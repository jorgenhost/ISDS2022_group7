No, the coronavirus disease was not used as a weapon in a robbery
","The most recent piece of misinformation being spread about the coronavirus disease 2019, also called COVID-19, is that it can be used as a unique robbery weapon. A Facebook post uploaded on Feb. 26, 2020, includes a screenshot of a news story with the headline: ""Corona virus: Florida man arrested for robbery using cough as a weapon."" The live news alert’s background photo is a man of Asian descent with the quote ""if you call the police I will cough"" in front of him. This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This a screenshot from a satirical news website and the news format of the image is from a breaking news generator that anyone can use.  The website that generated this image says it is a satirical news website and has a link for readers to submit their own satirical news stories.

The font and formatting of this screenshot are identical to the breaking news generator. There is also a breakyourownnews.com watermark in the top right corner of the image. The image of an Asian man to symbolize a robber using coronavirus feeds into stereotypes about who has the illness. According to the CDC’s COVID-19 FAQ page, ""fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans."" The CDC said that this ""hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.""  The CDC’s advice: ""Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads."" The CDC also includes a breakdown of all the ways COVID-19 can be spread on their website. This screenshot of ""breaking news"" is fake.

Rep. Mark Pocan is on point that wages haven't moved much in the last 30 years
","On the campaign trail, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has made a point of talking about stagnant wages.  So has U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, who co-sponsored a bill in 2019 to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2024.  The bill passed in the House in July 2019 and is stalled in the Senate, but Pocan is still talking about wage growth — most recently in his endorsement of Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination.  In a Jan. 16, 2020 video with Sanders posted on Twitter, Pocan described an advertisement he saw for the Amazon distribution center in his hometown of Kenosha, seeking workers for $12.75 an hour.  ""Your parents made that three decades ago, and that’s what people are making now,"" Pocan said to the camera. Is Pocan right on the numbers? And what about his underlying point: that real wages haven’t changed much in 30 years? We checked it out.  When asked for evidence to back up Pocan’s claim, communications director Usamah Andrabi provided historical pay data for the nation’s auto industry and the median income for Wisconsin men and women according to the 1990 census.  Andrabi said Pocan often uses auto worker pay to make his point, because auto manufacturing was the dominant industry in Kenosha when he was growing up there.  But Pocan did not mention auto pay in his claim, and pay in that industry historically is far higher than many other jobs. So, we focused on the weekly and hourly earnings data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Let’s walk through the math.  Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, said the best metric to use in examining the claim is median wages — and, of course, to examine them in ""real"" terms, to compare the spending power over time. The median wage for Americans in December 1990 was $417 per week, which breaks down to $10.43 an hour.  Fast-forward three decades, and the median wage for Americans in December 2019 was $933 per week, or $23.33 an hour.  That might look like a significant increase.   But using the Bureau’s inflation calculator, the 1990 weekly wage translates to $800.88 per week in today’s dollars, or $20.02 an hour. So, that’s a roughly $3 increase in 30 years. From a narrow perspective, Pocan is off — an offer of $12.75 does not equate to hourly wages from 30 years ago, as a straight comparison or with inflation factored in.  He fares much better when considering the larger point being made: That wage growth has been largely stagnant. An August 2018 study from the Pew Research Center showed that at least since 2000, most of the country’s wage growth is distributed among the top 10% of earners. For those closer to the median and below it, the growth line is nearly flat.  What’s more, the cost of living has undergone a much steeper hike: from 1983 to 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a roughly 3% annual increase in rent and food prices, and a 1.3% annual increase in new vehicle prices.  So, a small growth in median wages is dwarfed next to the rise in cost of other goods. In his endorsement video for Sanders, Pocan said that people in 1990 were making the same amount per hour as he saw advertised for the Amazon distribution center in Kenosha today. A quick comparison shows that wages today are slightly higher than what they were then, once inflation is factored in.  But the cost of everyday goods like rent, groceries and cars have outpaced that median wage growth, meaning a worker’s 1990 weekly paycheck, at a $10.43-an-hour rate, would have held more spending power than the $23.33-an-hour rate does today. We rate Pocan’s claim Mostly True.

Did Donald Trump fire pandemic officials, defund CDC?
","During a CNN town hall before the South Carolina primary, Mike Bloomberg — a former New York City mayor and Democratic presidential candidate — was asked whether he had confidence in President Donald Trump to handle a potential coronavirus pandemic, officially known as the COVID-19 virus. After jokingly saying, ""I feel so much better,"" Bloomberg told the audience, ""No. 1, he fired the pandemic team two years ago. No. 2, he's been defunding the Centers for Disease Control. So, we don't have the experts in place that we need. I hope he's right that the virus doesn't come here, that nobody gets sick. That would be a wonderful outcome. But the bottom line is, we are not ready for this kind of thing."" Bloomberg had a point that the Trump administration ousted some of its officials dealing with global pandemics, but ""defunding"" the CDC is more complicated than he let on. ""Fired"" may be a strong word, but there have been abrupt changes to key national security posts with responsibility for global pandemics. More recently the administration has assigned new officials to take leadership roles. In May 2018, the top White House official in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics left the administration. Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer was the senior director of global health and biodefense on the National Security Council and oversaw global health security issues, a specialty that had been bolstered under President Barack Obama. After Ziemer’s departure, the global health team was reorganized as part of an effort by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Meanwhile, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser who recommended strong defenses against disease and biological warfare, was reportedly pushed out by Bolton in 2018. Neither White House official or their teams, which were responsible for coordinating the U.S. response to pandemic outbreaks across agencies, have been replaced during the past two years. In November 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers and experts formally recommended that health security leadership on the NSC should be restored. And on Feb. 18, 2020, a group of 27 senators sent a letter to current National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to ask him to appoint a new global health security expert to the NSC. ""The fact that they explicitly dismantled the office in the White House that was tasked with preparing for exactly this kind of a risk is hugely concerning,"" Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran foreign disaster assistance in the Obama administration, told the Guardian. ""Both the structure and all the institutional memory is gone now."" Instead, Trump has looked within his administration to fill roles for the coronavirus response.  Last month, Trump appointed his Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, to chair a coronavirus task force. On Feb. 26, he announced that Vice President Mike Pence would be taking charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus.  And the following day, Pence announced he was appointing Ambassador Debbie Birx to assist the effort as ""White House coronavirus response coordinator."" Birx is a physician and global health expert who is currently responsible for coordinating the State Department's HIV/AIDS task force. The White House said she will be supported by NSC staff in her role. It’s not accurate to say that Trump has been ""defunding"" the CDC, but he has tried to make cuts in key programs. It’s just that Congress didn’t listen. The Trump administration’s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at CDC — a key player in the fight against coronavirus — have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year.  The administration proposed $61.7 million less in 2018 than 2017; $96.4 million less in 2019 than in 2018; $114.4 million less in 2020 than in 2019; and $85.3 million less in 2021 than 2020. However, Congress reshapes presidential recommendations as they see fit when they craft final spending bills. Every year since Trump has been president, lawmakers have passed bills — bills signed by Trump — that not only exceeded what Trump requested on emerging infections but also exceeded what had been spent the previous year. As the chart below shows, funding increased every year from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020. (We have not included the 2017 proposal, since that was submitted by the Obama administration. The figures for 2020 are preliminary.) It’s important to note that Trump has asked Congress for a $2.5 billion supplemental budget to help combat the emergence of this coronavirus. House Democrats quickly said the amount was insufficient to meet current threats, and Trump said he was willing to seek more if lawmakers were willing. In addition, the Trump campaign pointed to consistent funding for certain budget sub-categories, such as CDC’s public health emergency preparedness, which helps states and localities deal with public health emergencies, including outbreaks. That program suffered funding losses that predate Trump. Bloomberg said Trump is hampered in the fight against coronavirus because ""No. 1, he fired the pandemic team two years ago. No. 2, he's been defunding Centers for Disease Control."" On the first point, it’s hard to pin down whether the National Security Council staffers were ""fired"" in 2018, but they certainly left abruptly and have not been replaced, though other leaders in the coronavirus fight have been named in recent days. On the second point — funding — there’s no question that the Trump administration sought to cut key CDC budget categories that would be involved in emerging infections like coronavirus. But Bloomberg overlooks that, thanks to Congress, that funding was restored and even increased in bills that were ultimately signed by Trump. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FDA40>],/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/

Do Democrats support abortion up until (and after) birth?
","In the latest push from Republicans to advance a federal ban on abortion after 20 weeks and a requirement for doctors to treat infants born after an attempted abortion, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke in favor of the efforts from the Senate floor. In his remarks, Cruz urged his Democratic colleagues to support these kinds of ""common sense propositions,"" a departure from the party’s ""extreme"" position on abortion. Neither bill — versions of which GOP lawmakers have attempted to pass several times over multiple years — was approved. ""We’ve seen far too many Democrats embrace extreme positions on abortion: abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that,"" Cruz said, before highlighting a radio interview Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gave in 2019 about a bill in the Virginia House of Delegates regulating third-trimester abortions. ""This bill was allowing a mother in labor, in the process of delivering a child, this bill would allow a doctor to kill that child instead of delivering that child in the midst of labor,"" Cruz said. ""The idea of killing a child while the mother is in labor instead of delivering the infant is horrifying beyond words."" Cruz’s claim that Democrats support abortion up until birth and ""even, horrifically, after that,"" is inaccurate, as is his characterization of the Virginia proposal (which was unsuccessful). Trump claims This isn’t the first time a Republican leader has used an inaccurate description of the Virginia bill to advance legislation to require care for infants ""born alive"" after attempted abortions. When Senate Republicans attempted to pass a version of the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act in February 2019, President Donald Trump offered two inaccurate claims on this front. Speaking at a rally in El Paso, he said that Northam ""stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world ... then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby."" We rated this claim False. In a tweet sent days later, Trump said: ""The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth."" We rated that claim False. To be clear: killing an infant after birth is illegal, and people on both sides of the abortion debate agree that this act should be illegal. Under federal law, the definitions of a person, human being, child and individual all include infants ""born alive at any stage of development."" Virginia legislation This characterization of Democrats as supporters of allowing abortions during and after a live birth surfaced in early 2019, when a subcommittee of the Virginia House of Delegates considered a bill aimed at loosening the state’s abortion laws. In Virginia, a woman can choose to obtain an abortion through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, up to 28 weeks from her last menstrual period. After that point, abortions are legal if they happen in a hospital and three physicians certify that ""the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman."" The law also requires physicians to make ""measures for life support for the product of such abortion"" available if there is ""any clearly visible evidence of viability"" after an attempted abortion. The bill Virginia lawmakers considered in 2019 proposed multiple changes to state laws addressing abortion, including the provision regulating the procedure in the third trimester. The proposal would have lowered the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and remove the ""substantial and irremediable"" threshold in the law. At the time of the debate, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that there were two confirmed third-trimester abortions performed in Virginia since 2000. Republican lawmakers questioned the bill’s sponsor on the scope of the proposal, asking whether the measure would allow a woman who is dilating to get a abortion. ""My bill would allow that,"" said Democratic lawmaker Kathy Tran. ""Yes."" Her response sparked intense backlash from anti-abortion advocates and footage of her remark circulated quickly on social media. But days later, Tran said she misspoke: ""I should have said: ‘Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.’"" A spokeswoman for Cruz pointed to the language of Tran’s bill and said it clearly allows abortion up until the moment of birth, but Tran’s bill only changed the requirements in place before a doctor can perform a third-trimester abortion. It did not change the law as it relates to when such an abortion could take place. As the law stands, abortion is legal in the third trimester only in cases where three physicians certify that the mother’s life is in danger. Virginia law prohibits ""partial birth infanticide,"" the killing of an infant who has ""been born alive, but who has not been completely extracted or expelled from its mother."" Northam’s comments In a radio interview two days after the debate, Northam discussed the legislation and offered a confusing comment about third-trimester abortions: ""It’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s nonviable. So, in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother."" A number of anti-abortion advocates accused the Democratic governor of approving the killing of infants. Northam rejected this characterization of his remarks and a spokesperson said the comments were about options for care available to women with a nonviable pregnancy or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality. This can include issues like anencephaly, when an infant is born without parts of the brain and skull, and limb-body wall complex, when an infant's organs have developed outside of its body. In these cases, where there is ""little or no prospect"" of an infant surviving after birth, families might opt for perinatal palliative care, or comfort care — prioritizing comfort while allowing an infant to die naturally without exercising full resuscitation efforts. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes this care as existing on a spectrum of care, ""which includes pregnancy termination (abortion) and full neonatal resuscitation and treatment."" Cruz’s spokeswoman pointed to this care as an example of a doctor completing an abortion by denying medical care. This type of care is rare — a study of deaths at children’s hospitals found that while neonates represented 41% of all deaths, perinatal palliative care was only utilized in 2% of cases — and does not meet the definition of abortion. Harvard Medical School defines abortion as ""the removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception or the fetus and placenta (afterbirth) from the uterus."" Our Ruling Cruz said Democrats support ""abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that."" Cruz’s remark hinged on an inaccurate characterization of legislation considered in Virginia’s House of Delegates in 2019 and comments made by the state’s Democratic governor at the same time. State law in Virginia allows doctors to perform abortions up until the moment of birth, but only in cases when three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman. The author of the bill clarified earlier remarks to say it would not allow an abortion to be performed on a woman during a live birth. PolitiFact has rated multiple statements making similar claims about Democrats supporting the execution of children False.

Fact-checking Bernie Sanders’ record of voting on sanctions against Russia
","From honeymooning in the Soviet Union in 1988 to getting love from Russia for his presidential bids, Bernie Sanders has an uncommon connection with one of America’s chief adversaries. It’s subjected the Vermont senator to a number of attacks. On Feb. 22, 2020, the day Sanders won the Nevada caucuses and arguably established himself as the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, a post claimed:  ""Not once in his entire career in Washington, D.C., which started way back in 1991, has Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders ever voted yes on sanctions against Russia."" Sanders has run as an independent in Vermont, was a member of the U.S. House from 1991 to 2007, and has since been a member of the Senate. He calls himself a democratic socialist. There aren’t many votes to look at when it comes to Russia, and Sanders’ voting history isn’t as clear-cut as the post claims.  In recent years, the United States sanctioned Russia in response to allegations of corruption and human rights abuses. It continued sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Some of the sanctions were imposed by presidential executive order, without any vote in the Senate. Here are the key votes: Dec. 6, 2012: Sanders voted no on the Magnitsky Act, which imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the 2009 death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian whistleblower.  GQ reported on Feb. 23, 2020, that Sanders never explained his vote, but ""fellow Dems suggest that it was because a free trade provision had been tucked into the legislative package."" Sanders’ campaign emphasized to us that in 2015, the Senate with unanimous consent extended the law to countries other than Russia, and said it was ""more robust"" than the original law.  June 14 and 15, 2017: Sanders votes yes on an amendment to a bill, adding Russia to a bill that was sanctioning Iran. But the next day, Sanders voted no on the overall legislation, which put new sanctions on North Korea, as well as Russia and Iran. On Russia, the bill targeted the country’s aggression in Ukraine and Syria, citing corruption, human rights abuses and weapons sales.  Sanders said at the time he feared the bill would endanger the 2015 nuclear deal, which was aimed at curbing Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. ""I am strongly supportive of the sanctions on Russia included in this bill. It is unacceptable for Russia to interfere in our elections here in the United States, or anywhere around the world. There must be consequences for such actions,"" he said in a statement at the time. Jan. 16, 2019: The Senate failed to stop the Trump administration from easing sanctions on companies linked to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Sanders missed the vote, but his absence did not affect the outcome. He was meeting with women who accused his 2016 presidential campaign of sexual misconduct. A post claims: ""Not once in his entire career in Washington, D.C., which started way back in 1991, has Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders ever voted yes on sanctions against Russia."" Sanders voted once, in 2017, to add Russia to a sanctions bill. But on the final version of that bill, which carried sanctions against Russia, North Korea and Iran, he voted no. Moreover, he voted no on a Russia sanctions bill in 2012. The statement is partially accurate.

No, the CDC isn’t recommending men shave their beards to protect against the coronavirus
","Amid increased fears about a potential coronavirus outbreak in the United States, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention graphic from 2017 has resurfaced online along with the claim that the organization is recommending men shave their beards to protect against the virus. This is not true. The organization has made no such recommendation.  The wrong information developed out of a CNN wire story that was re-packaged by San Francisco-based news station Kron4.com. We saw it shared on plenty of other news websites. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Though the original Feb. 26 CNN story differs slightly, it also states that the CDC has suggestions about facial hair in relation with coronavirus protection, and fails to mention that the graphic is old and has no connection to the illness. The infographic, which covers over 30 different types of facial hair styles, is from 2017 and is unrelated to the current coronavirus outbreak – or any other illness. It instead warns that some beard styles can interfere with face masks. The graphic was originally posted in a CDC blog post that year during ""No Shave November"" that pointed out some of the problems certain types of beards could present with tight-fitting respirator masks. It’s one of several respiratory protection posters for the workplace compiled by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a CDC department.  The graphic is specific to respirators, which the CDC does not recommend using outside of the workplace for protection against the coronavirus:  ""CDC does not recommend the routine use of respirators outside of workplace settings (in the community). Most often, spread of respiratory viruses from person-to-person happens among close contacts (within 6 feet). CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as avoiding people who are sick, avoiding touching your eyes or nose, and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue."" For the record, a respirator is different than a surgical mask, as evidenced by this CDC graphic. Surgical masks aren’t considered adequate protection for respiratory illness, and only protect the face from large droplets and should be worn to shield others from your own coughs and sneezes. A headline claims that the CDC recommends men shave their beards to protect against coronavirus. The story, and others like it, say that facial hair can interfere with masks – and that isn’t untrue – but these posts in connection with the coronavirus are ultimately misleading.  The story inaccurately says the CDC is telling people to shave their faces to help ward off the coronavirus and omits that the graphic was made years ago and unrelated to the current outbreak. It also misses health officials’ actual recommendation against using respirators for protection outside of the workplace.  We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979DD640>],/factchecks/2020/feb/27/facebook-posts/no-cdc-isnt-recommending-men-shave-their-beard-pro/

Pro-Trump PAC takes Obama book quote out of context to attack Biden
","A pro-Trump PAC recycled a quote from President Barack Obama — taken out of context — to attack Joe Biden. In an ad that aired during the Feb. 25 Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, S.C., the Committee to Defend the President urged African Americans to turn their backs on Biden. Here’s the ad’s text: ""Joe Biden promised to help our community. It was a lie. Here is President Obama: ‘Plantation politics. Black people in the worst jobs, the worst housing, police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we’d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.’ Enough. Joe Biden won’t represent us, defend us or help us. Don’t believe Biden’s empty promises."" We’ve seen this quote from Obama before. The same PAC used exactly the same material in November to attack Democrats in general for failing the black community. We rated it Pants on Fire. Here’s why. The voice in the ad sounds like Obama dramatizing someone else’s words, and the words were not his own views. They came from Obama reading from his 1995 book ""Dreams From My Father"" about his days as a community organizer in Chicago. He recounted his conversation with a barber he called Smitty about Chicago’s first black mayor, Harold Washington. Smitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington. Here’s how the scene plays in the book: ""Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city,"" Smitty said. ""Before Harold, seemed like we’d always be second-class citizens."" ""Plantation politics,"" the man with the newspaper said. ""That’s just what it was, too,"" Smitty said. ""A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. White folks spitting in our faces, and we’d reward ‘em with the vote."" In his book, Obama then described the power of African Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified. Obama wrote:  ""They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old. And their faith had been rewarded."" In Smitty’s words, ""The night Harold won, let me tell you, people just ran the streets … ,"" he said, recounting how the community was proud of Washington and themselves. ""When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life."" The pro-Trump ad uses the passage to create the impression that Obama believed that black voters, ignored and suffering, sold their soul to the Democrats at election time. But the actual book passage is quoting another speaker, and talks about the good things that come from voting. Worse, the ad suggests Obama was talking about recent times and the failings of Joe Biden.  We contacted the PAC behind the ad and they defended their use of the excerpt. A pro-Trump ad says that Obama said black people have the ""worst jobs, the worst housing"" and face rampant police brutality, ""but when so-called black committeemen came around election time we’d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey."" While Obama did say those words, they were not his own. In his book ""Dreams from my Father,"" Obama was describing a conversation with a Chicago barber who remembered African Americans helping elect Chicago’s first black mayor.  The ad creates an impression that Obama was describing the failure of Democrats, including Biden, to actually help blacks, while in reality, the passage was about a key African American election victory.

Obama never ordered CIA to train members of ISIS
","A blog post from five years ago that claims President Barack Obama ordered the CIA to train members of ISIS continues to circulate on the internet, despite the fact that it severely mischaracterizes the intent and outcome of a CIA operation. In 2013, the CIA operated a program that both trained and armed Syrian rebels in an attempt to support stronger opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The program had some unintended consequences — at times, weapons intended for Syrian rebels were stolen and sold on the black market, for example — but it was never designed to ""train ISIS Jihadists,"" as the post claims. ""Obama ordered CIA to train ISIS Jihadists,"" reads the over-the-top headline. The blog post bases its claims primarily on a once-classified Defense Intelligence Agency document obtained by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group. On top of falsely alleging that Obama ordered the CIA to intentionally train members of ISIS, the post claims the released document confirms the United States and its partners ""actually facilitated the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as an effective adversary against the government of the Syrian dictator President Bashar al-Assad."" The post also says that the DIA document ""declared that President Barack Obama and his counterparts within the coalition considered the establishment of a Salafist organization in eastern Syria in order to further downfall of the Assad regime."" The reality is not that simple. Despite what the post’s headline says, Obama never ordered the CIA to train members of ISIS. In fact, the New York Times reported that Obama only ""reluctantly agreed"" to the training program to train and arm some Syrian rebels opposing Assad’s government forces. The program, code named Timber Sycamore, was a joint effort primarily between the CIA and other Arab intelligence agencies.  The program and its details are still largely classified. Most of what we know comes from media reports. The New York Times, for example, reported that the program trained thousands of fighters and was going well until Russian military aid forced the rebels to retreat. But there were other problems. In October 2015, the BBC reported that American officials admitted only four or five of the program’s trainees ""had actually returned to the battle."" Further, an Al Jazeera and New York Times investigation revealed that millions of dollars in weapons the CIA meant to provide Syrian rebels had actually been systematically stolen and sold on the black market. From there, the weapons could fall into the wrong hands. Once, stolen CIA-supplied weapons were used in a shooting in Amman, Jordan, that killed five people, including two Americans. The document obtained by Judicial Watch said Salafi-jihadists — fundamentalists who believe in the return to traditional Islam practices — the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida in Iraq were ""the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria."" While the document does not say anything about Obama, it seemed to explore some of the CIA training program’s potential effects on Iraq.  ""If the situation unravels there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in Eastern Syria,"" reads the document. ""And this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian Regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran)."" Essentially, the document seems to say that the groups it identified as the ""major forces"" in the region supporting Syrian rebels hoped to establish a Salafist state in Eastern Syria. The document did not say the United States considered supporting this outcome, however. The headline said, ""Obama ordered CIA to train ISIS Jihadists."" Obama authorized a program in 2013 that trained and armed Syrian opposition forces. The program had its flaws, including that CIA-provided weapons were systematically stolen and sold on the black market, ending up in enemy hands. However, the declassified DIA document contained nothing that suggested the United States or its allies intentionally ""facilitated"" the rise of ISIS in their efforts to oppose Assad. Further, there was no evidence the program ever trained known members of ISIS. That was never ordered by Obama.

No, Bernie Sanders did not collaborate with Marxist regimes
","In the South Carolina presidential debate, Bernie Sanders continued to parry attacks for having said that Cuba did something good when it launched a massive literacy campaign under Fidel Castro. (We rated that claim Mostly True, noting that the teaching materials came with hefty ideological baggage.) This sort of criticism isn’t new for Sanders. Thanks to his past comments on Marxist governments, he has been taking shots for a long time. A Feb. 8 Facebook post recycled an August 2018 image that poses the question, ""Bernie Sanders: Communist traitor?"" It continues: ""The Vermont Senator collaborated with Marxist regimes in the Soviet Union, Nicaragua and Cuba in the 1980s when America was on the verge of winning the Cold War."" Some quick timeposts: When he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders visited Nicaragua in 1985, the Soviet Union in 1988 (three years before its collapse) and Cuba in 1989. The question is, did he collaborate with those governments? By the plain meaning of the word, he did not. Collaborate means for two or more people to work together, while a more loaded political meaning is associated with treason. Neither applies to Sanders. What’s true is Sanders said nice things about each of the countries. In particular he gave Nicaragua and Cuba, both small nations targeted by the United States, the benefit of the doubt. Some see that as actively undermining the United States’ foreign policy. However, Sanders also criticized each place. The words he used to describe their shortcomings might not satisfy everyone, but they do indicate that he tempered his praise. Nicaragua Here are some key excerpts from Sanders’ press conference in Vermont, after his 1985 trip to Nicaragua: ""My goal was not to determine how good or bad the Nicaraguan government is. I’m not an expert. My major concern is that there is a real possibility that the United States is about to enter into a Vietnam type war in Central America. I think that such a war would not only be a disaster for the Nicaraguan people, but a disaster for the people of the United States as well. Others may disagree with me, but I do not believe it is in the interests of the people of our country to have young men and women fighting and dying in the jungles of Central America.""  ""Many people believe the Sandinista government has made significant progress in such vital areas as health care education, agriculture and land reform and the distribution of food. They have also gone a long way in extending democrtic rights to a country which has no democratic history."" ""As poor as Nicaragua is, one of the nice things that I saw, is that as a result of government policy, in terms of the distribution of food, people are not hungry, by and large."" ""I am not here to defend every action of the Nicaraguan government. Do I think I got to all sides of the story and talked to everybody? The answer is, ‘No.’""  When reporters pressed Sanders on the government’s violent repression of indigenous people, Sanders said the situation was ""complicated."" He said that some government officials said they didn’t like what happened, but that he wasn’t expert enough to comment. In a letter to a constituent, he wrote, ""Nicaragua, a tiny impoverished nation of 3 million, is today fighting a brutal war — with their enemy being totally financed by the most powerful nation on earth.""  The cities of Burlington and Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua became sister cities. Under that program, the city sent 500 tons of supplies and humanitarian aid in 1986. Critics cast this as supporting the government of Nicaragua. Yaroslavl, USSR After Sanders and a group from Burlington returned from a trip to the Soviet Union, the travelers shared their impressions on June 13, 1988. Here are excerpts of Sanders’ comments from that: ""They (Soviet officials) are absolutely open in acknowledging that they are not a democratic society and that those people we spoke to want to become a democratic society, and right now they are in the midst of an extraordinarily important and turbulent point in their history. At least some of them want to try to determine how they go from where they are today to become a more open and democratic society."" ""While they are proud that their health care system is free, and we went to one of their medical schools and they’re proud of that, they estimate that they are 10 or 15 years behind the United States in terms of new medical technology. They are making, at least in the Yaroslavl area, significant advances in building housing. They have a major housing crisis which they acknowledge, but they acknowledge that not only do they not have enough housing, but the construction and the quality of the housing is also not adequate."" ""We were saying, yeah, in our country we also have a housing crisis. Our housing in general is better than yours but people are paying 40% of their income for housing. The quality of your housing is not good, but we appreciate the fact that people are paying 5%. The quality of your health care we understand is not good, but in the United States, believe me, we have enormous problems in terms of our health care system."" Cuba In March 1989, Sanders held a news conference after his trip to Cuba. According to the Burlington Free Press, Sanders praised Cuba for delivering essential services to its people, and criticized it for suppressing political opponents. ""I did not see a hungry child,"" Sanders said. ""I did not see any homeless people. Cuba today not only has free health care, but very high-quality health care."" In terms of personal freedoms, Sanders had a different take. ""Cuba is not a perfect society,"" he said. ""There are political prisoners in Cuba."" Sanders said the people he met had ""almost a religious affection for"" Fidel Castro. ""The revolution there is far deeper and more profound than I had understood it to be,"" Sanders said. ""It really is a revolution in terms of values."" In a Feb. 21, 2020, interview with Telemundo, an interviewer pressed Sanders on the places with socialism he supports, such as Denmark, and the places he does not. ""In those countries that you're talking about, Venezuela, Cuba, and now Nicaragua unfortunately, you're talking about authoritarian societies,"" Sanders said. ""You're talking about the old Soviet Union. You're talking about an authoritarian, communist society. I don't support those. I have, my entire life, been fighting authoritarianism, whether it is communism, whether it's fascism, whatever it may be. I believe in democracy. We're here today to encourage people to vote."" The Oxford dictionary says collaboration involves at least two people working on something together. But in a political context, it’s a more loaded term. A collaborator is ""a person who cooperates traitorously with an enemy."" Cold War historian Marc Trachtenberg at UCLA said the term doesn’t apply to Sanders. ""Collaborator means he worked together with them, which he never actually did, to my knowledge,"" Trachtenberg said. ""It has a very negative connotation, since it calls up memories of people in occupied Europe, especially France, who collaborated with the Nazis in World War II in rounding up Jews, etc. ‘Sympathizer’ would be a better term, but even using that would be going a bit too far, since Sanders sympathized with those regimes only in part."" In practice, the word applies when there’s active repression of others in direct service to a powerful group. In 2007, the archbishop of Warsaw resigned after he admitted that he had worked with Poland’s Communist-era secret police. In 2016, new documents indicated that Polish leader Lech Walesa also was a paid informer.  ""Mr Walesa strenuously denied long-standing allegations of collaboration in a BBC interview in 2008,"" the BBC reported. A Facebook post said Sanders collaborated with the Soviet Union, Nicaragua and Cuba. The term ""collaboration"" does not match what Sanders did. He did praise those countries for doing a lot to address the day-to-day needs of their people, such as housing, food and health care. At the same time, he criticized them for the lack of democracy and political freedom. He was particularly sympathetic to Nicaragua due to the military offensive against it orchestrated and backed by the United States.

Facebook post overreaches by claiming it’s OK to kill newborns in Virginia
","Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam worked as a doctor before he was elected to helm the Commonwealth, and it’s not hard to find photos of him online wearing a stethoscope around his neck.  One such picture shared on social media features text on top criticizing the state.  ""Thanks Virginia,"" it says. ""OK to kill babies once born."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  One account that posted the image also links to a Jan. 30, 2019, National Review article with this headline: ""Virginia governor defends letting infants die."" It is not legal to kill babies once born in Virginia. That is a felony.  But here’s what you need to know about the late-term abortion debate in the state.  That story cites a radio interview Northam did with the station WTOP, after a Jan. 29, 2019, committee hearing on proposed legislation that would loosen restrictions on late-term abortions. The bill was introduced by Kathy Tran, a Democatic delegate to the state House, and during the hearing she fielded questions from Todd Gilbert, a Republican delegate.  ""How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?"" Gilbert asked.  ""Through the third trimester,"" Tran said. ""The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks."" ""Where it’s obvious that the woman is about to give birth, would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified? She’s dilating,"" he said.  ""My bill would allow that,"" Tran said.  The next day, Northam appeared on the radio show. Reporter Julie Carey asked him this question:  ""There was a very contentious committee hearing yesterday, when Fairfax County delegate Kathy Tran made her case for lifting restrictions on third-trimester abortions as well as other restrictions now in place, and she was pressed by a Republican delegate about whether her bill would permit an abortion even as a woman is essentially dilating, ready to give birth, and she answered that it would permit an abortion at that stage of labor. Do you support her measure? And explain her answer."" Northam said he couldn’t speak for Tran but that the situation illustrates why such decisions should be made by physicians and parents.   ""When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician — more than one physician, by the way — and it’s done in cases where there are severe deformities, there may be a fetus that is nonviable,"" he said.  ""So in this particular example, if a mother’s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" he said. ""So I think this was really blown out of proportion but again, we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions. We want the decisions to be made by the mothers and the providers, and this is why legislators … most of whom are men, shouldn’t be telling a woman what she should and shouldn’t be doing with her body."" Virginia law already allowed abortions after the second trimester but required three doctors to certify that the mother would die or her mental and physical health would be ""substantially and irremediably"" impaired without the procedure.  Tran’s bill, which died in committee, would have eliminated the requirement that two other physicians certify that a late-term abortion is necessary to prevent the mother’s death or harm or mental or physical health. It also eliminated the words ""substantially and irremediably"" from the law, among other changes.  In the interview, Northam said he supported keeping the state’s requirement that multiple physicians certify the abortion is necessary because ""these decisions shouldn’t be taken lightly.""    The Democratic governor’s comments drew criticism from conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.  ""I never thought I would see the day America had government officials who openly support legal infanticide,"" he tweeted on Jan. 30.  U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called Northam’s comments ""morally repugnant."" ""In just a few years pro-abortion zealots went from ‘safe, legal, and rare’ to ‘keep newborns comfortable while the doctor debates infanticide,’"" Sasse said. ""I don’t care what party you’re from — if you can’t say that it’s wrong to leave babies to die after birth, get the hell out of public office."" Tran later said she misspoke when she was asked whether her bill would let an abortion happen when the mother was in labor and about to give birth. ""I should have said, ‘Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.’"" In Virginia, killing a newborn is a felony punishable by death.  A Northam spokesperson told Vox that his comments were ""absolutely not"" a reference to infanticide. Rather, they ""focused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor."" He called the idea that he approved of killing infants ""disgusting,"" according to the Washington Post. Our ruling The Facebook post says it’s ""OK to kill babies once born"" in Virginia.  Late-term abortions are allowed under the state’s laws through the third trimester if doctors certify the procedure is necessary for the mother’s health — the proposed law discussed by Northam would not have changed the time period during which an abortion is allowed.  As we’ve previously reported, Northam’s comments were confusing and he didn’t clarify what he meant by saying ""resuscitated."" But he was speaking in the context of pregnancies in which the fetus has severe deformities or is nonviable. The Facebook post overreaches by claiming it’s OK to kill newborns. In Virginia, that’s a felony.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3CD3C0>],/factchecks/2020/feb/27/viral-image/facebook-post-overreaches-claiming-its-ok-kill-new/

Fact-checking Rush Limbaugh’s misleading claim that the new coronavirus is “the common cold”
","Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh accused the media of overhyping the 2019 coronavirus that’s infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide, calling it ""the common cold"" and claiming, without evidence, that it’s ""being weaponized"" as an attack on President Donald Trump. ""It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,"" Limbaugh said Feb. 24 on his radio show. ""Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus … I’m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks."" ""The drive-by media hype up this thing as a pandemic,"" Limbaugh continued. ""Ninety-eight percent of people who get the coronavirus survive. It’s a respiratory system virus.""  The recent Presidential Medal of Freedom winner went on to push the debunked conspiracy theory that the new coronavirus strain was created in a lab as a bioweapon. But we were also struck by his claim that the 2019 coronavirus is nothing more than ""the common cold.""  We didn’t have to look far to see where Limbaugh went wrong. In a FAQ about the 2019 coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed his confusion head-on. ""A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified,"" the CDC wrote. ""The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not that same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold."" The current strain of coronavirus was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. It’s one of seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the CDC. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surface, coronaviruses are typically found in animals such as camels, cattle and bats. Strains infecting humans were discovered in the mid 1960s. RELATED: PolitiFact’s coronavirus coverage in one place Most strains that affect humans are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003. According to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a ""beta coronavirus"" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012.  All three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath — similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains ""usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold."" But the same fact-sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. ""This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,"" it said. Limbaugh seems to have been ""mixing up clinical symptoms as defining the disease,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California. ""Many diseases start off with ‘flu-like symptoms’ and progress on to something else,"" Watanabe said, noting that the 2019 coronavirus is part of a different family of viruses than the flu. RELATED: A reader’s guide to misinformation about the coronavirus Neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said on air that Limbaugh’s comparison was ""minimizing"" what the 2019 coronavirus could become. ""This is a brand new virus,"" he said. ""I think what Rush Limbaugh is referring to is the idea that it is from a family of coronaviruses. That is the family name of these viruses, and some of them in the past have caused systems that were more consistent with the common cold. But it’s also been the same family of viruses that caused SARS, that caused MERS."" Experts from the National Institutes of Health and Penn State University’s College of Medicine drew a line from the spread of the 2019 virus to outbreaks of SARS and MERS in a report titled ""Coronavirus Infections — More Than Just the Common Cold."" According to the WHO, about 80% of 2019 coronavirus patients have recovered from mild symptoms without needing special treatment, while roughly 1 in every 6 people have become ""seriously ill."" About 2% of people have died. (For comparison, the flu — which is more severe than the common cold — has an estimated death rate in the United States of about 0.1%). People who are older or have certain pre-existing health conditions have been more likely to experience serious symptoms, the WHO’s website says. ""There are alpha coronaviruses that cause common cold,"" said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. ""This is a beta coronavirus like SARS and MERS and is approximately 20 to 30 times more deadly than (the) flu."" We follow the facts and share what we learn so you can make your own decisions. Support our mission today. Membership.politifact.com As of Feb. 24, the new coronavirus has spread to 29 countries beyond China, according to the WHO's official count. In China, the virus has infected at least 77,262 people and resulted in at least 2,595 deaths. Outside of China, there have been at least 2,069 infections and 23 deaths. That’s a fatality rate closer to 3%. The WHO declared the virus an international public health emergency in late January, and the group’s director-general has since called it a ""potential pandemic.""  Daily media briefing on #COVID19 with @DrTedros https://t.co/ChotCy0r1k Limbaugh said the 2019 coronavirus is ""the common cold."" Generally speaking, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that produce illnesses ranging from the common cold to more critical diseases such as SARS or MERS.  But the 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain that was unknown before December. It is different and can be much more dangerous than the common cold.

Homeopathic supplements are not proven to treat the flu
","You wouldn’t expect drops that taste like ""sweet tarts"" or elderberry syrup to cure anything, but one Facebook post claims that these homeopathic supplements can rid you of flu symptoms after only three days. This post, which has been shared more than 70,000 times, was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post from Nov. 15, 2019, claimed that Sambucol, an elderberry extract, and Oscillococcinum, a diluted duck heart and liver pill, offer flu relief. ""A nurse friend taught me this,"" the post says. ""If you have the Flu… get these two items… Sambucol [and] Oscillococcinum… in 48 hours you will feel better. In 72 hours you will be almost symptom-free."" The medical community is still debating how effective these supplements are, with a few small studies showing positive results. While doctors agree that Sambucol has the most flu-fighting potential, there is little evidence that Oscillococcinum can considerably shorten the length of the flu. Both Sambucol and Oscillococcinum’s websites note that their claims to treat influenza symptoms ""have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.""  The Mayo Clinic recommends using an antiviral drug like Tamiflu if you ""have severe infection or are at higher risk for complications."" Effectiveness of Sambucol Sambucol is an elderberry extract that originates in folk medicine, where elderberries were used to treat various illnesses, including sinus congestion, sore throat, common cold and rheumatism. Elderberries contain tannins and viburnic acid, which have been shown to help with nasal congestion and to improve respiration. They also have one of the three highest anti-inflammatory capacities ever seen in fruit or berries, according to a study from the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry. A study in 2001 found that Sambucol has antiviral properties and was connected to an increase in the inflammatory cytokines found in patients’ blood, effectively activating the immune systems of influenza patients. A small 2004 study of the healing properties of Sambucol in Norway found that otherwise-healthy flu patients treated with the elderberry extract had symptom relief on average four days earlier than the placebo group. Patients treated with Sambucol had no symptoms after 48 to 72 hours. The study found that Sambucol ""seems to offer an efficient, safe and cost-effective treatment for influenza."" The study included only 80 influenza patients, and the administrators called for a larger study of elderberry extracts to verify their findings. Effectiveness of Oscillococcinum Oscillococcinum is made from highly diluted heart and liver of wild duck, but essentially no molecules of duck heart or liver are found in the actual pill, according to Pharmacy Times. Cochrane, an independent health care research center, did a review of Oscillococcinum trials in 2015. Cochrane found that Oscillococcinum did not prevent the flu in preventative trials, and that the trials that ""proved"" the supplement helped with flu symptoms were biased because they were performed by employees at Boiron, the company that produces Oscillococcinum. A study in Italy in 2018 did use Oscillococcinum to treat patients with respiratory tract infections and found that patients taking the supplement had fewer RTI episodes than patients without treatment. Their study spanned an eight-year period with 455 patients and found that it had the potential to save health center funds, with ""significantly lower costs in the patient population being treated.""  Our ruling A post claims, ""If you have the Flu… get these two items… Sambucol [and] Oscillococcinum… in 48 hours you will feel better. In 72 hours you will be almost symptom-free."" Overall, Sambucol has the most flu-fighting potential, but there is little evidence that Oscillococcinum can considerably shorten the length of the flu. And there isn’t enough evidence to prove that either of them can treat influenza better than antiviral medications.  The post’s claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical context.

Joe Biden leaves out key facts in claim that Bernie Sanders opposed Obamacare
","Former Vice President Joe Biden said Sen. Bernie Sanders talks in a way that one would think Sanders and Barack Obama ""were close buddies."" But they were not, Biden said, claiming that Sanders was against Obama’s signature health care law. Sanders ""opposed Obamacare, didn't like the fact we didn't push a single-payer option,"" Biden said in an MSNBC interview aired Feb. 23. Is Biden right? If viewers were left with the impression that Sanders voted against Obamacare, they were misled. Sanders voted for the law. But Sanders also wanted a single-payer option in the law and didn’t like that it wasn’t included. ""I think it is fair to say that Sen. Sanders was ambivalent about the ACA and uncertain if he was going to vote for it during much of the 2009-10 debate,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an expert on the law. But Sanders voted for the bill, Oberlander said, ""so it’s not fair to simply say he opposed it."" Obama on March 23, 2010, signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. The Senate passed the health care bill, 60-39, on Dec. 24, 2009, with Sanders voting in favor. No Senate Republican supported it. About a week before, Sanders told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto that he was not yet a ""yes"" vote on the bill. ""I am going to do my best to make this bill a better bill, a bill that I can vote for, but I have indicated both to the White House and the Democratic leadership that my vote is not secure at this point,"" Sanders said Dec. 16, 2009. Sanders said that without a public option, he worried about controlling costs. ""What a strong Medicare-type public option would do is at least provide competition to these private insurance companies and prevent, I believe, these large increases in rates,"" Sanders said. ""I am doing my best right now to make this bill a bill that works for the American people."" In the Obamacare debate, supporters of the public option said it would be available to people who had to buy their own insurance, without the help of an employer. It would be run by the government and offer basic coverage. Opponents argued that it would have presented too much government involvement in the health care system. RELATED: Medicare for All: What it is, what it isn't; 6 things to know about health care and the 2020 campaign The Biden campaign said that before the bill passed, Sanders submitted an amendment for a single-payer health care system. That’s true, but Sanders also backed down and withdrew the amendment after Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., used a procedural move to force a full reading of Sanders’ proposal — a move that would have taken hours of floor time and risk passage of a more moderate bill backed by Obama and his allies. (Sanders also didn’t have the votes to pass his amendment.) Sanders ultimately voted for the law. ""The bill is not as strong as I wanted and I will work to improve it, but it begins to move this country toward the long-time goal of providing comprehensive, affordable health care for all Americans. … We can do better, but this is an important step forward,"" Sanders said after the Senate passed the bill. PolitiFact has reported that Sanders successfully pushed for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for community health centers, especially in rural areas. Sanders said that expansion was an important factor in helping him vote for the bill. While he continues to advocate for a single-payer option, Sanders has defended Obamacare against efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans to roll it back. Biden said Sanders ""opposed Obamacare, didn't like the fact we didn't push a single-payer option."" Sanders voted for the passage of Obamacare, even though he did not like that it did not include a public option. Before voting for the bill, Sanders said his vote was not certain since the proposal did not include the public option.

What Hillary Clinton really said about TPP and the 'gold standard'
","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended her opposition of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the first Democratic debate of the 2016 race. Clinton announced last week that she no longer supports the international trade deal, despite supporting it while serving as secretary of state -- once calling it the ""gold standard."" CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper picked up on those words and asked Clinton about her reversal at the Oct. 13 debate in Las Vegas. ""I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard,"" Clinton said. ""It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ‘this will help raise your wages.’ And I concluded I could not."" Clinton’s phrasing -- that she said she ""hoped it would be the gold standard"" -- implies that she was undecided on the TPP. But that doesn’t exactly match up to her prior comments. We found that her previous remarks actually gave the impression that she had confidence in the deal as it stood. In Australia in 2012, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Here’s everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the ""gold standard"" comment in bold. ""So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment."" So it seems Clinton is saying the TPP does, definitevely set the gold standard -- as opposed to Clinton hoping it will. In other addresses around the same time, she expressed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet a high standard. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations ""willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP"" to join the deal. ""The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy. Canada and Mexico have already joined the original TPP partners. We continue to consult with Japan. And we are offering to assist with capacity building, so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join. We welcome the interest of any nation willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP, including China."" Here are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: ""exciting,"" ""innovative,"" ""ambitious,"" ""groundbreaking,"" ""cutting-edge,"" ""high-quality"" and ""high-standard."" (To read more of her comments in full, check out our previous article on this subject.) As a presidential candidate Clinton has used more hedging language, for example saying she has ""some concerns,"" and now she has said she outright doesn’t support the deal as it stands. In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, she wrote: ""Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It’s safe to say the TPP won’t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers."" In fairness to Clinton, the TPP was still under negotiation when Clinton made the ""gold standard"" comment. The partners only finalized the deal this year. It’s quite possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was at the State Department -- something Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out to us for this fact-check. The negotiations have been conducted in secret, so it’s hard for us to assess that ourselves. Also, as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal. Our ruling Clinton said when she was secretary of state, she was reserving judgment but ""hoped (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) would be the gold standard."" She’s twisting her 2012 remarks a bit. Clinton said, ""This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements,"" which is a more confident claim than if she had said she ""hoped"" it would meet that standard. This is in contrast to more recent comments where Clinton said she had concerns about the deal and that she ultimately opposes it. The statement is distorting her previous comments.

In debate, Bernie Sanders says African-American youth unemployment is 51%, and 36% for Hispanics
","During his opening statement at the first Democratic presidential debate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders turned to some statistics he’s used before on the stump, decrying high rates of joblessness among young African-Americans. ""African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent,"" Sanders said at the Oct. 13, 2015, debate in Las Vegas. ""Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent."" That’s similar -- but not identical -- to a claim we checked in July. Back then, he said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, ""the real unemployment rate … is 51 percent."" We rated that Mostly True. However, since the claim was phrased somewhat differently, we’ll take a fresh look at it here. At the debate, Sanders didn’t define the age range in question, but the most readily available ""youth"" data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers ages 16 to 19. For individuals age 16 to 19 in September 2015, the official unemployment rate for whites was 13.9 percent, for Hispanics it was 18.6 percent, and for African-Americans it was 31.5 percent. For individuals in that age range of all races and ethnicities, the unemployment rate was 16.3 percent. While the rates for both minority groups are lower than the rate for whites, they are still well below the figures Sanders offered at the debate. So what’s going on? When we checked this claim in July, we noted that Sanders, by using the term ""the real unemployment rate,"" had telegraphed that he was not using the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic. Indeed, when we asked Sanders’ camp for supporting evidence, they pointed us to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This data was different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didn’t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were ""marginally attached to the labor force."" The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren’t entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of ""labor underutilization"" rather than ""unemployment."" EPI itself used the term ""underemployment"" in its research. It’s a real statistic, but in July Sanders didn’t really describe it the correct way. He twice used the term ""unemployment rate"" and once used the variation ""real unemployment rate,"" a vague term that doesn’t have any official definition at BLS and wasn’t mentioned in the EPI research he was quoting. His phrasing during the debate was even more problematic. He simply said, ""unemployment rate,"" without indicating that he was using a non-standard measurement. Also, the EPI data only went through March 2015. But since March, the overall unemployment rate for all African-Americans has fallen by almost 1 percentage point, though the rate for the subset of 16-to-19-year-olds has zigzagged since then. (This youth subset is based on a small sample and has a higher margin of error.) All this said, Sanders does have a point that young African-Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of unemployment than young whites do. ""What's odd about Sanders' choice is that he could have used the official unemployment statistics and still made his point that African American and Hispanic youth have higher rates of unemployment than other groups,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed. Our ruling During the debate, Sanders said that ""African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent."" He has a point that African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do. But his numbers are too far off. Using the standard method for determining the jobless rate, the figure for African-American youths is 31.5 percent and for Hispanic youths it’s 18.6 percent. While those rates are still disproportionately high, they are not nearly as high as Sanders said. The statement is partially accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A4A640>],/factchecks/2015/oct/14/bernie-sanders/debate-bernie-sanders-says-african-american-youth-/
"['National', 'Guns', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton: Bernie Sanders voted against Brady bill five times
","Hillary Clinton used the gun debate to try and attack Sen. Bernie Sanders from the left at the first Democratic debate. Sanders’ record on the issue has been the subject of much liberal ire. After CNN moderator Anderson Cooper grilled Sanders on his vote shielding firearms companies from lawsuits, Clinton brought up another time Sanders didn’t side with gun control advocates. ""The majority of our country supports background, and even the majority of gun owners do,"" Clinton said on Oct. 13. ""Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady Bill."" Clinton is correct that most Americans (90 percent) support background checks. But did Sanders vote against the landmark Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which mandated a five-day waiting period for background checks for gun purchases? Five nays from the Vermont congressman The Clinton campaign pointed to our July fact-check of an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC. We rated a slightly more expansive claim — ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, background checks and waiting periods"" — Mostly True. (That statement that referred specifically to background checks, which Sanders had supported.) Before it became law in 1993, the Brady bill underwent many transformations. Sanders, then Vermont’s sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the bill in its entirety five times: 1. In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.   2. The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In November 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992. 3. After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five-day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version twice in the same day, but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time). 4. He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why. 5. The final compromise version of the Brady bill --  an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it. In July, when we first looked into the issue, Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. ""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont."" A mixed record overall Overall, Sanders is neither a gun nut nor an anti-gunner. He’s received lukewarm marks from the NRA, ranging from a C- to F in the last 15 years. ""Throughout his time in public office, Sen. Sanders has consistently voted to outlaw the most dangerous weapons and keep guns out of the hands of criminals,"" Sanders spokesperson Michael Briggs told us. Briggs noted that Sanders has voted in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown massacre. On the flip side, Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains and in National Parks, though his most recent pro-gun vote was in 2009. ""(Sanders’) gun control position is a reflection of living in Vermont for 40 years,"" Garrison Nelson, a professor of professor of political science at the University of Vermont, told us in July. ""Vermonters use guns to shoot deer and moose, not one another."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill."" Sanders voted against the Brady bill five times from 1991 to 1993. Sanders’ campaign manager told us in July that he did so because he was against a national waiting period and had to answer to the people of Vermont, a rural state with high gun ownership. Overall, Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to guns. But he did indeed register five nays on the Brady bill.

Westmoreland: Iran doesn't have to prove nuclear plan changes
","Georgia Congressman Lynn Westmoreland stood with the majority in the U.S. House last month in refusing to approve the nuclear pact that President Barack Obama signed with Iran in Vienna on July 14. In a Sept. 11 press release, Westmoreland, a Republican, said the United States didn’t need to negotiate with ""dangerous"" and untrustworthy Iran and said the deal ""only weakens the national security of our country"" and its allies, particularly Israel. ""Like many times before, President Obama is manipulating the system to get his way: presenting this to the American people as a ‘deal’ instead of what it really is – a treaty to circumvent needing approval by Congress,"" Westmoreland said. ""President Obama and Secretary (John) Kerry also showed a lack of leadership and strength in agreeing to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct."" Politifact has fact-checked several claims about the pact, which is an executive agreement, not a treaty subject to congressional approval. For example, we rated False a statement from Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz that said the deal ""trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves."" This time, a reader from Westmoreland’s congressional district asked Politifact Georgia to truth-test the statement that Obama and Kerry had agreed ""to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct."" ""My understanding is that Iran must meet certain requirements through verification before these sanctions are lifted,"" the reader wrote. ""Can you please investigate this claim?"" The historic agreement was reached in July between Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States and was backed by 41 Senate Democrats. It calls for Iran to significantly limit its nuclear capabilities for more than a decade in exchange for being relieved of economically crippling international sanctions. (Executive agreements, such as this, do not require congressional approval. But many in Congress were upset at this and insisted that the House and Senate have weigh-in. Earlier this year, a law was passed mandating a vote on a resolution of disapproval. Had it passed by two-thirds, it could have blocked the [resident’s legal authority to waive sanctions on Iran in exchange for actions to curb Iran’s nuclear capabilities.But the resolution did not receive the necessary 60-vote majority that is necessary in the Senate to be formally considered; in the House, there were not enough votes in favor of disapproval to overcome a presidential veto. Therefore, the resolution of disapproval failed in both Houses and the deal is going forward.) Opponents say the deal lacks long-term assurances that Iran -- hostile to Israel and the U.S. and one of three countries still identified by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism -- won’t develop nukes. They say the U.S. should demand that Iran renounce any future nuclear arms ambitions and any involvement in terrorism in exchange for having the sanctions lifted. Supporters say the accord, while far from perfect, has safeguards to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons in the short term. They say the U.S. had to make concessions because many of its allies had grown weary of continuing economic sanctions against oil-rich Iran. Initially, we weren’t entirely certain what Westmoreland meant by ""conduct."" Was it the country’s nuclear policy? Foreign policies? Human rights record? We zeroed in on the nuclear threat after Leigh Claffey, the communications director for Westmoreland, responded when we told her a reader had asked us to fact-check the accuracy of the statement. Claffey said Westmoreland’s statement was based, in part, on the fact that the U.S. does not have any inspectors on the ground to receive firsthand knowledge or confirmation that the Iranians have changed their ways. The U.S. also is not part of the inspection process, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations entity entrusted with monitoring nuclear nonproliferation commitments,  is not permitted access to all Iranian sites, she said. Claffey also forwarded us links to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s ""21 reasons the Iran deal is a bad deal"" and to an opinion piece in The New York Times calling it ""the worst agreement in U.S. Diplomatic history."" Additionally, she cited a statement from the conservative Foundation for Defense of Democracy that read, in part, that ""the fatal flaw"" of the pact is its sunset clauses, which permit ""critical nuclear, arms, and ballistic missile restrictions to disappear over a five- to 15-year period."" Long list of requirements Greg Terryn, a research and policy associate with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington, said Westmoreland ""is mistaken."" ""The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the pact) specifically delays the lifting of any sanctions until the IAEA has verified that Iran is living up to its commitments under the agreement,"" Terryn said. In the language of the deal, this is described as Adoption Day -- the day Iran must begin working toward its commitments under the agreement, Terryn said. Implementation Day is  the day the U.S., United Nations and European Union must waive the implementation of certain sanctions, he said. ""Implementation Day only comes about when the IAEA verifies that Iran has fulfilled its initial obligations under the agreement,"" Terryn said. The agreement lists 82 specific items about its nuclear program that Iran has to change to satisfy the international community. These include reducing the country’s stockpile of enriched uranium down to 300 kg and removing the core of the reactor at Arak and filling it with concrete. Ultimately, the deal rolls back Iran’s nuclear program for more than a decade, pushing back the time it would take Iran to enrich enough nuclear material for one nuclear weapon from a few months to at least one year, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. We contacted several other nuclear-policy experts, only one of whom thought Westmoreland’s statement had merit. ""The problem is there are tiers of sanctions -- the United Nations sanctions, the United States sanctions -- and the sanctions are being lifted upfront without Iran having to change its conduct, without Iran having to abide by the agreement itself,"" said Michaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Technically, the way the agreement is written, they do not have to change their conduct."" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nonprofit Arms Control Association in Washington D.C., said the pact ""definitely requires Iran to effect radical changes in the conduct and capacity of Iran’s nuclear program before there is any sanctions relief."" ""There will be no sanctions relief — whatsoever — before ‘Implementation Day,’ and to get to that point Iran must take very substantial steps and put in place tough restrictions that will block its ability to produce nuclear bomb material, allow much more intrusive inspections, and answer questions from the IAEA about past experiments with ‘possible military dimensions,’ "" Kimball said. Shawn l. Ramirez, an assistant professor of political science at Emory University, said ""numerous ‘proofs’ of compliance with the terms of the agreement are required of Iran over time to actually lift the sanctions."" ""In fact,"" Ramirez said, ""restoring the sanctions cannot be undone unless all five members of the UN Security Council  agree to continue to suspend sanctions — the U.S. has locked in its veto power to punish Iran if Iran doesn’t comply."" Our ruling U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland said that President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry agreed to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct. The Iran deal may be less than perfect. And there’s certainly reason to be dubious of Iran, one of only three nations that remain on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. But most experts say the agreement does require Iran to make significant changes before some, if not all, sanctions are removed and pushes back the timeframe on Iran’s ability to make a bomb. We rate Westmoreland’s statement  False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AFA340>],/factchecks/2015/oct/13/lynn-westmoreland/Westmoreland-ran-doesnt-have-to-prove-nuclear-plan/

Conservative Steve Deace says the pollsters don't trust their own polls
","In the Republican presidential nomination contest, polls have been the outsiders’ best friend. Billionaire Donald Trump and physician Ben Carson gained early momentum and critical debate exposure thanks almost entirely to their high rankings in public opinion surveys. What those poll numbers say about Trump and Carson’s chances in the Iowa caucuses and beyond is far murkier. Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace said the polls are meaningless. ""The record of polling in Iowa is a joke,"" Deace said on MSNBC’s News Nation on Oct. 8, 2015. ""You’ve got the pollsters now coming out in numerous articles in recent days saying ‘don’t actually believe our own data.’ You have Gallup yesterday made the announcement, they’re pulling out of polling in this primary. They may not even poll the general election because they don’t trust their methodology."" A lot of people wonder about the accuracy of the polls, and it would be a big deal if the pollsters themselves were just as skeptical. We decided to drill down on Deace’s points that pollsters are warning people not to trust their data, and that Gallup stopped its primary polling because it doesn’t trust its methodology. A cluster of articles Deace told us he relied on several stories that came out recently. Bloomberg wrote about systematic flaws in the data. High on the list: -- the rise of cell phone-only households and a growing percentage of people who refuse to answer pollsters’ questions. The best public opinion operations employ banks of callers who are fed randomly picked phone numbers. Cell phones make it tougher to determine where the interviewee actually lives, which matters a lot for state-level polls. Plus, federal rules about calling cell phones mean you must hand-dial each one, rather than use a faster automated dialer. That’s a significant cost factor. And then there’s the response rate. When more people hang up, that raises questions about whether the people who participate are unrepresentative of the public at large. ""As response rates have declined, the need to rely on risky mathematical maneuvers has increased,"" the Bloomberg article said. There was also a report from Politico that carried a warning from pollsters. They said they shouldn’t be the ones ""to winnow the GOP field."" ""Don’t trust polls to detect often-tiny grades of opinion in a giant field,"" the Politico writer summarized. The point was, news organizations sponsoring debates are counting on polls to decide who to bring on the stage and who to cut. With over a dozen Republican candidates, many of them clustered in the single-digits, the differences between any two are nearly certain to be smaller than the polls’ well-published margin of error. If just 1 percentage point separates Candidate A from Candidate B, and the margin of error is 3.5 percent, you have a problem. But it’s not a problem that stems from the polling itself. As the Politico article noted, it’s a problem with how debate organizers are using the polls. What’s up with Gallup? So those two articles are the grounds for the first part of Deace’s statement. Then there was his comment about Gallup. The bombshell in the polling world, as these things go, was Gallup’s decision to pull back from tracking the presidential primaries. This came out in another Politico article headlined, ""Gallup gives up the horse race."" ""After a bruising 2012 cycle, in which its polls were farther off than most of its competitors, Gallup told Politico it isn't planning any polls for the presidential primary horse race this cycle,"" Politico wrote. ""And, even following an internal probe into what went wrong last time around, Gallup won't commit to tracking the general election next year."" Gallup is one of the granddaddies of polling and had done a lot of polls in past elections. It was no small thing for the primaries to lose such a prominent player. Frank Newport, Gallup’s editor-in-chief, told Politico that the polling firm thought it could have more impact by asking people what they think about issues, rather than who they want to see in the White House. While the article drew a connection between Gallup’s move and its polling methods, Newport himself didn’t say that. And afterward, he sent around a statement rebutting the story’s broader implication. ""Unlike some critics, we at Gallup remain very strong in our belief in the accuracy of polling today, even with the new challenges that are in front of the industry,"" Newport said. ""Our post-mortem work in 2012/2013 and our experimentation in the 2014 midterms leave us with little doubt that polling, including our own, can be accurate in 2016."" Taking Newport’s words at face value, worries about Gallup’s methodology did not drive its decision. Deace told us he had not seen Newport’s statement. Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and director of the Marquette University Law School Poll, told us he thinks this was more a business decision, but the picture is complicated. Gallup does a lot of contract work for businesses, and in that context, political polling comes with a risk. ""You can be judged by how you do on the presidential vote in November,"" Franklin said. ""If you have troubles with that, it creates problems for the company."" Franklin said he thinks Gallup does as good a job as anybody, but he can see why the firm might decide it makes more sense to pull back from election tracking. Polling in changing times There’s no question that it has become trickier and more expensive to be accurate. It’s also clear that the better financed pollsters adapt. Statistics researchers Ole Forsberg and Mark Payton at Oklahoma State University focused on the cell phone issue. Forsberg told us the pollsters have come up with a variety of approaches. He said while we won’t know which ones work best until this election is over, he’s optimistic. ""The current polling methods are most likely more accurate than in 2012,"" Forsberg said. ""They may be more accurate than in 2008. They are most likely worse than in 2004."" Polling in 2004 was more reliable because landlines were more common back then, and landlines are inherently easier to work with than cell phones. As for the hurdle of rising refusal rates, Franklin said the survey firms, including his, spend more time getting full interviews. ""We have to call many more numbers to get a big enough sample size, but there’s plenty of evidence that we’re reaching enough,"" he said. Historical trends collected by the National Council on Public Polls, a trade association of pollsters, track the gap between polling and actual voting results in presidential years. In 2012, the average error was 1.46 percentage points. That was slightly higher than in the previous three elections in 2008, 2004 and 2000, but less than the error in 1996 when it was 2.1 percentage points. Jon Krosnick at Stanford University has assessed polls for many years. Krosnick distinguishes between polling organizations that dot their I’s and cross their T’s, and those that don’t. ""Our evaluations of survey accuracy indicate that surveys done using best practices, which is expensive, continue to be remarkably accurate,"" Krosnick said. ""If you look at the average of the final pre-election polls done by the neutral news organizations that used high quality methods just before the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, they predicted the national popular vote within one percentage point."" Krosnick said the danger lies in the proliferation of firms that do polling on the cheap. Those results, he said, could give the impression that polling in general is less accurate. All that said, Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers University political scientist and former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, warns that no one should underestimate the challenges polling faces today. Zukin said there’s a huge issue of figuring out who will actually vote and all the problems only get worse at the state level where much of the attention is focused during the primaries. ""We are less sure how to conduct good survey research now than we were four years ago, and much less than eight years ago,"" Zukin wrote in an op-ed. A particularly subtle form of error seems to have crept into the picture. Nate Silver, a statistician who grew famous for his accurate election predictions and is now editor-in-chief of 538.com, has written about the ""herding"" phenomenon. That’s when polling firms fear to publish results that don’t track with other polls. ""Pollsters have admitted to suppressing polls they deem to be outliers but that would have turned out to be just right,"" Silver wrote in 538. ""In the U.S. last year, at least two polling firms declined to publish surveys showing a tight Senate race in Virginia, which in the end was decided by only 18,000 votes in what was almost a historic upset."" Early polls in a class by themselves From what we found, most research into polling accuracy looks at surveys done in the final weeks of a campaign. Right now, we are nearly four months before the first ballot is cast in Iowa. Deace said he thinks the polls are a joke because he doesn’t think they reflect who will carry the caucuses. Franklin at Marquette University told us for pollsters, that’s the wrong question. ""This is very much like midway through the second quarter of a football game,"" he said. ""It is not telling you with great certainty who will win the game. But it is telling you who's playing well and who isn't. And we still have the second half to play."" Franklin said, if you don’t think the score at halftime tells the whole story, you shouldn’t expect any more from polls at this stage of the primary process. Our ruling Deace said pollsters are warning people not to trust their results and that Gallup doesn’t trust its methodology. The articles he cited actually were more specific than he suggested. Pollsters did say that surveys can’t be used with surgical precision to separate the wheat from the chaff in the crowded Republican field. But that’s in response to broadcasters who have counted on polls to decide who should appear in debates. As for Gallup, a news article implied that concerns over methodology drove its decision to stop tracking the primaries, but the editor-in-chief at Gallup didn’t say that and in fact, he expressed confidence in the firm’s techniques. It’s costing more and more to do polling well, and state-level polls, which are the ones Deace had in mind, face the biggest challenges. But overall, Deace exaggerated what pollsters have said. We rate this claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A58E00>],/factchecks/2015/oct/12/steve-deace/conservative-steve-deace-says-pollsters-dont-trust/

Glen Sturtevant says Dan Gecker voted to double car registration fee
","Time and again, Republican Glen Sturtevant is telling Chesterfield County voters whom to blame for doubling their car registration fees. Democrat Dan Gecker ""voted to double vehicle registration fees, costing county residents $6 million annually in additional fees,"" Sturtevant says in at least three campaign mailers in the state Senate’s 10th District. Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member, and Gecker, a Chesterfield supervisor, are squaring off in a key race that could determine which political party controls the state Senate, which now has a 21-19 GOP majority. They are seeking to replace longtime Republican incumbent John Watkins, who is not seeking re-election. A Sturtevant TV ad features a bike racer pedaling hard while the narrator says Gecker is in ""a race to raise your taxes."" Among the ensuing charges is that Gecker ""voted"" to ""double vehicle registration fees, costing us $6 million in one year."" We investigated whether Gecker really did vote to double the fee. Matt Brown, campaign manager for Sturtevant, told us the claim is based on Gecker’s actions last year, when the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors was considering the county’s 2014-15 capital improvement plan and its budget. Among the proposals was to increase the county’s $20 car registration fee to $40, to raise $7.5 million for local transportation needs that the state would match. The proposal was controversial and, at Gecker’s request during a supervisors meeting April 23, 2014, it was pulled from the capital improvement plan and voted on separately. The $20 increase passed, 3-2, with Gecker voting against it. A tape of the meeting shows Gecker offered no explanation at the time of his vote. But about 10 minutes later, he said it should be a higher priority for the county to dedicate long-term revenues for clean-water programs mandated by the federal government than to raise fees for transportation. Gecker did not push for the clean water funding, however, saying he realized his view was in the minority. Given Gecker’s clear vote against the fee increase, what evidence does Sturtevant offer that his opponent actually voted for it? Brown, in an email, replied that Gecker later that same April day voted for the entire capital improvement plan — which funds long-term construction projects — and then for the county’s operating budget. The two are connected, because revenues from the car registration fee flow into the county’s operating budget and then are allocated to the capital improvement plan. Brown said this counts as two Gecker votes for the raised fee. We should point out that the 134-page capital improvement plan was filled with line items for projects totaling $848 million over five years. The 208-page operating budget funded $766 million of services, including education, public safety and health programs. Gecker told us that while he didn’t agree with every line item, he supported the overall benefits of the spending plans. Brown cited a third vote, as well, that occurred Feb. 26, 2014 — almost two months before the budget was approved. Gecker concurred in the Chesterfield board’s unanimous vote to advertise all fee and tax rate increases being considered in the budget — including the car registration increase — and to set a public hearing on them March 26. It should be noted that this is a required step in budget deliberations and that the mere advertisement of possible tax rate increases doesn’t obligate local board or council members ultimately to support them. Our ruling Sturtevant says Gecker ""voted to double vehicle registration fees, costing county residents $6 million annually in additional fees."" The simple truth is just the opposite. When the $20 increase came up for a vote before the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors in April 2014, Gecker opposed it. Despite his opposition, it passed on a 3-2 vote. Sturtevant, in trying to justify his claim, dismisses this obvious vote. His campaign instead argues that Gecker subsequently voted to pass massive spending plans that fund all of the county’s public services and public improvement projects. The new registration fees were a tiny part of these plans. The Sturtevant camp also notes that Gecker, in 2014, voted to advertise that the board was considering the $20 increase. But that’s not tantamount to voting in support of the increase. Local governing boards are required to give notice for a public hearing whenever a fee or tax increase is on the table. Keep your eye on the ball. Again, the only time the fee increase came up for a direct vote, Gecker opposed it.

Clinton: 7 Benghazi probes so far
","House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested last week that Congress’ current investigation into the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, is a political move against former Hillary Clinton, and she was quick to jump on the Republican’s gaffe.    In an interview Monday morning, Clinton was visibly frustrated with the ongoing Benghazi investigation. ""There have been seven investigations led mostly by Republicans in the Congress,"" Clinton said. ""And they were nonpartisan, and they reached conclusions that, first of all, I and nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make. This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans."" Is Clinton correct that there have been seven and now eight investigations into Benghazi? We started counting and found she was largely accurate. Here’s what we found. Background Clinton was secretary of state when Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in the barrage. In the weeks following the attack, the White House was heavily questioned for its response to the terrorist attack. Many debated, among conflicting reports from intelligence officials, what role al-Qaeda played in the attack and how much the White House knew about the group’s involvement. Critics also questioned whether Clinton and the State Department could have better addressed security at the U.S. facilities before they were attacked. The debate got more partisan as time went on, as Republicans began speaking of conspiracy theories and cover-ups. The seven probes mentioned by Clinton include only those conducted by Congress, but there was at least one more. After the attack, Clinton convened an Accountability Review Board to investigate the incident -- something she was legally required to do. The Board’s report found no fault in the State Department for the terrorist attacks but acknowledged ""systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" that left Benghazi vulnerable. Four State Department officials were temporarily suspended and ultimately reassigned within the department. It should be noted that each congressional committee that investigated the Benghazi attack looked into different aspects of the event. After the attack, Republican Speaker John Boehner directed the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence to investigate the issues within their jurisdictions. The House investigations were led by Republicans. Two bipartisan Senate Committees also investigated the attack. Clinton said the committees found that she and her department had not committed wrongdoing but suggested changes. Actually, almost every committee report found her department did not adequately address security concerns in Libya or could have done more to prevent the attack. Clinton’s words give the best possible spin to the various committee findings, but she’s also essentially accurate. Here’s a list of all the congressional investigations and what they found. Investigation 1: The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform The House Oversight Committee was one of the first committees to question Clinton following the Benghazi attack. On Sept. 16, 2013, the Republican-led committee released an interim report on the Accountability Review Board appointed by Clinton. The report raised questions about the independence and integrity of the Accountability Review Board (since Clinton appointed the board to investigate her own department) and criticized the conclusions in the board’s final report. Investigation 2: The Senate Committee On Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs This bipartisan committee released a report in December 2012 detailing the ""high risk"" of a terrorist attack at the U.S. facilities in Libya. While the report criticized the State Department for not addressing the security concerns leading up to the attack, it also found ""administration officials were inconsistent in stating publicly that the deaths in Benghazi were the result of a terrorist attack."" The report attributed the State Department’s security failures to intelligence problems and a failure ""to imagine the type of attack that occurred."" Investigation 3: The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence The Senate Intelligence Committee released a bipartisan report in January 2014 calling the Benghazi attacks ""preventable."" Among other findings, the committee concluded the State Department had received ample warning about deteriorating security in Libya and failed to adequately increase security in the weeks leading up to the attack. The report also faulted intelligence officials for not relaying information on the CIA annex to the U.S. military. Investigation 4: The House Committee on Foreign Affairs  Clinton testified before this House committee on Jan. 23, 2013 (she also testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier that day). The House Committee on Foreign Affairs later released a report criticizing Clinton and other high-ranking officials who they said were ""provided extensive warning of the deteriorating security environment in eastern Libya."" The report also criticized the State Department’s Accountability Review Board, which ""was seriously deficient in several respects,"" especially in its failure to comment on the actions of the department’s highest ranking officials, including Clinton. Investigation 5: The House Committee on the Judiciary The focus of the Committee on the Judiciary’s probe was the FBI investigation that followed the terrorist attack. The committee released its findings in April 2013 as part of an interim progress report in conjunction with the five other Republican-led committees investigating Benghazi. The report detailed how the FBI did not investigate the scene until three weeks after the attack and spent less than one day collecting evidence in Benghazi. The committee also faulted Clinton for reducing security at the Benghazi consulate, despite her testimony that she ""had no knowledge"" of security requests from the compound. Investigation 6: The House Committee on Armed Services The Armed Services Committee began its investigation ""immediately after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya… to evaluate the response of the Department of Defense"" to the attack, according to a February 2014 committee report. The Republican-led committee bashed the Obama administration’s failure to address security threats in Benghazi, asserting that the military was unprepared for possible violence in Libya. Investigation 7: The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence The House Intelligence Committee concluded its two-year Benghazi investigation in November 2014 when it released a report exonerating the Obama administration of wrongdoing in its response to the attack. The report found evidence of contradicting intelligence among government officials and concluded officials did not intentionally mislead the public with information in the days following the attack. Ongoing Investigation 8: The House Select Committee on Benghazi The Republican-led House created the House Select Committee on Benghazi in May 2014 after a conservative watchdog group discovered new State Department emails about the attacks. The committee includes seven Republicans and five Democrats. The group released an interim progress report in May 2015, but the committee’s Democrats have been outspoken on the committee’s lack of progress. Clinton, who has faced more scrutiny over Benghazi after it was discovered she used a private email server while serving as Secretary of State, is set to testify before the Benghazi panel on Oct. 22. Our ruling  Clinton said, ""There have been seven investigations (of Benghazi) led mostly by Republicans in the Congress"" that concluded ""nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make."" Clinton’s number is correct: there were seven previous congressional probes into the Benghazi attack. Saying these committees were led ""mostly by Republicans"" is also a fair assertion: the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs were the only two committees not led by Republicans. As for her comment that there was no overt wrongdoing, just room for improvement, that’s a rosy assessment. But it is also largely accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F0900>],/factchecks/2015/oct/12/hillary-clinton/clinton-there-have-been-7-benghazi-probes-so-far/

Salaw says Virginia unemployment rate is at all-time low
","Richard Saslaw, the state Senate minority leader, says although Virginia faces headwinds from federal budget cuts, the state’s economy is sailing forward. ""Our unemployment (rate) is the lowest in the Southeast U.S. and the lowest in Virginia history — the lowest in Virginia history,"" Saslaw, D-Fairfax, said during Monday’s debate against his Republican counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment of James City. Since Saslaw doubled down on his proclamation that the state’s jobless level has reached the lowest point ever, we checked to see if he was correct. We turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which keeps the closely watched tallies of each state’s unemployment rate. For August, the rate was 4.5 percent, according to the latest figures available when Saslaw made his claim. These monthly figures date to 1976, but you don’t have to go back too far to find a time when the rate was lower than 4.5 percent. It was lower than that level each month during the 149 months from May 1996 through September 2008. During that period, there were times it even was below the 3 percent threshold and actually reached a low point of 2.1 percent in October and November of 2000. In September 2008, as the recession took hold, Virginia’s jobless rate started to grow at a brisk clip and eventually hit 7.4 percent by January 2010. The rate has trended down since then. The 4.5 percent figure for August is the lowest the rate has been since it started to spike in 2008, Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a Sept. 18 news release. Sam Sterling, Saslaw’s campaign manager, said the senator was trying to reiterate the governor’s point that unemployment is the lowest since 2008, but he didn’t say that during the debate. ""He had meant to say that (Virginia) has its lowest unemployment rate since 2008,"" Sterling wrote in an email. We also should note that Virginia has seen other periods of sub-4.5 percent unemployment, including 39 months from May 1987 through July 1990 and from December 1994 through April 1995. Our ruling Saslaw said during the debate that Virginia’s unemployment rate is the lowest in the state’s history. Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show he’s wrong, and the senator’s campaign says he garbled his talking point. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A63E00>],/factchecks/2015/oct/12/richard-saslaw/salaw-says-virginia-unemployment-rate-all-time-low/

Bee Moorhead says Texas poverty rate has outstripped U.S. poverty rate since at least 1959
","Texas remains home to a greater share of people in poverty than the nation as a whole, Bee Moorhead wrote in a September 2015, oped article in the Austin American-Statesman. Not news? Well, Moorhead, executive director of the Texas Interfaith Center for Public Policy/Texas Impact, also wrote that according to U.S. Census Bureau figures, ""Texas once again outstripped the national poverty rate"" in 2014, ""as we have done since at least 1959."" That’s 56 years--a long time to be better at poverty. We wondered. To our inquiry, Moorhead emailed us a spreadsheet, drawing on bureau figures, indicating that in select years, or each decade from 1959 through 2009, more Texans lived below the federal poverty level, by percentage, than Americans as a whole. According to the figures, which we confirmed on the bureau website, the share of Texans in poverty was greatest in 1959 — 31.7 percent, 9 percentage points greater than the 22.1 percent of Americans nationally in poverty. In the selected years, the smallest gap occurred in 1979 when 14.7 percent of Texans lived in poverty compared with 13.1 percent of Americans overall, according to the figures. Moorhead said she separately drew the 2014 Texas poverty rate (16.4 percent) from a chart fetchable from a bureau web page last updated Sept. 16, 2015. Nationally in 2014, the bureau announced, the poverty rate was 14.8 percent, meaning 46.7 million people lived in poverty. Moorhead also pointed out a bureau website enabling comparisons of poverty in a state to the nation each decade from 1960 through 2010, leading us to develop this Texas-U.S. comparison: SOURCE: Web page, ""Poverty Rates by County, 1960-2010,"" U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Oct. 7, 2015) Measuring poverty Through the bureau, the federal government has estimated residents living in poverty for more than 50 years, initially from a U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of how much income that families under economic stress needed in order to put food on the table. How the government defines poverty has changed a bit over the years, but generally, the bureau says, it ""uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty."" The thresholds don’t vary by location, the bureau says, but are updated for inflation. The poverty definition rolls in income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps), the bureau says. Each year’s national poverty estimates derive from the bureau’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, which surveys about 100,000 households a year, asking about income from more than 50 sources, according to the bureau. An expert’s look Moorhead did not delve into poverty rates for every year from 1959 on, so we asked Daniel Dillon of the University of Texas Child and Family Research Partnership for a look. Drawing from CPS data, he put together a chart suggesting the Texas poverty rate exceeded the national rate each year from 1959 through 2014. But Dillon and bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that comparative year-by-year figures start only in 1980. Since 1980, Dillon summed up, the Texas poverty rate ""has generally bounced between 15 percent and 17 percent with a few exceptions. The fact that is it so consistent means that the rate of growth in the general population is basically on par with the rate of growth in the poor population. Sometimes they don’t change at the same rate though, like after the recession, where the number of poor shot up but population growth was stable. This caused the poverty rate to increase. So the poverty rate is reflecting the interplay between total population change and poor population change, the latter of which is generally more affected by fluctuations in the economy."" Big picture: The 4.4 million Texans in poverty in 2014 was double the 2.2 million residents in poverty in 1980, Dillon noted. In the period, the state’s total population increased 87 percent, escalating from 14.3 million to 26.7 million, he noted. Dillon pointed out there were times the gap between poverty in Texas and the nation narrowed, including 2014. Broadly, he wrote, the gap grew through the 1980s until about 1988, at which point it peaked at a difference of 5 percentage points. Then the gap began to narrow, he wrote, expanding and contracting every few years until 2010 when it began to close. ""In 2014, Texas had a poverty rate 1.6 percentage points above the national rate,"" Dillon said. ""That’s the closest we have been to the national rate since 1984, when the gap was 1.3 percentage points."" Several factors, Dillon said, explain why Texas has consistently had a bigger chunk of residents in poverty than the nation on average. The state is home to a larger foreign-born population than most states and is one of a few minority-majority states in that non-Hispanic whites make up a minority of the residents, he wrote. ""In comparison to their numbers, minority groups in Texas tend to be overrepresented among the poor. Education level is also strongly linked to poverty status, and Texas is the near the bottom when it comes to the percentage of the adult population with a high school degree,"" Dillon said. ""Finally, Texas has a higher percentage of children than most states and child poverty has been on the rise. Today, a quarter of Texas children live below the poverty line."" Dillon said the narrowing gap between the Texas and national poverty rates might be explained by the state generally growing faster than most states due both to new births and migration from other places. ""As long as the mix of people moving to Texas are more likely to be above the poverty line than below it, this will drive the poverty rate down. Similarly, if births to non-poor families outpace those to poor families, this will also drive the rate down,"" Dillon wrote. Another indicator We also asked Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University economist, to evaluate Moorhead’s claim. By phone, Taylor said that while it’s likely the Texas poverty rate has consistently outpaced the national rate, on average, it’s worth mention that the rate has always been calculated by assuming the same income levels put residents in poverty regardless of location. She said this has tended to lead to overstatements of people in poverty in lower cost-of-living parts of the country and understatements of residents in poverty in high-cost areas. Taylor and a colleague pointed out in a December 2014 article that in 2013, per the government's poverty threshold, a family of four with two children and a household income of $23,624 was classified as poor regardless of whether the family lived in rural Arkansas, where a typical two-bedroom apartment rents for less than $600, or in New York, where a two-bedroom apartment rents for more than $1,400. In the past few years, the census bureau has been developing its Supplemental Poverty Measure, which reaches its rates by taking into account regional differences in housing costs. And, Taylor noted, the bureau found in its 2013 surveys that Texas and the U.S. had the same 15.9 percent SPM rate. In contrast, the general 2013 poverty rate for the country was 14.8 percent and the Texas rate was 16.9 percent. By phone, Moorhead agreed that ""using a standard measure"" of poverty ""across the country is insufficient to characterize the complexity of regional economies."" But the SPM is a new measure too, she said, and rates haven’t been calculated retroactively to cover nearly all the years included in her Texas-U.S. comparison. Our ruling Moorhead said Texas has ""outstripped the national poverty rate"" since ""at least 1959."" Available poverty rates for select years through 1979 and for 1980 through 2014 back up this statement. Yet poverty rates don’t appear to be available for many earlier years. Also, a new supplemental poverty measure makes a case for the same share of Texans and Americans lately living in poverty provided regional differences in housing costs are factored in. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Wasserman Schultz: Under 'conservative Republican president we were losing 750,000 jobs a month'
","It’s been nearly eight years since George W. Bush was president, but Democrats still plan to run against him. Certainly, that’s what Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz promised on the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate. ""There are so many people who are focused on making sure we can look at the fact that, when we had a conservative Republican president, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month,"" Wasserman Schultz said on CNN’s State of the Union Oct. 11, 2015. ""We’ve come through that -- 67 straight months of job growth in the private sector. People are no longer losing their homes. That’s the contrast we’ll talk about."" The DNC press office told us that Wasserman Schultz was thinking of President George W. Bush, and that the time period she had in mind were the last few months of his presidency, November through January. President Barack Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, so it’s reasonable to count that month as part of the Bush legacy. We pulled up the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers and Wasserman Schultz is on solid ground. Month Jobs (000’s) Loss Nov 135,469 -765 Dec 134,773 -696 Jan 133,977 -796 Average -752 Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics Benchmark comparison The number is particularly high because Wasserman Schultz chose the three worst months of the Bush presidency. If she had chosen a longer period, say the last full year, the losses would have averaged about 365,000 per month. The losses would shrink even more if you look at longer period of time. Wasserman Schultz didn’t mention that the economy continued to shed jobs at or above the 700,000 mark for the first two months of Obama’s presidency before the trend began to ease. This chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  gives a more complete jobs picture.  The Great Recession saw employment declines of historic proportions. Government analysts compared the relative losses from 2007 to 2009 to past downturns. The bottom purple line on their chart tracks jobs in the Great Recession which officially began December 2007.  Of course, Wasserman Schultz’s statement implies that conservative Republican policies alone brought about a massive loss of jobs and the reality is more complicated. Some analysts believe that a portion of the blame goes back to policies that enjoyed Democratic support, including changes in financial regulation passed during the Clinton administration. But Wasserman Schultz did not make that claim specifically. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that under a conservative Republican president the country was losing 750,000 jobs a month. Wasserman Schultz was speaking of President George W. Bush and at the end of his term, the monthly job losses averaged about 750,000 jobs. The average would of course be less if she had included Bush’s final 12 months -- or a period longer than that. There is an element of cherry-picking here, but the overall point holds up.

Understanding the Freedom Caucus divide with House Republicans
","Encapsulating the divide and chaos in the GOP, the conservative who defeated former Majority Leader Eric Cantor and a moderate Republican duked it out on NBC’s Meet the Press. Following Cantor’s defeat and John Boehner’s announcement that he would step down as speaker, the insurgent wing of the party claimed their third victory when California Rep. Kevin McCarthy withdrew from the race to replace Boehner. Republicans, however, have yet to agree on a new leader as the infighting continues. Rep. David Brat of Virginia, Cantor’s replacement and a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, blasted the establishment for caving to Democrats and President Barack Obama, while Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Penn., expressed frustration that the hard right refuses to govern. (""A pox on both your wings!"" chimed in conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.) Here’s a part of their Oct. 11 exchange: Brat: ""I follow the American people. Charlie here wants us to follow, like a caucus or whatever. He wants to kick us out of our conference for voting our conscience."" Dent: ""I don’t want to do that."" Brat: ""You’re on the record last week saying it."" CROSSTALK Brat: ""I’ve got quotes. ..."" Dent: ""That’s an outrageous thing to say."" Brat: ""No, it’s absolutely true."" Dent: ""That’s not true."" Brat: ""You said we ‘need to be punished,’ end quotes."" Dent: ""No, I said we should marginalize people who don’t want to govern."" We were curious about Brat’s claim that Dent wants to give the Freedom Caucus the boot.  ""Members of Congress should be able to vote their conscience and cast a vote that represents their constituencies without fear of retribution or political punishment,"" Jack Minor, Brat’s spokesperson, told us. To prove Brat’s point, Minor sent us a few examples of Dent criticizing the insurgent conservatives, as well as articles in which anonymous sources say leadership allies and members of the Tuesday Group — an informal caucus of moderate Republicans led by Dent — are considering excommunication. But that’s not the same thing as Dent saying ""on the record"" that he wants to kick the Freedom Caucus out of the conference for ""voting their conscience"" or that they ""need to be punished."" Dent told us he never made such a statement, but suggested Brat may have been confusing him with California Rep. Devin Nunes, a Republican and Boehner and McCarthy ally.   ""I would strongly encourage those who don’t want to be part of a caucus structure in our own party — they should go form their own party,"" Nunes told Breitbart. Dent, for his part, said he’s never endorsed that position. ""I don’t think that’s a good idea. My view on this is you have to work around them,"" Dent told us in an interview. ""I have said the leadership should try to marginalize those individuals, not by excommunicating them or by punishing them. You negotiate a bipartisan agreement and you make them less relevant. That’s what we’ve done."" The record supports Dent. We searched three databases — Lexis Nexis, CQ and Google News — and couldn’t find any instance of Dent saying he wants to expel or punish the Freedom Caucus. That doesn’t mean Dent is a fan of the Freedom Caucus. He repeatedly calls them ""rejectionists"" and calls for the party to marginalize them and not ""appease"" their ""unreasonable demands."" He said they ""fragged"" Boehner and McCarthy. And he insinuated that they’re part of the reason why Republicans ""don't have 218 votes for a bathroom break."" Here’s a round-up of comments made by Dent this past week: • Oct. 9 News Max: ""The Freedom Caucus, typically, does represent the more rejectionist wing of the party."" • Oct. 9 CNN: ""The Freedom Caucus has used tactics that I believe have undermined conservative principles. • Oct. 9 CNN: ""What I've said all along is simply marginalize those members up front. Go out and negotiate your -- negotiate what you have to negotiate just like we did on the Medicare reimbursement to physicians, the SGR."" • Oct. 8 MSNBC: ""We also have the Freedom Caucus. ... I said before John Boehner stepped down, the same people who are trying to take down John Boehner were gonna try to frag the next guy. And that’s what happened today. • Oct. 8 CNN: ""In my view, sometime to marginalize those members, you know, who don't want to be part of the governing majority. … And I don't think that any of our leaders should make accommodations to those who are going to make unreasonable demands."" • Oct. 8 MSNBC: ""Same members who wanted to take down John Boehner just fragged Kevin McCarthy. … Whoever’s going to be the next speaker should not appease this group of rejectionists, who have no interest in governing. They can simply not get to yes. The perfect will always be the enemy of the good to them, so we just have to deal with the reality as it is."" • Oct. 8 NPR: ""I mean, it was pretty clear there were a group of members — some said as many as 50 — you know, who were not going to support (McCarthy) on the House floor. … The same thing could happen for speaker, where we may need to assemble a bipartisan coalition to elect the next speaker."" • Oct. 6 Rolling Stone: ""There are a lot of folks in our conference who have a very difficult time getting to 'yes' on anything. ... On any issue of great consequence around here, we on the Republican side don't have 218 votes for a bathroom break! So we always need a bipartisan coalition."" So it’s clear that there’s no love lost between Dent and the Freedom Caucus, but Brat takes the claim a bit too far, an expert told us. ""Mr. Brat exaggerates what Mr. Dent said, as he doesn't literally advocate ‘kicking them out’ of the Republican conference,"" said Kathleen Kendall, a professor of political communication at the University of Maryland. ""This exchange between Reps. Brat and Dent illustrated the sharp divide between two wings of the Republicans in the House."" Despite his differences with the Freedom Caucus, Dent told us he wants the party to be open to everybody and he doesn't object to people ""voting their conscience,"" as Brat put it. He noted, however, that Freedom Caucus members ""talk a big game"" as they sometimes side with Democrats as part of their obstructionist tactics. ""Yes of course they should be able to vote their conscience,"" he said. ""I understand conscience votes — I get that, I understand and respect it. But some point that seems to me that you want to be part of a governing majority or you don’t."" Our ruling Brat said, Republicans like Dent want to kick the Freedom Caucus out of the Republican conference ""for voting our conscience."" Dent is critical of the Freedom Caucus but he told us he does not want to excommunicate them, nor could we find evidence that he’s expressed the desire to in the past. Brat may have been getting his moderate Republicans mixed up. It was Rep. Devin Nunes who suggested on the record that dissatisfied hardliners form their own party. We rate Brat’s claim False. Editor’s note: Shortly after we published the story, we received additional information from Brat’s spokesperson that we have added to the story. Brat's office also challenged our hearing of part of his back-and-forth with Dent. As such, we've removed a portion of Brat's quote in this fact-check. The changes do not affect our ruling. Here is a statement sent from Brat's office: ""In Congressman Brat’s exchange with Congressman Dent, he clearly did not use the foul language that PolitiFact insisted but said, 'I’ve got quote for days.' ""PolitiFact has engaged in the fabrication of a quote that Brat did not say. It discredits their entire publication and demonstrates that they are not in the business of publishing facts, but publishing false partisan attacks. It is dishonest, disgraceful and shameful. ""On Sunday afternoon, the office was given only a few hours to refute a falsehood and a political attack. After sending 6 references supporting the statements of Congressman Brat, PolitiFact insisted that the references were not enough to support the claims and chose not to highlight them appropriately.

"['Crime', 'Florida', 'Guns', 'Matt Gaetz']","
Is violent crime lower in states with open carry?
","Florida is one of only a handful of states left in the country that doesn’t allow any open carry of firearms, and some state legislators want to change that. State Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, is sponsoring a bill that would allow those with a conceal carry license to openly carry their firearms. On Oct. 6, 2015, a House panel voted in favor of the bill, which will now advance to other committees in anticipation of a January legislative session. In a press conference before the hearing, Gaetz tried to allay fears that public safety would suffer by comparing crime rates in states without open carry with those that allow it. ""It is important to note that in the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower, the murder rate was 5 percent lower, the aggravated assault rate was 23 percent lower and robbery rates were 36 percent lower."" We decided to fact-check his claim that violent crime was 23 percent lower in open carry states. The statistic suggests that open carry laws make states safer, or at the very least don’t make them more dangerous. But the reality is much more complex, according to experts and research. Comparing states on violent crime rate Gaetz used Uniform Crime Reporting figures compiled by the U.S. Department of Justice to create his statistics. The data come 2012. He divided the states into two groups — the eight states that did not allow open carry at the time, which included Florida, Texas, California, South Carolina, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma, Arkansas — and the 42 states that did allow open carry. Gaetz then compared the total number of violent crimes (defined by federal officials as murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) with the total population in the eight states without open carry in 2012. We checked his math and found the same result: Those states had a combined violent crime rate of about 434 per 100,000 people. The remaining 42 states had a violent crime rate of about 352 per 100,000. That means states with open carry laws did have a 23 percent lower violent crime rate that year. Not all open carry states are the same, however, and laws vary from state to state.  The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence lists states that prohibit the open carry of handguns in public places, states that allow open carrying without a permit, and states that require some form of license to open carry. They currently list five states that prohibit the open carrying of handguns in public places. But that’s not the only issue with these statistics. We asked several experts about Gaetz’s methodology. Many of them said the single law was too narrow to draw meaningful conclusions about its impact. In essence, his number -- for one year -- is right, but so what? Gaetz framed the use of the stats as ""evidence that this bill does not create a less safe environment."" John Pierce, co-founder of gun rights group OpenCarry.org, agreed with that point. But he said the data doesn't necessarily reflect a correlation between allowing open carry and fewer instances of violent crime. He noted that Texas and Florida are both populous states with huge numbers of concealed carry permit holders so focusing just on open carry laws will give a skewed picture about the effect of legally-armed citizens on crime rates. Tomislav Kovandzic, a University of Texas professor who teaches classes on research methods and gun control, was more blunt. ""The problem with this approach is that it implicitly assumes that both groups of states were identical/similar before the laws in the treatment states (in this case, open carry states) were enacted,"" Kovandzic told PolitiFact via email. ""This is rarely, if ever, the case. As a result, the comparison merely reflects group differences that existed before the treatment states enacted the laws."" A sound look at the issue would require controlling for factors like specific crimes, population characteristics or other details, not Gaetz’s static group comparison. ""Even if he averaged multiple years together to make his open carry versus non-open carry comparison, it wouldn’t change the futility of the approach,"" he said. What does more detailed research have to say? Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck said that plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding ""have no net effect on crime rates, including violent crime rates, one way or the other."" However, Kleck said that the research he has seen doesn’t differentiate between open carry and concealed carrying. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, pointed us to a 2010 study that looked at whether right-to-carry laws affected crime rates. The conclusion: they didn’t. ""The best available evidence suggests that right to carry concealed laws are associated with increases in aggravated assaults with guns, but have no measurable effect on population rates of murder and robbery,"" Webster said. Our ruling Gaetz said, ""In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower."" This is a fact that experts say is largely meaningless and shouldn’t weigh into any serious policy discussion. There may be less crime in those states, but there’s no way the single data point Gaetz gave can provide clues as to the effects of open carry laws. Gaetz’s statement is a one-year snapshot that is misleading. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A7840>],/factchecks/2015/oct/09/matt-gaetz/violent-crime-lower-states-open-carry/
"['National', 'History', 'Foreign Policy', 'Ben Carson']","
Ben Carson says Mahmoud Abbas, Ali Khamenei, Vladimir Putin knew each other in 1968 Moscow
","It sounds like the opening to a joke: A young Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk into a Soviet-era Moscow university … But it’s a claim that was made with a straight face by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson -- on national television, three times. First, on the Oct. 5, 2015, edition of the Fox News show Hannity, Carson said Putin’s ""relationships go way, way, way, way back, you know? 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University -- that's when Putin first got to know the Ali Khamenei, and also Mahmoud Abbas."" Then, on Oct. 8, Carson said much the same thing to CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer. Putin ""already has substantial ties in the Middle East,"" Carson said. ""In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin."" And then again to Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC on Oct. 9: Putin ""has longstanding relationships with people in that area. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was in that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that was when they first became familiar with Putin."" Really? Three future world leaders -- and three people many Americans consider adversaries -- found themselves kicking around a university in Moscow in 1968, building ties that would serve them decades later? We had to check it out. When we asked Carson’s staff whether they had any supporting evidence, aide Ying Ma wrote back, ""Thanks for your inquiry. We are not in the habit of providing Googling support to the media. If there is a specific aspect of Dr. Carson's statement that you wish to challenge, please let us know and we can go from there."" We did have difficulty finding any support for the claim, and we forwarded what we found to the campaign but did not hear back. Here’s a rundown, point by point. Mahmoud Abbas The portion of the claim dealing with Abbas has the most supporting evidence, but even here it’s not all that clear-cut. It’s fairly well documented that Abbas -- the head of the West Bank-based Palestinian government -- did do some academic work in the Soviet Union. This part of Abbas’ biography gained some attention in 1995, when Abbas became a key Palestinian figure in the Oslo peace accords. Reports surfaced that Abbas had written a doctoral thesis in the early 1980s titled, ""The Other Side: The Secret Relationship between Nazism and the Zionist Movement."" Critics, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, criticized the thesis for seeming to minimize the Holocaust, and he later distanced himself from some of its conclusions. The importance of Abbas’ thesis for our fact-check is that it was presented at a Soviet university, variously described as Oriental College, the Institute of Oriental Studies or Moscow State University. Oddly, Wikipedia is the only source that cites Patrice Lumumba University, an institution of higher education in Moscow that was designed to serve an international student clientele and which has been linked by some observers to the KGB. (It’s now known as Peoples' Friendship University.) We did track down one possibly credible source placing Abbas at Lumumba -- a 2010 article from Ria Novosti, a state-owned news agency. ""Contrary to popular myths, (Patrice Lumumba University) released from its walls not too many successful politicians -- about a dozen future ministers and only two future leaders of their countries,"" the article said. In addition to a president of Guyana, the article cited Abbas, ""who graduated from the law faculty,"" the article said. Still, a degree from Patrice Lumumba doesn’t appear in most biographies of Abbas. He is more often listed as having earned his law degree (or in some tellings, a bachelor’s degree) from the University of Damascus. In addition, most bios place Abbas working for Palestinian organizations in 1967 and 1968. He would have been 33 in 1968, the year Carson cited. So what do we know about Abbas? We know for sure that he took ""short visits"" to Moscow to defend his doctoral thesis around 1982 (where, apparently, ""he always drank coffee with cardamom,"" according to a 2005 Russian media account by a former professor). It’s also conceivable that Abbas had some connection with Patrice Lumumba University, though the evidence of that is equivocal. But there’s no hard evidence that Abbas was at Lumumba in 1968, which is what Carson said. Ali Khamenei There is no mention in the official biography of Iran’s supreme leader that he ever studied in the Soviet Union, and the timeline that’s known would have made it difficult for him to have done so. We did not hear back from the Iranian mission to the United Nations, but Ali Alfoneh, a researcher at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, looked into the question in 2012 when he was at the American Enterprise Institute. He wrote, ""According to Khamenei’s official biography, he travelled to Iraq in 1957 to study at the Theological Seminary in Najaf. Since the People’s Friendship University was first established (as Lumumba) in 1960, the young Khamenei could not have used his journey to Iraq as a cover for his studies in the Soviet Union."" On the other hand, Alfoneh continued, Khamenei’s biography says he spent a ""clandestine life"" in Tehran between March 1966 and March 1967, after which he was arrested by the police and imprisoned. The existence of this ""clandestine"" period may have fed the rumor that he spent time studying in Moscow. Certainly a period studying in the ""godless"" Soviet Union would be something Khamenei -- the head of a theocracy -- would want to keep under wraps. In an interview, Alfoneh said he isn’t convinced of the Khamenei-in-the-Soviet-Union claim. ""I'm very skeptical,"" he said. So where did this rumor come from? The allegations garnered attention in 2010 when RT, a network tightly controlled by Putin’s Kremlin, aired a piece about the 50th anniversary of Peoples' Friendship University and mentioned in passing that Khamenei was an alumnus. (We tried to contact the university, but didn’t get a response. Neither Abbas nor Khamenei is listed among the school’s ""eminent graduates."") The earlier citations of this claim aren’t well sourced, either. It appears to have surfaced initially in a 1989 column by Smith Hempstone, a journalist and future U.S. ambassador to Kenya, that ran in a small, western Pennsylvania newspaper. We also found a brief article in a Russian newspaper from 2003 that mentions the claim in passing. None of these approximate a primary source. A half-dozen experts on the region unanimously told us that they doubted Khamenei ever studied in the Soviet Union -- or that he did so in 1968, when he would have been 29. ""I've never seen it corroborated,"" said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. John Limbert, a professor of international affairs at the U.S. Naval Academy, called the idea ""bizarre."" And David Houghton, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at King’s College of London, called it ""unlikely in the absolute extreme."" ""The Soviet Union is the absolute last place where one could expect to find Khamenei at any stage in his career, and I personally do not believe that he ever studied there or had any links to Putin,"" Houghton said. ""It looks like a rather daft conspiracy theory to me."" Vladimir Putin The biggest problem for the Putin portion of Carson’s claim is the calendar: In 1968, Putin would have been 16 years old. According to his official biography, ""in 1960-1968, Vladimir Putin attended Primary School No. 193 in Leningrad. After the eighth grade, he entered High School No. 281, a chemistry-focused magnet school under the aegis of a technology institute, completing his studies there in 1970."" ""It’s pretty difficult to imagine that he could have met Messrs. Abbas and Khamenei under any circumstances at age 16 in Moscow, unless he ran into them randomly on the street on some kind of school or family trip — if, indeed, they were actually there,"" said Fiona Hill, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. In addition, Putin grew up in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). That is a 9-to-10-hour car ride from Moscow and Patrice Lumumba University. ""He studied between 1970 and 1975 in the law faculty of Leningrad State University,"" said Richard Sakwa, a professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent. ""The claim by Ben Carson is garbled rubbish."" A defense The closest we came to any of this making sense was an interview with Cliff Kincaid, who runs a group called America’s Survival, Inc. Kincaid published a paper titled, ""Communists and Muslims: The Hidden Hand of the KGB"" that raises many of these claims. Kincaid made the case that Carson was saying Abbas and Khamenei could have been agents of the KGB, and if they were, Putin, who rose to colonel in the KGB, would have known them. ""Carson was clearly saying that Putin, as a former KGB colonel and later head of the FSB, the new name for the KGB, would have knowledge of Abbas and Khamenei attending Patrice Lumumba University, a KGB-controlled institution,"" Kincaid told PolitiFact. ""That made them subject to KGB influence, if not KGB agents. Whether Putin personally met them in his younger years is beside the point. … Please report these facts rather than nitpick Carson on the ages of the various players."" We hereby report those ""facts."" Still, this isn’t what Carson said. Our ruling Carson said, ""In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin."" This is one of the more bizarre claims we’ve heard so far in the 2016 presidential campaign, and that’s saying something. Abbas may have attended the university, though we don’t know for sure, or when. No credible evidence has yet surfaced to place Khamenei as a student in the Soviet Union -- ever, much less in close proximity to Abbas, or in 1968. And Putin would have been a teenager in 1968, attending school 450 miles away. The idea that the three men developed lifelong ties as students in the late-1960s-era Soviet Union is ridiculous.

Environmental group claims Ron Johnson voted against carbon limits, took cash from polluters
","Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is once again in the crosshairs of a national conservation group for his voting record. The League of Conservation Voters has run a series of television ads against Johnson, a first-term senator who is facing a 2016 rematch with Democrat Russ Feingold. The ads have aired in anticipation of possible action by Republicans in Congress to undo Obama Administration regulations limiting carbon emissions. The $1.6 million campaign includes an ad called ""Disappear,"" and another dubbed ""Lakes."" Both make variations of the same claim: That ""Ron Johnson led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution."" The second ad includes this addendum: ""... and took nearly $225,000 from polluters."" Turns out the environmental groups are doing a bit of recycling. Support for the legislation We checked a similar claim in 2013 when the League of Conservation Voters aired an ad that said Johnson had taken ""more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air."" We rated the claim True. Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions. And, at the time that ad aired, he had received $109,550 from oil and gas interests since his first campaign in 2010, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. The same votes are cited in the most recent ads. But the wording varies a bit. It says Johnson ""led the fight,"" which is problematic. The group’s backup for the ad cites two measures that Johnson voted in favor of -- one in 2011 and one in 2013 -- that would have blocked the EPA from strengthening the carbon emission standards. However, he was not a sponsor or co-sponsor of either amendment, so it’s hard to consider him a leader. The group also noted Johnson ""has co-sponsored legislation, written to President Obama, and spoken to the media regarding his opposition to the Clean Power Plan."" The bill the group cites, the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, was introduced May 13, 2015. Johnson is among 35 co-sponsors. That’s nearly two-thirds of the 54 senators who are Republican. The letter cited was written to Obama June 4, 2014. It called on him to withdraw the EPA carbon rules. Johnson was one of 41 Republican senators who signed. Finally, the group cites a quote from Johnson in a June 18, 2014 article posted by the liberal blog Talking Points Memo. In it, Johnson said he'd be ""totally supportive"" of using government funding legislation to block the EPA rules. ""I'm a manufacturer. You actually need power if you're going to manufacture things,"" he said. ""Let's not drive, artificially, the cost of power up -- that's a self-inflicted wound. That's what this administration is doing and I have no idea why they'd want to do that."" He was one of a half dozen GOP senators quoted in the story. So, while Johnson took the steps, the group provides little evidence he was out in front or somehow spearheading them. Campaign contributions Finally, the ad offers a new figure for campaign cash (nearly $225,000) and instead of ""oil and gas,"" describes the contributors as ""polluters."" According to same campaign contribution database we previously reviewed, Johnson received  $133,600 from the oil and gas industry, $63,428 from the mining, and $22,700 from electric power utilities. That tallies out to $219,728. Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger called the ads a ""false partisan attack"" and said they distorted Johnson’s position ""that we can protect our economy and environment at the same time with a balanced national energy policy."" Our rating The League of Conservation voters launched TV ads that claim Johnson ""led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution and took nearly $225,000 from polluters."" Much of the ad’s content is recycled. The claim, however, is puffed up a bit this time because it says Johnson ""led"" the effort. We did not find much evidence of that. That knocks the claim down to Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096942240>],/factchecks/2015/oct/09/league-conservation-voters/environmental-group-claims-ron-johnson-voted-again/

Wasserman Schultz claims 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone
","In the wake of the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that the ""national epidemic"" of such incidents demands a response from Congress. She directed some of her criticism at former Gov. Jeb Bush -- one of the Republican presidential candidates from her home state of Florida: ""A message for Jeb Bush: 380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone. ‘Stuff’ doesn't just ‘happen.’ Inaction happens,"" she said in an Oct. 2 tweet. (Here’s the background of what Bush said.) A reader asked PolitiFact to look at her statistical claim, because if you divide victims by shootings, then the numbers suggest that there are less than two deaths per ""mass"" shooting. We found that Wasserman Schultz used an overly broad definition of what most people would consider a mass shooting.  A look at the statistics Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman said she was citing a report in the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, which stated that the Oregon shooting brought the total of mass shootings this year to 294. The statistic came from Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowdsourced site, which defines mass shooting as any in which four or more people are shot, regardless of whether they die or are injured. But that definition is more broad than some other definitions, which we will get into later. Mass Shooting Tracker showed 294 mass shootings as of Oct. 1. About 122 of those incidents -- or about 42 percent -- involved zero fatalities. The shootings killed 379 people and injured 1,094. Brock Weller, a Portland, Ore., resident who launched the website in 2013, told PolitiFact he gets his information from news reports. Weller said he supports more gun control ""but the site is just data and is no more political than a phone book."" While the website defines mass shootings to include fatalities and injuries, a key federal government report defined ""mass shooting"" and ""mass murder"" as four or more fatalities. The federal government’s more restrictive definition means it tends to count fewer incidents than Mass Shooting Tracker. Using 2013, the most recent year for which federal data is available, the Congressional Research Service found 25 mass shooting incidents -- far less than the 363 counted by Mass Shooting Tracker. We looked for 2015 data for the federal definition of mass shootings, but it isn’t yet available. Based on its definitions, we would expect the total to be significantly lower than Mass Shooting Tracker, but we can’t say by how much. USA Today has been tracking the data and found approximately 18 mass killings by firearms so far in 2015. A spokesman for Wasserman Schultz defended her use of a broad definition of mass shooting. ""I think the main point is that mass shootings that result in both deaths and injuries are occurring too frequently in this country,"" spokesman Sean Bartlett said. ""And it’s both reasonable and publicly understood that a mass shooting does not necessarily have to require a minimum amount of deaths, because the intent of the shooter is to kill and instill fear. Regardless of the outcome of a shooting, there are still serious physical and psychological effects."" Experts’ caveats An academic told us that one problem with Mass Shooting Tracker is it lumps together incidents that are different -- for example, those shot in bar fights are counted along with school shootings. ""This is not consistent with the motivations behind events like Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson, or Sandy Hook, and therefore are not comparable in the way we think of mass shootings,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, at State University of New York System. ""By including such events to try and quantify a phenomenon (though the loss of one life is one too many), these sources essentially are inflating the statistics."" Northeastern University professor James Alan Fox said it’s the fatal shootings that draw the most attention. ""If six people are shot and they survive, it has nowhere near the impact as six people killed. ...It’s qualitatively different,"" he said. Politicians or others who want to make a point about guns choose a set of data and a definition that reinforces the point they want to make. People who want more gun control tend to choose more expansive definitions. ""Those who want to create a sense of crisis over the violence will tend to use lower cutoffs, while those who want to minimize the problem will use higher cutoffs,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, ""380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone."" She cited the crowdsourcing site Mass Shooting Tracker, which showed 379 people killed in 296 mass shootings. But Mass Shooting Tracker uses an extremely broad definition of what many people would consider a mass shooting. If she had used a more restrictive definition that only counts incidents with deaths, as the federal government does, she would have come up with a much lower number. The Congressional Research Service counted 25 incidents in 2013, compared with 363 incidents counted by Mass Shooting Tracker. The claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

"['National', 'Regulation', 'Guns', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Less than 1% of noncompliant gun dealers get their licenses revoked. Here's why
","Following the mass shooting at an Oregon community college that left nine dead, Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to tackle gun violence that includes expanding background checks, banning assault weapons, and going after negligent gun dealers and manufacturers. ""Due to lobbying efforts by the NRA, these bad actors are granted unique protections in our laws, and the country’s law enforcement agencies often face barriers when attempting to hold them accountable,"" reads the plan released Oct. 5. ""While 38 percent of (firearms) dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked."" We were curious about her claim that less than a percent of firearms dealers found to be noncompliant had their licenses revoked by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, the agency tasked with overseeing gun sales. Clinton’s numbers are slightly off, but she’s right that it’s extremely rare for a noncompliant dealer to lose its license. Whether that means ""bad actors"" are getting away, however, remains up for debate. Not a straight shot to revocation Clinton’s spokesperson Josh Schwerin told us the campaign got its figures from a 2013 Justice Department audit of the ATF following the Sandy Hook shooting. According to the audit, the ATF found 62 percent of more than 10,000 inspected gun dealers did not violate firearms law in 2011. Clinton’s campaign took this to mean that 38 percent of dealers were noncompliant. But the actual figure is closer to 31 percent, because about 6 percent of gun dealers were categorized as ""other"" and an additional percent opted to give up their license. Out of the noncompliant dealers, only 71 had their licenses revoked. That’s 0.05 percent of all dealers active that year (over 120,000), but 0.68 percent of inspected dealers. Clearly, both are small numbers. Why do so few noncompliant dealers get their licenses revoked? For starters, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 stipulates that the ATF can only take away licenses when the dealer is ""willfully"" violating the law. So rather than revoking licenses automatically, ATF gives dealers chances to redeem themselves. If the ATF finds that a dealer has been noncompliant, it first issues a report of violations. More significant violations — for example, not properly logging gun acquisitions and gun sales — or repeated paperwork errors prompt a warning letter or a warning conference. In 2011, as with most years, 97 percent of noncompliant dealers agreed to make changes to become compliant.  ""There’s a difference between people having a hard time trying to do the right thing versus people who don’t have any interest in doing the right thing at all,"" said Suzanne Dabkowski, a public information officer and industry operations investigator at ATF’s field division in Columbus, Ohio. ""Most people do seem to want to do it correctly."" According to the ATF, it’s rare for a dealer to demonstrate a blatant disregard for the law — ""willful"" noncompliance. This can include serious violations like knowingly selling to straw buyers (someone buying a gun for someone else who wouldn’t be able to pass the background check) or minors or consistently ignoring ATF warnings, said Mike Bouchard, a former ATF assistant director for field operations. Only in those cases does the ATF recommend revocation, and a separate process kicks in. The recommendation first goes through ATF internal review, including legal consultation. If the recommendation is approved, the dealer can request a hearing and make the case that its violations were not willful. Should the ATF decide to press on, the dealer can take the case to the U.S District Court. With all this back and forth, revoking a license can take over two years, according to the Dept. of Justice audit. Meanwhile, dealers facing pending license loss can and do still sell firearms. Procedural pains or procedural justice In her gun plan, Clinton promised to increase ATF funding and ""aggressively enforce current law"" to weed out rogue dealers. It’s important to note license revocation requires an extremely high burden of proof, thanks to the ""willful"" violation requirement, according to Lindsay Nichols, senior attorney for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. For example, she said, if a dealer is selling guns without background checks, it could falsely claim that it just forgot to create the required record. Similarly, it would be very difficult for the ATF to prove that a dealer is abetting a straw purchase ""unless there is video or audio footage,"" Nichols said. Gun dealers, however, contend that the inspections regime ensures due process. Many violations reported by the ATF are paperwork mistakes that don’t endanger the public (i.e. writing ""Y"" instead of ""Yes""), said Larry Keane, the senior vice president of the firearms industry’s trade association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation. ""The dealers have certain rights, and ATF has certain rights to shut them down if they’re bad apples,"" he said. ""No one minimizes the paperwork violations. That still results in warning letters or more. ...The idea that dealers are selling guns to criminals willy nilly is just false."" Many of the most common violations are indeed paperwork errors, but the list also includes not obtaining identification, not reporting multiple handgun sales, and selling guns to someone likely to be prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Here’s a snapshot:  If bad dealers are getting away, said Bouchard, ""it’s a resource issue."" ATF’s staff size, 2,500 agents, hasn’t increased in four decades unlike other law enforcement agencies. To conduct all the inspections due in a year, the agency would need to increase its manpower by 45 percent, according to the Dept. of Justice. On top of that, by law, the ATF is not allowed to keep a centralized electronic database, and it must prioritize other duties (i.e. explosives inspections) over cyclical inspections of firearms dealers. As a result, 58 percent of dealers haven’t been inspected within five years, the legal requirement. In practice, visits actually come only once a decade, reports the Washington Post. ""There are so few agents and inspectors to do all the work,"" said Bouchard. Our ruling Clinton said, ""While 38 percent of dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked."" The numbers are slightly off. About 30 percent of inspected dealers had violated firearms regulations in 2011, and about 0.7 percent of them had their licenses revoked. That’s because revocations are only allowed when the dealer is ""willfully"" violating the law, which some say is a huge legal obstacle. The inspections and revocations process gives noncompliant dealers the chance to demonstrate willingness to comply, and the vast majority say that they will. We rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696DFC0>],/factchecks/2015/oct/08/hillary-clinton/less-percent-noncompliant-gun-dealers-get-their-li/

Hillary Clinton flip-flops on Trans-Pacific Partnership
","Since the start of her 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton hasn’t taken a strong position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal -- saying she would reserve judgment until the deal was finalized. Well, the negotiations recently came to a close, and Clinton promptly announced that she opposes the deal. ""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" she said in an Oct. 8 interview with PBS Newshour’s Judy Woodruff, adding, ""I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I have set."" This stance has some people scratching their heads, because she praised the negotiations while serving as secretary of state. We thought we should take a look back and see how Clinton’s position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has evolved. She has addressed the trade deal on a number of occasions since official negotiations started in 2010 (CNN counted at least 45 comments), so we’ll note her most representative remarks in chronological order. Sept. 8, 2010, remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations: ""We want to realize the benefits from greater economic integration. In order to do that, we have to be willing to play. To this end ... we're pursuing a regional agreement with the nations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we know that that will help create new jobs and opportunities here at home."" March 9, 2011, remarks at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum: ""The United States is also making important progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will bring together nine APEC economies in a cutting-edge, next generation trade deal, one that aims to eliminate all trade tariffs by 2015 while improving supply change, saving energy, enhancing business practices both through information technology and green technologies."" July 8, 2012, remarks with a Japanese official: ""The United States welcomes Japan's interest in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which we think will connect economies throughout the region, making trade and investment easier, spurring exports, creating jobs."" Nov. 5, 2012, remarks in Australia: ""This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment."" July 2014, in her memoir Hard Choices: ""Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It’s safe to say the TPP won’t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers… The TPP became the economic pillar of our strategy in Asia."" May 22, 2015, at a press conference in New Hampshire: ""I've been for trade agreements, I've been against trade agreements, voted for some, voted against others, so I want to judge this when I see exactly what exactly is in it and whether or not I think it meets my standards,"" adding she had some ""concerns"" about the TPP. There is an obvious difference in tenor between Clinton’s remarks as a member of the Obama administration and today as a presidential candidate. Across the whole time period, she has said details needed to be hammered out, and they had to meet certain standards. But her comments were more positive on the whole from 2010-13 than they have been recently. Here are some of the words she used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: ""exciting,"" ""innovative,"" ""ambitious,"" ""groundbreaking,"" ""cutting-edge,"" ""high-quality,"" ""high-standard"" and ""gold standard."" She also publicly encouraged more nations to get involved, such as Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, and she expressed hope that the negotiations would wrap up by the end of 2012. As a presidential candidate she has used more hedging language, for example saying she has ""some concerns,"" and now she has said she outright doesn’t support the deal as it stands. While some pundits have painted Clinton’s transition as political -- an appeal to liberals who oppose the deal -- she might have legitimately changed her mind. It’s possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was at the State Department. The negotiations have been conducted in secret, so it’s hard for us to assess that ourselves. Also, as secretary of state, she represented the Obama administration, which remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal. ""I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of state,"" Clinton said in an Oct. 7 statement. ""I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don't believe this agreement has met it."" It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about her changed stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but we rate Clinton’s reversal as a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B966C0>],/factchecks/2015/oct/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-now-opposes-trans-pacific-partners/
