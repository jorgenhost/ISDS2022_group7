Maurice Ferre blasts Kendrick Meek for party loyalty
","
In a meeting with the South Florida Sun Sentinel editorial board on July 1, 2010, U.S. Senate candidate Maurice Ferre blasted Democratic rival Kendrick Meek for, basically, having a consistent voting record. In the words of Ferre, a former Miami mayor, Meek has voted 98.6 percent of the time with his political party.

Ferre's point is to distinguish himself from his Democratic rival, whom he accuses of leaning too far from the political center. ""I think the Democrat party needs to be a centrist party,"" Ferre tells an off-camera audience from a wooden table. The interview was recorded and posted on YouTube in a 7:12-minute clip.

""In the case of Kendrick Meek, Kendrick Meek, in the Washington Post's view of each of these candidates, has voted 98.6 percent of the times with the Democrat party,"" Ferre said.

Seconds later, Ferre compares Meek's voting record to that of other Florida Democrats -- namely, Sens. Bill Nelson, Bob Graham and the late Lawton Chiles.

""None of them has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party,"" Ferre said.

The percentage is so high and so specific, to the tenth of a decimal point, we decided to look into it.

Ferre refers to a Washington Post online database that shows how members of the U.S. Congress have voted since 1991. It indeed reveals that in the current session of Congress, Meek has voted with a majority of his Democratic colleagues slightly below 98.6 percent of the time -- 98.4 percent, to be exact. That's based on 1,355 votes and does not include votes in which Meek did not vote.

For comparison, 79 other House members, all Democrats, voted with their party at the same percentage or an even higher level in the current session. All Democrats combined voted with their party 92.3 percent of the time, and all Republicans voted with their party 88.4 percent of the time. As expected, a high level of party allegiance is common for most members.

We next looked at OpenCongress.org, run by the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation, which also tracks votes by party. That site too put Meek at 98 percent for the current session.

Meek's current figure largely mirrors his record in earlier sessions, according to the Washington Post database. In the 108th Congress (2003-2004), Meek voted 94.2 percent of the time with the Democratic party. In the 109th Congress (2005-2006) and 110th (2007-2008), he voted with a majority of his Democratic colleagues 98.4 percent of the time.

But what about the other three Democrats Ferre mentions? Did they vote fewer times with their party? Nelson voted with a majority of his Democratic colleagues 92.7 percent of the time during the current Congress, according to the Washington Post database. Nelson was at 85.5 percent and 91.8 percent in two previous sessions. Similarly, Graham's percentages between 1991 and 2002 ranged from 81.8 percent to 92.9 percent. The Washington Post database keeps records back until 1991. Chiles left the U.S. Senate in 1989.

The only issue with Ferre's claim is the minor difference between 98.6 and 98.4 percent. And so we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/21/maurice-ferre/ferre-meek-hews-democrat-votes/

Immigration law author claims 60 percent of Arizona Hispanics support the measure
","
How do you defend a state law that the President of the United States calls ""misguided""? Simple, you start naming all of the people and groups that allegedly support it. That's what the conservative TV host Glenn Beck did when he claimed that 64 percent of Americans support the controversial Arizona immigration bill that Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law in April of this year. It's also what Brewer did when she cited the support for the legislation among Arizona's law enforcement.

It was only a matter of time before the author of the bill, Arizona state senator Russell Pearce, joined the chorus. Talking about the bill on CNN, Russell said that ""This is the most popular bill in America. America supports it, overwhelmingly they support it, yet every time folks get on the air, they talk about the Arizona controversial law. Controversy with whom, lawbreakers versus law keepers?""

To prove his point, he threw in an eye-catching statistic. ""Sixty percent of the Hispanics support it in Arizona.""

The number seemed high based on the media reports that we've seen, so we decided to investigate.

We found several polls that measured support for the law among Hispanics, both at the state and national level. Here is a quick summary:

*A national poll conducted by Univision, a Spanish-language television network, in May found that 67 percent of Hispanics oppose the law.

*A May poll released by the Wall Street Journal/NBC showed that 70 percent of Hispanics on the national level are either strongly or somewhat opposed to the measure.

*A national poll released in June by the Quinnipac University found that 54 percent of Hispanics disapprove of Arizona's immigration law.

Most importantly, a study commissioned by the National Council of La Raza along with the Service Employees International Union in May looked at support for the law among registered Hispanic voters in the state of Arizona. It found that 81 percent either strongly or somewhat oppose the law. Only four percent somewhat support it and 12 percent strongly support it.

We checked with polling experts to see if we had missed something.

""The La Raza poll is probably the best poll available for gauging Hispanic attitudes"" toward the immigration law, said Fred Solop, a Northern Arizona University polling expert. ""This poll was run by social scientists, includes an ample sample of Hispanics in the state, and approached the issues somewhat more complexly than other polls.""

A representative from Pearce's office told us that he was referring to a Rasmussen poll but didn't supply us with more details. So we went digging.

In the end, we decided that a possible source of the claim was a poll published on April 21, 2010. That survey looked at attitudes among likely Arizona voters, and found that 70 percent favor the legislation. Broken down by race, the approval rate was 73 percent among white voters, 50 percent among African American voters, and 63 percent among ""other"". It seems like Pearce took the 63 percent ""other"" figure and re-labeled it Hispanic.

Our polling experts told us that there are numerous problems with that approach. To begin, the ""other"" category also includes groups like native Americans, not just Hispanics. Moreover, there are some Hispanics who self-define themselves as white, so there could ""very well be overlaps between the White and Other,"" said Solop. Finally, because the poll only looked at likely voters, by the time you get down to how many actual Hispanics were interviewed, you are dealing with a very small sample size, which means that you are at a risk of incurring large margin of error.

To be thorough, we got in touch with Scott Rasmussen himself. His office sent us a statement saying that ""it would be inappropriate to use our data to state that Hispanic and Latino voters favor the Arizona law."" Well, there you have it: Pearce's own source telling us his data was used inaccurately.

To recap. Russell Pearce claimed that sixty percent of Hispanics support the Arizona immigration law. During our research, however, we found three national polls and one Arizona-specific poll that showed the exact opposite. On the national level, anywhere from 54 to 70 percent have either a strongly or somewhat unfavorable view of the legislation. On the state level, 70 percent strongly disagree with the law and 11 percent somewhat disagree. What's even more disqualifying, however, is Pearce's misuse of the poll on which he apparently based his claim. The very source that he quoted told us that it's inaccurate to equate the ""other"" category with ""Hispanics"", a point of view that we also confirmed with several other polling experts. Pearce earns himself a Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jul/21/russell-pearce/immigration-law-author-claims-60-percent-arizona-h/

Joe Biden says he never called for partition of Iraq
","
With fresh questions being raised about how to configure Iraq's government, Vice President Joe Biden was asked about a proposal that he advocated in 2007. 
""You once advocated for a three-way partition of Iraq because you were not confident that Iraq's government was capable of having a strong central government,"" ABC This Week host Jake Tapper said to Biden during a July 18, 2010, interview. 
Tapper then played a video of Biden speaking from the floor of the Senate on April 24, 2007, in which Biden said, ""The most basic premise of President Bush's approach, that the Iraqi people will rally behind a strong central government headed by Maliki, in fact, will look out for their interests equitably, is fundamentally and fatally flawed. It will not happen in anybody's lifetime here, including the pages."" 
Asked Tapper: ""Is it possible that you were right back then that it is just impossible to have a centralized government?"" 
Biden responded by taking issue with the word ""partition"" -- which was often used to describe Biden's plan at the time -- saying it was never about breaking Iraq into three separate countries. 
""I don't want to debate history here, but I never called for a partition,"" Biden said. ""I called for a central government with considerable autonomy in the regions."" 
""It was to allow them more autonomy,"" Biden said, ""...And so what's happening here is, there is an election that's taken place. And what happened-- there's 325 plus members of what they call their core, their parliament. And no one party won more than 91 seats. The two major parties, one won 89 and one won 91 seats. That's Maliki and Allawi, Iraqiya and the State of Law, they call them. 
""They're in negotiations right now to figure out how to allocate the power within that government. In other words, share power. And it is about just that. And it's underway. And it's going to happen. There will be a central government with control of its foreign policy, with control of the military. But you will see that there are going to be significant amounts of autonomy in each of the areas that exist in these provinces. That's what their constitution calls for."" 
Check the headlines in 2007, and it's clear that the word ""partition"" or ""soft partition"" was often used to describe Biden's proposal, which called for boundaries to be drawn for the country's Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite populations. And so we decided to check his claim that he never called for a partition. 
Biden's strategy was first outlined in an op-ed piece for the New York Times on May 1, 2006, which Biden co-wrote with Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations: 
""The idea, as in Bosnia, is to maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it, giving each ethno-religious group — Kurd, Sunni Arab and Shiite Arab — room to run its own affairs, while leaving the central government in charge of common interests."" 
The plan, they wrote would be to ""establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad. The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection."" 
""Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing,"" Biden wrote. ""But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq."" 
In 2007, Biden and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, successfully shepherded a nonbinding, ""sense of the Senate"" resolution that proposed separating Iraq into three semi-autonomous regions with a federal government. The resolution passed the Senate 75 to 23. 
The resolution called for the U.S. to ""actively support a political settlement among Iraq's major factions based upon the provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions."" 
And last, we point you to the fuller comments Biden made from the floor of the Senate on April 24, 2007, when Biden said the idea that the Iraqi people would rally behind a strong central government was ""fundamentally and fatally flawed."" 
As an alternative, Biden said, ""You make federalism work for the Iraqis. You give them control over the fabric of their daily lives. You separate the parties. You give them breathing room. Let them control their local police, their education, their religion, their marriage. That's the only possibility. 
""Change the focus to a limited central government and a federal system that their Constitution calls for. I can't guarantee that my strategy will work, but I can guarantee that the road the president (Bush) has us on leads to nowhere with no end in sight."" 
Biden addressed the ""partition"" issue head-on in an Oct. 3, 2007 op-ed co-written with Gelb for the Washington Post: ""Our plan is not partition, though even some supporters and the media mistakenly call it that. It would hold Iraq together by bringing to life the federal system enshrined in its constitution. A federal Iraq is a united Iraq but one in which power devolves to regional governments, with a limited central government responsible for common concerns such as protecting borders and distributing oil revenue."" 
So is it fair to call Biden's plan a call to ""partition"" Iraq? Certainly Biden advocated carving out three semi-autonomous regions. In that sense, we could see why many characterized Biden's proposal as a ""soft partition."" But the word ""partition"" carries heavy political implications, namely the creation of three separate nations. And that was never Biden's plan. He consistently upheld the idea of one Iraq with a central government, albeit a more modest one responsible for such things as defense, foreign affairs and sharing oil revenues. That's an important distinction. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/21/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-he-never-called-partition-iraq/

Sheila Jackson Lee says there are two Vietnams: North and South
","
Good morning, Vietnams. 
In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on July 15, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, raised eyebrows when she compared the war in Afghanistan to Vietnam. 
""I stand here asking us to do what we did not do in Vietnam, (which) was to recognize the valiant and outstanding service of our men and women, and to understand victory had been achieved,"" she said during the special order speech, which House members can give on any topic at the end of a day's legislative work. 
""Today, we have two Vietnams, side by side, North and South, exchanging and working,"" she said. ""We may not agree with all that North Vietnam is doing, but they are living in peace. I would look for a better human rights record for North Vietnam, but they are living side by side."" 
Conservative pundits and bloggers are still lampooning the congresswoman, and Jackson Lee, who earned a bachelor's degree in political science at Yale University and is a member of the House foreign affairs committee, backpedaled. 
""If there was any reason to raise a point of concern, it was probably because I misspoke and did not add the phrase, after my discussion of North and South Vietnam, that 'the nation was united as one,'"" she said in a statement issued the following day. ""However, my point is still accurate, and that is that the war between North and South Vietnam is similar to Afghanistan, in that those fighting against each other were Vietnamese and now the country lives as one Vietnam. However, it is South Vietnam that was consumed by North Vietnam and governed by the policies of North Vietnam."" 
The incident is already infamous on Jackson Lee's entry on the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, under a section titled ""gaffes."" Also noted: in 1997, Jackson Lee asked a NASA scientist if the Mars Pathfinder had photographed the flag that Neil Armstrong had planted on the moon. 
Quick history lesson, compliments of the CIA World Factbook:Under the 1954 Geneva Accords, Vietnam was divided into the Communist North and anti-Communist South. The United States' military presence in South Vietnam grew during the 1960s in an attempt to bolster that government, but armed forces withdrew in following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North Vietnam conquered the south, reuniting the two countries under Communist rule. 
Today, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is home to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Benefit of being unemployed: You have more time to exercise, Holly Benson says
","
Pam Bondi, a former Hillsborough County Assistant State Attorney now running for attorney general, is playing up her courtroom experience and life outside of politics in a new mailer hitting doorsteps of potential Republican voters.

The mailer is heavy on self-praise, calling Bondi a ""proven conservative,"" a ""hands-on prosecutor"" and a ""legal expert."" Those aren't claims PolitiFact Florida can objectively analyze, but we found something else that caught our eye.

In a section of the mailer called ""Who's cut out for the job?"", Bondi creates a chart that reports to measure the three GOP candidates -- herself, Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp and former Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Holly Benson.

One of the categories is: ""In their own words.""

Bondi's answer, since she got to choose it, says that she won't be outworked or outlawyered. Kottkamp's answer comes from a newspaper interview related to the Republican Party of Florida credit card mess that besieged the state GOP in 2009 and early 2010.

Then there's Benson's line. According to Bondi, Benson once said that ""just because you're poor doesn't mean you're unhealthy, it just means you have a lot more time to go running.""

The line includes a footnote referencing a Tallahassee radio interview from July 9, 2008, when Benson would have been serving as Gov. Charlie Crist's health care secretary. But would she have said something like that?

We found a digital recording of the interview with WFSU's Margie Menzel.

Benson and Menzel were having an extended discussion about health and poverty, a serious topic. During the interview, Benson talked about trying to get people to eat more fruits and vegetables, the push for more nutrition in school lunches and the encouragement to take the stairs instead of the elevators.

Then, Menzel suggested the economic downtown would continue to create a ""downward spiral"" in people's health.

""It may not create a downward spiral in their health, maybe in their ability to find affordable health insurance,"" Benson responded. ""But just because you're poor doesn't mean you have to be unhealthy. It means you have a lot more time to go running.""

The answer prompted a devilish laugh from Menzel, and from the sound of it, immediate regret from Benson. (You can listen to the interview yourself here, the exchange starts around the 12 minute mark).

Benson almost instantaneously tried to correct her statement.

""OK, that's not... that's not really,"" Benson says over the laughing. Then, she tried to clarify her point. ""I don't think just because you don't make a lot of money doesn't mean you can't go exercise.""

Later in the same program, a caller who identified himself as ""Michael from Alabama"" criticized Benson's remark, calling it inappropriate and low class.

""Thank you sir, I apologize for that. As soon as I said it, I regretted it,"" Benson says according to the audio recording. ""I mistook something that Ms. Menzel said and meant that there's no reason that anybody couldn't be healthy at any time.""

Bondi quotes Benson accurately in the campaign mailer, but Benson tried to walk back her comment right away and apologized for it later in the same radio interview. We rate Bondi's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/20/pam-bondi/holly-benson-once-said-poor-people-have-time-run-o/

Joe Biden says health care approval increasing
","
Jake Tapper, the host of ABC's This Week, asked Vice President Joe Biden in an interview aired Sunday July 18 if the Obama administration was getting enough credit for its accomplishments, and if not, why not. 
Biden responded that it takes time for people to feel the effects of legislation. ""For example,"" said Biden, ""here you had the insurance industry spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make the health care bill out to be this godawful tragedy. Now what's starting to happen? The health care numbers are going up."" 
That made us wonder whether public opinion polls have shown a marked increase in approval of President Obama's health care reform bill since it was signed into law on March 23, 2010. 
The problem with statistics and public opinion polls is that numbers can be cherry-picked to make just about any assertion. Looking at polling numbers in different ways paints a clearer picture, so that's what we did. And we found that there is no clear trend in approval, positive or negative, since the health care bill passed. 
Our data primarily comes from Pollster.com's aggregation of polls measuring opinions towards the new health care bill. If you look closely, shortly after the bill passed there was a slight move upwards, followed by a move downwards, resulting in a negligible net change. 
  
Within a week of passage, a USA Today/Gallup poll found that 47 percent of those polled thought the health care law was a ""good thing."" When they polled again in June, 49 percent responded favorably. While that marks a two percentage point increase, since the poll's margin of sampling error is four percent, the difference is statistically insignificant. 
At the end of March, CBS News took a poll that found 32 percent approved of the new law. When the same question was asked in July, 36 percent approved. With a sampling error of three, this means a slight increase in those viewing it favorably. However, a Pew poll taken in early April and then again in July shows a five percent decrease, with a sampling error of four percentage points. 
The three polls mentioned above come to three different conclusions, but they all share one thing in common-- the changes in opinion are very small when accounting for sampling error. 
""I would say there is no clear trend,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. 
""The healthcare reform legislation Congress passed in late March divided the public then and has not gained support in the three months since,"" read a report published by Gallup in late June. 
If you look over the last six months and use live interviewer polls, which are usually considered more reliable, as opposed to just looking at polls since March when the bill passed, then you can see a small trend upward, according to Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com. However, Franklin agrees that using the time around the bill was signed into law is ""an obvious point of comparison."" Franklin added that the lack of polling over the last three months makes it difficult to accurately detect trends using Pollster.com data. 
Since the poll results reflect no clear trend up or down in the public's view of the health care bill since its passage in March, we rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/20/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-health-care-approval-increasing/

Joe Biden says U.S. 'is not engaged in nation-building' in Afghanistan
","
During a July 18, 2010, interview on ABC's This Week, Vice President Joe Biden made a clear characterization of U.S. policy in Afghanistan.

""If you notice, what we have is a counter-insurgency plan along the spine of the country, where the population is,"" Biden said. ""It's not a nationwide counter-insurgency plan. We're not engaged in nation-building, which the original discussion was about. We have ... a date where we're going to go look and see whether it's working. And we have a timetable in which to transition.""

The part that caught our eye was the notion that the United States is ""not engaged in nation-building."" We thought it would be worth seeing whether that's a fair characterization of what the U.S. is doing.

Our initial challenge was to define what ""nation-building"" actually means. One concise definition offered in America's Role in Nation-Building: From Germany to Iraq, a 2003 study by the RAND Corp, is ""to use military force to underpin a process of democratization. Substitute ""stablilization"" or ""reconstruction"" for ""democratization"" -- as many recent commentators have done -- and that serves as our definition. 
We should start by noting that the term isn't exactly in favor these days.

In recent years, ""nation-building"" has variously taken hits from the right, for seeming to place battle-hardened troops in softer roles of promoting civic society, and from the left, for fear of an open-ended military commitment. ""Labeling it as such would help discredit such interventions,"" said Ivan Eland, a senior fellow at the Independent Institute, a libertarian think tank, and author of an upcoming book on counterinsurgency warfare.

True to form, the Obama Administration avoids the term ""nation-building"" as if it were allergic to the concept. We were unable to find any instance in which a White House official used the term to describe what was actually happening on the ground in Afghanistan. Just about the only time the term is used is when the administration seeks to explain what the U.S. is not doing.

In a Dec. 1, 2009, speech at the U.S. Military Academy intended to outline the administration's policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Obama said that ""there are those who oppose identifying a time frame for our transition to Afghan responsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort -- one that would commit us to a nation-building project of up to a decade.  I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.""

Two days later, in Congressional testimony, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sounded the same note.

""This approach is not open-ended 'nation building,'"" Gates said. ""It is neither necessary nor feasible to create a modern, centralized, Western-style Afghan nation-state -- the likes of which has never been seen in that country. Nor does it entail pacifying every village and conducting textbook counterinsurgency from one end of Afghanistan to the other. It is, instead, a narrower focus tied more tightly to our core goal of disrupting, dismantling and eventually defeating al-Qaida by building the capacity of the Afghans -- capacity that will be measured by observable progress on clear objectives, and not simply by the passage of time.""

The administration is essentially arguing that it is not undertaking ""nation-building,"" first, because the goal of strengthening civil society in Afghanistan is secondary to the narrower goal of taking on al-Qaida, and second, because the U.S. role in the mission is not one that will keep personnel on the ground indefinitely. 
Marvin Weinbaum, a former Afghanistan specialist at the State Department and now a scholar at the Middle East Institute, said the U.S. will have an interest in supporting Afghanistan's development long after the troops leave. But since the context of Biden's comment was a discussion of military policy, we'll keep our analysis narrowly focused on military-led nation-building.

Meanwhile, Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that ""nation-building"" is not only a loaded term, ""it's also a vague term.""

Some foreign-policy experts say the administration has some justification for distinguishing between current U.S. policy and ""nation-building."" While we did not receive any clarification from the Vice President's office, O'Hanlon said that ""in Afghanistan, our goals are relatively limited to ensuring some semblance of security and stability. In that sense, the vice president is right"" that the mission in Afghanistan is more limited than full nation-building would be, O'Hanlon said.

Lawrence Korb -- a former Defense Department official under President Ronald Reagan who now serves as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal group with close ties to the Obama Administration -- added that the time element is important too. A strict interpretation of the term ""nation-building"" would suggest that the U.S. would ""literally stay until everything was secure and a functioning government was in place."" But the administration is saying that the Afghans ""have 18 months to shape up,"" Korb said. That 18 months would end in July 2011, according to current plans.
 
That said, both O'Hanlon and Korb agreed that there is significant substantive overlap between what goes on under the traditional definition of ""nation-building"" and what the U.S. is doing in Afghanistan. ""There certainly are major elements of what one might call 'state-building' going on, starting with creation of a strong army and police,"" O'Hanlon said.
 
Indeed, key policy documents outline a variety of duties that would seem to fit well within our definition of nation-building.

The administration's National Security Strategy document released in May 2010 says that the U.S. ""will continue to work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan Government to improve accountable and effective governance. As we work to advance our strategic partnership with the Afghan Government, we are focusing assistance on supporting the president of Afghanistan and those ministries, governors, and local leaders who combat corruption and deliver for the people. Our efforts will be based upon performance, and we will measure progress. We will also target our assistance to areas that can make an immediate and enduring impact in the lives of the Afghan people, such as agriculture, while supporting the human rights of all of Afghanistan’s people--women and men. This will support our long-term commitment to a relationship between our two countries that supports a strong, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan.""

If this sounds a lot like nation-building, so does a portion of the Army's Counterinsurgency Field Manual, which was authored by Gen. David Petraeus in 2006. While the document was written during the Bush Administration, it still holds significant sway, especially given that Petraeus is now the top commander in Afghanistan.

One portion of the manual says that ""particularly after security has been achieved, dollars and ballots will have more important effects than bombs and bullets. This is a time when 'money is ammunition.' Depending on the state of the insurgency, therefore, Soldiers and Marines should prepare to execute many non-military missions to support (counterinsurgency) efforts."" It even goes so far as to use the now-taboo words: ""Everyone has a role in nation-building, not just Department of State and civil affairs personnel.""

Another portion of the manual says that ""success in (counterinsurgency) operations requires small-unit leaders agile enough to transition among many types of missions and able to adapt to change. They must be able to shift through a number of activities from nation-building to combat and back again in days, or even hours.""
 
Such overlap suggests that for the current administration, the difference between its policy in Afghanistan and nation-building is, to a certain extent, one of nomenclature.
 
Doug Bandow, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said, ""Of course they are engaged in nation-building, and of course they are denying it.""

Eland added, ""They are simply doing it and using a different name.""
 
So let's recap. When Biden says that ""we're not engaged in nation-building"" in Afghanistan, he's correct that the administration doesn't use that word, and that the U.S. commitment is narrower and more time-limited than a nation-building effort might be. However, many of the things the U.S. is seeking to do in Afghanistan would fall under a reasonable definition of what used to be known as nation-building. So while we acknowledge the limits of U.S. military intentions in Afghanistan, we don't think it's right to let the vice president simply deny the existence of the types of activities formerly identified with ""nation building"" by disavowing the phrase. So we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/20/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-us-not-engaged-nation-building-afgh/

Are former Atlanta tenants flooding the suburbs?
","
It's been a constant refrain in Atlanta's suburbs when there is a rise in crime.

Those crime spikes are often blamed on people who used to live in the Atlanta projects.

A frustrated Atlanta Housing Authority official addressed the claims in an open letter last month.

""Have the suburbs been inundated with former residents of Atlanta housing projects? Absolutely not,"" said Barney Simms, the authority's chief external affairs officer.

We decided to look into the matter.

Have former housing project residents relocated to the suburbs? Or have they stayed within the city of Atlanta?

The AHA built what's widely believed to be the first public housing complex in the nation, Techwood Homes in 1936. By the 1970s, many AHA developments developed reputations as high-crime areas. One apartment complex, East Lake Meadows, was so dangerous that residents called it ""Little Vietnam"" because of the constant shootings there. City leaders and police tried many efforts to improve public safety inside and around some of the projects. In one five-month stretch in 2007, five men were shot and killed in one AHA development, Bowen Homes.

In 1994, Renee Glover became the AHA's executive director and embarked on a new strategy to transform its older developments into mixed-income communities, thinking, in part, that it would reduce crime. Some tenants moved elsewhere, using rent subsidy vouchers called Section 8. Others returned to AHA properties once they've been redeveloped. The latest round of redevelopment began in 2007. The Quality of Life Initiative, as the most recent effort was called, included the demolition and redevelopment of 10 apartment complexes and two senior citizen high-rises.

In August 2007, Clayton County officials considered a plan that would require they have a copy of all residential lease agreements. The idea, Commission Chairman Eldrin Bell said at the time, was to know who was in the county and better respond to any problems unruly renters cause. Some Clayton officials worried former Atlanta Housing Authority tenants were moving into apartment complexes in north Clayton and largely responsible for a spike in violence.

Former state Sen. Steen Miles made a similar claim about former AHA tenants in DeKalb County in an April newspaper editorial and in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

""The people dumped from the Atlanta housing projects went to Clayton and DeKalb counties,"" she told the AJC.

Did they come to Clayton and DeKalb?

We reached out to the AHA. Its Housing Choice division tracks where its former tenants have moved.

Longtime journalist John Sugg, a former senior editor of Creative Loafing, is using their data and additional research to write a book on the authority. He presented PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet from the AHA that tracks the whereabouts of about 2,600 households since the Quality of Life Initiative began. The AHA data show 2,251 households stayed inside Atlanta city limits. It shows 344 households, 13 percent, moved to other parts of metro Atlanta. The bulk of those people moved to Decatur, College Park and East Point.

Since those figures come from the AHA, we looked to see if anyone else is tracking such data. The U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department does not track where former AHA tenants are using Section 8 vouchers, a HUD spokesman said.

We did find one group that has done its own research. Georgia State University's Urban Health Initiative has been tracking the progress of tenants who lived in six AHA developments since 2008: Bankhead Courts, Bowen Homes, Herndon Homes, Hollywood Courts, Palmer House and Roosevelt House. The latter two developments are senior citizen high-rises. Their research showed 15 percent of those 330 households now live outside the city, said Deirdre Oakley, an associate professor of sociology at the university.

Oakley said there's been no evidence from their group's research that shows a spike in crime in neighborhoods where these former tenants have moved.

""It's easy because of the publicity that AHA has gotten to say, 'Oh, look! It's public housing from Atlanta moving into our neighborhoods,' "" she said.

Since an average of four people live in each AHA apartment, we multiplied that number by 344 households that AHA says has moved to other parts of metro Atlanta. That's about 1,400 people. Clayton County's population is nearly 276,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. DeKalb County's population is slightly more than 747,000, the Census Bureau data show.

Even if all 1,400 of those people moved to one of those counties, is it fair to say one of those places has been ""inundated"" with former AHA tenants? We don't think so. The data from the AHA and Georgia State both reach similar conclusions that the percentage of tenants moving out of the city has been small. Therefore, we rate Simms' statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/20/barney-simms/are-former-atlanta-tenants-flooding-suburbs/

Loughlin says carrying drugs is the price people have to pay to sneak into the U.S. from Mexico
","John Loughlin, a Republican running for Congress in the 1st District, echoed a controversial claim about illegal immigration when he appeared July 9 on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show.

Loughlin, fresh from a trip to Arizona, said that it's common for people crossing the border illegally to be carrying drugs for drug traffickers.

""That's the price of admission,"" Loughlin said. ""So if you want your family to go -- you, your wife, your kids, you know --  'Here's a backpack full of drugs.' That's how you're going to get across the border.""

At another point in the conversation, he said, ""And these are folks that come across the border and in many cases they're human traffickers. And in order to get passage across the border you gotta carry a knapsack full of 80 pounds of drugs. And if you get tired in the middle of the desert, they take the drugs off your back and leave you for dead. They found many of them just left for dead in the middle of the desert.""

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer made a similar claim June 25, when she asserted that ""The majority of people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules.""

PolitiFact National examined Brewer's claim and, on June 30, judged it as False.

PolitiFact concluded that while most experts agree that there is growing overlap between drug smuggling and human smuggling, the evidence shows that only a small percentage of those crossing the border illegally are carrying drugs.

Even Brewer backed off her initial statement, issuing two clarifications. The second one said, in part: ""The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs.""

So, by her logic, if you're being helped by a drug smuggler, you're a drug smuggler, even if you're not carrying drugs.

We alerted Loughlin's campaign to the previous PolitiFact story and asked for the source of the candidate's statements on the Glover show.

Loughlin's campaign manager, Cara Cromwell, responded by noting that Loughlin never specifically said the majority of illegal immigrants were transporting drugs. But his words and the context of his comments clearly gave the impression that carrying drugs is now the price of admission for getting into the United States illegally.

Cromwell also released a statement from the candidate saying that he got his information from law enforcement officials in Arizona, and she gave us a phone number for the Pinal County sheriff's office. ""While the information is anecdotal, it is nevertheless a sad but true fact,"" Loughlin said in the statement.

So we called, and then emailed, the Pinal County sheriff's office and asked how many people they had arrested for crossing the border since Jan. 1, and how many of those had been charged with drug offenses.

Spokesman Tim Gaffney said that from Jan. 1 to May 18, their office turned over 100 people to the U.S. Border Patrol for being in the country illegally, of which 41 were charged with marijuana smuggling. So far so good.

But it turns out that Pinal County is about 70 miles from the border, and those 100 people, said Gaffney, were picked up for a variety of reasons, not as they were crossing the border. ""None of them are from that. They're all just from officer contacts, from citizens calling in the individuals,"" Gaffney said. ""Almost all of them are traffic stops or citizens calling in regarding fights in progress or suspicious behavior where we get called to it.""

He referred us to the U.S. Border Patrol for broader numbers.

We then called Steven Cribby, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who pulled statistics for the Tucson sector, which covers 262 miles of Arizona border, from the New Mexico state line to Yuma, Arizona. It's also the biggest and busiest sector.

The 100 people (about 22 per month) picked up in Pinal County turns out to be a drop in the bucket. From Oct. 1, 2008 through Sept. 30, 2009, the border patrol apprehended 241,673 people (20,000 per month), Cribby said.

How many of the 241,673 cases involved drugs? Cribby said the Border Patrol logged 1,602 apprehensions in ""drug-related events"" for that period.

We did the math. That's less than 1 percent (0.66 percent) of all the apprehensions from that Border Patrol sector.

But Cribby stressed that not everyone who is apprehended in a drug-related event is actually involved with drugs. ""It just means they were apprehended in the same event,"" he said.

So the actual percentage could be even lower.

""For the most part, the people who are bringing drugs across, they're getting very heavily coached that as soon as you sense that the Border Patrol is coming to run away as quickly as possible"" back to Mexico, said Tucson sector agent Colleen Agle. ""And a lot of them try to come north with the intention of just hiding the load so that somebody who is already in the United States can come and pick that up. So they're trying to hide it and run back.""

So they're not even interested in staying in the United States.

This seems to confirm what PolitiFact found in June when it received data from the Department of Homeland Security showing that, in March 2010, drug and drug-trafficking charges accounted for just over 5 percent of immigrations and customs prosecutions while simple immigration violations accounted for almost 89 percent.

By saying that carrying drugs has become the price of admission for getting across the Arizona border illegally, Loughlin falsely created the impression that most immigrants sneaking across the border are being forced to pay this price.

After we informed the campaign that the drug mule claim had been questioned (and sent along the June 30 PolitiFact item outlining its problems), Loughlin acknowledged that he was using anecdotal information from the law enforcement people he spoke with, yet still characterized his ""price of admission"" comment as ""a sad but true fact.""

But anecdotes are not the best evidence.

The not-so-anecdotal numbers from Customs and Border Protection show that his fact is sad but not true.

We rate his claim as Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jul/20/john-loughlin/loughlin-says-carrying-drugs-price-people-have-pay/

The Rick Scott-Playboy-gay dating website connection
","
Rick Scott's ties to a company have become, let's just say, the ""centerfold"" of a new attack being leveled by Scott's challenger for the Republican nomination for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum.

In a new campaign mailer called ""The Two Faces of Rick Scott,"" McCollum's camp attempts to counter suggestions that Scott is a unwavering conservative with impeccable Republican credentials.

""What Rick Scott does and what Rick Scott says show the completely different faces of Rick Scott,"" says the mailer, which follows with examples.

""Rick Scott says he is an across-the-board conservative,"" the mailer says. But, ""Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating.

""Rick Scott: Nothing new. Something bad.""

The mailer got us wondering -- Is Scott, a former health care CEO, in bed with Playboy?

McCollum spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said the company referenced in the mailer is Quepasa, which in Spanish means ""what's happening."" The corporation (NASDAQ: QPSA) owns Quepasa.com, which claims to be one of the world's largest Latino online communities.

The company is headquartered in West Palm Beach with offices in Miami, Los Angeles, Scottsdale, Ariz., and Hermosillo, Mexico.

As McCollum suggested, Quepasa and Playboy began partnering in 2009 to find and identify ""Cyber Chicas"" for the magazine's Mexico edition. Quepasa created an online community that features models wanting to be included in Playboy. Users of the website can go to the Playboy community to vote for and rank the women. Three finalists are forwarded each month to Playboy, which selects a winner. A 24-year-old Brazilian, Fernanda Schonardie, was selected as the first ""Cyber Chica"" and was featured in a full-page layout in the March 2009 edition of Playboy México. The partnership has continued since (We'll skip the links).

""The Playboy México community has been a tremendous success,"" Quepasa CEO, John C. Abbott, said in a press release. ""We've received numerous submissions from all over the globe and have recorded hundreds of thousands of impressions and votes from members. We are delighted with the campaign and anticipate ongoing growth in traffic.""

Quepasa reported that the Playboy México community became the most popular community on Quepasa in just a matter of weeks and represented 28 percent of all community page views.

Quepasa.com is much more than Playboy, however. It's an online network that allows people to join discussion groups about everything -- from romance, to music, to culture and politics, to sports, to religion.

The company said that as of July it had nearly 15 million online members.

Quepasa is definitely a general interest social network, and in short appears to be trying to reach anyone who would want to talk about anything. It makes sense, then, that some of the website's online communities are geared to gays and lesbians. The company also announced in June 2010 that it was partnering with online dating service Zoosk Inc. Zoosk does offer its dating services to gay people.

What is Scott's role in Quepasa? McCollum says it's his company.

But really, Scott is an investor. According to required filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Scott controls 13.8 percent of all of the stock in Quepasa, which translates to 2 million shares. We should note that Scott himself owns just a fraction of those shares. The rest are split between a family partnership and in a trust in his wife's name. Scott also has a warrant to purchase 1 million shares (A warrant is a way to entice investors into a company, by essentially offering them a good deal to accumulate large amount of shares). Scott's stock in Quepasa is worth about $7.6 million, the St. Petersburg Times reported.

Scott began investing in the company in March 2006, according to a Quepasa press release.

""Hispanic and Latino families have a growing presence in the U.S.; Quepasa has been developing content relevant to the Hispanic community for over seven years,"" Scott was quoted as saying in the release. ""Quepasa should be well positioned to build a viable company if it continues to innovate and deliver value to the Hispanic and Latino communities.""

As an investor, Scott would have some say in the company's direction, but he doesn't own enough stock to get what he wants, whenever he wants it. He does not sit on the company's board of directors, which is an important distinction considering McCollum's original statement.

In McCollum's  campaign  mailer, he said, ""Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating."" The company in question, Quepasa does partner with Playboy in an Internet venture and does have community chat rooms that cater to gays and lesbians. 
But the company and the website is more than Playboy and gay dating. 
It's also misleading for McCollum to say Quepasa is Scott's company, as if he were the owner, or the one making decisions. As a fourth-largest individual stockholder, he has clout, no doubt. But he's ultimately not in charge of Quepasa. (For instance the partnership with Playboy came in 2009, three years after Scott had already invested in the company). Because of those failures to be more clear with potential voters, we rate McCollum's claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/19/bill-mccollum/rick-scott-playboy-connection/

Ron Johnson campaign ad blasts Russ Feingold for record on Great Lakes oil drilling
","
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is at the top of the news, but the political ripples are being felt far and wide. In Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold and Republican challenger Ron Johnson have gotten into a bit of mudslinging over who would be better at protecting the Great Lakes from drilling.

Feingold started the war of words by charging in a 30-second ad that Johnson ""is willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies, threatening Wisconsin’s economy, and a way of life for generations of Wisconsin families.""

Johnson quickly shot back with a statement saying in part, ""I would not support any efforts to overturn the provision which outlaws drilling in the Great Lakes as Wisconsin’s next U.S. Senator. Let me repeat: I would reject any and all efforts to drill in the Great Lakes.""

Johnson drove home that theme in a 30-second television ad. In the ad, viewers see a car spinning its wheels in the mud.

""Twenty-eight years in politics and Russ Feingold’s stuck in the mud,"" the narrator says. ""Feingold started his campaign slinging mud at Ron Johnson. Ron Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes, and Russ Feingold knows it. Drilling is already illegal in the Great Lakes, and Feingold knows that too. Because he voted against the law that protected our lakes. That’s right. Feingold was the only Great Lakes senator to vote no. Feingold played politics. Partisan politician Russ Feingold. Stuck in the mud.""

In this item, we won't get into the question of whether Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes. But we thought we'd sort out whether Feingold had indeed voted against a bill to ban Great Lakes drilling.

The bill that Johnson's ad refers to is the Energy Policy Act of 2005. A provision of that law -- Section 386 -- reads, ""No Federal or State permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant, directional, or offshore drilling in or under one or more of the Great Lakes."" A check of the Senate roll call vote on the final version of that bill confirms that Feingold voted ""nay.""

Case closed? Not quite. The claim requires several caveats.

• Feingold wasn't voting against the bill because of the drilling ban. The bill in question was championed by President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, most congressional Republicans and some Democrats. Nineteen Democrats, six Republicans and one independent voted against the bill, which passed, 74-26.

At the time, Feingold cited several reasons for voting against the bill.

""This bill digs us deeper into a budget black hole,"" Feingold said, according to his home state newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""It fails to decrease our dependence on foreign oil. It rolls back important consumer protections. And finally, it undermines some of the fundamental environmental laws that our citizens rely upon."" He also cited the bill's repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, its changes to the Clean Water Act and its exemption of hydraulic fracking -- a controversial technique for retrieving underground natural gas -- from the Safe Drinking Water Act.

He most certainly didn't vote against it because it included a Great Lakes drilling ban. Quite the contrary: Feingold's camp points out that in 2001, the senator was an original co-sponsor of the Great Lakes Water Protection Act, which directed the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator to conduct a study on known and potential environmental effects of oil and gas drilling on land beneath the water in the Great Lakes. (The bill did not advance.) Feingold also sponsored or supported numerous other bills to protect the Great Lakes specifically and clean water generally.

The Johnson camp told PolitiFact that ""our ad never insinuates Sen. Feingold did not support a 2001 bill regarding Great Lakes or make any other statement about whether or not he supports drilling in the Great Lakes."" But we think a reasonable person could come away with the ad wondering whether Feingold is somehow opposed to a ban on Great Lakes drilling. And that would be incorrect.

That said, congressional bills often have hundreds or thousands of provisions. Most of the time, lawmakers who vote yes on a bill don't agree with everything in it, and when they vote for it because of the many things they do agree with, they must be prepared for critics to point out the discrepancies. So we think Johnson deserves some leeway for legitimately catching Feingold voting against something he says he supports.

• There wasn't just one law that curbed drilling in the Great Lakes. The ad says that Russ Feingold ""voted against the law that protected our lakes."" That makes it sound like there was one law that accomplished that purpose, and that Feingold missed his chance to support it. That's incorrect. There were actually four, one of which was permanent -- the one cited in the ad -- and three of which were temporary. All did essentially the same thing.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, ""Congress had enacted a temporary ban on any new federal and state permits for drilling under the Great Lakes in 2001 (P.L. 107-66; Title V, §503) and extended it to 2007. This temporary ban was in addition to several state bans on drilling in or under the Great Lakes.""

So we looked up the 2001 law to see whether Feingold voted for it. He did. (The bill passed overwhelmingly, 96-2.) Specifically, it was the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2002, which included a provision that said that ""during the fiscal years 2002 and 2003, no federal or state permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant, directional, or offshore drilling in or under one or more of the Great Lakes.""

We also looked up the extension for 2004 and 2005, which passed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 -- a massive federal spending bill. In this case, Feingold voted no.

Finally, we looked up the law that extended the ban through 2006 and 2007. It was the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. Feingold voted no on that one too.

So Feingold actually voted for one temporary ban and voted against three (two of them temporary, one permanent). All were buried in much broader bills, and his camp says he opposed those bills despite the drilling ban provision, not because of it. At the same time, even though he only batted one for four, Feingold has a right to say that in one case, he voted for a ""law that protected our lakes.""

• Feingold was not the only Great Lakes senator to vote no on the 2005 bill. Johnson cited yes votes by senators from Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But he excluded New York state, which borders Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Both New York senators at the time -- Democrats Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer -- joined Feingold in voting no. 
The Johnson campaign told PolitiFact that ""including or excluding two New York City senators as Great Lakes senators is subjective, and many government and academic sources do not group New York in the Great Lakes region."" They cited the Great Lakes Regional Water Program University of Wisconsin Extension (which defines the Great Lakes Region as ""Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin""), the Bureau of Economic Analysis (which defines the Great Lakes Region as ""Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin""), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (which defines the Great Lakes Region as ""Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin""). 
But we think the implication that Clinton and Schumer somehow forfeit their right to represent residents on Lake Ontario and Lake Erie is ridiculous. In addition, if the campaign was going to use these three alternate groupings as gospel, they should have also eliminated Pennsylvania, which does not appear in any of the three they cite. But they didn't: The Johnson campaign's backup sheet for the ad cites Pennsylvania, but not New York.

This strikes us as cherry picking. We find no good rationale for excluding New York, so on this count, we find Johnson's ad clearly inaccurate.

So let's sum up. Feingold did vote against a bill that included the permanent ban on Great Lakes drilling, and also voted against two of the bills with temporary bans, though for reasons unrelated to the drilling ban provision. As a result, Johnson has some justification for saying that Feingold ""voted against the law that protected our lakes."" But the ad ignores that Feingold supported one of the temporary bans, and that he has a long record of protecting the environmental quality of the Great Lakes, including championing at least one bill that dealt directly with drilling. Meanwhile, we don't buy the campaign's rationale for excluding New York from the list of Great Lakes states. That fundamentally undercuts the ad's claim that Feingold was the only Great Lakes senator to vote against the 2005 bill. On balance, we rate the ad Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/19/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-campaign-ad-blasts-russ-feingold-recor/

Governor Rick Perry says he's never fielded phone call from the Obama White House
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who seems to relish bashing Washington, suggested a complete lack of outreach by President Barack Obama and the White House in a Fox News Channel interview aired July 13. 
Speaking to anchor Neil Cavuto, Perry said: ""We don’t get a lot of calls from this White House."" Asked about his relations with the Democrat’s administration, the Republican governor said: ""I have, frankly, never had a call from them.""

Perry’s remarks came after Cavuto asked the governor about federal plans to push afresh for a moratorium on the drilling of deep-water oil wells. According to a transcript posted online by Fox News, Cavuto said: ""Did they consult on this? Did they consult you on this, sir, did anyone ...""

Perry: ""They don't...""

Cavuto: ""...run this, ‘Hey, we ought to give Rick Perry a call on this?’""

Perry: ""We don't get a lot of calls from this White House.""

Cavuto: ""Really? How would you describe your relations with the Obama administration?""

Perry: ""You know, I have, frankly, never had a call from them. So they may have checked in at some staff levels that I'm not aware of.""

From ""the standpoint of the White House caring what Texas thinks -- look... ,"" said Perry, ticking off some administration ideas he said would be injurious to Texas. ""This is an administration that clearly has Texas on its radar and it’s in a bad way.""

We asked Perry’s office for elaboration on his no-call status with Obama and also contacted the White House, whose spokesman, Matt Lehrich, disputed Perry’s description.

Lehrich pointed us to indications that Perry has been part of White House conference calls.

On April 29, 2010, according to a press release on the White House website, the president called the governors of states on the Gulf of Mexico, including Perry, ""to discuss the BP oil spill situation and assure the governors that the administration will continue to use every single available resource at our disposal in the response efforts.""

The release continues: ""The president described the range of federal actions that are underway to respond to the spill and stressed the importance of maintaining close coordination with the governors as this event continues to evolve. All of the governors appreciated the call and the actions being taken by the federal government.""

An earlier release, from July 6, 2009, says Perry was among five governors to participate in a conference call with Vice President Joe Biden.

Of late, Lehrich said in an e-mail, Perry has been invited to be on a call with senior administration officials involved in the response to the oil spill every day since May 4. Perry ""has participated on a number of those calls and has been represented by his staff on many more,"" Lehrich said.

We shared this information with Perry’s office and got no response.

Next, we checked Perry’s state schedule covering April 1 to mid-July. There were no entries indicating White House calls April 29 or May 4. But Perry’s schedule for June 29 has an 8:15 a.m. entry stating ""Phone Call: White House Intergovernmental Affairs/BP Oil Spill.""

Does the Democratic president routinely seek the Texas Republican’s counsel? We doubt it.

But both the White House’s information and Perry’s own schedule contradict his claim he’s never had a call from this White House. Presuming his state schedule reflects what actually happened, Perry got such a call two weeks before the Fox interview aired.

Cicilline says Providence's crime rate is the lowest in 30 years
","Providence Mayor David Cicilline has made Providence's falling crime rate one of the key selling points in his campaign in the 1st Congressional District. He repeated it during the July 13 debate with his three Democratic challengers, saying the city now has ""the lowest crime rate in three decades.""

In addition, the mayor's website says, ""Under his leadership, Providence has seen crime drop to its lowest rate in 30 years.""

We asked the campaign for numbers to support that assertion. They provided statistics collected by the Providence Police Department on various crimes going back to 1960.

Cicilline is basing the claim on the sum of all reports of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft, which the police call the ""crime index.""

Those numbers show that in 2009, there were 9,252 such crimes reported in the capital city. The last time the number was that low was in 1965, when 8,521 crimes were logged in those categories. That's a span of 44 years.

So by that measure, Cicilline's claim is understated. The annual number of reported crimes hasn't been this low in more than four decades, not three.

But is the mayor's leadership responsible for that decline?

When we invited Karen Watts, the mayor's director of communications, to address that issue, she responded in an email that, ""I think I'll just let the facts speak for themselves.""

We compared the rise and fall of crimes in Providence to the national pattern, using numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Justice. Over the years, the Providence trends have been very similar to the U.S. numbers. The number of crime reports rose steadily, except for some sporadic dips, throughout the 1960s, '70s and '80s.

Around 1990, things began to change. Nationally, the numbers began a gradual decline. Chris Menton, a professor of criminal justice at Roger Williams University, said there are lot of theories for the trend, but one of the most solid holds that when there are more young people in a population, the crime rate is higher. Beginning in the 1960s, the Baby Boomers were of an age where they were more likely to get into trouble and, in reaction, ""our tolerance for deviant behavior went down."" That upward trend changed after the early '90s because the population was older and a booming economy meant more jobs, which helps keep younger people out of trouble.

Locally, the numbers fell dramatically, beginning around the time then-Mayor Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. began his second administration. Then, during Cianci's final three years, before he went to prison on a federal corruption charge, crime made a sharp spike upward again, a trend that was far more muted on the national level.

It was after this 2001-2002 peak that Cicilline took over and - with the exception of a bump in 2008 when the number of incidents went up by 6 percent over the previous year - the number of reported crimes has fallen steadily.

So the decline in the number of crimes reported in Providence coincides with a similar, although much less steep, decline nationally. In other words, whatever effect Cicilline or his administration might have had on the crime rate, national forces were likely at work as well.

A few other issues complicate this analysis. For example, Cicilline is talking about the crime rate when the number his administration is using is the total number of crime reports, which is different. But when we looked closely, we found that those issues didn't actually affect the conclusion. For a discussion of those factors, CLICK HERE.

In the end, the number of incidents of crime in Providence has declined since Cicilline took office and the number of incidents reported in 2009 is the lowest in 44 years, which makes the mayor's claim seem modest.

Even though the ebb and flow of crime reports roughly mirrors what's been going on in the rest of the nation, and it's not clear how much he or his administration is directly responsible for a rate that began dropping during the second Cianci administration, we rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/19/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-providence-crime-rate-lowest-30-yea/

Did tax law produce virtually no new business investment, as Joe Biden said?
","Former Vice President Joe Biden — a possible 2020 presidential contender — criticized the Republican tax law signed by President Donald Trump. Biden suggested that the law did not have a big enough impact on the economy to justify its costs, which include a reduction in federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. ""You saw what happened, all the news about the massive tax cut,"" Biden said at an event at the Broward Center for Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ""There was virtually no new business investment."" Biden indicated that he had predicted that companies would follow this course, and he added, ""The bulk was used to buy back their own stock."" We decided to take a look at both parts of Biden’s statement. Economists say the amount of business investment hasn't skyrocketed, but they added that Biden was leaving out some important context. Biden’s office pointed us to a Wall Street Journal news article published Dec. 22, 2018. The article cited only ""modest"" investment after the tax law was passed. Biden’s remark ""is a little bit misleading in the sense that it creates an impression that investments have not grown in businesses over the last year to year and a half,"" said Charles C.Y. Wang, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. ""In fact, the data shows that business investment has grown rapidly from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018."" Indeed, a National Association for Business Economics survey published in January 2019 found that the the tax law had an impact on the goods-producing sector. Half of survey respondents in this sector reported increased investments at their companies. And a monthly survey of small businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business found that over the course of 2018, the percent of companies making a capital expenditure was higher in 2018 than in the same month in 2017 in seven months, and lower in only two. That said, there are signs that the overall increase has been low. The quarterly poll by the National Association for Business Economics found that 84 percent of firms surveyed said the tax law had not changed their hiring or investment plans. That was similar to the 81 percent in the previous survey, released in October 2018. And Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said it's hard to disentangle the impact of the energy markets on this investment from the impact of the tax law. This view receives some support from a paper by Harvard University economist Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. ""Overall, business fixed investment has grown much faster in the first three quarters of 2018 than it did in previous years … but much of this is due to the 22.8 percent annual rate increase in oil and mining equipment and structures,"" Furman wrote. ""Excluding these, investment picked up meaningfully but by a more modest amount."" There’s another important caveat: Not all investment will come immediately. ""Just like when we had our last stimulus package and it was a surprise to some that there are really very few ‘shovel ready’ government projects, most businesses were not just sitting around unable to invest because they had no capital,"" said Jeff Hoopes, an accounting professor at the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School. ""In the past five years, the cost of capital was extremely low, and many businesses who wanted to expand or invest would have been able to do so by borrowing if they wanted. I would expect the investment effect of tax reform to happen over much longer time periods than over the few months most people are examining."" Here, too, there's some hard data that stock buybacks have increased, but the assertion glosses over some nuances. Stock buybacks refer to a practice of companies buying back shares from shareholders. The company will pay fair market value to the shareholders, essentially becoming a way to distribute cash to shareholders. Biden’s office pointed to news coverage of 2018 setting a record for the volume of stock buybacks — upwards of $1 trillion. But economists expressed caution about jumping to conclusions. First, it’s important to note that $1 trillion in stock buybacks and the $1.5 trillion cost of the tax bill are apples and oranges. The tax law was projected to produce tax savings of $150 million in the first year, far less than the the $1 trillion in stock buybacks. ""It is not right to treat a 10-year tax cut as though this was all money that businesses would see in 2018,"" Baker said. Second, research has found that the record-setting stock buyback figure was heavily influenced by a small number of companies. While stock buybacks did increase, a large percentage was due to a limited number of companies, led by one monster buyback, by Apple, according to the research by Hoopes and two co-authors, Joel Slemrod and Michelle Hanlon. ""We find a general increase in share repurchases following the passage of the (tax law), but the increase is extremely concentrated in a small number of firms,"" the researchers wrote. ""We find only nine firms that announced a new share repurchase plan explicitly attributed the new plan to the"" tax law. Finally, ""buybacks have been increasing for a long time,"" Hoopes said. ""There is no discrete jump in the number of firms buying back shares because of tax reform."" Biden said, ""There was virtually no new business investment"" after the 2017 tax law. ""The bulk was used to buy back their own stock."" Economists agree that business investment after the tax law has been underwhelming, but it was an exaggeration for Biden to say there was virtually none. Investment did increase, especially in the goods-producing sector. As for stock buybacks, a new record was set in 2018, but research suggests that it was driven by particularly large buybacks by a small number of firms, rather than a broad swath of companies. This casts doubt on Biden’s contention that the buybacks consumed ""the bulk"" of the tax law’s proceeds.

Chico’s soda tax swipe at Mendoza falls flat
","Negative ads are a staple of politics, but a new one from Chicago mayoral candidate Gery Chico slaps at not just one of his rivals but three. ""In Springfield, Susana Mendoza voted to hit working families with a massive new soda tax,"" a narrator says. ""Two years later, Mendoza voted for billions in new income taxes on the middle class, but she voted to raise her own pay twice. Toni Preckwinkle’s soda taxes, sales and new parking taxes will force more families out. And Bill Daley’s commuter tax is a job killer."" That’s a lot packed into just 30 seconds, and in the spirit of succinctness we can say Chico is playing fast and loose with his scattershot accusations. The attack on Preckwinkle is a prediction for the future based in part on a tax that has been repealed. As for Daley’s so-called commuter tax, we’ve already rated Mostly False a similar claim from Mendoza. And, for the record, Daley has never endorsed such an idea. That brings us to the soda tax charge levelled against Mendoza, who is currently the state comptroller but once was a member of the Illinois House. It intrigued us because we had never heard of a soda tax being proposed at the state level. First, some context for the term ""soda tax,"" a phrase likely to elicit strong reactions from Chicago area voters in the wake of Cook County’s short-lived and much-maligned tax on sweetened beverages. That’s the soda tax Chico refers to in his ad while blasting Preckwinkle, who helped the county board pass it  and became a prominent defender. The penny-an-ounce charge infuriated pop lovers when they discovered even previously free fountain drink refills were subject to the tax. Just two months after it took effect in late 2017, county commissioners repealed the tax. So Chico is seizing on a potent symbol in his attack on Mendoza. A campaign press release announcing the ad’s debut goes even further, referring to Mendoza as the ""Original Soda Taxer"" and accusing her of ""two-faced political hypocrisy"" for having criticized the soda tax Preckwinkle pushed. When we followed the citation in Chico’s ad to the Illinois General Assembly’s website, however, we didn’t find anything resembling Cook County’s soda tax. State records show the bill Mendoza voted for, in 2009, was a sweeping measure that both legalized video gambling in Illinois and funded a $31 billion capital spending program. Chico has, by the way, indicated he supports video gambling as a potential revenue source for Chicago to tap. To pay for borrowing costs to bankroll construction projects, the bill hiked taxes on alcoholic beverages, increased fines and fees for drivers, and imposed higher sales taxes on products like candy bars and soft drinks that previously had been taxed like groceries at a steep discount. It passed in the House with a bipartisan, veto-proof majority. Records of the floor debate show several lawmakers raised concerns about the bill, but none focused on the impact on soda sales. Prior to the 2009 bill Mendoza supported, which later was signed into law, about 2-cents in state sales tax would have been added to the purchase of a two-liter bottle of soda costing $2.29. The law hiked the tax to 12-cents for the same purchase, whereas the short-lived Cook County soda tax added about 67-cents. Chico said that as a state lawmaker, ""Susana Mendoza voted to hit working families with a massive new soda tax."" The claim follows a well-worn partisan script in which a candidate blows out of proportion a minor piece of legislation an opponent once supported. Mendoza indeed voted for a bill that imposed a modest increase in the cost of not just soda purchases but also candy, booze and other items. Had she voted against that bill, which passed with strong support from all corners, she also would have been turning thumbs down on major infrastructure spending, expanded gambling and more. What’s more, changing the tax rate for a handful of items is a far cry from creating a new tax specific to sweetened beverages. The change also costs consumers considerably less at the register than did the now-defunct Cook County soda tax Chico has compared it to. We rate his claim Mostly False.

GOP leaders' claim that Foxconn won't get a dollar of taxpayer funds without jobs is on the money
","It didn’t take long for political finger-pointing to begin following a report that Foxconn Technology Group was reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a $10 billion Wisconsin campus. As fallout from the report roiled Wisconsin politics, Foxconn on Feb. 1, 2019, said it will indeed build a liquid crystal display manufacturing plant in Wisconsin, following talks between President Donald Trump and company CEO Terry Gou. Back to the beginning In a Jan. 30, 2019, story, Reuters reported that Louis Woo, special assistant to Gou, said the company was considering moving away from the high-end display screens and would likely hire mostly engineers and researchers rather than the manufacturing workforce the project originally promised. Under the deal between Foxconn and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., the state will pay Foxconn up to $2.85 billion in cash over 15 years, depending on how many jobs the company creates and how much the company invests in the plant. The company also gets an additional sales tax break worth up to $150 million on construction material for the factory. Together with aid from local government and utility ratepayers, the total incentives are worth about $4 billion, in exchange for the manufacturing facility and up to 13,000 jobs. Reaction in Wisconsin to the news Foxconn was considering changing its plans was swift. In a Jan. 30, 2019, joint statement, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, blamed Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for the changes, saying his administration brought with it a ""wave of economic uncertainty."" We rated that Pants on Fire. A separate part of their statement provided another claim we want to check: ""From the very beginning, we looked out for the best interest of the taxpayers of the state,"" the statement read. ""Not a dollar would be paid out until jobs in the Foxconn development area were created. The incentive package is based on fulfilling the contract."" Are the GOP lawmakers correct that ""not a dollar would be paid out until jobs in the Foxconn development area are created?"" The evidence When asked for backup, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer offered this statement via email: ""This part of the statement directly refers to the state incentives that were agreed to in the contract with Foxconn in the EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit) zone. No state tax dollars are awarded with sales tax break. And the bench marks that were set for the incentive plan that Democrats criticize were not met as outlined in the letter to WEDC (Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation)."" She also noted that Foxconn fell short of its job goals for 2018 and, thus, did not get the related state money. Let’s break it down. Job-related incentives: In January 2019, Foxconn reported 178 full-time Wisconsin employees in 2018 as of Dec. 31, 2018 — 82 jobs short of the minimum required for the company to immediately claim state job-creation tax credits. Foxconn, however, can still earn credits for the 2018 employment by making up for the job-creation shortfall in future years of its long-term contract with the state. Sales tax break: Unlike the job-related incentives, Foxconn is already benefiting from state-granted sales tax break of up to $150 million. According to a 2017 Legislative Fiscal Bureau report, the Department of Revenue estimates that the sales and use tax exemption will result in tax savings of $139 million for Foxconn and its contractors. It does amount to money for Foxconn, but it is fuzzier. As the Fiscal Bureau report notes, in part: ""Since it is highly unlikely that Foxconn would locate in the state without the incentives provided under the Act, this amount should not be viewed as a state revenue loss."" Local incentives: In the statement, Vos and Fitzgerald framed their claim around state-based incentives. But that ignores another significant piece -- support provided by local units of government. The Village of Mount Pleasant and Racine County have borrowed $355 million so far in support of Foxconn. The local governments have spent about $190 million of that, with most of the money going for land acquisition. So, looking at all three, the ""not a dollar"" claim from Vos and Fitzgerald is a mixed bag. If you look strictly at the job-related incentives, the two are on solid ground. But their original statement refers broadly to state tax dollars. The company is already saving dollars through the construction sales tax break, even if it’s not considered a state revenue loss. Finally, while money borrowed at the local level may not strictly count as state incentives, it does amount to a substantial public investment in the project. And that money is already being spent -- a fact the claim glosses over. Our rating Vos and Fitzgerald said ""not a dollar"" in state taxpayer money will be paid out ""until jobs in the Foxconn development area were created."" While job-creation incentives have not kicked in, that only represents a portion of the state-level support -- and the company is already benefiting from the sales tax break on construction materials. In addition, the statement ignores costs to local taxpayers -- ones the company is also benefiting from already. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/feb/01/wisconsin-republican-legislative-leaders/gop-leaders-claim-foxconn-wont-get-dollar-taxpayer/

Has the number of Border Patrol agents quadrupled since 2005?
","Some Democrats say that sending more money to border security is challenging, given recent tax cuts, a $22 trillion debt and a deficit that’s going to be $1 trillion this year. ""We have to make budget choices, and I will also point out that, go back to 2005 until now, we have quadrupled the number of Border Patrol agents,"" said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., who chairs the House Armed Services Committee. ""We have built 700 miles of wall. We have drones and sensors. We have massively increased the amount of money that we spent on border security,"" Smith added at a Jan. 29 committee hearing. The U.S.-Mexico border spans about 2,000 miles and has barriers across nearly 700 miles; drones and sensors are also used to monitor the border. Has the number of Border Patrol agents quadrupled since 2005? No. The number has increased substantially, but not by as much as Smith claimed. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has online data on Border Patrol staffing by fiscal year, from 1992 to 2017. In 2005, there were about 11,300 Border Patrol agents nationwide. Close to 10,000 worked at the southwest border. In 2017, there were about 19,400 Border Patrol agents nationwide. Around 16,600 worked at the southwest border. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact that it now has roughly 20,000 Border Patrol agents. It didn’t specify how many were at the southwest border, but historical data shows that the vast majority are sent to the southwest border. The nationwide number of Border Patrol agents peaked in 2011 at approximately 21,400 (during the 1992-2017 timeframe), but still short of quadrupling. Contacted by PolitiFact, Smith spokeswoman Rebecca Bryant said the congressman misspoke and that Border Patrol staffing levels are closer to doubling, not quadrupling 2005 numbers. The Border Patrol remains understaffed, despite the increased hires. It struggles to retain agents who see a lack of mobility and better opportunities elsewhere, according to a 2018 federal report. Smith’s remarks came as lawmakers are working on a deal to fund the government and avoid another shutdown mid-February. Trump wants $5.7 billion for a border wall with Mexico; yet Democrats are reluctant to provide that amount for a wall, favoring other security measures. Smith claimed, ""Go back to 2005 until now, we have quadrupled the number of Border Patrol agents."" Government data shows that the number of Border Patrol agents has nearly doubled, not quadrupled from 2005 to current levels. Smith’s statement is inaccurate.

No, New York abortion law doesn't let mothers abort babies a minute before they would be born
","On Jan. 22, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed abortion legislation that its advocates say codifies Roe vs. Wade into state law. The Reproductive Health Act, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Liz Krueger, says that a health care practitioner ""may perform an abortion when, according to the practitioner’s reasonable and good faith professional judgment based on the facts of the patient’s case: the patient is within twenty-four weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s life or health."" Previously, women in New York could only get abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy if their lives were threatened, according to Justin Flagg, a spokesman for Krueger. Under the new law, he said, women can also get an abortion after 24 weeks if their health is threatened or the fetus isn’t viable. That was the standard set by the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Flagg said, but the discrepancy between the state and federal laws ""meant that many women have been forced to go out of state to get necessary medical care after 24 weeks."" The New York law is part of a trend: In states where many people favor abortion rights, legislatures are moving to make the Roe vs. Wade standard part of state law.   ""With the signing of this bill, we are sending a clear message that whatever happens in Washington, women in New York will always have the fundamental right to control their body,"" Cuomo said. New York’s new law has alarmed abortion opponents, who see the exceptions of Roe — the health or life of the mother — as something that could apply to any pregnancy for any reason. The law ""will expand our state’s already radically permissive law, by empowering more health practitioners to provide abortion and removing all state restrictions on late-term procedures,"" said the state’s Catholic bishops in a statement. Online, abortion opponents have crafted many Facebook messages about the New York law. One post from Jan. 23 attacked it by suggesting it allowed murdering babies a minute before they would otherwise be born. ""I was born at 12:05,"" reads the text over a photo of a smiling infant. ""In New York, it is now perfectly legal to murder me at 12:04."" This post is not accurate, though it has been shared more than 5,500 times and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Is the post correct that women can get abortions the minute before a baby would be born? Flagg called such a situation ""absurd."" ""If a healthy baby is born at 12:05, the only thing happening at 12:04 is labor,"" he said. ""If it is a vaginal birth, the baby’s head would likely have been crowning for several minutes, and the labor itself going on for several hours or even days. In a caesarean delivery, the mother would have been prepped for surgery for some time."" But a C-section is not always possible, said Danielle Castaldi-Micca, vice president of political and government affairs at the National Institute for Reproductive Health, an organization that advocates for abortion rights. It’s possible the abdominal surgery would endanger the mother’s life or health, she said. Jen Villavicencio, an ob-gyn in the Midwest who provides abortions, said in a statement to PolitiFact that the post is ""inaccurate."" ""Abortions are not performed at 40 weeks on healthy, viable pregnancies,"" she said. ""Overwhelmingly, abortions that occur at this point in pregnancy are pregnancies where lethal fetal anomalies have been diagnosed."" In some cases, she said, complications aren’t detected or haven’t developed until the third trimester. Doctors may ask patients if they want to continue the pregnancy and deliver a ""nonviable fetus,"" she said, or have an abortion. There are situations where abortion is necessary to save the mother’s life, Villavicencio said. ""However, if a mother’s life is at risk and she is pregnant with a viable fetus, most often delivery is pursued, not abortion. The care becomes about saving both the life of the mother and the fetus."" Third-trimester abortions account for ""far less than 1 percent of abortions,"" she said. Data back that up. The Guttmacher Institute finds that ""slightly more than 1 percent of abortions are performed at 21 weeks or later."" And in a study of abortions in the United States in 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported that 1.3 percent of abortions happened at 21 weeks gestation or later. Finally, the New York law is codifying on a state level what already existed in federal law.   Our ruling The Facebook post oversimplifies and distorts what the New York law allows. The Reproductive Health Act permits abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy only if the mother’s life or health are threatened or if the fetus isn’t viable.

Conspiracy theorists peddle fake claim about the 1986 Challenger Space Shuttle disaster
","On Jan. 28, 1986, the Challenger Space Shuttle flight ended in tragedy when it disintegrated just 73 seconds after liftoff. Live broadcasts captured the space shuttle breaking apart and plummeting in midair. Children across the United States witnessed the event from classrooms, where they were seated before televisions, prepared to celebrate NASA’s first ""teacher-astronaut,"" Christa McAuliff. All seven crew members on the mission perished: Francis R. Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Gregory Jarvis, and McAuliffe, the New Hampshire teacher who had been selected to fly via NASA’S ""Teacher in Space"" program. President Ronald Reagan soon addressed a stunned nation from the Oval Office, calling it ""truly a national loss."" Unfortunately, conspiracy theorists have taken to making mockeries of large-scale tragic events. The same, it seems, with the Challenger disaster. One post, shared on Facebook on the 33rd anniversary of the accident, purports that the entire event was a hoax, and that crew members are alive and well today. The post reads: ""They didn’t die in 1986. I just found Astro-NOT Judith Resnik by searching Yale’s website just moments ago."" Pictures of the crew are attached, with side-by-side comparisons with their so-called dopplegangers. This conspiracy rumor – which claims that persons resembling the crew members with identical or similar names are still living out their lives around the U.S. – has been roaming around the internet since at least 2015, when other fact-checkers debunked it. The Facebook post also links a YouTube video from 2016 that highlights the doppelgangers while ""The Twilight Zone"" theme song plays. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is an example of conspiracy theorists combining a few suggestive aspects in an attempt to prove a monumental, and well-documented event, was faked. To say the evidence is not conclusive would be an understatement. The rumor’s only evidence is that at least six of the seven crew members (excluding Gregory Jarvis) have lookalikes with identical or similar names who are around the approximate ages that the crew members would be if they were alive today. There are a few problems with this thinking. First, most of these doppelgangers have very different backgrounds and were in very different locations, professional roles, and institutions than that of the crew members prior to the disaster. For example, Judith Resnik, who the Facebook post singles out. (""I just found Astro-NOT Judith Resnik by searching Yale’s website just moments ago."") But the Judith Resnik at Yale was teaching law classes at the school (and at USC) in the 1970s and '80s at the same time that astronaut Judith Resnik was studying and working in electrical engineering, and eventually with NASA. In 1985, law professor Resnik was writing papers for law review journals. In 1984, astronaut Resnik was on a space flight, making her the second American woman to go to space. The same woman couldn’t have been working different jobs, in different geographic locations, at the same time. This can also be applied to Richard Scobee, Sharon (Christa) McAuliffe and Michael Smith. Second, Onizuka and McNair’s supposed doppelgangers are the astronauts’ actual brothers, Claude Onizuka and Carl McNair, respectively. These are both real people and not assumed identities. Carl McNair, has given interviews about his brother, including one on Story Corps on the 25th anniversary of the Challenger explosion in 2011. And Claude Onizuka has paid tribute to his brother over the years by hosting the Onizuka Science Day for schoolchildren in their native Hawaii. Third, some of the lookalikes do not actually resemble the crew members, with different facial structures and characteristics, and seem selected to simply try to help prove the conspiracy. Lastly, for a major national conspiracy supposedly orchestrated by NASA, it is highly improbable the crew would be living openly, under the same names and with no physical disguises in place. We also found four of the crew members — Scobee, Smith, Onizuka and McNair — in the Social Security Death Index, which is not comprehensive, as the database includes most, but not all, persons who have died since 1935. ""The absence of a particular person in the SSDI is not proof this person is alive. Additionally, there is a possibility that incorrect records of death have been entered on the DMF,"" Ancestry.com website says. All four found, though, match the crew members’ dates of birth and death, and the states in which their Social Security cards were issued. A social media post claims that the 1986 Challenger space shuttle crew members are alive and well, and the tragedy was a hoax orchestrated by NASA. To suggest that NASA staged the deaths, for no particular reason, and then allowed the crew to openly live out their lives with no name changes or physical disguises is highly unlikely. Also, for something so out-in-the-open, it wasn’t noticed until nearly 30 years later. Moreover, death certificates and the backgrounds of the ""lookalikes"" directly contradict the core of the conspiracy theory. This false rumor disgraces the crew’s legacy and is based on assumptions loosely tied together. This is Pants on Fire!

Pants on Fire: Robin Vos, Scott Fitzgerald blame Tony Evers for Foxconn changes
","The size and scope of Foxconn Technology Group’s planned complex in Racine County is suddenly up for debate, months after the Taiwanese firm signed contracts with state and local officials for billions in public funding. Reuters reported Jan. 30, 2019, that Foxconn was reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels here and intending to hire mostly engineers and researchers, instead of the promised manufacturing workers. The next day, the Nikkei Asian Review reported Foxconn planned to suspend and scale back its plans for a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin — a report the company disputed. All that left Foxconn — a longtime political football — subject to a fresh round of kicks. On the day the Reuters story appeared, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, released a joint statement that took aim at a seemingly unlikely target: Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat sworn in a mere three weeks earlier. ""We don’t blame Foxconn for altering plans in an ever-changing technology business. It’s also not surprising Foxconn would rethink building a manufacturing plant in Wisconsin under the Evers Administration,"" the statement read in part. ""The company is reacting to the wave of economic uncertainty that the new governor has brought with his administration. Governor Evers has an anti-jobs agenda and pledged to do away with a successful business incentive for manufacturing and agriculture."" Is Foxconn really making changes in reaction to ""economic uncertainty"" created by the state’s newly-minted governor? Let’s review what we know. This was a fast-moving story, with different accounts of Foxconn’s reported leanings coming from different sources across several days. But in the middle of that, Vos and Fitzgerald made a very specific and concrete claim: that Foxconn was reacting to uncertainty Evers caused. When we asked Vos and Fitzgerald to back up their claim, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer noted a series of changes in Evers’ economic policy positions over time. But she said Republicans had no direct evidence connecting Foxconn’s changes to Evers or any action by the new governor. ""The leaders believe that is the case,"" she said. Meanwhile, Foxconn hasn’t explicitly laid out its current plans or the reasoning behind them — but several reports have pointed to market factors rather than political ones. Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou, voiced concern over the cost of making advanced TV screens in the U.S. due to labor expenses that exceed those in other countries, Reuters reported. The Nikkei story, citing unnamed sources, said plans are on hold due to the trade war between China and the U.S. and uncertainty over demand. Apple is of particular concern, as the top Foxconn customer announced a revenue downgrade this month due to lagging sales. Nikkei claimed the Wisconsin delay was ""as a result of negotiations with new Gov. Tony Evers,"" citing a company document. But its article did not quote from the document or provide additional details. In any case, Foxconn disputed the Nikkei report and spoke positively of Evers. ""The company remains committed to its long-term investment and creating 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin,"" the company said in a statement issued Jan. 31, 2019. ""All interactions to date with Governor Evers and his team have been constructive, and we look forward to further discussions as we continue to invest in American talent and broaden the base of our investment within the State of Wisconsin."" In addition, Mark Hogan, head of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., WEDC, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Evers has not sought to renegotiate the Foxconn agreement or to pursue any side deals with the company — as claimed in the Nikkei report. Hogan was appointed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who helped negotiate the deal. ""I have been involved with the Foxconn project from day one, and there never have been any side deals and the contract stands on its own,"" Hogan said Jan. 31, 2019. ""In addition, there have been no attempts by either the company or the Evers’ or Walker administrations to renegotiate WEDC’s contract."" Aside from what has been reported, there are many other things that undermine the argument that Foxconn is responding to Evers. Experts say it simply wouldn’t make sense for Foxconn — a major global player —  to take action in response to a governor who was just sworn in Jan. 7, 2019. ""It’s pretty clearly a partisan statement that doesn’t connect to how corporations work,"" said Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University. ""When Foxconn made this deal, they knew an election was coming up in 2018, they knew Gov. Walker could lose. These are all calculations corporations make."" Nolette said slowing iPhone sales and the trade war are more likely factors in what exactly Foxconn builds and operates in Wisconsin. The statement by Vos and Fitzgerald expanded on the ""economic uncertainty"" claim by pointing to Evers’ pledge to eliminate a business incentive. But studies show tax rates play a much lesser role in business investment decisions than market demand, supply networks, worker availability and transportation networks, said Andrew Reschovsky, professor emeritus of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin. What’s more, there are contradictory aspects in Vos and Fitzgerald’s own statement. Vos and Fitzgerald say they understand Foxconn changing its plans ""in an ever-changing technology business,"" but then blame Evers for causing changes. They say Foxconn is changing due to Evers, but then note Foxconn hasn’t pulled back on its pledge to create 13,000 new jobs. ""You can see kind of a disconnect there,"" Nolette said. ""They’re saying it’s Evers’ fault that the bad things are happening, but really things aren’t that bad because the contract is still in place."" Which brings us to an important point — the state has a signed contract in place with Foxconn. It establishes up to $4 billion in cash payments and tax breaks over 15 years in exchange for building the manufacturing facility and creating 13,000 jobs. Beyond that, if Evers did seek changes or side deals, Foxconn would not have to agree to them. And any re-negotiations on the contract would have to go through the WEDC board, which thanks to lame-duck legislation pushed by Vos and Fitzgerald, is controlled by Republicans until September. Republican leaders Vos and Fitzgerald said in a joint statement that potential changes in Foxconn’s Wisconsin plans are a result of ""economic uncertainty"" created by Evers — who has been governor for less than a month. A spokeswoman for Vos offered no evidence of that claim, saying merely that the leaders ""believe"" that is the case. Meanwhile, the evidence against the claim is steep: Published reports attribute the potential changes to an array of market and economic factors, including labor costs in the U.S., declining consumer demand and the trade war with China. Experts say those are historically the kinds of factors that drive business decisions, not politics. Foxconn’s lone public statement on the matter says talks with Evers have been ""constructive."" And the CEO of WEDC says Evers has not interfered in the Foxconn contract in any way. All of which makes Vos and Fitzgerald’s claim not only wrong, but ridiculous. That’s our definition of Pants on Fire.   ",/factchecks/2019/feb/01/wisconsin-republican-legislative-leaders/robin-vos-scott-fitzgerald-have-no-business-blamin/

Warren: Top 0.1% own about as much as the bottom 90%
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s plan to tax the wealthiest Americans has drawn immediate fire. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, himself a potential presidential candidate, called it a ridiculous plan that would never be passed. Warren, D-Mass., fired back. ""What's ‘ridiculous’ is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else,"" Warren tweeted Jan. 29. ""The top 0.1 percent, who'd pay my #UltraMillionaireTax, own about the same wealth as 90 percent of America."" What's “ridiculous” is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. The top 0.1%, who'd pay my #UltraMillionaireTax, own about the same wealth as 90% of America. It's time for change. https://t.co/D04G5fNvpa The top 0.1 percent is fewer than 200,000 families. The bottom 90 percent? About 110 million households. Warren would put a 2 percent tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 3 percent tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. Do people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos ($160 billion) and Bill Gates ($97 billion) and the rest of the uber-wealthy own as big a piece of the pie as Warren said? For sure, they own a hugely disproportionate share, but estimates vary as to how much. Wealth is often confused with income, and while the two often go hand in hand, they are different. Income is how much money a person makes from a job or investments. Wealth is the value of everything a person owns after factoring in debt. The equity in a home, retirement savings and bank accounts, for example, are part of a person’s wealth. There are several ways to measure wealth in America, and none of them are perfect. Warren’s figure comes from an analysis by economists Emmanuel Saez at Stanford University and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California-Berkeley. Saez and Zucman sent Warren a letter with their estimate of how much revenue her tax plan would raise. They wrote that the top 0.1 percent own about 20 percent of all the nation’s wealth. The bottom 90 percent own about 25 percent. Mortgages, credit card and student debt, they said, take a bite out of the net worth of most American families. That backs up Warren’s statement that the people at the very top own ""about the same"" as the bottom 90 percent. But another credible study found a somewhat smaller share of wealth held by the ultra rich. A group of economists from the Federal Reserve and the University of Pennsylvania found that in 2013, the top 0.1 percent held about 15 percent of the wealth. That’s about five percentage points less than what Warren referenced. When we compared the data from both studies (we had full spreadsheets from each), the Saez-Zucman estimates tend to show the wealthy owning a little more and the rest of the population owning a little less than the Federal Reserve group found. The Federal Reserve group’s results for 2013 involved adjusting the standard survey data the central bank typically reports. (There is more recent data for 2016, but it is unadjusted and does not speak to the wealth of the top 0.1 percent.) One reason for the differences in the two studies is they used different methods. The Federal Reserve group started with the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finance and then added in data the survey misses. Saez and Zucman worked with tax return data. Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. But while estimates vary, there’s no disagreement over the broader trend. ""In all of the estimates discussed here, top wealth shares in the United States are very high and increasing over time,"" the Federal Reserve-University of Pennsylvania group wrote in their 2016 article. All results should be read with care because seemingly small changes will change the percentages a bit. For example, when Saez and Zucman look at individuals, rather than families or tax units, their numbers become closer to the Federal Reserve group’s results. Warren said that the top 0.1 percent of the people own about the same as the bottom 90 percent. She relied on a letter from two economists who spoke broadly of the top 0.1 percent holding 20 percent of the wealth, while the bottom 90 percent own about 25 percent. On that basis, the two numbers are about the same. But another study found that the top 0.1 percent owned about 15 percent of all household wealth, while the bottom 90 percent owned 29 percent. That still represents a a lot of wealth in the hands of a tiny fraction of families, but it’s harder to say the amounts held by the two groups are about the same.

"['Bankruptcy', 'Health Care', 'Florida', 'José Oliva']","
Is health care the top reason for bankruptcies, as a Florida GOP leader said?
","Health care is a top reason that Americans are saddled with debt, said Florida House Speaker José Oliva, R-Miami Lakes. ""The two issues that Floridians and Americans are most controlled by nowadays financially are their health care, No. 1 reason for bankruptcy, and student loans, No. 1 debt for young people,"" Oliva told reporters during the Associated Press’s legislative day Jan. 30.   Oliva stated that the only way to curb rising health care costs is to allow more competition in the free market. The Republican-led Legislature has rejected Medicaid expansion, which is a part of the Affordable Care Act. We found that it isn’t so simple to determine if health care is the top reason for Americans to declare bankruptcy. It’s tough to tease out the single-most factor in bankruptcies, because people can find themselves in debt for multiple reasons at once. But medical bills and illnesses can play a role in bankruptcy, including when people can’t work as a result of their health. There are a few key studies about the extent to which medical bills and illnesses factor into bankruptcy. Oliva’s spokesman also cited studies about the financial burden of medical debt, but we will focus on the research specifically about bankruptcies. Medical bankruptcy was a frequent Democratic talking point around the discussion of the Affordable Care Act. In 2009, President Barack Obama said, ""The cost of health care now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds."" Democrats in the Senate, including Hillary Clinton and Chris Dodd, made statements about the percentage of bankruptcies attributed to medical issues. The research has drawn a lot of attention because key research was co-written by Elizabeth Warren, then of Harvard Law School and now a U.S. senator running for president. In a 2005 paper, Warren, along with David Himmelstein, then at Harvard Medical School, found that that 28.3 percent of bankruptcies were attributed to illness or injury alone based on 2001 data. But that number grew to 46.2 percent when researchers asked about additional factors such as unpaid medical bills, lost income due to illness, or the mortgage of a home to pay medical bills. The researchers interviewed about 900 people who had filed for bankruptcy and examined bankruptcy records. They updated their research in a paper in 2009 and found for 62 percent of people, illness or medical bills contributed to their bankruptcy. Researchers designated bankruptcies as medical based on debtors’ stated reasons for filing, income loss due to illness, and the magnitude of their medical debts. (Oliva’s spokesman, Fred Piccolo, included this study among several he sent to PolitiFact but said the 62 percent figure was probably too high.) The Harvard research has led to years of disagreement between the authors and other academics. Critics of the research have said it relied too much on people saying their medical bills led to their own bankruptcies, rather than independent confirmation. David Dranove and Michael Millenson at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern analyzed the data and concluded that there was a causal link in only 17 percent of personal bankruptcies. ""It is insufficient to show that medical problems are associated with bankruptcy; one must also determine whether, and to what extent, medical spending causes bankruptcies,"" they wrote in 2006. Himmelstein and Warren pushed back, noting that an industry group supported the research by Dranove and Millenson. More recent research on the topic renewed the debate. A group of economists from the University of Southern California, MIT and the Kellogg School wrote an article published in 2018 in the New England Journal of Medicine, ""Myth and Measurement: The case of medical bankruptcies.""  Using data on California adults from 2003 to 2007, they found that hospitalizations caused only 4 percent of personal bankruptcies among adults. The researchers acknowledged this didn’t cover all potential bankruptcies from illnesses or injuries that did not lead to hospitalization, or from hospitalizations of children or senior citizens. In an interview with PolitiFact, Himmelstein zeroed in on those caveats, saying that it led to a big underestimate in bankruptcies. ""Families can drown in medical debts without a hospitalization — they may spend hours in an emergency department after an accident, followed by months of physical therapy, or have chronic conditions requiring drugs costing tens of thousands of dollars,"" Himmelstein and his co-authors wrote in a response to the 2018 study. Neale Mahoney, a University of Chicago economics professor, said that the research by Warren and her co-authors overstates the share of bankruptcies caused by health shocks. One problem is that those who file for bankruptcy may attribute it to health problems, while downplaying other factors such as financial mismanagement. On the other hand, the California study understates the impact of health shocks on personal bankruptcy because it only looks at hospital admissions. ""More broadly, I think determining exactly what causes bankruptcy is difficult, because bankruptcy typically has multiple causes — overborrowing, job loss, health shocks, and so on,"" he said. ""That being said, I think Jose Oliva's statement is not outside of the range supported by the research literature."" We interviewed two other professors who said that the 62 percent figure is too high and that the 4 percent figure is probably closer to the truth: Craig Garthwaite, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern and Martin Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University. ""That doesn’t mean that health care expenses don’t cause people financial hardship — they do,"" Gaynor said. ""It just means that (medical issues are) not responsible for nearly as large a percentage of bankruptcies as some people have been claiming."" Oliva said that health care is the ""No. 1 reason for bankruptcy."" Research in 2009 found that in 62 percent of cases, medical illnesses or bills contributed to bankruptcy, based on surveys of the people who declared bankruptcy. But other academics have disagreed with that conclusion, particularly those who are wary that people tend to blame financial problems on illness when there are other reasons as well. A paper published in 2018 concluded that adult hospitalizations caused 4 percent of personal bankruptcies, but that data also has limitations. It is difficult to pinpoint a top reason for bankruptcies because multiple factors could collide, causing someone’s debt to mount and leading to bankruptcy. Researchers are still debating how different issues contribute. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2019/jan/31/jose-oliva/health-care-top-reason-bankruptcies-florida-gop-le/

Are paychecks failing to keep up with inflation?
","Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., hit a lot of subjects during her campaign launch event in Oakland, Calif., on Jan. 27, from criminal justice to education to health care. At one point in her speech, Harris addressed the state of the economy. ""Let’s speak truth about our economy,"" Harris said. ""Our economy today is not working for working people. The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren’t keeping up."" (Watch it here around 1:21:00.) Is Harris’s assertion about wages accurate? Broadly, no. Wages haven’t soared over the past 40 years — or over the past five — but they haven’t fallen behind inflation, either. When we contacted the Harris campaign, they offered news articles and studies that they said supported their position. However, most of this evidence for lagging paychecks was for particular slices of time and doesn’t reflect the overall trend. Wages, once adjusted for inflation, have gone up both in the recent past and the longer term. For economists, the primary statistic for measuring wages is median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, age 16 and up. (""Real"" is economic-speak for ""inflation-adjusted."") The following chart shows how that this measurement of wages has risen and fallen every quarter since 1979: It’s important to note that median wage growth has hardly been robust over the full four-decade span — workers experienced a gain of 6 percent above inflation. The financial crisis of 2008 had a big impact on Americans’ sense of economic security. But it’s wrong to say that wages haven’t outpaced inflation. The increase has been particularly clear since 2014, which was when wages finally began climbing again after the losses of the Great Recession. Between the second quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2018, inflation-adjusted wages rose by almost 8 percent, the data show. And wage gains have exceeded inflation for lower-income workers as well as higher-income workers, economists said. Another measurement — average weekly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees, adjusted for inflation — shows wages are also up in the shorter and longer term. It’s also consistent with annual rises after 2014 in median household income, a different statistical measurement. All in all, various data sources agree that ""paychecks are keeping up with inflation,"" said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the jobs site Indeed.com. One subset of the workforce does fit Harris’ description: Male workers in the lower half of the income spectrum. They account for a bit more than a quarter of the workforce. A tool created by the liberal Economic Policy Institute allows users to slice and dice federal wage data in a variety of ways. On the suggestion of Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless, we looked at real hourly wages for working men at or below the median. The following chart shows wages at the 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th and median percentiles. This chart shows that lower-earning male workers have seen their inflation-adjusted wages fall since 1973. Any real wage gains in 2018, which are not yet available, are unlikely to have been large enough to erase the decline since 1973, Burtless said. That said, even these workers have seen their wages rise above the rate of inflation since at least 2014, following steep declines from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Burtless said that this wage stagnation among lower-income men has been more than balanced out by gains among lower-income working women, which is why median wages overall have been rising. ""Viewed over the long time span, Sen. Harris’s claim is correct for important segments of the working population,"" Burtless said. ""However, for wage earners more generally, the claim is wrong. Workers up and down the wage distribution have seen gains in real hourly pay since 1979, since 2000, and since 2014."" Harris said, ""The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren't keeping up."" Overall, wages have hardly skyrocketed, but they have risen faster than inflation since 1979, and especially since 2014. One subset of workers — men in the lower end of the wage spectrum — has seen their pay fail to keep up with inflation since 1973. However, Harris used general terms in her speech. We rate the statement Mostly False. Editor's note: We heard from several readers who disagreed with or had questions about this rating.

GOP official falsely says Bladen voters didn't call NC elections board about absentee ballots
","Despite an investigation into North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District race results, the state GOP believes Republican Mark Harris should be declared the victor. Unofficial results put Harris 905 votes ahead of Democrat Dan McCready, and the NC GOP says the alleged tampering is so minimal that no one called to complain. Dallas Woodhouse, the party’s executive director, recently pointed to the state elections board’s attempt to collect tips from voters in Bladen County. Before Election Day, the state elections board mailed letters to Bladen County voters who requested absentee by-mail ballots. The letters reminded voters, ""Elections officials will never come to your house to pick up your absentee ballot or tell you how to vote,"" and asked those with tips to call the board. On Jan. 17, Woodhouse tweeted about what he referred to as ""huge news"" about the investigation. The elections board ""sent (a) letter to every person requesting a mail ballot in Bladen, (but) received no calls to the hotline number provided,"" Woodhouse tweeted on Jan. 17. Is it true that no one from Bladen County called the state elections board with tips? No. Here’s how the mix-up happened. A FACEBOOK POST When Woodhouse tweeted his claim, he linked to the Facebook page of Stony Rushing, a Republican Union County commissioner. Rushing encouraged reporters to find out how many people called the elections board hotline — but he didn’t claim to have official information on the number of calls received. ""If the total number of calls exceed 905 votes (the number of votes Harris leads McCready) then let’s talk new elections,"" Rushing posted on Facebook. ""I will bet the total number of voters who called them before November 6th from this letter is less than 10 and closer to 0."" (This argument makes it seem like, to order a new election, the elections board needs to prove that at least 905 ballots were destroyed or altered. That’s not the case, as PolitiFact has already reported.) A REPORTER’S TWEET PolitiFact contacted Woodhouse by email to ask if he had information to support his claim that the board received no calls. Woodhouse responded by acknowledging his tweet was inaccurate, adding that he now thinks the board received only four calls. ""I believe Joe Bruno reported that,"" Woodhouse said in an email, referring to a WSOC reporter. But PolitiFact couldn’t find a tweet from Bruno that supports Woodhouse’s claim. PolitiFact found a tweet from Bruno on Jan. 17 stating that nine people called the hotline established for Bladen voters ""to report receiving absentee ballots they did not request."" Of those, ""8 calls were between Nov 1-3. 1 call was made Dec 7. NCSBE is not providing the voicemails left on the hotline, citing the investigation,"" Bruno added in a tweet. Patrick Gannon, a spokesman for the NC elections board, confirmed that the agency received nine calls on the hotline. He also repeated what Bruno reported: that the elections board can’t release details about the calls due to the ongoing investigation. OUR RULING Woodhouse said the NC elections board received ""no calls"" after alerting Bladen County voters to possible absentee ballot fraud. When contacted by PolitiFact, Woodhouse amended his claim, saying the board received four calls. Neither claim is correct. Furthermore, his tweet — and the Facebook post his tweet promoted — presents a flawed argument: that the evidence must show 905 votes are in question. That’s not the case. We rate this claim False.

Wisconsin Firearms Coalition misfires with claim against Evers, Kaul and Vos
","Protesters gathered in front of the Capitol in Madison on Jan. 12, 2019 to tell Gov. Tony Evers to keep his laws off their guns. Indeed, some carried their guns openly.

Along with Evers, a Democrat, its post cited newly elected Attorney General Josh Kaul, also a Democrat, and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican. Is the group right that the three are ""demanding"" red-flag laws in Wisconsin? And that such laws allow guns to be seized with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process""? About the laws ""Red flag gun seizures"" refers to provisions that allow officials to take away firearms owned by people deemed to pose a threat to themselves or others. Family members or law enforcement officials have to petition a judge to temporarily restrict a person’s access to firearms. The term comes from the idea the person’s behavior amounts to a ""red flag"" for danger. Since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018, a total of 13 states have put such laws in place. When asked for backup for its claim via a Facebook message, the Wisconsin Firearms Coalition responded: ""The Attorney General’s comments were in his inaugural address, the governor came out the next day in support of red flags, and Statewide media reports that Robin Voss is willing to look at the idea a day or two after that."" Let’s start with the elected officials. Positions of elected officials In his Jan. 7, 2019 inaugural speech, Kaul called for taking steps to make schools safer, and mentioned red flag laws as one way to do so. Of red-flag laws, he said, they will ""allow law enforcement or family members to go to a judge and ensure that somebody who is a threat to themselves or others is temporarily disarmed."" In a story posted Jan. 10, 2019 on the website for Wausau-based WAOW-TV, Evers backed Kaul’s position and was quoted saying: ""Anytime we have an ability to take a firearm from somebody who may not be able to handle a firearm because of various in-capabilities, we need to investigate that."" The same article included this line: Republican Assembly speaker Robin Vos said he’s open to considering a red flag law, but is concerned about the rights of gun owners.

But that line, especially, is a far-cry from ""demanding"" the laws be put in place. Vos communications director Kit Beyer described the speaker as a staunch Second Amendment supporter and noted he has said he is ""fearful of taking away anyone’s constitutional rights"" when it comes to such laws. On Jan. 22, 2019, in a response to Evers’ State of the State address, Vos was more firm. ""I promise you: Republicans will fight for and protect your freedom, from unnecessary red flag gun laws,"" he said. So, the group’s claim is largely on the money with Evers and Kaul, but mischaracterizes Vos’ position. The bigger picture There are bigger problems with the main thrust of the claim -- that the laws would allow gun seizures with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process."" Adam Winkler, a law professor and specialist in constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles, said red-flag laws require a neutral arbiter to order confiscation of an individual’s firearms. ""A judge has to determine that a person is a threat,"" Winkler said. That undercuts the central thrust of the claim -- that there is zero oversight. That said, affected individuals could have their guns taken away temporarily without the ability to defend their position by appearing in court -- if a judge finds the concerns raised are severe enough. After the temporary period ends, the judge can review the case. At this stage, the individual would typically be involved in a hearing. Winkler said the laws are controversial, in part, because of due process concerns. ""You’re taking away fundamental rights without participation,"" he said. ""American courts are reluctant to take away guns unless (an individual) has been convicted of a crime."" So, the thrust of the claim overstates -- by a lot -- the way the laws work. Our rating A gun rights group claimed ""Governor Evers, AG Josh Kaul, and Speaker Robin Vos are demanding ""Red Flag Gun Seizures"" for Wisconsin"" which would allow gun seizures with ""no proof, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process at all!"" Though there is some truth to the claim, in that Kaul and Evers have clearly voiced support, the group was wrong about Vos’ position. The claim goes well beyond the facts in stating there is zero oversight of any action under such laws. Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2019/jan/30/wisconsin-firearms-coalition/wisconsin-firearms-coalition-misfires-claim-agains/

Checking Howard Schultz's claim that 40 percent of Americans don't have $400 in the bank
","Former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz told CBS’ ""60 Minutes"" that he’s ""seriously considering"" a 2020 run for the White House. The self-described lifelong Democrat, who developed a reputation as a socially conscious leader while overseeing the coffee mega-company for 32 years, told CBS correspondent Scott Pelley on Jan. 27 that he would run as a ""centrist independent outside of the two-party system."" At one point in the interview, the billionaire reflected on the financial stresses that he says motivate him to run for the nation's top office. ""When I read statistics that says that over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank and only a crisis away from bankruptcy…this is what I think about."" The claim stood out as a stark description of everyday life in America, so we wanted to know if it was accurate. Our reporting found that Schultz’s claim is on the right track, although he overstated it a bit. This is not the first time we have checked a claim about American finances from Schultz’s shop. In 2015, Starbucks published an eight-page insert in USA Today explaining why it wanted to start a national conversation about race. It included this statistic: ""White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth."" We rated it True. It matched the latest net worth figures from the Federal Reserve System at the time. Schultz’s 40 percent statement reminded us of something former Washington Post reporter Hunter Schwarz said in 2015 before joining CNN. Schwarz said that 47 percent of Americans ""can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money."" PunditFact rated that claim True. As our colleagues reported, Schwarz’s statement was based on results of a nationally representative sample of American adults who completed an online survey in October 2014 by the Federal Reserve Board. When asked how they would pay for an emergency expense of $400, 53 percent said they would be able to pay essentially immediately, while 47 percent said they could not. But that’s based on a survey taken more than four years before Schultz made his statement, and the reporter’s statement was somewhat more precise. So, let’s dig in. We didn’t hear back from Schultz’s office about what he used as the basis for his statement. But the Fed has done its survey, in what is known as the ""Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households,"" each year since 2013. And the most recent results, released in May 2018, got coverage from NPR, CNBC, Forbes, Fox Business and other national media. The new survey, conducted in November and December 2017 with more than 12,000 respondents, found that: ""Four in 10 adults, if faced with an unexpected expense of $400, would either not be able to cover it or would cover it by selling something or borrowing money."" So, that isn’t direct evidence that 40 percent of Americans don’t have at least $400 in a bank account. But, based on the survey, the 40 percent didn’t have that much in their checking or savings; or, they said they would resort instead to borrowing or selling something to cover the expense. The Fed noted that 40 percent was an improvement from half of adults in 2013 being ill-prepared for such an expense. Two points worth noting before we close: • An April 2018 report by the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at George Washington University found that 36 percent of the population couldn’t come up with $2,000 within the next month to cover an emergency expense — a measure the report said is similar to being able to come up with $400 immediately. • Given the drop in unemployment and generally good economy, the figure might now be lower than the 40 percent cited in the Fed survey, Marquette University emeritus economics professor Abdur Chowdhury told us. Schultz said ""over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank."" Based on the latest survey from the Federal Reserve Board, Schultz is essentially on track: 40 percent of Americans said that, if faced with an emergency expense of $400, they would not be able to cover it, or would have to borrow or sell something in order to cover it. We rate Schultz's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/jan/29/howard-schultz/checking-howard-schultzs-claim-40-percent-american/
