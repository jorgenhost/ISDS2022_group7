McAuliffe claims GOP ticket says banning abortion is its top priority
","
Members of the Democratic state ticket gathered recently in Richmond for their first campaign rally an immediately labeled their Republican opponents as extremists. 
""The Tea Party ticket says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control,"" Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, told a crowd of about 150 at the Hippodrome Theater in Jackson Ward. 
The claim caught our attention. There’s no doubt that the members of the GOP slate -- gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, lieutenant governor candidate E.W. Jackson and attorney general candidate Mark Obenshain -- are strongly opposed to abortion. But have they really said their No. 1 goal is to ban abortion and some forms of contraception? 
We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for proof and spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to a comment Cuccinelli made at a February 2012 rally to support personhood legislation. The bill, which defined life as beginning at conception, had passed the House when Cuccinelli spoke but would subsequently die in the Senate. 
 ""It’s hard to believe we actually have to come and advocate for something as basic as life, but we’ve had to do it for decades and we’re going to have to do it for the rest of our lives,"" The Washington Times quoted Cuccinelli as saying. ""The fight for life is going to last for all of our lives."" 
Schwerin cited various press reports and other materials saying the personhood measure would lead to a ban on all abortions and forms of birth control that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. 
But this Truth-O-Meter is not about the consequences of personhood legislation. We are examining whether the GOP ticket has proclaimed that ending abortion and certain types of contraception is its top priority. So Cuccinelli’s comments at the rally are immaterial. 
There are plenty of instances when members of the GOP ticket opposed abortion. Cuccinelli helped muscle through controversial new regulations that require clinics performing abortions to comply with building code standards for hospitals -- an action that was criticized as a ruse to force clinics to close.  In a May 18 speech at the Republican state convention accepting the gubernatorial nomination, Cuccinelli called for ""defending those at both ends of life -- protecting the elderly from abuse as well as the unborn."" 
Jackson, the lieutenant governor nominee, has called abortion ""genocide."" And Obenshain, running for attorney general, has consistently voted to restrict abortion rights during his nine years in the state Senate. 
But when it comes to identifying the most important issue facing voters this fall, Cuccinelli has said it’s the economy. 
He was asked in a Jan. 3 radio interview on The John Fredericks Show how a Cuccinelli administration would differ from current GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell. 
""In some ways it would be very similar,"" Cuccinelli replied. ""Certainly the same top priority of focusing on economic opportunity would be the same in a Cuccinelli administration."" 
And in a May 7 news conference announcing his tax plan, Cuccinelli said ""as governor, job creation will be my top priority."" 
We asked McAuliffe’s spokesman if he had any other evidence that Cuccinelli and his running mates have stated that ending abortions and restricting birth control are their main reasons for running this year. 
Schwerin pointed to comments Cuccinelli made last September during a visit to Prison Fellowship, a Lansdowne-based ministry. 
""Start with the priorities. Work your way down: life, family, community, world -- a lot of ways to affect the ones at the bottom,"" Cuccinelli said. ""It gets narrower and narrower as you get to the top. None of those other rights matter a whole lot if you don’t get born."" 
Schwerin provided another snippet of a clip, this one from Cuccinelli’s appearance at a June 2011 conference of homeschoolers in Herndon. 
""And that’s where the candidate’s responsibility arises. You give a campaign purpose. My purpose was to fight abortion, to shrink government, to protect life and families,"" Cuccinelli said. 
That establishes once again that one of Cuccinelli’s key reasons for entering politics is to oppose abortion. But it falls short of a declaration by the GOP ticket of its No. 1 goal. 
Our ruling  
McAuliffe claimed the GOP ticket ""says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control."" 
A compelling argument can be made that members of the GOP ticket will do everything possible to restrict abortions and those actions could ban certain types of birth control. But McAuliffe went an extra step and put words in the mouths of his opponents. 
We rate McAuliffe’s statement False.",/factchecks/2013/jun/21/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-claims-gop-ticket-says-its-top-priority-/

McCaul said Obama admin. plans to reduce detention beds, releasing hundreds of dangerous criminals
","U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas warned of bad guys on the horizon while summarizing proposed appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security.

In his June 5, 2013, floor remarks, the Austin Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said the outlined spending would cover additional Border Patrol officers and continued operation of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which enforces laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration.

Plus, McCaul said, the legislation had ""funding for ICE’s 34,000 detention beds despite the administration’s plans to reduce the number and release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities.""

A flood of dangerous criminals?

In this context, ""beds"" refers to ICE regularly placing non-U.S. citizens ""who are apprehended and determined to need custodial supervision"" in more than 250 facilities around the country,

Congress has lately required the government to maintain at least 34,000 beds to house such apprehended individuals, though not all the beds are always filled.

Administration urged reduction in detention beds McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen told us by email that Congress mandated 33,400 detention beds from 2009 through 2011 before raising the threshold to 34,000 starting in 2012. In contrast, Rosen said that President Barack Obama had proposed to fund 31,800 beds in fiscal 2014, which begins Oct. 1, 2013. Homeland Security’s 2014 budget request says the cut would save $114 million, adding: ""This level of beds allows ICE to ensure the most cost-effective use of federal dollars, focusing the more-costly detention capabilities on priority and mandatory detainees, while placing low-risk, non-mandatory detainees in lower cost alternatives to detention programs.""

An April 12, 2013, Washington Times news article put the budget request this way: ""The president said he wants to reduce the number of illegal immigrants ICE keeps in detention from 34,000 to 31,800."" The story also said, ""Congress fought hard during the past decade to boost the number of detentions, arguing that those who were allowed back into the general population rarely returned to be deported."" The story quoted Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as saying the department believes it can keep all high-priority individuals detained with the lower number of beds, while making use of alternatives to track the other people in deportation proceedings, the story said.

So, the administration sought to fund fewer detention beds.

Detainees have included few violent criminals And was the result going to be hundreds of dangerous criminals let loose?

ICE officials did not respond to our inquiry about the percentage of violent criminals in detention nor did we come up with other current-day breakdowns.

But according to a Feb. 11, 2010, outside analysis, when the number of detainees surged more than 60 percent to 385,524 from fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009, few of them had criminal convictions. The study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that detainees ""without any criminal conviction doubled between fiscal 2005 and (fiscal) 2009,"" the study said, when they accounted for 73 percent of detainees. However, the share of detainees with criminal convictions reached 43 percent in the first three months of fiscal 2010, the study said, as increases in overall detainees leveled out.

Government released 2,200 detainees By email, Rosen said McCaul’s reference to dangerous criminals reflected on ""detainee releases for budgetary reasons,"" including felons, in 2013 that McCaul tabulated based on information he obtained from ICE’s director, John Morton.

During February 2013, the agency indeed released individuals who had past criminal convictions, according to news accounts and testimony, though few had felony convictions and most remained subject to immigration proceedings.

Public knowledge of the releases appears to have been spurred by a news story. On March 1, 2013, the Associated Press reported that Homeland Security had recently released more than 2,000 illegal immigrants from its jails--in states including Arizona, California, Georgia and Texas--due to looming budget cuts. According to the report, the released individuals--granted supervised release under conditions that can include mandatory check-ins, home visits and GPS devices--would still be required to appear for immigration hearings.

The story, citing ICE budget documents, said the agency had temporarily shuttered plans to release 3,000 additional detainees in reaction to intense criticism. The internal budget documents ""show the Obama administration had intended to reduce"" the average daily population of detainees from about 31,000 to 25,748 by the end of March 2013, the story said. Also, Rosen pointed us to an ICE document with those figures.

About two weeks after the news story appeared, ICE’s Morton testified to the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that he had 2,228 detainees released over several weeks from Feb. 9 to March 1, 2013 ""to other forms of supervision,"" according to a transcript. He said he acted for immediate budgetary reasons plus concern about the federal sequester that was set to trigger automatic cuts starting in March.

Also in February 2013, Obama warned that if the sequester hit, ""federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go."" PolitiFact in Washington rated that claim Mostly False, concluding that while U.S. Attorney offices would face cuts under the sequester, officials would have discretion in prioritizing cases notably involving, by and large, individuals yet to be tried.

Official: Dangerous criminals not among released Morton told the subcommittee that ICE’s releases did not include dangerous criminals. He said officials let out individuals ""who were not subject to mandatory detention and they did not pose a significant threat to public safety"" and, he said, each individual remained subject to deportation.

Seventy percent ""of those individuals released had no criminal record,"" Morton said. ""The remaining 30 percent were either misdemeanants or other criminals whose prior conviction was not a serious violent crime."" He closed his prepared statement by saying ""there are no mass releases of dangerous criminals under way or any plan for the future, just efforts to live within our budget.""

Questioned by U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, the subcommittee chairman, Morton said the released individuals included 10 ""Level 1"" offenders, in this case meaning crimes like aggravated financial felonies, Morton said, and four of the 10 were subsequently returned to custody. The six not returned to custody were not violent criminals, he said.

Morton said one ""Level 1"" offense occurred in 1979 and another involved the single father of a 5-month-old child. He said that in each of these releases, field officers made the decision ""and I'm confident that if I were to share these offenses with you, you would be better reassured that we are not out willy-nilly releasing serious Level 1 offenders.""

Morton said the released individuals included 159 ""Level 2"" offenders, including ""a fair number"" of people whose ""most serious offense will have been for a theft offense, for example petty larceny or shoplifting, traffic offenses. The largest category will be for"" drunk driving, Morton said, including some multiple convictions. He said 460 ""Level 3"" offenders, convicted of misdemeanors, were released, saying their crimes would have ranged from a single traffic offense, a single drunk driving conviction or shoplifting.

In May 2013, Nelson Peacock, an assistant secretary of homeland security, said 622 of the released detainees had some type of criminal conviction. In his May 6, 2013, letter to Sens. Carl Levin and John McCain, which McCain posted online, Peacock specified that there were 32 Level 1 and 80 Level 2 detainees released. He wrote, too, that 58 released detainees were re-detained.

At the March subcommittee hearing, Carter noted that the agency’s ""priorities for detention include illegal aliens who have not been convicted of crimes but otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety."" Morton replied that no such detainees were released. He also said he did not know how many of the released individuals had pending criminal charges.

Carter: ""How many were violent criminals?""

Morton: ""I am not aware of any violent criminals...""

Also at the meeting, Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, said that under federal law, the agency has had the authority to release detainees since at least 1952. Morton agreed, saying detentions are the exception to normal practices. ""We have limited resources,"" Morton said. ""Congress has directed a level of mandatory detention that focuses around mainly violent offenders and certain aliens; the vast majority of the people in the system Congress provides for consideration for release.""

Morton earlier said: ""Just to give you some perspective of it, there are 350,000 people in immigration proceedings at any given time, only about 34,000 of whom -- actually, in Alaska, some of the Border Patrol cases aren't even in formal proceedings -- are in detention. The vast majority of people are not detained by design. Congress has provided for their release on bond or a supervision. Immigration judges make those calls.""

Next, we circled back to McCaul’s office per Morton's testimony. By email, Rosen said the ""drastic reductions"" in detention beds in Obama’s budget request ""would inherently result in the release of dangerous criminals.""

Outside takes We also ran the congressman’s claim past David Burnham, co-director of the records clearinghouse, who said any reference to dangerous criminals being let go exaggerates the administration’s intent. ""There’s some rhetoric here,"" Burnham said.

Donald Kerwin, who directs the New York-based Center for Migration Studies, which describes itself as devoted to the study of migration, to the promotion of understanding between immigrants and receiving communities and to public policies that safeguard the dignity and rights of migrants and newcomers, pointed out by telephone that the administration has long said its focus is on deporting criminal immigrants and recent arrivals, which is what ICE says on an agency web page including a graph indicating that in the fiscal year through September 2012, 55 percent of immigrants removed from the country were convicted criminals. An Obama adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, touted the approach in a White House blog entry Aug. 18, 2011.

Kerwin speculated that the only way the administration would release a seriously violent criminal from detention is ""mistakenly.""

Our ruling

McCaul said the Obama administration, seeking to reduce the number of detention beds, plans to ""release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities.""

The administration has sought to shrink the number of beds devoted to holding individuals in detention, saying that would save money. If approved, this could lead to more individuals who face immigration proceedings not living behind bars. It also looks to us like the government is keeping its options open on releasing more immigration detainees if money runs tight.

However, we did not confirm any related expected release of hundreds, or even a few, dangerous criminals. The February 2013 release of 2,200-plus individuals didn't include violent criminals, a top administrator testified.

McCaul’s statement has an element of truth; the administration's budget request. But there doesn't appear to be any plan to release dangerous criminals. We rate the claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jun/21/michael-mccaul/mccaul-said-obama-administration-plans-reduce-dete/

Barack Obama says the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 'is transparent'
","
President Barack Obama has taken a lot of criticism from both friend and foe in the wake of recent disclosures about how the U.S. government monitors telephone and Internet traffic. 
He defended himself recently in an interview with Charlie Rose on June 17, 2013, making several claims in defense of government surveillance. 
The full discussion is available here, but one exchange in particular struck us as noteworthy. It involves the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a special court that hears government requests for warrants related to national security investigations. 
Rose: ""So I hear you saying I have no problem with what NSA has been doing."" 
Obama: ""Well, let me finish, because I don’t. … (The FBI has) to go to the FISA court with probable cause and ask for a warrant."" 
Rose: ""But has FISA court turned down any request?"" 
Obama: ""First of all, Charlie, the number of requests are surprisingly small, number one. Number two -- folks don’t go with a query unless they’ve got a pretty good suspicion."" 
Rose: ""Should this be transparent in some way?"" 
Obama: ""It is transparent, that’s why we set up the FISA court. The whole point of my concern before I was president -- because some people say well, Obama was this raving liberal before, now he’s Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney sometimes says, 'Yes, you know, he took it all, lock stock and barrel.' My concern has always been not that we shouldn’t do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances?"" 
We wondered whether Obama has justification for saying that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ""is transparent."" So we decided to investigate. 
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was established in 1978 to provide oversight of a system that many observers believed had been widely abused by prior administrations. National Security Agency requests for warrants must have certification from Justice Department officials that the target of surveillance is either a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power. These applications are heard by federal judges who serve on the court on a rotating basis. 
All hearings and decisions are conducted in secret. The public disclosure of the court’s activities is sharply limited, consisting of two sets of statistics sent annually in a letter sent to Congress -- applications for surveillance or physical searches, and applications for business records. 
According to the most recent letter, about 98 percent of the 1,856 applications for surveillance and searches in 2012 were approved outright, with one withdrawn and 40 others modified. In addition, the government made 212 application for business records. The government modified 200 of these applications, but none was denied. 
The letter doesn’t offer any details about what was contained in any of these applications, only the raw numbers. 
The White House argues that the statutes governing the court, combined with Congress’ oversight role, provide checks and balances that come as close to transparency as national security needs permit. And experts say there are good reasons for this secrecy. 
""If we required that the public be permitted to take a peek at these classified proceedings, we'd be giving that information to foreign powers and terrorists as well, which would be lunacy,"" said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who once worked for the Justice Department representing the United States before the surveillance court. 
Instead, Shadel said, ""we require transparency in the form of giving other parts of the government -- the judicial and legislative branches, who have different interests and different perspectives from the executive branch -- the power to peek at those classified proceedings."" 
Still, is Obama justified in calling the kind of disclosure the court makes ""transparency""? We asked a range of experts on secrecy and public access, and most agreed that Obama is wrong to take credit for any reasonable degree of ""transparency"" in the court’s operations. While Congress has a degree of oversight over the court, that doesn’t mean there’s transparency -- a word that we think the ordinary person assumes to mean a non-trivial amount of disclosure to the public and the press. 
""We typically don’t see the court’s opinions interpreting the Constitution or FISA, or its orders directing the government to do or refrain from doing particular things,"" said Nathan Sales, a law professor at George Mason University. ""On occasion, parts of the court’s opinions will be declassified and released to the public, but this is the exception to the rule. The FISA court certainly serves as an important check on the executive branch, but -- usually -- it’s not accurate to call the court ‘transparent.’ "" 
Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. For one of his projects, Harper has assembled a list of four tenets of transparency. The court, he said, doesn’t even meet the first and most important one of these -- providing authoritative sourcing for information. 
""The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s raison d'être is to prevent any information about surveillance from being made available – much less authoritative ones,"" Harper said. ""I don’t know of any plausible meaning of ‘transparent’ that encompasses the ‘oversight behind closed doors’ concept."" 
Freedom of Information advocates seconded this view. 
""Checks and balances may be related, but they are not the same thing as ‘transparency,’"" said Kenneth F. Bunting, executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition. ""A court system that has proceedings that are secret and makes secret rulings that are often based on secret interpretations of law cannot fit my definition of the word ‘transparent.’ "" 
We should note that Obama himself has signed a ""memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies"" about ""transparency and open government."" While this memorandum was intended to apply to non-classified government information, the court doesn’t come anywhere close to upholding the principles for transparency outlined in it. 
""My administration,"" Obama wrote, ""is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government. … Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their government is doing. ... My administration will take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use."" 
Our ruling 
Obama said that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ""is transparent."" We don’t doubt that there are good reasons for secrecy at the court, but if you’re going to operate a mostly secret court, you also don’t get to crow about how ""transparent"" it is. The president can’t have his cake and eat it, too. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-foreign-intelligence-surveillanc/

Senate record on appropriations draws Kingston’s scrutiny
","
The race for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Saxby Chambliss is in full swing -- at least on the GOP side, where at least four major hopefuls have announced for the seat. 
One of the contenders made a point of denouncing the work -- or lack of work -- carried out by the current Senate over the past few years. 
In a speech announcing his run for the Senate last month, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah said:  ""The United States Senate has not passed a credible budget in four years. In the past four years, it has only passed nine out of 48 appropriation bills.""   
""It has killed any attempts to rein in entitlements, reform out-of-control spending or reduce government interference in our lives,"" he continued. ""If we are going to turn America around, we have to start with the United States Senate."" 
Our fact-checkers have examined some aspects of this argument before. Last year, PolitiFact Tennessee found that the Senate had not passed a budget in three years. And PolitiFact Georgia recently found that with the exception of a few very, very short meetings, Congress had spent 66 of the first 100 days of the current session in recess. 
So now, has the U.S. Senate really passed little more than one-fifth of the appropriations bills that have come before it, as Kingston claims? We decided to track down the numbers and check out the claim. 
Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford responded to our inquiry in an email. The congressman’s statement was about ""regular order appropriations measures"" that should have passed for fiscal years 2010-2013, he said. The claim was based on figures from the Status of Appropriations Legislation charts for 2010-2013 maintained by the Library of Congress. 
There are 12 regular annual appropriations, or spending, bills that provide funding for federal departments and agencies. When those bills are passed individually, through the traditional committee process, they are considered to have gone through the ""regular order."" The 12 appropriations bills are included in the annual budget resolution. 
According to Kingston’s count, the nine bills that were passed were in fiscal year 2010, Crawford said. The nine appropriations bills were for: agriculture, commerce-justice-science, defense, energy and water, homeland security, interior and environment, the legislative branch, military construction-veterans affairs, and transportation-housing and urban development. 
We also checked the Library of Congress charts and found that Kingston’s count was accurate for the past four fiscal years. And in fiscal 2010, while the Senate passed nine spending bills, it did not pass regular order spending bills for financial services, labor/health and human services/education and the State Department and foreign operations. 
When lawmakers in the Senate and House chambers -- or even within the same chamber -- can’t agree on the individual spending bills in time  for the new federal fiscal year on Oct. 1, the bills can sometimes be lumped together in ""omnibus"" bills. In December 2011, the Senate passed an omnibus spending bill of almost $1 trillion that combined nine of the 12 appropriations bills. 
Before that, the federal government had operated throughout 2011 on a continuing resolution that maintained policies and program levels set in the fiscal 2010 appropriations bills. For fiscal 2013, the Senate passed another continuing resolution at the end of March, almost six months after deadline, to keep the government running. President Barack Obama signed the stopgap plan into law a week later. 
So what does this mean? Has the Senate been derelict in its duties? 
The Senate hasn't been passing individual spending bills, ""but I see this largely as a reflection of the majority's (Democrats) inability to secure the necessary 60 votes for passage given GOP opposition and willingness to filibuster the bills,"" said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political science professor at George Washington University. 
For Kingston’s argument, from a very far bird’s-eye view of the Senate, this is an institution that is having a hard time functioning under its rules during these times of political polarization, Binder said. Kingston is right to say the Senate is having a hard time, she said. 
But before criticizing this Senate too much, Binder said, we need to remember that this has happened before. In the 1980s, for example, the House and Senate passed none of the 12 spending bills individually but put them all into omnibus bills, she said. 
""Ultimately there are no innocent parties here,"" Binder said. 
To sum up, Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston said the U.S. Senate has only passed nine out of 48 appropriation bills in the past four years. 
Data from the Library of Congress, which tracks bill histories, show that his statement is correct. But digging a bit deeper into his claim -- and into history -- shows that this congressional stalemate that lingers over federal spending is not new. 
Also, while the Senate may not have passed its portion of bills, there are lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have prevented real progress on solutions to reduce the national debt and grow the economy. 
Kingston’s statement is accurate but needs more information. We rated it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jun/21/jack-kingston/senate-record-appropriations-draws-kingstons-scrut/

Rep. Dana Rohrabacher says Sen. Marco Rubio’s claims differ in Spanish
","
Has Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., promised one kind of immigration reform in English — and something else in Spanish? 
A Republican congressman from Orange County, Calif., recently accused Rubio of contradicting his pledge to put border security before legalization for undocumented immigrants. 
Rubio ""all along has been saying, 'We have to have border security first,’ "" Rep. Dana Rohrabacher told conservative WND Radio on June 16, 2013. ""And then, he, you know, when he gets on Spanish TV, he ends up saying, 'No, no. That will never get in the way' or, 'Legalization status isn't contingent on border control.' Well, this is outrageous, and no one should believe him."" 
At the heart of the claim, according to Rohrabacher’s office, is Rubio’s June 9 Spanish-language interview on Univision’s Al Punto. 
The eight-minute back-and-forth between Rubio and host Maria Elena Salinas made headlines across conservative media. ""Marco Rubio: In immigration reform, legalization comes first — ‘It is not conditional,’ "" said one headline from the Washington Examiner. ""Rubio: Legalization first, border security whenever,"" said another from Human Events. 
Other conservative media offered a different take, such as a piece in the Daily Caller: ""No, Rubio isn’t telling Spanish and English audiences different things."" 
Rubio’s own website says, ""The most important thing that happens on day one is that the toughest border security and enforcement plan in American history will be the law of the land."" 
Has Rubio told two different stories about the Senate’s immigration bill? 
Steps to legality 
What’s going on here? 
We watched Rubio’s Univision interview, read transcripts in English and Spanish, and scouted his past comments to English-language audiences, such as interviews on Fox News and the Rush Limbaugh Show. 
In each, he described the bill’s multistep process. The government must submit to Congress a plan to secure the border. No earlier than that, it may begin processing applications from immigrants in the country illegally to get provisional status, a process that includes fines and a background check. Only when that border security plan has been substantially implemented may immigrants with provisional status apply for green cards. 
But while Rubio explained the same plan to each interviewer, he also tailored his language to address their concerns. 
In interviews with Limbaugh and Fox News host Sean Hannity, he focused on steps that must be achieved before immigrants are eligible to apply for green cards, which grant permanent legal status. On Univision, he focused on the provisional status process that begins at the same time that a plan to secure the border is submitted. 
For example, he told Fox News host Sean Hannity in January that enforcement would need to be in place, not just at the border but also for the visa system and in the workplace, ""before there’s a path to a green card."" 
Hannity noted that lawmakers’ framework for the immigration bill ""said simultaneously."" Rubio explained: 
""Here is what happens, when you're undocumented, you have to come forward and identify yourself and you're going to be fingerprinted and have a background check done. You're going to have to pay taxes and fines and what you get is a nonimmigrant visa, a nonimmigrant visa, a work permit to stay in the country and you don't qualify for any federal benefits under that. 
""You don't get federal benefits. During the same time, they're going to have to stay in this process for a significant period of time. While they're in that process is when all of this security stuff needs to happen. After a number of years have gone by and the security enforcement stuff is in place, then the second phase begins. 
""Which would give the people an opportunity to apply for a green card, the same way that everybody else does, not the special way, which means you have to stand in line with everyone in line, and apply, and in essence we're giving people the opportunity to earn the chance to do this the way they should have done it to begin with. 
""That's why they say simultaneous, and when you're in the probationary period that's when this is happening."" 
Rubio had a similar exchange with Limbaugh in April, in which he walked the radio host through the different steps of implementation. He also offered such explanations to Bill O’Reilly, Lou Dobbs, and repeatedly to Hannity. 
That sets up this month’s Spanish-language interview. 
On Univision’s Al Punto, Salinas pressed Rubio on how he would attract 60 votes. He answered that he would earn his colleagues’ trust by making sure ""that the border is secure and that another wave of illegal migration doesn’t take place in the future."" 
(The English-language quotes are from Univision’s official English transcript, which we confirmed by watching the interview in Spanish.) 
Salinas asked him if he would abandon the legislation if lawmakers didn’t agree to strengthen border security even more. Rubio answered that he was committed to reform, but that the key to votes would be ""a reasonable measure … to secure the border and prevent any sort of wave of illegal immigration in the future."" 
Then came the exchange that set up the ""legalization"" quote that lit up the Internet: 
Salinas: At this time, the border is more secure than ever. There are 21,000 border agents, a 651-mile wall, more than 300 watchtowers. And the bill that you helped to write has even more funds for border security. So, what are the measures that you consider key for the Senate to approve the reform? What else do the Republicans want? 
Rubio: Well, the problem — not just Republicans. There are four, five Democrats who are also asking for it in the Senate. And the point is the following: What they want are details on exactly where those resources are going to be used because, yes, there are sectors of the border that are much more secure, but there are others that aren’t. For example, the area of Tucson, Arizona. So what they’re asking is that it not be left to the discretion of the administration or agencies, but that the law specifically says where and how those resources will be used so that there is no waste and that the errors of the past are not repeated. 
Salinas: And that can be done. Can you look for some type of … 
Rubio: Yes. 
Salinas: … phrase that can describe it in that way? Because we have to come up with something. At this point it’s the … 
Rubio: Yes, of course. Yes— 
Salinas: … Obama Administration, but in 12, 13 years when they’re eligible for legalization, many of those immigrants, we don’t know who will be in the White House. 
Rubio: Well, we’ll be clear. Nobody is talking here about preventing legalization. Legalization will take place. That is, the following things will come next. First comes legalization, then comes this border security measure and then comes the permanent residency process. What we are talking about here is the permanent residency system. Regarding legalization, a vast majority of my colleagues have already accepted that: that it must take place and that it must start at the same time we start with what has to do with security. That is not conditional. Legalization is not conditional. Now, and I repeat, we can do it, and that is the point, we must specifically spell out where will the additional towers go, where will the additional wall go, where will the additional fence go, where will the additional sensors be; to provide specifics about where and how the available funds will be used. 
So Salinas had asked about what might happen under the next administration. Rubio clarified that ""legalization"" would already be in place, distinguishing that temporary status from a later ""permanent residency system."" 
With Hannity and Limbaugh, he called that early phase ""provisional status"" or a ""probationary period,"" and emphasized instead the border security that would have to be achieved under the law before immigrants were eligible to apply for green cards. 
Rohrabacher, in his interview June 16 with WND Radio, attacked those distinctions, saying, ""This is just a lot of weasel words that Rubio and these people are throwing in. They’re going to legalize the status of people here illegally. Once they do that, that is an amnesty. And once they do that, there will be no border security improvements. It’ll all be a facade."" 
But Rubio emphasized his commitment to a bill that required border security. 
Our ruling 
Rohrabacher claimed on WND Radio that Rubio ""all along has been saying, 'We have to have border security first. And then, he, you know, when he gets on Spanish TV, he ends up saying, 'No, no. That will never get in the way' or, 'Legalization status isn't contingent on border control.’"" 
We found, instead, that Rubio has explained the Senate bill’s multistep process, starting with a border security plan, in his English-language interviews with conservative hosts. He clarified that immigrants would be eligible to apply for provisional status at the same time. 
In Spanish, he also emphasized border security, but explained that immigrants would be eligible for provisional status — ""legalization"" — before the Obama administration left office. 
Rubio emphasized different parts of the bill’s process depending on his audience — particularly what he described as happening ""first."" But his explanations described the bill’s provisions the same way, in both English and in Spanish.

Biden: Since Newtown, more American gun deaths than soldiers lost in Afghanistan
","
In the six months since a gunman killed his mother, six educators and 20 children in Newtown, Conn., gun control legislation has ground to a halt in Congress. In the face of political opposition, mainly from Republicans but also from some Democrats, the White House has readied a more limited approach in a package of executive orders aimed at reducing gun violence. 
Vice President Joe Biden outlined those measures in a press conference Tuesday, emphasizing that President Barack Obama will still press for a new law. In making the case, Biden said, ""Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. Pretty astounding. And Iraq, as a matter of fact. Over 5,000. That's no way to run a country."" 
Obama repeated Biden’s stat in a tweet. Readers asked us if the number was right, so we decided to take a look at his numbers. 
The White House press office told us that Biden was speaking about American casualties since the start of the war in Afghanistan. That number is 2,106, according a fact sheet updated daily by the U.S. Defense Department. Another tally, maintained by the Associated Press, shows nearly the same figure. 
Firearm deaths are more difficult to count. Biden relied on a database assembled by Slate, an online magazine. The numbers there come from average people who send links of newspaper stories about gun deaths in their communities; we found no duplicate entries. This approach is likely to undercount deaths, and it still shows some 5,176 fatalities in the six months since Newtown. 
The numbers back up Biden’s claim. In a span of half a year, there were more than 5,000 gun fatalities in the United States. In a dozen years, fewer than half that number of Americans died in the war in Afghanistan. Biden also referred to Iraq. Deaths there reached 4,422, according to the Pentagon. That’s higher, but still less than fatalities due to firearms in America since mid December, 2012. 
We should note that Slate’s statistics don’t distinguish among suicides, homicides, accidents and law enforcement actions. 
Also, Biden's comparison doesn't take into account that the deaths occurred in populations of very different size. 
When Biden said ""that’s no way to run a country"", that would take in the entire U.S. population. We calculated the death rates implicit in his claim. When you do the math for the 5,176 gun deaths and the population base is over 316 million, the rate turns out to be .016 per 1,000. 
To make the same calculation for American service fatalities in Afghanistan, we contacted the Defense Department to determine the number of people at risk. The total number of soldiers deployed in that country for Operation Enduring Freedom is a bit over 823,000. The death rate comes out to 2.56 per 1,000. That’s nearly 150 times bigger than the death rate by guns in the United States since Newtown. 
A similar calculation for Operation Iraqi Freedom yielded a rate of 3.97 deaths per 1,000. 
To get a longer term view of firearm fatalities in America, we went to a database run by the Centers for Disease Control. There we learned that between 2001 and 2010, the rate was .103 per 1,000. That’s higher than the rate since Newtown but still 25 times smaller than for the Afghanistan war. 
Lastly, it’s important to note that one expects deaths in a war zone. The gun deaths in the United States represent deaths during peacetime. 
Biden said America has lost more people to guns since Newtown than it has in the war in Afghanistan. He is correct that more than twice as many people died in the past six months as did in 12 years of fighting.

Florida Democrats link state's No. 1 corruption ranking with Gov. Rick Scott
","
Florida Democrats play up the significance of ""one"" in a Web video designed to get members fired up about taking on Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2014. 
A segment riffs off a clip of Scott saying, ""Florida won’t stop until we’re No. 1."" 
The words ""Um, right"" appear on the screen, followed by a newspaper headline typed over Scott: ""Study ranks Florida No. 1 in government corruption."" 
""No. 1 in government corruption,"" the text states. ""Yep, Rick Scott, you’re #1 alright."" 
Florida Republicans were not amused with the video for many reasons, taking particular issue with the corruption claim. (For the record, the clip of Scott was not of him talking about trying to make Florida No. 1 in government corruption.) 
We decided to check it out. Is it fair for Democrats to link Scott with the report on corrupt government officials? 
At issue is a study released by Integrity Florida, a nonprofit watchdog group, in June 2012. 
From 2000 to 2010, the study found Florida led all states in total convictions of officials and staff who broke federal public corruption laws. Florida had 781 convictions, followed by more populous states California, Texas and New York.  
During that time, for example, four Palm Beach County commissioners and two West Palm Beach commissioners pled guilty to corruption charges over several years, leading to it being derided as ""Corruption County."" 
Without getting into more of the nitty gritty of the report, we’ll note it included a disclaimer key to our fact-check on page 2: ""The public corruption conviction data included in this report is from a time period prior to Gov. Rick Scott taking office."" 
Integrity Florida included the line to discourage people from doing essentially what the Democrats did: misconstruing a correlation between the decade of corruption cases and Scott, who had been in office a year and a half when the report was released. 
""We were concerned about that kind of interpretation,"" Integrity Florida executive director Dan Krassner told us. 
The Florida Democratic Party stands by its video. Spokesman Joshua Karp directed us to a story by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald about Scott promising ethics reform with an executive order on his first day in office but not following through. Scott had pledged his administration would develop a plan for implementing ""all or certain"" recommendations by a grand jury convened by former Gov. Charlie Crist. 
""We feel that we have a strong case here given that the text of the ad is 100 percent true,"" Karp said, ""and the fact is that Scott has not addressed the problems addressed in the report."" 
But the video does not get into that degree of detail. It also fails to mention that Scott did sign two ethics measures into law this year. 
The laws give the state Commission on Ethics more power to investigate complaints referred to it, requires constitutional officers to go through four hours of ethics training and bans former legislators from lobbying state agencies for two years after leaving office, among other things. 
One more note: Florida is not universally considered the most corrupt state. 
A study by researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago examined Department of Justice data for corruption convictions across the states from 1976 to 2010. The broadened time period meant Florida ranked No. 4 in total federal public corruption convictions (1,762 convictions), trailing New York, California and Illinois. Per capita, Florida ranked eighth. 
Our ruling 
The Democrats took too big a leap by blatantly linking Scott with a report about Florida being No. 1 for federal corruption convictions. The report specifically stated it was looking at the decade before Scott took office. The juxtaposition in the video is misleading, leaving viewers with the wrong impression. 
We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2013/jun/20/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-link-states-no-1-corruption-rank/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Larson']","
Sen. Chris Larson says Wisconsin agency can't account for the creation of a single job
","
Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature created the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. to lead the way on job creation. 
The agency -- a privatized version of the old state Commerce Department -- is nearing the two year mark. And, according to state Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), there’s not much to show for the effort. 
Appearing May 19, 2013 on ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,""Larson said the agency was a mismanaged mess. 
""What we've done with WEDC is created an agency that has taken the worst of government, the worst of corporate, private enterprise and combined them, where they are spending tens of million of dollars, allocating it to whomever they see fit without legislative oversight,"" he said.  ""And the rare glimpses we get, show there's huge problems over there."" 
Larson added: ""I think the stunning thing about this, Mike, is that they cannot account for creating one single job over their two years of existence."" 
Not one? 
When we asked Larson to elaborate, he referred us to WEDC’s annual reportand a May 2013 Legislative Audit Bureau’s report on the agency. 
""The Legislative Audit Bureau pointed out that they cannot count and accurately say that they have created a single job,"" Larson said, adding that WEDC officials will  ""say that they created a whole bunch of jobs"" 
This path is a familiar one, though the last time we walked it from a different direction. 
We rated Half True a statement from state Rep. John Nygren (R-Marinette) who called WEDC a ""proven job creator."" The audit found record-keeping is lacking, but employers in Nygren’s northeastern Wisconsin district said that they added jobs after receiving tax credits and other assistance from the agency. 
Here’s what each report cited by Larson says: 
WEDC report: The report covers the first year of the agency. When it comes to measuring effectiveness, it looks to the future. 
""A total of 23,759 jobs in Wisconsin are anticipated to be impacted directly by investments made by WEDC in FY12,"" the report says. That means the agency expects that number of people will be hired in the future by companies that have received assistance. 
In all, WEDC made 287 ""awards"" worth $500 million to state employers in the first year of operation, the report said. 
Legislative Audit Bureau:The bureau’s reportsaid the agency had poor record keeping, sloppy internal practices and gave awards to ineligible businesses and projects. Additionally,  it noted WEDC has experienced severe staffing turnover, including with top leadership. 
The audit said record-keeping was so sloppy, they were unable to include a job count in their review: ""The report WEDC submitted in November 2012 did not contain all required information, contained some inaccurate information, and did not clearly present information about the number of jobs created and retained as a result of its programs. For these reasons, and in the absence of verified performance information, we did not assess the effectiveness of WEDC’s economic development programs."" 
But there is a difference in calculating an accurate total number of jobs and -- as Larson claimed -- not being able to account for a single one. What’s more, there are the accounting standards applied in by auditors, and there is the understanding most would be left with after hearing Larson’s remark: That WEDC has nothing to show for its work. 
In reviewing the Nygren claim, we looked at several companies in his district that said they added workers after receiving tax credits and other help from WEDC. 
Those three companies -- Precision Ice Blasting Corp., Vargo Tool & Die Corp. and Marinette Marine, say they added a total of 1,022 jobs of a promised a total of 1,076 in exchange for $28.46 million in tax credits.Under the agreements, they don’t get the credits unless they can show the jobs were created. 
So, it’s clear that WEDC has provided tax credits and helped companies win additional work and hire more people. It’s just not clear what the overall score card actually reads. 
Our rating 
Larson said the state’s signature jobs agency ""cannot account for creating one single job."" Larson’s correct in that the agency, or a critical audit, can’t quantify its effectiveness. 
But Larson’s statement suggests no businesses have been assisted by WEDC. And there’s plenty of evidence that’s not the case, starting with the employers in northeastern Wisconsin. 
Our definition for Mostly False is: ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2013/jun/20/chris-larson/sen-chris-larson-says-wisconsin-agency-cant-accoun/

Rep. Mike Rogers says the IRS scandal ""clearly showed some criminal behavior""
","
There’s broad bipartisan agreement that Internal Revenue Service targeting of tea party and other conservative groups was wrong. But was it criminal? Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., thinks so. 
During a June 16, 2013, appearance on CBS’ Face the Nation, Rogers said the IRS scandal ""clearly showed some criminal behavior that at least we know was back at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave."" 
While this sounds as if Rogers was accusing White House officials directly of perpetrating criminal activities, host Bob Schieffer pressed him on that claim twice, and both times Rogers denied that he was making that argument. Instead, Rogers told Schieffer that the administration has ""admitted that people in the White House knew about this behavior."" 
Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have concluded that Rogers’ overall claim is overblown. We wondered, though, whether Rogers was well-grounded on something more specific -- that the IRS scandal ""clearly showed some criminal behavior."" 
Kelsey Knight, a spokeswoman for Rogers, elaborated on his comments in an interview, saying the congressman ""believes the targeting of individuals for their political beliefs at the IRS broke the law. … The ongoing investigations will eventually determine who at IRS was actually guilty of criminal behavior."" 
First, let’s recap what the IRS scandal is all about. As we’ve noted previously, the IRS apologized on May 10, 2013, for singling out tax-exemption applications from groups whose names included ""tea party,"" ""patriot"" or ""9/12."" The organizations were seeking exemption from federal taxes either as charitable groups with IRS designation 501(c)3 or as social welfare groups, which are allowed to engage in limited political activity without disclosing donors, under IRS designation 501(c)4. 
Several factors offer complications for Rogers (and for us) in sorting out what went on inside the IRS. Congressional investigations are still under way, meaning that not all the facts are in evidence yet. In addition, Republicans and Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee have been releasing pieces of evidence selectively, in ways that advance their political goals. 
That said, the inspector general’s report that ignited the scandal doesn’t say anything about criminal behavior. So we checked with experts in criminal and tax law to see if there was something we were missing. Is a criminal case the slam dunk Rogers said it was? 
The experts we interviewed agreed that there would be a substantial bar to clear before a prosecution could go forward, to say nothing of a guilty verdict being rendered. The experts raised two key issues: 
The need to prove intent 
""The key element in any criminal case, in addition to satisfying the statutory requirements, is to establish intent,"" said Stan Brand, a veteran white-collar lawyer in Washington. ""That is typically the most difficult part of any criminal case, because it must be established directly through the acts or statements of the defendant or, more commonly, through circumstantial evidence and inference. … That won't be any easier in the IRS case than any other case."" 
Brand said he hasn’t seen anything yet that is clear evidence of intentional criminal activity, though he added that he’s sure the FBI and Justice Department are looking. 
What law would have been broken? 
Finding the right criminal statute to use for prosecuting the targeting of political groups could be harder than it sounds. 
Elizabeth Kingsley, a Washington attorney who specializes in the tax treatment of exempt organizations, said it’s ""a reach to even come up with a statute that applies, much less to find ‘clear’ criminal culpability. I suppose if the facts eventually came out to show that the special scrutiny of those groups was based on an intentional decision to subject certain applicants to harsher scrutiny because of an animus against their racial or religious identity, there might be a case to be made. But it would require evidence to demonstrate such an intent, and we have nothing like that so far."" 
David Weisbach, a University of Chicago law professor who previously worked as associate tax legislative counsel at the Treasury Department, agreed. 
""I'd be shocked if anything that was done was criminal, because there is no explicit statute on point, and because it appears that the IRS staff actually had quite good reasons for selecting the applications as they did,"" he said. ""Examining the political activity of these groups was their job."" 
Brand said that criminal civil rights violations could come into play ""if there was a plan or a plot to intentionally deprive these groups of their tax status based on their political ideas."" But it would have to be proven that IRS officials targeted groups for the content of their political beliefs, rather than on the possibility that they would act on those beliefs. 
Another possibility is the Hatch Act, which limits federal employees from taking part in certain political activities. However, the political activities restricted by the Hatch Act involve partisan politics, and while the tea party groups in question were conservative, they were not officially Republican. Because the key question in the targeting of tea party groups revolves around whether they are primarily ""social welfare"" organizations, rather than partisan organizations, ""it’s hard to see how any delay in processing their applications could be considered partisan political activity,"" Kingsley said. 
The laws that could most plausibly support Rogers’ claim are those that address perjury or making false statements to law enforcement, Brand said. But if those laws end up being broken, it would be as part of a cover-up rather than the targeting scandal itself, and in the interview with Schieffer, Rogers referred to criminal activity in the targeting itself. 
""Clearly, when the government in any way, shape, or form uses its power to intimidate citizens who are donating to whatever their political belief -- Republican or Democrat-- that's a criminal activity,"" Rogers told Schieffer. 
Our ruling 
Rogers said the IRS scandal ""clearly showed some criminal behavior,"" but the experts we interviewed were skeptical that such a threshold has been met, at least for now. Proving a civil rights violation would be hard, requiring evidence of officials’ intent to deny someone’s civil rights. More plausibly, prosecutors could go after officials for false statements or perjury, though it would be a stretch to call that part of the original targeting scandal that Rogers referred to on Face the Nation. 
In all, experts said Rogers’ use of the adverb ""clearly"" went too far. If anything, they suggested, ""murky"" might be a more appropriate descriptor. Not all the evidence is in, but Rogers is pushing the envelope well beyond what is publicly known today. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jun/19/mike-rogers/rep-mike-rogers-says-irs-scandal-clearly-showed-so/

Rick Perry says New York has ‘bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp’
","
Before Gov. Rick Perry took off for New York in hopes of luring businesses to Texas, he previewed his pitch in a radio ad. 
In the spot, Perry said, ""The new New York sounds a lot like the old New York: Higher taxes. Stifling regulations. Bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp."" 
We learned of the ad, posted online June 12, 2013, by Texas’ state economic development corporation, from a June 12, 2013, Dallas Morning News news blog entry, which said it had a ""slight inaccuracy,"" because convenience stores ""always were exempt"" from a New York ban on big sugary drinks struck down earlier in 2013. 
Are New York government officials getting between 7-Eleven customers and their self-serve plastic cups? 
Big Gulp, of course, is a trademark registered to Dallas-based 7-Eleven Inc. convenience stores, alongside Super Big Gulp, Slurp & Gulp, Super Slurpee, Big Brew and many others. Its size has varied from time to time; these days, 7-Eleven spokeswoman Margaret Chabris told us by email, Big Gulp denotes a 32-ounce fountain drink. For comparison, an ordinary soft drink can holds 12 ounces. 
Perry vetoed a measure June 14, 2013, that would have barred the sale of sugary drinks during class hours at most Texas public schools, saying current policy was adequate and the bill would limit ""innocuous"" beverages such as 2 percent milk. 
Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle told us by email that the governor’s wording was a play on ""Big Gulp Ban,"" a nickname for the anti-obesity proposal that New York’s mayor launched in 2012 to stop some sales of large sugary drinks, similar in spirit to the city’s 2008 ban on certain fats at restaurants. 
A May 30, 2012, New York Times news story said Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s proposal took aim at ""any cup or bottle of sweetened drink larger than 16 fluid ounces"" sold in food service establishments regulated by the city’s health department, unless the beverage contained ""fewer than 25 calories per 8-ounce serving."" Diet sodas, fruit juice, dairy drinks and alcoholic beverages were not covered, the story said. 
Under the measure, the Times wrote, fast-food and other restaurants, movie theaters, street carts and sports arenas ""would be required to hand out cup sizes of 16 ounces or less"" -- but not grocery stores or convenience stores such as 7-Eleven. 
Bloomberg spokeswoman Samantha Levine and 7-Eleven’s Chabris said the same, telling us via email that 7-Eleven would not be affected because it is regulated by the state, not the city. 
A May 31, 2012, CBS news story described the plan as Bloomberg’s latest tactic against sugary drinks, saying he ""previously supported a soda tax that was ultimately shot down by state lawmakers and, in 2010, proposed to ban people from using food stamps to buy sugary drinks, sodas and teas,"" an effort stopped by the USDA. 
Those earlier efforts could have affected convenience stores, but it appears the 16-ounce portion cap would not have. 
The city’s statement of purpose for the 16-ounce limit, published in the City Record on June 19, 2012, said, ""To address the obesity epidemic among the city’s residents, the Department proposes that the Board of Health amend Article 81 (of the city health code). The proposed changes would establish maximum sizes for beverages offered and sold in FSEs."" 
An FSE, or food service establishment, is defined in Section 14 of the city’s health department regulations as ""a place where food is prepared and intended for individual portion service and includes the site at which the individual portions are provided, whether consumption occurs on or off the premises."" The regulations specify that ""retail food stores,"" private homes and certain other establishments are exempt. 
A June 6, 2012, Times news story headlined ""At 7-Eleven, the Big Gulps Elude a Ban by the City,"" said the Big Gulp would be ""an important exception"" to the ban. 
Then again, the overall ban fell through March 11, 2013 -- blocked the day before it was to take effect by what the Times called a ""surprise"" ruling from a state Supreme Court judge. The city appealed the decision, according to a June 11, 2013, Times news story. 
Confusion over which businesses would be affected was a factor in the ruling, which said, ""This court finds that the regulation herein is laden with exceptions based on economic and political concerns"" and mentioned city health officials’ assertion that markets and stores ""including the 7-11 market chains and their famous, or infamous, Big Gulp containers"" would be exempted. 
The city health department backs up the Big Gulp exception in a ""Fact vs. Fiction"" document on its website, saying that because certain ""retailers, like convenience stores and grocery stores, are not regulated by the health department, they are not covered by the rule."" 
Bloomberg hasn’t given up on other ways to limit sugary drinks. He and other mayors wrote to Congress on June 18, 2013, with a new request to limit the use of food stamps for buying sugar-sweetened beverages. 
Our ruling 
Perry said New York has ""bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp."" 
City officials are trying to tell New Yorkers they can’t buy large sizes of sugary drinks at some establishments -- but they haven’t succeeded. Notably, the ban Perry referred to would exempt convenience stores.

"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'John Nygren']","
Rep. John Nygren says the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. is a proven job creator
","
Nearly two years after its creation, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. -- the quasi-private jobs agency created by Gov. Scott Walker -- has been criticized by Democrats for management turnover, failure to follow up on past due loans and other problems. 
Those complaints got new life in early May when the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau issued a bruising auditabout WEDC’s effectiveness.  The audit criticized the agency for poor record keeping, sloppy internal practices, and giving awards to ineligible businesses and projects. 
It also said there was no way to measure the agency’s effectiveness in spurring job creation, in part because WEDC failed to follow basic standards in state law regarding the clear and proper use of taxpayer money. 
WEDC was created in 2011 as the successor of the state’s Commerce Department with the idea that a private agency would be more effective at encouraging business growth than a state agency. The audit painted a far different picture. 
As lawmakers and Walker debated how to improve WEDC, support came May 8, 2013, from state Rep. John Nygren (R-Marinette), co-chairman of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee. 
He argued the agency needed more time to prove itself and said there should be no cuts to the WEDC budget because the agency was a ""proven job creator."" 
That caught our attention because it seemed to contradict the statements in the very audit that Nygren was responding to. 
When we asked Nygren for evidence to back up his claim, aide Jennifer Malcore said his statement was from ""a local perspective."" 
""He has talked with businesses in his district that have taken advantage of WEDC services and have increased their employees,"" Malcore said. 
That’s a narrow answer, and we’ll return to it below. 
But Nygren’s statement addressed the overall performance of the new agency. 
And that’s where we start to find trouble. 
About that audit 
For starters, even the auditors could not evaluate the effectiveness of WEDC’s job creation, noting this in their report: 
""The report WEDC submitted in November 2012 did not contain all required information, contained some inaccurate information, and did not clearly present information about the number of jobs created and retained as a result of its programs. For these reasons, and in 
the absence of verified performance information, we did not assess the effectiveness of WEDC’s economic development programs."" 
Likewise, WEDC did not cite a number for total jobs created in its 2012 annual report. 
Rather, the report said that in fiscal year 2012 -- which ended June 30, and covered the agency’s first year in operation -- WEDC provided 287 ""awards"" worth $500 million to state companies. The incentives included tax credits, bonding and grants and loans ""to companies that have or will go on to start, expand or relocate their operations in Wisconsin."" 
The report added: ""A total of 23,759 jobs in Wisconsin are anticipated to be impacted directly by investments made by WEDC in FY12."" That means that the agency expects that number of people that will be hired in the future by companies that received assistance. 
Nygren’s statement did not involve a claim of a specific number of jobs, or compare the performance of WEDC to the old Commerce Department. So it turns largely on how successful WEDC’s performance has been in specific instances. Since it is a new agency, it’s understandable that many of its efforts have not yet led to hiring, or will lead to jobs in the future. 
WEDC spokesman Thomas Thieding said: ""We don’t create the jobs. We help the job creators."" 
Yet the audit pointed out that WEDC needs to do a better job of following up with companies to see how many jobs were created. 
""Local perspective."" 
For the ""local perspective"" Nygren’s aide cited, his office directed us to seven companies. We spoke to executives from several firms, large and small. All said that financial and other assistance from WEDC was an important factor behind their decision to add workers. 
Here’s a synopsis: 
Precision Iceblast Corp. moved in early 2012 from Michigan to a building in the Peshtigo industrial park. The company deploys crews that use machines fueled by dry ice to do paint removal and other tasks, mostly in power plants and factories. 
Precision received $400,000 in tax credits and, in return, promised to create 64 jobs, under a contract with WEDC. 
In general the credits range from $3,000 to $7,000 per job, depending on the level of pay. Companies can also get credits based on a percentage of a capital investment they make. 
""If a company doesn't create the jobs they simply don't get the tax credits., Thieding said. ""The only way tax credits are approved is if a company meets the terms of a contract."" 
WEDC helped Precision find a suitable facility, and gave advice about expanding internationally, said Paul Lemery, vice president. 
""They did a lot of the grunt work for us,"" he said. 
Employment grew from 55 to about 70 now, and is on track to meet the employment goal within three years, Lemery said. 
""If it wasn’t for them, we would have just built in Michigan."" 
Marinette-based Vargo Tool and Die Inc. added a new facility and seven jobs in 2012 in Peshtigo after WEDC helped, said company owner Doug Vargo. 
Through WEDC, Vargo received $58,000 in tax credits and promised to create 12 jobs under an agreement signed in April 2013. The company also received assistance from the city of Pesthigo in the form of a tax district. 
The new building has a boring mill and a large crane that allows the company to bid on additional work, Vargo said, adding that he believes employment could grow to 12 at that facility within five years. 
""All together, we got $700,000 from the state and Peshtigo,"" Vargo said. ""It turned out to be a really good deal for us."" 
Marinette Marine, one of the state’s largest employers, received $28 million in tax credits through WEDC and promised to create 1,000 jobs under an agreement signed in August 2011. 
WEDC ""played an integral role"" in Marinette’s ability to land a major federal contract as a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin Corp.  to build littoral combat ships for the U.S. Navy, said Scott Wellens, Marinette Marine director of quality and facilities. 
He added the agency has been a ""strong partner in the creation of jobs"" at Marinette. 
The shipyard has built and delivered two of the ships and Lockheed has a contract to build a total of 10 of the ships in Marinette. 
WEDC’s assistance helped Marinette to be competitive in bidding for the work, Wellens said. It also helped the company establish a maritime center for excellence, which helps Marinette work with suppliers to become more efficient and competitive, he said. 
Marinette has added about 1,000 jobs in the past three years and has total employment of 1,750 today, Wellens said. 
State efforts to help the company began in the spring of 2010, under then Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle -- before Walker was elected and a year before WEDC was created. The state offered Marinette $50 million in incentives, with the promise that the company create 1,000 jobs. 
That was revised to $28 million under Walker  ""with the  opportunity to expand another $10 million for another large project subject to new employee numbers,"" said Thieding. 
Our rating 
Nygren defended the new Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. after an audit criticized the agency’s record keeping and performance. The agency, Nygren said, was ""a proven jobs creator."" 
The Legislative Audit Bureau and the agency’s annual report say that because the agency was so poorly run it’s impossible to determine how many jobs WEDC helped create. WEDC projectsthat the agency helped create 23,759 jobs. But that’s a prediction. 
Nygren directed us to northeastern Wisconsin employers who received help from the agency. Of the three companies we contacted, they reported adding a total of 1,022 jobs of a promised a total of 1,076 in exchange for $28.46 million in tax credits. And WEDC doesn’t deserve sole credit for the largest employer, Marinette Marine, which added more than 1,000 jobs. The state began efforts to help Marinette well before the agency was established. 
So Nygren’s statement is true on the local level, but it’s impossible to measure in the broad sense. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jun/19/john-nygren/rep-john-nygren-says-wisconsin-economic-developmen/
"['Rhode Island', 'History', 'Taxes', 'Charlene Lima']","
R.I. State Representative Charlene Lima says Rhode Islanders don't have to pay federal income taxes because the state never ratified the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
","
There was a lot of debate on the floor of the House of Representatives June 13, 2013, about the National Popular Vote bill. 
Once enough states ratify it -- and nine already have -- Rhode Island would be required to cast its Electoral College votes on behalf of the presidential candidate who, on a national level, gets the highest popular vote, regardless of who wins the presidential contest in Rhode Island. 
The proposal is designed to discourage candidates from focusing exclusively on battleground states such as Ohio and Florida. 
One opponent of the plan, which has already received the endorsement of both the House and Senate, was Rep. Charlene Lima, a Cranston Democrat. 
In her speech on the House floor, carried live on television, she spoke of the ""fiercely independent"" history of Rhode Island and offered this example: ""We didn't ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn't even have to pay federal income taxes. We never ratified that."" 
PolitiFact Rhode Island did a double-take. 
So we don't have to pay our federal income taxes? 
Before we wrote to the government to demand a big refund, we called Lima. 
When we couldn't get through to her right away, we checked some history. 
It turns out that the 13th Amendment abolished slavery. It had nothing to do with the federal income tax. 
Rhode Island not only ratified that amendment, we were the second state to do so, on Feb. 2, 1865. 
The amendment that created the federal income tax was the 16th Amendment. It was ratified by 42 of the 48 states in 1911, 1912 and 1913. (Alaska and Hawaii were not states at the time). Rhode Island rejected it, so Lima is correct about that element of her statement. 
Then we got to the big question: If Rhode Island didn't ratify it, is Lima correct to say that Rhode Islanders don't have to pay income taxes? 
No more than Mississippi residents could continue to own slaves after it rejected the 13th Amendment in 1865. (It would take Mississippi another 130 years to formally approve that amendment.) 
Lima's statement ""is wrong in so many different ways,"" said Jared Goldstein, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law. 
On the issue of paying taxes, the fact that Rhode Island did not ratify the 16th Amendment ""does not matter in the least,"" he said. ""Under the Constitution, an amendment becomes part of the Constitution upon the ratification by three-quarters of the states. Under the Supremacy Clause, the U.S. Constitution trumps any contrary state law, which means that states are bound by the Constitution regardless of whether they ratified every part of it. Otherwise, each state would only be bound by the parts of the Constitution that it agrees with, and there would be chaos."" 
So it doesn't look as if we're going to get that refund. 
When we heard back from Lima, she said she might have named the wrong amendment, she does pay her federal income taxes and ""I think people have to pay them."" 
She said her comment was ""kinda more tongue in cheek."" 
After her statement on the House floor, she said, the chairman of the House Finance Committee, Helio Melo approached her. ""He said, 'I wanted to get up on the floor and say, Don't listen to Rep. Lima,'"" Lima said. 
On this issue, we agree. 
Rep. Charlene Lima had the wrong amendment and the wrong lesson from history when she said Rhode Island ""didn't ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn't even have to pay federal income taxes."" 
Because her statement falls into the realm of ridiculous, we rate it Pants on Fire!

Jeb Bush says immigrants are 'more fertile'
","
The aging of America draws a lot of attention as the country tries to control the rising cost of health care and sustain critical programs such as Social Security. Jeb Bush, former Republican governor of Florida and potential 2016 presidential candidate, has a partial solution -- promote immigration. 
Bush, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference in Washington, made a pitch for immigration reform, saying America needs more new workers to help pay for retirees -- ""to rebuild the demographic pyramid"" as he put it. 
""Immigrants are more fertile,"" Bush said. ""And they love families and they have more intact families, and they bring a younger population. Immigrants create an engine of economic prosperity."" 
Bush’s reference to the fertility of immigrants stirred up an immediate flurry of activity on Twitter and the comment sections of news websites. Some said his words were callous, some said he was simply speaking the truth. 
We decided to take an evidence-based look into the fertility of immigrants. The key here is understanding the meaning of the word ""fertile."" Fertility can mean the ability to have children, but it can also refer to the birth rate of a population. In context, Bush's comments clearly referred to the second definition. We contacted Bush’s office; his spokesperson, Jaryn Emhoff, told us Bush was referring to birth rate. 
On that front, there is no debate about the numbers. The Pew Research Center reported in 2012 that the birth rate among foreign-born women was nearly 50 percent higher than for U.S.-born women -- 87.8 births per 1,000 women compared with 58.9 births per 1,000 women of prime child bearing age (15-44). 
A major reason why immigrant birth rates are higher has to do with the age of new arrivals; as a group, they skew young, which means more of them are likely to be ready to start families. If you looked at a group of foreign-born women and the same number of U.S.-born women, all between 15 and 44 years old, you would find more women closer to 20 years old among the immigrants. 
However, the Pew report noted an important trend. While birth rates for all women dropped between 2007 and 2010, it fell much faster among immigrant women. It declined by 14 percent compared with 6 percent for women born in America. 
Analysts differ on what is driving this change, and the debate has some bearing on Bush’s main interest in promoting immigration. The Pew researchers believe the data shows that these women are simply not having children. An alternative explanation is that there are fewer young immigrant women. 
Emilio Parrado, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, leans towards that one. Parrado  said that the data tell him that the real reason for the drop in the immigrant birth rate is the recession. With fewer jobs in America, fewer people had the incentive to come. 
""There are no new entrants,"" Parrado said. ""The immigrants who are already in the U.S. have already completed their family size, so they are no longer having kids and rates are declining."" 
This debate has significant implications for Bush’s argument on immigration. If birth rates for immigrants continue to drop, then immigration reform as a way to rebalance the country’s age distribution is not simply a matter of creating a legal option for those who are already here. It requires a steady influx of newcomers. 
Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that opposes high levels of immigration, said it is easy to overstate the benefits of attracting people from other countries. He noted that the children of foreign-born women still represent a significantly smaller slice of all births. This shows up in the data. The overall birth rate in the Pew report is 64 per 1,000 -- for U.S.-born women it is 58.9. 
""Immigrants do pull up the average but not by very much,"" Camarota said. 
To really change the birth rate, Camarota said a much larger number of immigrants would be needed. 
We should also note that it’s not a good idea to lump all immigrants together. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the country of origin can have a big impact on fertility rates. For mothers from Mexico, the rate is 77; that jumps by about a third for people from Central and South America. For mothers from Asia, the rate is 59 per 1,000. 
In addition, rates can change from one generation to the next. A paper presented at the Population Association of America 2013 conference found significant shifts among first-, second- and third-generation immigrant families. In terms of the number of children a woman will have in her lifetime, fertility falls steadily among Asians, from 1.84 in the first generation to 1.3 by the third. In contrast, Hispanic women show a dramatic decline from the first to second generation -- 2.41 to 1.9. But in the third generation, the number rises to 2.1. 
Our ruling 
Bush said that immigrants are more fertile and the data back him up. National statistics show that birth rates among foreign-born residents are about 50 percent higher than for U.S.-born women. However, the rates are converging, they vary widely among immigrant groups and over the years, the rates change. 
Still, Bush’s words were on track, and we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jun/18/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-immigrants-are-more-fertile/

Did Oregon Republican Party members raffle off an AR-15 assault rifle at the state fair?
","
Turner resident Suzanne Devlin recently sent a letter to the Statesman Journal, taking Sarah Palin and other Republicans to task for using gun-heavy language and then trying to distance themselves from the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and several others in Tucson, Ariz. , in early January.

""I volunteer at the Democratic booth at the state fair. Last summer, as is my custom, I walked over to the Republican booth. The differences between the two parties couldn't be better illustrated than what I encountered,"" she wrote. ""While we were passing out free ice water, the Republicans were raffling off an AR-15 assault rifle.""

A reader suggested PolitiFact Oregon take this on, and we found the topic interesting enough to tackle. Is a semiautomatic AR-15 an assault rifle? And were members of the Republican Party raffling one off at the Oregon State Fair?

We called Greg Leo, our go-to man at GOP state party headquarters, and asked about the rifle raffle. The state party spokesman said, ""It is true."" How we love easy confirmations.

Leo went on to explain that the raffle was a fundraiser to benefit the Marion County Republican Central Committee. The state fair was just one of the locations where people could buy a $5 raffle ticket, and the rifle (.223 caliber) was not on site. The winner was directed to a dealer, who processed the paperwork and handled the transaction. Gun raffles, apparently, are not uncommon. The Oregon Firearms Federation is in the midst of raffling off five AR-15 rifles.

Now, is it accurate to call an AR-15 an ""assault rifle""?

Technically speaking, Kevin Starrett of the Oregon Firearms Federation says, it’s not an assault rifle because an assault rifle must be able to switch between semiautomatic -- one bullet with each trigger pull -- and fully automatic machine-gun style modes. The AR-15, in this case, is a semiautomatic only. Genuine assault rifles are hard to get in the United States, outside the military.

Still, look up the term ""AR-15 assault rifle"" online and you’ll find that even firearms sites describe the AR-15 as an assault rifle. When an unnamed man showed up with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at an Obama event in Phoenix nearly two years ago, news media used both ""assault weapon"" and ""assault rifle"" to describe the firearm. (CNN here; MSNBC picking up AP here.) The Associated Press Stylebook says the correct term is assault weapon, not assault rifle.

In any case, fans say the AR-15 is terrific for hunting and target shooting; it’s versatile and precise. (Fashionable, too. Look online to find a Pepto pink Hello Kitty version.) There’s a quibble with the definition of ""assault rifle,"" but it’s a small one. We rate this claim Mostly True.

David Dewhurst says that last year, 250,000 people moved to Texas from other states
","
Texas is a bastion of opportunity that attracts newcomers,  Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said in his Jan. 18 inaugural address. ""Last year, out of the 500,000 (in) population growth we had in the state of Texas, about 250,000 of the 500,000 came to Texas, voted for Texas, with their feet,"" Dewhurst said. ""They came from the other 49 states--and it wasn’t because of our weather.""

That was more dramatic than his prepared remarks, which read: ""Last year, more than 200,000 people moved to Texas from the other 49 states.""

Either way, that’s a lot of volunteer Texans.

We zeroed in on what Dewhurst actually speechified. Asked for back-up information, Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz pointed us to the state demographer, Lloyd Potter of San Antonio.

Potter said there are no published figures yet on the state’s population gains in 2010 due to migration from other states. However, Potter singled out a U.S. Census Bureau estimate covering July 2008-July 2009, which says the population of Texas increased by 478,012, or 2 percent, to 24.8 million over those 12 months. During the period, net migration from other states--the number of people who moved to Texas minus those who left Texas for other states--was 143,423. The net migration of residents who moved to Texas from outside the U.S. was 88,116.

That is, the state’s population increased by nearly 480,000 with the 143,423 new residents hailing from other states accounting for about 30 percent of the increase.

At the bureau, Dallas spokeswoman Suzee Privett guided us to a different collection of data estimating new Texans. According to the bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey, Texas enjoyed a net gain of 128,137 residents coming from other states in 2009.

Robert Bernstein, a Maryland-based bureau spokesman, said the two census estimates differ because they cover different time periods--July 2008-July 2009 compared to calendar year 2009--and use different data-gathering approaches. The former estimate draws on government records including birth and death certificates, he said, while the survey is based on samplings of households across the country.

Potter said it’s possible that Dewhurst’s reference to 250,000 people moving here from other states included those from other countries, which is a common misunderstanding.

We shared the 2009 estimates with Walz. He replied by e-mail that Dewhurst was trying to show that roughly half of the state’s population growth is from migration, with the other half due to natural increases, in-state births minus deaths.

But we’re left weighing what Dewhurst actually said: that half the growth Texas experienced -- 250,000 out of 500,000 additional residents last year, he said -- was due to residents moving in from other states.

Not quite. First, the census data for 2010 hasn’t been released yet. And the most generous census estimate prior to last year indicates net migration from other states equaled 143,000 people from July 2008 to July 2009, accounting for less than a third of the state’s population increase in the period.

However, looking at Texas population growth in terms of people moving here ""with their feet"" versus people born here, Dewhurst pegged the ratio correctly -- about half-and-half.

Ed Turanchik says no one in the private sector gets unlimited vacation and sick leave
","
Think government workers get gold-plated benefits packages? Tampa mayoral candidate Ed Turanchik does.

His campaign platform calls for stopping unlimited accumulations of vacation and sick days and taking a long look at the city's pay scales. He told the weekly publication Creative Loafing in the Dec. 10, 2010, issue that, ""No one in the private sector gets unlimited accruals of vacation and sick leave. That's gotta be changed.""

We wanted to know, can Tampa's city workers collect unlimited vacation and sick time? And are such practices extinct at private companies?

Tampa’s policy

We first turned to Tampa's personnel manual for guidance. Full-time workers get about 12 vacation days per year, plus extra days depending on how long the person has worked for the city. A 20-year employee earns seven extra days, for example. Workers also receive 12 days of sick leave, but don't get extra days based on seniority.

Employees can save their vacation time and carry up to six weeks to the next year. Additional vacation time gets converted to sick days, which have more restrictions than vacation time. Workers can carry forward as much sick leave as they want.

(Tampa has four contracts that cover union workers, police officers, firefighters and all other employees. Each contract is different, but the vacation and sick leave policies are largely consistent.)

Asked on Jan. 25 about his description of Tampa's benefits package, Turanchik noted that retiring workers are paid for their unused vacation time (up to the six-week cap) and for half of their unused sick days. Even though vacation time is capped, he said, extra days are converted to sick leave and can eventually be cashed out at the lower rate.

""It grows and grows and grows,"" he said.

So Turanchik is mostly correct about Tampa's policy. Combining vacation and sick leave, an employee can accumulate unlimited paid time off. But vacation days are capped and additional time is counted as sick leave, which is harder to use and less lucrative upon retirement.

Tampa is mostly in line with other large area cities, though it's the only major city with unlimited sick leave. Both St. Petersburg and Clearwater cap vacation and sick days. Retiring St. Petersburg city workers can cash out almost five months of unused time off, while their Clearwater counterparts get a little more than five months. (That figure was cut by about a third for newer Clearwater hires.)

Tampa vs. the private sector

It turns out that policies similar to Tampa's are somewhat common in the private sector, according to several studies of employee benefits packages.

The New Jersey-based employment law think tank Alexander Hamilton Institute surveyed 1,193 companies about their benefits. Roughly three-fifths of the businesses have traditional vacation plans such as Tampa's. The rest give workers a lump sum of time off to use for vacation, sick days or personal time.

The survey found a large group of traditional companies — about 36 percent — offer unlimited sick time. Another 28 percent let workers collect more than six weeks.

Tampa's 30-day cap on vacation time also is common, though less so. About one-fifth of traditional employers set caps between 21 and 30 days. Roughly the same number allow workers to carry only five days to the next year. Almost 11 percent allow unlimited vacation accumulation.

Another report has similar results. A 2009 survey by the Society for Human Resources Management found that 14 percent of traditional companies offer unlimited sick time. On average, companies allowed workers to roll over 20 vacation days to the next year, or 10 days less than the city of Tampa.

We sent Turanchik copies of the studies and asked him if he had any evidence to support his statement that ""no one"" in private business gets unlimited vacation and sick leave. He said he made the claim based on his own experience as a labor lawyer and from talking with business owners.

""I haven't talked to a single business in the Tampa Bay area that allows for unlimited accruals,"" he said.

Turanchik also pointed to another finding from the Alexander Hamilton Institute: 87 percent of employers, a ""resounding majority,"" don't cash out unused sick time when a worker retires.

""It's just not a package you see,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's a few companies that do it. But as a general proposition, it's just not an acceptable practice.""

Our ruling

Turanchik's description of Tampa's benefits package is largely correct. He's also right that it's rare for a private business to offer unlimited accumulation of sick leave with a large payout upon retirement. Unlimited vacation also is rare.

But his original statement was ""no one"" in the private sector gets unlimited vacation and sick leave. Several studies say that's not true -- though very few of those companies will pay for unused sick time upon retirement as the city does. The essence of his point is correct, and we rate Turanchik's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/28/ed-turanchik/ed-turanchik-says-no-one-private-sector-gets-unlim/

Rand Paul says tea party pushed Barack Obama to shift view on earmarks
","
In the first-ever meeting of the Senate Tea Party Caucus on Jan. 27, 2011, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., shot a rhetorical barb at President Barack Obama over earmarks.

An earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics have long argued that earmarks are likelier to serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group than the national good.

At the Tea Party Caucus meeting, Paul said, ""Before we were even sworn in, the Republican caucus got together ... they forswore and said, 'No more earmarks.' Are they going to co-opt us? I went to my first State of the Union the other day, and guess who is now against earmarks? The president of the United States has been co-opted by the tea party!""

We decided to see whether Paul was correct that Obama had changed his stance on earmarks.

First, here’s what Obama said during his Jan. 25, 2011, State of the Union address. To the applause of lawmakers, he said, ""And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it. I will veto it.""

Now let’s look at what he said during the 2008 campaign. As a candidate, Obama spoke out several times against earmarks. In fact, our Obameter has been tracking no fewer than three earmark-related promises. They are:

• Through the ""Transparency and Integrity in Earmarks Act, will shed light on all earmarks by disclosing the name of the legislator who asked for each earmark, along with a written justification, 72 hours before they can be approved by the full Senate."" (We rated this one a Compromise.)

• ""And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely."" (We rated this a Compromise.)

• ""Barack Obama is committed to returning earmarks to less than $7.8 billion a year, the level they were at before 1994."" (We rated this one Promise Broken.)

As our promise ratings indicate, his record on earmarks as president has been less than consistent.

In March 2009, for instance, Obama said he would sign a $410 billion omnibus spending bill containing a reported 8,570 earmarks totaling $7.7 billion. ABC News’ Jake Tapper wrote at the time that Obama seemed a little embarrassed about it, refusing to sign the bill in public or even to release a photograph. 
Appropriations bills covering fiscal year 2010 contained 9,499 congressional earmarks worth $15.9 billion, according to the nonpartisan group Taxpayers for Common Sense.

His inconsistent opposition to earmarks convinces Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, that Paul’s observation is accurate.

""Given the huge number of earmarks signed into law by Obama, I think his subsequent back-pedaling is a testimony to the power of the tea party, or at least a testimony to the broader grassroots revolt against big government,"" Mitchell said. Mitchell added that Paul may be guilty of ""a bit of puffery in his rhetoric.""

We also asked Steve Ellis, a veteran earmark-watcher for the nonpartisan group Taxpayers for Common Sense, for his interpretation.

""While the president hasn’t called for the outright abolishment of earmarks before, he has been for earmark reforms and reductions,"" Ellis said.

Ellis said that, as a senator, Obama went through an ""arc"" in his views and actions on earmarks. In his first year, Obama followed the lead of fellow Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin. Durbin sat on the Appropriations Committee, a major institutional source of earmarks, and that year, Obama ""got all sorts of earmarks.""

The following year, Ellis said, Obama did not pursue earmarks for any for-profit companies, and the year after that, he went further than the rules required and released all of his earmark requests since becoming a senator.

In his final year in the Senate, Obama gave up earmarks entirely. ""Of course he was positioning to run for president, but still,"" Ellis said.

We think Paul is right to note that Obama’s State of the Union position was stronger than what he had expressed during the campaign, a point at which the tea party movement had not yet emerged. It’s also worth noting that, so far in his term, Obama has only inconsistently carried out his stated policies on earmarks.

As president, Obama has signed legislation that included a significant number of earmarks. In his State of the Union address, he said would veto legislation with earmarks. Still, we think it’s an oversimplification for Paul to imply that Obama had done a wholesale change on the issue, whether due to tea party pressure or some other reason. It would be inaccurate to describe Obama as someone who uncritically supported earmarks, at least after his first year or so in the Senate. In fact, as a candidate, he made three separate promises to rein them in. On balance, we rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/28/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-tea-party-pushed-barack-obama-shift/

Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli says EPA auto emissions rules will barely lower global temperatures.
","During a recent speech at a Tea Party rally, Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli took plenty of shots at the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Republican, an unabashed critic of global warming claims, called the EPA  ""the Employment Prevention Agency.""

While discussing the EPA’s endangerment finding that greenhouse gasses ""threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations,"" Cuccinelli voiced contempt for new regulations that will limit tailpipe emissions.

""It turns out that they believe, that if fully implemented with all the regulations that go with it, they will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit. By 2050.""

As the crowd laughed and jeered, the attorney general added, ""I might not be able to see my breath by then.""

Only 0.05 degrees by 2050? Is that really what the EPA was claiming these rules would do?

Brian Gottstein, Cuccinelli’s director of communications, referred us to the EPA’s massive document on light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards. He pointed us to page 4-101, deep in the document. It said: ""EPA modeled the anticipated potential effect on climate change and found that in year 2100, the rule would reduce temperature increases by 0.006-0.015 degrees Celsius.""

Those Celsius figures translate to a range from 0.011 to 0.027 degrees Fahrenheit.

Cuccinelli had claimed there would be a 0.05 reduction in temperature increases by 2050. So he actually spoke in the EPA’s favor, overstating the expected reduction and saying it would happen 50 years faster than the agency claims.

We also called the EPA and asked them to quantify any temperature reductions that could be expected under the new rules, which affect cars in model years 2012 through 2016. Spokeswoman Enesta Jones e-mailed us a response.

""EPA estimated that the 2012-2016 light duty tailpipe standards would reduce the global mean temperature by 0.006 to 0.015 °C by 2100. The approach used to estimate changes in global mean temperature evaluates the impact of the rule’s emissions reductions in the context of global [greenhouse gas] emissions,"" she wrote. ""Although the projected reductions are small in overall magnitude by themselves, they are quantifiable and would contribute to reducing climate change risks.""

The new EPA limits would establish in 2012 model cars the first-ever caps on carbon dioxide emissions by cars and light trucks. Over the next five years the limits would toughen by about 14 percent. The rules would also push fuel efficiency from 33.8 miles per gallon for passenger cars in the 2012 model year up to 39.5 miles per gallon in 2016.

The agency says these new rules would add about $950 to the price of each new car but that the higher price would be offset by lower fuel costs over three to five years.

Let’s review. The Virginia attorney general said the EPA’s new tailpipe emissions rules for cars and other light-duty vehicles would reduce temperature increases by 0.05 degrees Fahrenheit. He said this would occur by 2050.

The EPA said the reductions would be between 0.011 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.027 degrees Fahrenheit and would occur by 2100. The agency’s claim is even more modest than Cuccinelli suggested.

Anti-tax group says Georgia overhaul is hike
","
A proposal to overhaul Georgia’s tangled tax system recently earned the worst slur in the fiscal conservative book: ""tax hike.""   

Americans for Tax Reform, which opposes all tax increases, called out new Gov. Nathan Deal, House Speaker David Ralston and Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers by name. If they back the reforms, ATR said, they’re breaking a promise they made when they signed the group’s anti-tax pledge.

The proposal ""is akin to shards of glass in a delicious creme brulee,"" Grover Norquist, leader of the Washington-based group, said in a written statement Jan. 10. ""It is a bit of desirable tax reform ruined by an overall tax hike.""

Are there really shards of tax-hike glass in an otherwise yummy overhaul?

In June, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue created the Special Council on Tax Reform and Fairness for Georgians to recommend a rewrite of the state’s tax code.

Critics think change is overdue. They argue that the code is outdated and riddled with exemptions for special interests. They also want the state’s income to rely on revenue sources that aren’t so vulnerable to economic downturns.

On Jan. 7, the council came back with more than a dozen recommendations. They included lowering the 6 percent personal and corporate income tax over three years to a rate that ""does not exceed"" 4 percent, re-establishing a tax on groceries and eliminating many exemptions.

Council members recommended lowering income tax rates to levels they think will zero out any potential revenue increases, said Christine Ries, an economics professor at Georgia Tech and a member of the council.

State legislators now must decide how to incorporate the recommendations into a bill.

Three days later, ATR called the recommendations an ""overall tax hike.""

ATR used data from the council’s report and its own estimates to determine cuts would total $3.375 billion over three years but hikes would total far more -- between $4.77 billion and $5.75 billion. Since the proposal would increase state revenue, it counts as a tax increase, its officials told PolitiFact Georgia.

ATR’s focus is on the recommendation’s overall effect on revenue and not whether certain individuals would pay more taxes. We will therefore focus on revenue, as well.  

We took our own look at the council’s report and found that while it’s possible the changes would increase tax revenue, it might not.

Under the council’s proposal, a grocery tax would start right away, but reductions in personal and corporate taxes that would offset that hike would phase in over three years. Therefore, in the first year taxes could rise. Our rough calculations put that jump between some $250 million and $1.4 billion.

The report, however, lacks revenue estimates for major pieces. It has none for two years of the three-year cut in personal and corporate income taxes. Estimates for other initiatives, such as eliminating the tax on energy used in manufacturing, are missing as well. News accounts place the cost of this tax anywhere from $80 million a year to $420 million.

More complete estimates are in the works.

When you tally what numbers are available, it’s not clear whether tax numbers would rise or fall. PolitiFact Georgia was able to cobble together reasonable scenarios in which they increased and dropped.

For instance, if you follow ATR’s assumptions and take the high revenue estimates for taxing groceries, increasing cigarettes taxes and taxing person-to-person auto sales, revenue would jump by an average of more than $1 billion a year (about 6 percent of the state budget).

If you use low revenue estimates and ignore ATR’s assumptions, they would sink by nearly $119 million (roughly 1 percent).   
 
Another problem is that ATR boost its revenue estimate by about $1.23 billion over three years by assuming state-level reform would enable Georgia to collect sales taxes from out-of-state Internet retailers.

But state changes can’t create this windfall. This is largely a federal issue, and the constitutionality of collecting this money is in dispute. Other states, the U.S. Congress and courts will likely have to act before this money comes in. It’s not clear when or if this will happen.

ATR opposes taxing e-commerce, but ""that said, we are merely using the numbers we were provided,"" Joshua Culling, the group’s state affairs manager, said in an e-mail.  

""Most of what has been discussed about this plan has been guesswork to this point,"" Cullig added. ""ATR’s scoring of the plan is as comprehensive as anything out there.""  

We talked to other experts and found they were hesitant to label the proposal a ""tax increase.""

Kelly McCutchen, who is president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a Libertarian-influenced think tank, cautioned that even valid revenue estimates can vary widely.

For instance, the foundation’s estimate for the revenue from taxing food was more than $175 million higher than one by the Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center.  

Whether the proposal would constitute a tax increase is up for grabs, McCutchen said.

Kail Padgitt, a staff economist for the fiscally conservative Tax Foundation in Washington, noted that taxes may jump initially because of the timing of income tax cuts. Still, the group currently favors the proposal because its language would allow legislators to solve this problem by slashing income taxes more quickly and deeply than recommended.  

Another issue is ATR’s ""tax hike"" definition. Tax revenue is currently unusually low because of the foundering economy. It’s fair to ask whether ""revenue-neutral"" means the proposal maintains current revenue levels or returns us to pre-recession figures, said Sarah Beth Gehl, deputy director of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.

To sum up:

ATR concluded the reform recommendations were an ""overall tax hike"" before it had enough evidence. PolitiFact Georgia’s own analysis found that the tax overhaul could increase or cut taxes.  

ATR also included a $1.23 billion boost in e-commerce revenue that recommendations cannot bring about on their own.

Calling the recommendation an ""overall tax hike"" is therefore akin to telling Georgians there are shards of glass in their creme brulee before it reaches the table.

ATR’s assessment contains some element of truth, but it is premature and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It therefore meets our definition of Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/28/americans-tax-reform/anti-tax-group-says-georgia-overhaul-hike/

Rep. Marcy Kaptur critical of power in hands of a few banks
","
Whether she’s blasting Wall Street greed in Michael Moore’s 2009 movie ""Capitalism, a Love Story,"" or urging homeowners who face foreclosure to squat in their own homes, Rep. Marcy Kaptur has emerged as one of Congress’ most vocal critics of large financial institutions.

The Toledo Democrat repeated many of her criticisms in an interview on MSNBC’S Dylan Ratigan show, where she criticized the nation’s biggest banks for ""reckless"" conduct that led to the nation’s foreclosure crisis.

""Six institutions in our country now control two thirds of the capital,"" Kaptur said, who contends financial power should be returned to community banks and credit unions with ties to the areas where they do business. ""That’s too much. It’s too much power in too few hands.""

The statistic Kaptur cited sounded like a big chunk of change for a few institutions to control, so we asked where her numbers came from.

Her office cited a book called ""13 Bankers"" by MIT economist Simon Johnson and James Kwak which contains a table that examines the growth of the nation’s six biggest banks: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America.

According to the chart, the assets of those banks grew from less than 20 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product in 1995, to roughly 60 percent today. The book argues that these ""too big to fail"" institutions harm the economy because they stifle competition and take excessive risks because they know the government will bail them out of a disaster. Federal Reserve data backs up Johnson’s contention that the six large banks control assets that are roughly 60 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.

The statistic that inspired Kaptur’s remarks checks out, but there’s a problem with her statement. The chart refers to bank assets, not bank capital, as Kaptur said. And there’s a big difference between the two.

Assets encompass everything a bank owns, including buildings and loans to customers. Capital is what’s left on a bank’s balance sheet after its liabilities – like customer deposits that can be withdrawn at any time – are subtracted from assets. The federal reserve considers banks to be adequately capitalized if their capital is more than eight percent of its assets, says Emre Ergungor, a senior research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

Johnson said Kaptur’s underlying point about the concentration of power in the hands of a few banks was correct.

""My overall assessment - Rep. Kaptur should have said ‘six institutions in our country now have assets worth over 60 percent of GDP’ (or less technical words to that effect),"" Johnson said in an e-mail. ""But she is right that (a) the size of assets controlled by our largest institutions has gone up a lot in recent years, including after the financial crisis, and (b) this is an economic problem of first order importance for the United States -- this is the point of 13 Bankers.""

We agree with Johnson. And had Kaptur said something like that, she would have rated higher on the Truth-O-Meter.

A basic tenet PolitiFact uses to evaluate statements is that words matter. In this case, by using the word ""capital,"" rather than ""assets,"" she turned the accuracy of her statement upside down.

That’s why we rate her statement as False.",/factchecks/2011/jan/28/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-critical-power-hands-few-banks/

Attorney General Greg Abbott says bullets have crossed the border from Mexico at least four times
","Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, publicizing his call for Congress to investigate a shooting along the U.S.-Mexico border, said in a press release this month that his demand ""comes after at least four incidents where bullets from Mexico have crossed the border, putting at risk the safety and security of Texas residents."" We’ve found other claims about cross-border violence — how many people have been killed across the border and whether spillover violence is escalating, for example —  to be inflated. So we looked into Abbott’s count. According to an Associated Press news article, authorities from the Hudspeth County Sheriff’s office said road workers near the border ""were fired upon by an unknown gunman in Mexico"" on Jan. 13. Abbott referred to the incident in his Jan. 14 press release announcing he’d sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, urging their committees to review the Obama administration’s ""response to this incident and others like it"" and ""determine what the federal government can do to protect border residents."" Abbott’s press release said: ""Gunmen in Mexico fired across the border at U.S. road workers in rural West Texas, in what local law enforcement considers to be an attempt by drug smugglers to scare the workers away so that their smuggling operations in the U.S. could continue."" Abbott’s letter offers more detail: ""Six months ago, I warned President (Barack) Obama about the life-threatening danger of bullets flying across the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas. At that time, El Paso’s City Hall had just been struck by gunfire from the Mexican side of the border. In August of last year, more stray bullets from inside Mexico struck school buildings at the University of Texas at El Paso."" In a June 30 letter to Obama, Abbott said ""it was mere luck that the bullets struck buildings rather than bodies."" He urged the president to ""make border security (his) top priority."" Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland provided us with the administration’s response, from Jarrod Bernstein, acting assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. ""Border security remains a top priority for this administration,"" Bernstein wrote Dec. 10, also pointing out that ""Obama has deployed 1,200 National Guard troops to the Southwest border."" We previously confirmed three of the incidents Abbott referred to while fact-checking earlier statements, including one that Abbott made in August about gunfire in Mexico that month had led El Paso authorities to close a section of U.S. 85. A building on the UTEP campus was struck by a bullet that police suspect was fired during the incident, according to an Aug. 24 El Paso Times news article. Subsequent news articles by the Times reported more than one bullet crossed the border. Earlier, bullets fired on the Mexico side of the border struck El Paso’s City Hall June 29, an incident Gov. Rick Perry referred to in July. According to the El Paso Police Department, one bullet traveled through a ninth-floor window and an interior wall before lodging in a picture frame. Stucco walls of the government building were struck by an additional six rounds, the police said. ""Investigators believe that the rounds may be related to (a shooting incident) that occurred in Juarez,"" a police department press release said. In August, department spokesman Darrel Petry told us the bullets flew during an attack in Juarez on Mexican federal agents. In March, checking Sen. John Cornyn’s claim that spillover violence in Texas is real and escalating, we confirmed that in September 2009, the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College closed for several days after stray bullets from a shootout from the Mexican side of the border hit a car and building on campus. Strickland, who told us that Abbott wasn’t referring to a specific time period when he said at least four incidents have brought bullets across the border, pointed to news reports to confirm the recent incident in West Texas. On Jan. 14, the El Paso Times, reported that the day before, ""at least one gunman fired a high-powered rifles across the border"" at four road workers toiling about half a mile from the border, east of Fort Hancock. Robert Wilson, a lieutenant with the Hudspeth County Sheriff’s Office, told us authorities found eight bullets around Indian Hot Springs Road, where the men were working. The men weren’t hit, according to the news article. We rate Abbott’s statement as True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/28/greg-abbott/attorney-general-greg-abbott-says-bullets-have-cro/

Kent Conrad said we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend
","
Government borrowing needs to be brought back under control, and the solutions are not easy, said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

""The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense,"" Conrad said. ""That's 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.

""So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and that it's going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You're not going to solve the problem that way.""

Conrad was one of three senators who appeared on This Week to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012.

We wanted to check Conrad's statement that ""we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend."" We looked at whether Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget in a different fact-check.

We turned to the U.S. Treasury Department's Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government. For the most recently completed fiscal year, 2010, the department reported that the government had revenues of $2.16 trillion, spending of $3.46 trillion and a deficit of $1.29 trillion. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get 37 percent, which is very close to 40 percent.

We initially found the numbers a little confusing, but one of the experts we interviewed for this story explained it this way:

""It's like a family that earns $60,000 per year, but is spending $100,000. How are they doing it? By getting a new $40,000 loan every year to cover the difference,"" said Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Kent Conrad said 84 percent of the budget is Social Security, Medicare and defense
","
The public needs to accept that there are no easy solutions to the nation's budget crisis, said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Jan. 23, 2011.

""The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense,"" Conrad said. ""That's 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.

Conrad was one of three senators who appeared on This Week to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012. 
It's true that people don't like the idea of cutting Social Security or Medicare. A CNN poll recently found 78 percent said Social Security should be protected from significant cuts, and 81 percent said Medicare should be protected. The picture was mixed for defense, with 49 percent saying it could be cut and 50 percent saying protect it, a statistical tie. We also checked Conrad's statement that  we borrow 40 cents for every dollar we spend in a separate fact-check. 
We wanted to check Conrad's numbers on the budget, particularly his statement that Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget. That number seemed alarmingly high. As we dug into the numbers, though, we found a few discrepancies that needed explaining.

We began our calculations by looking at the current budget. If you add up defense spending, Medicare and Social Security, that currently equals 51 percent of spending. Add in spending on veterans, and it rises to 54 percent. (Add it up for yourself using the White House's budget tables.) We ran this number by two budget experts who confirmed it for us.

We contacted Conrad's office, though, and a spokesman said that Conrad's point was that it is very hard to cut the budget if you're only willing to look at discretionary spending, which is the money that Congress appropriates every year. If you leave defense spending out, you're left with an even smaller piece of the pie, which budget wonks call non-defense discretionary spending, which is 16 percent of the budget. (In Washington, people will even abbreviate non-defense discretionary spending to ""NDD."") It's basically the easiest part of the budget to cut.

Conrad was talking about the hard part: the mandatory spending programs, plus defense spending. And he short-handed mandatory spending to just Social Security and Medicare, which are the largest two programs in the category.

And while it's true that Social Security and Medicare are the largest part of mandatory spending, they are not all of it. Mandatory spending includes other entitlements -- benefits people have a right to under the law if they meet the requirements. That means programs like Medicaid, food stamps, welfare, child nutrition care, the children's health insurance program, supplemental security income, veterans pensions, a portion of the costs of health care reform and refundable tax credits for low-income workers.

You have to include those other programs to get to 84 percent. Strictly speaking, Medicare, Social Security and defense spending only make up 54 percent of spending.

In rating Conrad's statement, his numbers are definitely off. Social Security, Medicare and defense spending are not 84 percent of the budget, they're closer to 54 percent. Conrad may have known what he was talking about -- just the manadatory spending -- but we're not sure the average listener would. Still, his overall point is correct: Medicare, Social Security and defense represent huge parts of the budget, more than half, and it's difficult if not impossible to balance the budget if these three items are off the table. That's enough to tip the balance on our ruling; we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/27/kent-conrad/kent-conrad-said-84-percent-budget-social-security/

Citing cost, some people want to flush a septic tank inspection requirement
","
Members of the state Legislature who resoundingly voted in 2010 to require people to have their septic tanks inspected once every five years now say the new law -- sorry for the pun -- stinks.

The idea, to help prevent sewage from leaking out of septic tanks and into the state groundwater system, isn't the problem, they say. It's the cost to septic tank owners that worries legislators. They agreed in November to push back the implementation of the bill from Jan. 1, 2011, until July 1, 2011, to delay any fiscal impact on septic tank owners.

And now, the entire proposal appears to be -- okay, last pun -- circling the drain.

A Senate committee debated reversing many of the requirements on Jan. 26, 2011, less than a year after the initial legislation passed. State Sen. Charlie Dean, R-Inverness, who voted for the inspection requirement but is now leading a fight to have it removed or replaced, said the law has been met with almost ""unanimous disapproval,"" and that many septic tank owners are not in areas where they would affect water quality, anyway.

Sen. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, another 'Yes' vote in 2010, said the requirement is unnecessary. If someone's septic tank breaks, they'll have it fixed, she said. ""The previous incarnation of this legislation started out to protect the springs,"" Detert said. ""It became a huge overreach and overrun.""

But Sen. Dennis Jones, R-Treasure Island, said he saw merits in the law (which he voted for, too, by the way).

The inspection will help keep sewage from entering the state water system. It will keep homeowners' septic tanks in better shape. And it can serve a public good.

On top of all that, Jones said, the cost is marginal.

""I don't think it's that expensive to spend $100 to $150 every five years,"" he said.

Does all this talk and concern really boil down to $30 a year? PolitiFact Florida decided to find out.

Septic tanks largely unchecked

The septic tank inspection requirement seemed to be controversial from the moment it was approved and signed into law on June 4, 2010, by then-Gov. Charlie Crist.

According to the Department of Health, there are more than 2.6 million septic sewage systems in Florida serving about a third of the state's population. But less than 1 percent of the state's systems -- about 17,000 -- are being inspected and serviced by licensed maintenance professionals. In most cases, septic systems are only checked or serviced when they fail. And more than half of the state's septic systems are at least 30 years old.

Leaky septic tanks have been identified by health and environmental officials as major sources of water pollution.

So a group of legislators worked for several years to try to force inspections. The law that finally passed in 2010 attempted to mute concerns over cost. It requires inspections every five years (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests an inspection every three to five years), creates a grant program for low-income homeowners and allows certain homeowners to request a one-time, one-year inspection extension.

""Pay a little bit now or all of us will pay a whole lot later,"" said former state Sen. Lee Constantine, R-Altamonte Springs, who was behind the 2010 law.

But concerns over the cost to homeowners quickly escalated. The Legislature passed a measure to stall implementation of the law during a November special session, and then waited until Gov. Rick Scott took office to send the bill to the governor's office to prevent a possible veto from Crist. Scott allowed the delay to become law without his signature.

""I applaud Governor Scott for allowing Senate Bill 2A to become law,"" Senate Majority Leader Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, who voted for the original 2010 law, said in a statement. ""This decisive step postpones the implementation of septic tank inspection regulations, enabling lawmakers to analyze whether or not such a mandate is necessary and saving taxpayer dollars in the meantime.""

Interestingly, a state Senate analysis found that the inspection requirement would create hundreds ""if not thousands"" of private sector jobs because of a shortage of certified septic tank inspectors. The Department of Health estimated that annual septic tank inspections would grow from 17,000 a year to 500,000.

The cost of an inspection

All this leads to the main point of this fact check -- just how much would an inspection cost?

Jones said the cost of the inspection is between $100 and $150, to be paid once every five years. But we found references to the inspection costing $500. And then other references to $200.

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Jones said he used information from the Department of Health for his estimate. But he believed the number might even be high. He said he spoke with people who believe that an influx of new private inspectors will naturally drive down costs because of increased competition.

Michelle Dahnke, a health department spokeswoman, said private contractors would do the inspections. The department estimated an inspection would cost $150, she said, but that contractors ultimately would set the price and compete for business.

We then asked two private-sector experts to talk about the cost of an inspection.

Ellen Vause, president of Florida Septic Inc. in Hawthorne, said the cost of the inspection will depend on what the state actually requires and where the septic tank is located. Vause said that a standard inspection, which would include pumping out sewage from a septic tank system, costs $150 to $300 now in North Florida, and $200 to $350 in South Florida. The main difference, Vause said, is the cost to dispose of the sludge.

But Vause said she would expect costs to drop if more inspections were required because contractors could do several inspections in the same neighborhood on the same day, saving on transportation and disposal costs.

Bob Himschoot, a member of the Florida Onsite Wastewater Association and an owner of a septic tank contracting company in Fort Myers, pegged the cost slightly higher -- between $325 and $500. The cost includes the labor cost of a technician, who must be qualified to drive a commercial vacuum truck, equipment cost and the cost to dispose of the waste.

The cost of the inspection is only one part of the problem, though. The worry is that the inspector finds something wrong.

It's like going to the car mechanic for an oil change. You find out your brakes need fixing. Your wheels are out of alignment. Your tires are wearing thin. (And dollar signs dance through your head.)

That's exactly the point of the 2010 law, of course, to identify problems to keep contaminants from seeping into the ground. The Department of Health, in draft rules, would require septic tank owners to repair tanks that are cracked and replace systems where sewage is flowing directly into the ground.

Should your system need to replaced entirely -- systems generally last between 20 and 30 years -- that will cost $5,000 to $7,500 on average.

""It's just another thing for the government to get mixed up with when they have no business sticking their nose in there,"" said Ralph Pohl, 77, who installed a septic tank 18 years ago at his home in Seacrest in the Panhandle and hasn't had it inspected once. Pohl reports no problems with his system.

""I have no problem with someone coming and taking a look if there's any seepage or things like that,"" he said. ""To force an inspector to come out and dig out a perfectly operating septic tank -- I don't see the point. If they're working, there's no problem. If they're not working, the homeowner is going to have to do something.""

There's another obvious, but critical point to consider when talking about the cost of a septic tank inspection. People using septic tanks don't pay for a central sewer system. People without septic tanks do. We did some math for three areas -- St. Petersburg in Pinellas County, Lakeland in Polk County, and the residents of Marion County -- and found that the typical sewer system customer will pay $375-$400 a year for sewer service in those three areas. Septic tank users would pay nothing.

Over five years, that's $1,875-$2,000 in sewer charges versus nothing.

""It's really a very inexpensive method compared to a central sewer system,"" Himschoot said.

Our ruling

In talking about making changes to a law requiring septic tank inspections once every five years, Sens. Dean and Detert didn't question the need to have properly functioning septic tanks but argued that the inspection itself was unnecessary for many people. Jones countered that the cost of the inspection alone isn't that great, especially when spread out over five years.

Jones said an inspection would cost $100 to $150, citing a Department of Health estimate. Spread over five years, that's an investment of as little as $30 a year -- much less than homeowners with a central sewer system pay.

But that's not telling the entire story. Experts we talked to said the price of an inspection could cost up to $500 and depends on a number of variables. On top of that, the inspection could result in finding problems that could require repairs at additional cost. That's obviously part of the intent of the bill, but it comes at a cost nevertheless.

We think that's enough of difference to rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/27/dennis-jones/florida-septic-tank-inspections/
"['Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan says Obama increased spending nearly 25 percent in two years, 84 percent when stimulus money is included
","
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech called to mind their face-to-face -- but civil -- sparring in January 2010.

Back then, when Obama attended a House Republican caucus meeting, Ryan told the president in a televised exchange: ""The spending bills that you have signed into law, the domestic discretionary spending has been increased by 84 percent.""

Ryan, R-Wisconsin, is now chairman of the House Budget Committee.

Delivering the GOP response to Obama’s address, Ryan first threw Obama a bone (""There's no doubt the president came into office facing a severe fiscal and economic situation.""). Then he criticized Obama’s stimulus plan, saying it ""not only failed to deliver on his promise to create jobs, but also plunged us even deeper into debt.""

We were interested in what he said next:

""The facts are clear: Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25 percent for domestic government agencies, an 84 percent increase when you include the failed stimulus.""

NFL coaches talk about ""cleaning up"" mistakes before the next big game.

It appears that’s what Ryan did here -- at least in part.

In the wake of the Nov. 2, 2010 election, we gave Ryan a Barely True for repeating to reporters his assertion from Baltimore about an 84 percent increase in the past two years.

Ryan was on the right track in pointing to the federal stimulus package as a huge driver in spending increases under Obama. But Ryan used fuzzy math to make the year-to-year increase appear much larger than it was.

The spending figures for non-defense discretionary spending did show a 24 percent jump -- from $434 billion in 2008 to $537 billion in 2010. Discretionary spending goes for such things as education, health and housing -- in contrast to mandatory expenditures such as Social Security and Medicare ""entitlements.""

To get to 84 percent, Ryan -- and other GOP leaders who have repeated the claim -- put the one-time stimulus spending in 2010, not 2009 when the measure passed.

That’s what made it artificially higher, creating a rocket-like impression instead of the roller-coaster effect -- up a lot and then down some -- created by the stimulus package.

Experts said it was OK to include stimulus, if it was disclosed, and as long as it appeared as a one-time blip and was properly accounted for.

That brings us back to Ryan’s revised statement.

The numbers show a 24 percent increase from 2008 to 2010. Ryan accurately rounded it up to ""nearly 25 percent.""

And he added the reference to stimulus package, to give a fuller picture of what was behind the numbers. But he continued to use the 84 percent. That’s an inaccurate number. It is created only when the stimulus is assigned to the wrong year.

We were unable to reach Ryan spokespeople for this item.

So let’s tie this up.

Ryan has added the 25 percent figure into his public assertions of spending increases under Obama. And though he adds context with the stimulus disclaimer, the 84 percent is ultimately dubious. It exists only because of the accounting trick used to produce it. Ryan argues he is trying to capture the effect of stimulus funding. A worthy goal, but his method overstates the effect.

Rep. Paul Ryan claims health care law ""is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy""
","
In the Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., touched on one of the most contentious issues in the health care debate: whether or not the new health care law will increase or decrease the deficit over time.

""Health care spending is driving the explosive growth of our debt,"" Ryan said. ""And the president’s law is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy.""

Contrast that with President Obama's claim in the State of the Union address, that ""nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit.""

So which is it? Does the health care law reduce the deficit by a quarter of a trillion dollars or accelerate our country toward bankruptcy?

Let's start with Obama's claim. In a Jan. 6, 2011, letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, wrote that repealing the health care law would increase the deficit over the next 10 years ""in the vicinity of $230 billion."" That's because while the health care law has a large cost -- mainly from expansion of Medicaid and subsidies to people of moderate means to help them pay for health insurance -- those costs are slightly more than offset by new taxes and spending cuts (most from slowing the growth of Medicare spending).

Ryan and other Republicans, however, contend that the CBO report is based on gimmicks and double-counting and that the health care law will actually explode the nation's debt.

The various arguments underpinning that contention are laid out in a press release on Ryan's website titled, ""The Budgetary Consequences of the President’s Health Care Overhaul."" Some of the points raised by Ryan are more legitimate than others.

Let's address some of Ryan's main points: 
• ""The CBO score did not include the cost of setting up and administering the massive overhaul, including the cost of hiring new health-care bureaucrats to run new spending programs, as well as thousands of IRS agents to enforce the new mandates."" 
The release links to a CBO letter that estimates these discretionary appropriations would cost $115 billion over the next 10 years. That includes the administrative cost to implement new health care policies, as well as grants and other program spending prescribed in the law. And it's true that those costs weren't in the CBO's estimates regarding the budget effects of the health care law. 
But these are discretionary appropriations, which means Congress will determine each year how much of that cost it is willing to appropriate. 
Also, as the CBO pointed out in its letter to Boehner, ""most of those authorizations, for more than $86 billion, were for activities that were already being carried out under prior law or that were previously authorized.""

Marc Goldwein, policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said just $10 to $20 billion of that $115 billion is actually tied to implementation of the new health care law. In other words, much of the rest is not new cost. 
•  The new law double-counts $53 billion in additional Social Security payroll tax revenue and $398 billion in reduced Medicare payments.  
Ryan argues it's disingenuous to claim those revenues will be used to offset the cost of the health care law while also claiming they strengthen Social Security and Medicare finances. 
Goldwein agrees. ""It's one or the other,"" he said. ""You're either strengthening Medicare or using the money to offset the health care law. You are not doing both."" 
But in a report, ""Debunking False Claims About Health Reform, Jobs, and the Deficit,"" Paul Van de Water of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities dismissed the double-counting claim as a ""canard."" 
""In estimating the law’s impact on the deficit, CBO counted the Medicare savings and Social Security revenues only once,"" Van de Water wrote. ""The financial status of the Medicare or Social Security trust funds is a different matter, distinct from CBO’s estimate of the impact of the legislation on the budget deficit. The skilled CBO experts did not double count, as anyone familiar with budget estimates knows.""

•  The law uses an accounting trick to make a plan to create government insurance for long-term care, the CLASS program, look like a revenue producer.  
The program would start taking in premiums immediately but won't start paying out until 2016. As a result, it's expected to generate a surplus of $70 billion over the first 10 years. Long-term, the program could be quite expensive, but, because of a ""timing trick,"" it looks like a revenue-producer over the first 10 years, Goldwein said. 
Regardless of the effect of the CLASS program, said Edwin Park, co-director of health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the big picture is that the CBO projects an even bigger deficit reduction from the health care law in the second 10 years than the first. The CBO projects that over the second 10 years, the health care law will reduce the deficit ""in a broad range around one half percent of GDP."" Obama and other Democrats have used that to estimate that the health care bill would cut deficits by over $1 trillion dollars in the second 10 years, but that's such a speculative number we rated Obama's claim Half True. Still, it's worth noting that the CBO anticipates even bigger savings in the law's second 10 years. 
•  The plan does not account for the annual Medicare ""doc fix"" which the CBO estimates could cost the government an additional $208 billion.  
This relates to laws that limit the amount paid to Medicare doctors. Because lower payments (relative to the private market) could discourage doctors from accepting Medicare patients, Congress has regularly provided ""doctor fixes"" to bring payments closer to private market rates. 
One could certainly argue that this problem ought to be addressed in a comprehensive health care reform law, but it's also true that this problem would exist with or without the new health care law, which is why Democrats left it out -- it would certainly have driven up the cost of the legislation. 
• Even the government experts express skepticism that Congress can stick to the schedule of reduced payments to Medicare. 
In an April 22, 2010, letter, Richard Foster, chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, warned some of the estimated Medicare savings ""may be unrealistic."" 
""Simulations by the Office of the Actuary suggest that roughly 15 percent of (Medicare) Part A providers would become unprofitable within the 10-year projection period as a result of the productivity adjustments,"" Foster wrote. ""Although this policy could be monitored over time to avoid such an outcome, changes would likely result in smaller actual savings than shown here for these provisions."" 
And in his Jan. 6, 2011, letter to Boehner, CBO's Elmendorf wrote that ""current law now includes a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a long period of time"" including the law's reduced payments to Medicare providers. 
In other words, they aren't convinced Congress will have the stomach for the reduced Medicare payments over the long haul. 
In a House Budget Committee hearing on the fiscal consequences of the health care law on Jan. 27, 2011, Foster reiterated his concern that some of the estimated savings from Medicare may ""turn out to be politically unsustainable over the years."" Because of that and other factors, Foster said, ""it is important to note that the actual future costs for Medicare are likely to exceed those shown by the current-law projections in this report.

Foster was asked directly if it was true or false that the health care law would keep costs down.  ""I would say false, more so than true,'' Foster responded.

In a letter to the committee, James Capretta, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned that ""if these taxes and spending cuts do not materialize, the new law will be a budget-buster of significant proportions.""

But not everyone agrees that the Medicare cuts are unrealistic.

In a letter to the budget committee, Van de Water stated, ""The record demonstrates that Congress has repeatedly adopted measures to produce considerable savings in Medicare and has let them take effect.""

And in a White House blog post, Stephanie Cutter, a top aide helping to guide political strategy on health care, responded to Foster's testimony: ""Once again, we disagree. History shows that it is possible to implement measures that will save money for Medicare and the federal government.""

Again, some of these issues raised by Ryan are more legitimate than others. Yes, the CBO estimate did not include the administrative cost necessary to implement the new health care policies, but that comes to $10 to $20 billion. Most of the $115 billion cited in Ryan's press release are discretionary appropriations related to prior laws (in other words, unrelated to the new health care law). We also think there is some friendly timing that allows the CLASS program to look profitable in a 10-year window, even though it's likely to be quite expensive in the long-term. Still, we note that the CBO projects that over the second 10 years, the health care law is expected to reduce the deficit even more.

Almost every expert from every side on the health care law would agree that there's a lot of uncertainty involved in projecting its budget impact. Looking strictly at the CBO's analysis of the budget effect of the health care law, it is a deficit-reducer, both in the short and long term. But Ryan points to several legitimate concerns about the assumptions made by the CBO -- particularly whether reduced Medicare payments are sustainable -- assumptions that even the CBO and Medicare's chief actuary noted may be suspect. The fate of those cuts may largely determine whether the new health care law ends up in the red or black. For now, though, those cuts are law. Congress would have to act to reduce or eliminate them. So Ryan is overplaying his hand when he claims the law is ""accelerating our country toward bankruptcy."" We rate his claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/27/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-claims-health-care-law-accelerating-/

Michele Bachmann, in State of the Union rebuttal, says government employment grew as jobs overall declined
","
In her Tea Party Express-sponsored rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., sought to draw a contrast between the hemorrhaging of jobs nationally and an expansion of jobs in government.

""While the government grew,"" she said, ""we lost more than 2 million jobs.""

Analyzing this comment is somewhat tricky, because Bachmann’s time frame is open to interpretation (and her office didn’t return our inquiry seeking an explanation). Earlier in her comments, she referred to the jobless rate ""within three months"" after the stimulus bill became law, and she also referred to the month when the unemployment rate hit 9.4 percent. Since May 2009 fits both of those descriptions, we’ll assume Bachmann was using that as her yardstick.

She’s also vague about which populations she’s measuring. When she says ""the government,"" she could mean any one of three things -- government as a whole (federal, state and local), the federal government only or the federal government minus the U.S. Postal Service, a carve-out sometimes used by economists. And when she says that ""we lost more than 2 million jobs,"" she could mean employment overall or private-sector employment only (as a counterpoint to the government employment she cited in the first half of the comparison).

Because we don't know which she meant, we looked at all these options.

To do this, we examined data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official arbiter of employment data. Here’s how the data breaks down between May 2009 and December 2010, the most recent month for which figures are available:

• All government employment (federal, state and local). Start: 22,628,000. End: 22,259,000. Change: Down 369,000.

• Federal government employment. Start: 2,865,000. End: 2,852,000. Change: Down 13,000.

• Federal government employment minus the U.S. Postal Service. Start: 2,156,000. End: 2,208,700. Change: Up 52,700.

• Total national employment. Start: 131,155,000. End: 130,712,000. Change: Down 443,000.

• Total private sector employment. Start: 108,527,000. End: 108,453,000. Change: Down 74,000.

So let’s look first at whether ""the government grew."" Bachmann would be wrong if she meant to refer either to total government (federal, state and local) or to total federal employment. Both of those measures lost jobs during that period.

However, she’d be correct if she meant that non-Postal Service federal employment grew.

Now, what about Bachmann’s claim that ""we lost more than 2 million jobs""?

Neither total national employment nor private-sector employment declined by anything close to her number -- at least during the period she appeared to specify. To get to 2 million total jobs lost, you have to move the baseline back to February 2009. Shifting the time frame three months in one direction or the other wouldn’t ordinarily make much of a difference, but in this case, it does, because job losses nationally were so steep during early 2009. Total employment fell from 132,823,000 in February 2009 to 130,594,000 in May, down 2.2 million jobs, and now stands at 130,712,000, down 2.1 million.

So where does this leave us? When measured in two common ways, Bachmann is wrong about government jobs increasing, but she’s right using a third, less intuitive measurement -- that is, for federal employment not including the U.S. Postal Service.

As for total employment, she’s off by quite a bit if you begin the clock in May 2009, but you only have to move the time frame back by three months in order to meet her 2 million threshold.

So one part of her statement is untrue except by one uncommon measurement, and the other part is incorrect if the starting date is May 2009 but accurate counting from February 2009 and in tune with the general trend since the start of Obama’s term. On balance, we rate her comment Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-state-union-rebuttal-says-govern/

Florida is tops for staged auto accidents, Jeff Atwater says
","
At the AP Legislative Planning Session on Jan. 19, 2011, Florida’s chief financial officer lobbed a claim about auto insurance shenanigans.

""Of the top five cities for staged automobile accidents, three are in Florida. … We rank No. 1 in the country in staged auto accidents,"" Jeff Atwater said.

We have long known that Florida is special, the reluctant recipient of certain superlatives. These two claims seemed almost too good to be true, but were they? We decided to delve in.

Atwater made the remarks less than a week after the topic of fabricating car crashes for cash grabbed several headlines, including a front-page story in the Jan. 16 edition of the Miami Herald. A story earlier in the week chronicled the arrest of five people in Miami-Dade and a sixth in Naples. They were charged with faking car accidents after police say they hired people to stage wrecks or file false claims with insurance companies using drivers’ personal injury protection insurance policies.

All told, the scammers billed insurance companies up to $170,000 for medical treatment that was never performed, according to the Florida Division of Insurance Fraud. 
The issue of fraud related to personal injury protection, or PIP, insurance has been of interest to Atwater. His office issued a press release reporting that PIP-related fraud costs the average Florida family as much as $400 a year. Four Florida cities are among the top 10 in PIP fraud – Hialeah, Tampa, Orlando and, yes, Miami. The Herald reported that more than 400 people were charged in the past two years with PIP fraud.

And so, Atwater vowed to keep a spotlight on PIP fraud.

""The thieves committing these scams need to know that it’s my plan to put them behind bars,"" said Atwater, a Republican from North Palm Beach.

It was only a few days later that Atwater talked about the fraud cases in Florida at the AP meeting. According to spokeswoman Alexis Lambert, his statements were based on a May 10, 2010, report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an Illinois not-for-profit that teams up with various insurers and law enforcement agencies in an effort to prosecute insurance criminals.

The study showed that reports of ""staged accident questionable claims"" spiked 46 percent from 2007 through 2009.

The top five states that generated the most ""staged accident QCs,"" or questionable claims, were: (1) Florida, 3,006; (2) New York, 1,680; (3) California, 1,619; (4) Texas, 792; and (5) Illinois, 433.

The five cities that saw the ""most staged accident QCs"" were: (1) New York, 1,304; (2) Tampa, 562; (3) Miami, 511 (4) Orlando, 422; and (5) Houston, 376.

These revelations don’t come as a surprise to observers.

""I think it’s a generality that Florida ranks well up there,"" said James Quiggle, a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a Washington, D.C., anti-fraud watchdog. ""I don’t think anyone who sees the national picture will dispute that.""

According to a 2007-2008 report from the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, Florida led the nation in 2005 in the recovery of insurance fraud-related losses through court-ordered restitution. These court findings suggest Florida has ranked high across the board.

Despite his intention to put a spotlight on auto insurance fraud, Atwater fails to note that the numbers are for ""questionable claims."" These, according to National Insurance Crime Bureau spokesman Frank Scafidi, are not the same as actual staged accidents.

An analogy might be the difference between a charge and a conviction. The terms may often be used interchangeably, but law enforcement personnel and attorneys certainly know the difference.

""We stress to people to keep in mind that these are initial referrals and not definitive acts of fraud, although most of these will certainly be fraud,"" Scafidi wrote in an e-mail message.

Scafidi elaborated. In 2009, NICB reports that there were 85,201 questionable claims submitted and just 4,802 of that number were related to staged accidents. In an average year, he notes, more than 48 million claims are filed by the Insurance Services Office, a company that maintains claims data. That said, only 0.17 percent of the claims were deemed suspicious or questionable, and only about one in 20 of those involved questions of staged accidents.

The sample is not enough to draw conclusions on, Scafidi added, but, ""It is a useful tool for analysis and for us to see where the potential fraud hot spots are.""

Atwater is mostly correct about the high numbers of auto fraud cases coming from Florida, but he neglects to mention that the numbers he referred to are ""questionable claims,"" not yet confirmed as actual staged accidents. It’s an important detail. For omitting that clarification, we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/27/jeff-atwater/Florida-tops-staged-auto-accidents-Jeff-Atwater/
"['Candidate Biography', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Abele']","
Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele says opponent Jeff Stone = Scott Walker
","
A doppelganger is a ghostly double of a living person. In German it means ""double walker.""

In the case of a new TV ad from Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele, it would be ""double Scott Walker.""

Naturally, state Rep. Jeff Stone -- Abele’s opponent in the April 5 election -- is the alleged double.

In a new TV ad with B-movie special effects, Abele presents Stone and the new Republican governor as scary, bleached-out phantoms in ideological lockstep on the ""unfair"" state budget repair law. Stone, the ad claims, will copy a Walker agenda that has ""mismanaged"" Milwaukee County government.

""I thought he was Scott Walker’s twin,"" a man identified as David Crowley of Milwaukee County says into the camera. Later, he adds: ""Jeff Stone is Scott Walker.""

Last fall in the governor’s race, we looked at the Republican primary ad Scott Walker used to equate opponent Mark Neumann with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We labeled Walker’s claim -- ""Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi,"" for shorthand -- and found it False.

Here, Abele’s ad essentially equates Stone with Walker.

So: Does Stone = Walker?

Of course, depending on where a voter sits, the degree of similarity could be considered a good thing or a bad thing.

But it’s worth evaluating, because both sides have made Stone’s ties to Walker a theme -- Stone ran as Walker’s logical successor for most of the race, and Abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense.

We asked the Abele campaign to back up the claim. They provided an analysis of voting records and pointed us to public statements and other evidence.

""They are overwhelmingly similar, and Jeff would represent a continuation of Scott Walker’s approach to governing,"" said Brandon Lorenz, Abele’s spokesman.

We’ll look at Walker and Stones’ statements about each other, as well as their voting histories, common causes, priorities, styles and backgrounds.

Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. They served in the Legislature together for about four years -- even carpooling together -- with Walker taking the higher profile.

Walker is seven years younger, at 43, but they got into elected politics within a year of each other. Stone started locally, as a Greenfield city alderman. Walker, from Wauwatosa, won a state Assembly seat.

Both considered the Milwaukee County exec’s job in 2002 after a pension scandal forced out F. Thomas Ament; only Walker jumped in. Stone helped Walker get elected. Now Stone wants to take over for Walker, and the governor says Stone -- whom he has endorsed and raised campaign money for -- would be a crucial local ally in reducing spending.

Stone and Walker’s statements:

Walker touted Stone in February 2010 as a worthy successor, saying he was ""interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas"" that Walker has backed. That confirmed the impression at the Courthouse, dating back years, that Stone was the GOP’s candidate in waiting.

Stone has consistently praised Walker.

It should be noted though that from the start of his campaign he has said that his small-business experience would make him more focused on job creation than Walker, who Stone said was focused primarily on reforming county government after the pension scandal.

Are they close ideologically and by temperament?

Stone said in March 2011 that he and Walker share ""similar aspirations"" and ""a similarity in how we go about things. He urged a conservative audience: ""Vote for the person who’s going to move Milwaukee County forward along the lines of what Scott Walker has.""

Stone’s pre-primary campaign literature implored voters to back him to preserve gains being made during Walker’s tenure.

At times since Walker’s budget attracted massive protests in Madison this winter, Stone cautiously has tried to separate himself. He has said he will be less confrontational.

""I voted for the budget, but I'm not Scott Walker,"" said Stone. ""I'm Jeff Stone. I have a very different way of managing and doing business.""

Stone voted for Walker’s controversial budget-repair law, but later signaled he would not have tried to sharply curtail union bargaining rights if it had been up to him -- a position that earned him a Half Flip.

He voted for the business tax cuts Walker pushed in January’s special session.

Common Assembly voting history:

Stone and Walker overlapped in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002, when Walker was elected county executive. Stone has operated closer to power during his legislative career than did Walker (1993-2002). Stone served on the Legislature’s  budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Walker made his mark mostly on law enforcement issues.

Research by Abele’s camp on more than 1,400 common votes shows Stone and Walker agreed 96 percent of the time. Stone doesn’t dispute that number.

There’s a limit, though, to how much insight comes from examining a mass of votes by two members of the same party, because most lawmakers vote the party line most of the time, and so many votes are minor.

So we looked at some ratings by a sampling of special interest groups on key legislation. The verdict: Stone and Walker have remarkably similar profiles, though not identical ones. 
Top priorities:

On the issues, Stone has adopted Walker’s signature anti-tax stance and similarly endorses smaller government. Stone and Walker jointly have proposed various tax cuts over the years. Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting.

The most notable difference: public transit.

Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue.

""He’s been a great transit advocate for a decade,"" Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone.

There are limits to Stone’s support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walker’s stance against federal help for a high-speed train.

But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament.

Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion.

Experience:

Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to ""do it my way.""

We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares.

He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that he’s made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker.

Their biggest difference, Stone said, is ""vastly different life experiences and what we’ve done in our career."" Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election.

He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker.

""I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker,"" he said at a candidate forum.

Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Let’s review.

Abele’s strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walker’s agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups.

They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stone’s willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stone’s business experience is a notable biographical difference.

In the end, Abele’s equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/30/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/

Michele Bachmann says the government tells us what light bulbs to buy
","
Rep. Michele Bachmann said we've spent a lot of money over the past few years, but we don't have much to show for it. Bachmann gave a response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on behalf of two tea party groups.

""Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy and which may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill,"" Bachmann said in her January 25, 2010 response to the State of the Union, delivered at the request of the Tea Party Express and Tea Party HD. Bachmann is a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Minnesota.

Her statement caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. Here, we'll look at her claim about light bulbs. We'll look at her statement about IRS agents in a separate item.

We've looked into light bulbs before, when PolitiFact Texas examined a similar statement by Texas Gov. Rick Perry.

What our Texas colleagues found: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for incandescent lamps (light bulbs), incandescent reflector lamps (like track lighting in your kitchen) and fluorescent lamps, according to a 2007 report from the Congressional Research Service.

In June 2009, Obama announced more changes for lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said such fluorescent and incandescent lamps represented approximately 38 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of total lighting energy use.

PolitiFact Texas also found a June 2010 editorial in the Washington Times objecting to Federal Trade Commission-issued regulations of light-bulb labels. The editorial said the regs were ordered by Congress as part of its 2007 decision to force the more efficient, curlicue-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb ""on a public that so far has refused to embrace it willingly."" Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the editorial says, ""bureaucratic rules will phase in,"" and conventional 100-watt bulbs ""will be first on the contraband list.""

Jen Stutsman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Energy, told PolitiFact Texas in November that conventional incandescent bulbs as currently manufactured are not expected to meet the efficiency standards Congress set. However, the government expects manufacturers to improve incandescent technologies to meet the higher standards, or consumers will move to compact fluorescent light bulbs, LED technologies or halogens. She said new standards for 100-watt bulbs take effect in January 2012. New standards for 75-watt bulbs start in 2013, and standards for 60- and 40-watt bulbs start in 2014.

Stutsman said the expected shifts aren't equivalent to the government telling Americans which light bulbs to use. ""Under no circumstances does it say that a consumer must purchase a specific type of light bulb,"" Stutsman said.

Finally, PolitiFact Texas talked with the Dallas-based American Lighting Association, a trade group whose director of engineering and technology, Terry McGowan, said in an e-mail that it's a stretch to say federal laws are telling us what light bulbs to buy. ""Federal law is requiring that household light bulbs be made more efficient in steps over time as a nationwide energy-saving measure. It's like saying that new cars will have to deliver more miles/gallon. Maybe some people would say that's mandating what kind of car to buy, but that's an interpretation -- especially if many cars on the market can meet the miles/gallon requirement,"" McGowan said.

""There will still be household light bulbs available,"" McGowan's e-mail said, noting later that special-purpose bulbs used in appliances or for decorative purposes are exempted. ""One thing is for sure, what we use for lighting our homes will take some thought -- and maybe we'll be changing what we decide to do.""

So, is Washington telling us what kind of bulb to use?

Not yet, though the 2007 law steps up efficiency requirements, and that's expected to result in consumers purchasing and using different bulbs. These factors give Bachmann's statement an element of truth -- but not much more. We rate it Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/26/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-government-tells-us-what-lig/
