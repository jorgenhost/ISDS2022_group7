Weatherford misstates rate of state's college-ready graduates
","Even though Florida’s graduation rate is much better than it used to be, there is still room for improvement in terms of college readiness, House Speaker Will Weatherford said. Just one in three students is ready for college when he or she graduates high school. ""That’s a problem, that’s a real problem,"" Weatherford said Sept. 10 as the guest speaker at a Suncoast Tiger Bay luncheon. ""So while we’re having this debate about Common Core, and the grading system, and how much we pay our teachers, and how we should assess our students’ performance, just remember that one out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there."" Weatherford earlier joked about intense PolitiFact coverage of ""every word that comes out of my mouth,"" so we knew his team would not be surprised by us asking for backup of his claim that ""one out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there."" Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy responded to our inquiry on Twitter, directing us to Florida Department of Education data for the percentage of 2011 public high school graduates who took the SAT, ACT or CPT and scored at or above college-level scores. The state average was 64.7 percent. As Miami Herald political reporter Marc Caputo pointed out, that actually means two out of every three high school students graduates public school college-ready. Not one in three, as Weatherford said. Duffy acknowledged the flub. He insisted Weatherford has cited the statistic correctly in the past. Our ruling For us, the facts here aligned pretty easily (thanks, Twitter). Weatherford said one in three Florida students graduates high school prepared for college. Based on Florida Department of Education data, it’s two in three. We rate Weatherford’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809697C200>],/factchecks/2013/sep/11/will-weatherford/weatherford-misstates-rate-states-college-ready-gr/

Alan Grayson said Russia said on the record that it would replace weapons U.S. destroys in airstrikes
","As the United States seemed to be headed toward a congressional showdown over whether to authorize a bombing of Syria -- and before Russia brokered a proposal that seemed to slow the rush to a military strike -- Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., offered several arguments against military action during an interview with the Washington Post’s Wonkblog column. One of the arguments Grayson made was that whatever the United States destroyed, Russia would simply replace. The comment alluded to the staunch support Russia had provided its longtime ally during the uprising and civil war that began in 2011. In the Sept. 7, 2013, interview with the Post’s Ezra Klein, Grayson said, ""My understanding of the target plan is that it focuses on military infrastructure: Things like rocket launchers and runways and aircraft. In theory, the idea is this is the infrastructure that delivers chemical weapons, but in practice, it’s punishing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by degrading his general military capabilities."" One of the problems, Grayson responded, ""is that the Russians will replace the weapons immediately. They’ve said it on the record. They’ve suggested they might even replace it with better stuff."" When we asked Grayson’s office for support for their claim, they provided several pieces of evidence. Putin’s comment at a press conference The first was a comment made by Russian leader Vladimir Putin at a press conference following the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg. Question: ""You said once that there is no way Russia will ever intervene in a military conflict in Syria. However, if hostilities do begin, will Russia provide any aid to the country?"" Putin: ""Hostilities are already under way."" Question: ""I was talking about a foreign military intervention. Will Russia help Syria? Which country do you think is likely to find itself in a situation like Syria's?"" Putin: ""You know, I don't even want to think about it -- to think that another country might find itself the target of foreign aggression. Will we be helping Syria? Yes, we will. We are helping now. We are supplying arms and providing economic cooperation. I hope we will further expand humanitarian cooperation, including humanitarian aid and support for the civilian population, people who have found themselves in a very difficult situation in that country."" While this falls short of a clear statement that Russia would replace weapons destroyed in a U.S. attack, the exchange does reinforce the idea that Russia has been selling arms to Syria, and Putin made no indication that such assistance will stop. Putin’s interview with the Associated Press and Russia’s Channel One In an interview with the Associated Press and Russia’s Channel One before the G-20 summit, Putin discussed the status of an existing contract to supply Syria with the S-300, a surface-to-air missile that one Australian analyst described as ""rapidly deployable ... and highly lethal"" to military aircraft. The system has been a particular bone of contention internationally. Russia has said the missiles are defensive and are needed by the Syrian government to fight the rebels. But in May, Israel and the United States asked Russia not to deliver S-300s to Syria, arguing that they could block Israel’s air force from operating along the Syrian and Lebanese border, according to the Jerusalem Post. In the interview before the G-20 summit, Putin said scheduled deliveries of the S-300 had been partially fulfilled but are now ""suspended."" (Officially, the reason was that Syria had stopped paying for them, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported.) Putin added, however, that ""if we witness that some steps are being taken in violation of the effective international regulations, we will think it over how we should act in the future, particularly regarding the supplies of such sensitive weapons in some regions of the world,"" Putin said. Putin added that Russia continues to provide Syria with supplies and maintenance because Russia feels ""we are cooperating with the legitimate government and, meanwhile, do not violate any provisions of international law and any our commitments. … The United Nations Organization imposed no restrictions on the weapons supplies in Syria."" Finally, Putin referenced two advanced models, the S-400 and S-500, but he didn’t explicitly say in the interview that he would provide the enhanced technology to Syria. In all, then, Putin reiterated that he is continuing arms sales with Syria, and he suggested that an attack by the U.S. or other outside countries could cause it to revive currently suspended deliveries related to a key surface-to-air missile. But this was couched as a possibility, not a certainty, and he did not explicitly say Russia would send Syria technology more advanced than what Syria had already been promised. Dempsey’s Senate testimony Another piece of evidence was testimony given by Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As for Dempsey’s testimony, the comments came in response to a question from Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. ""You talked about the Russians now having four vessels in the eastern Mediterranean, but you did not seem to be that concerned about it,"" Markey said. ""Syria is a proxy state of Russia. They provide the military assistance, the training to Syria. Are you concerned in any way that a strike by the United States could increase the amount of military assistance that Russia sends into the Syrian regime?"" Dempsey responded, ""It could, senator. … There is some indication that they have assured the regime that if we destroy something, they can replace it. But you know, that's not a reason for me to hesitate to act."" By specifically suggesting that Russia would actually replace something the United States destroyed, Dempsey’s comment goes somewhat further than Putin did. But it is also couched with the phrase ""there is some indication that,"" which suggests that there’s a degree of doubt or conflicting evidence. In addition, while Dempsey would presumably be apprised of any U.S. intelligence on Russia’s intentions, he -- unlike Putin -- can’t be marshaled as evidence that Russia has said what it plans to do ""on the record."" Additional comments Grayson’s office also cited comments by retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a military analyst with Fox News, and British defense analyst Francis Tusa, but neither reflects what Russia said ""on the record."" Finally, Grayson spokeswoman Lauren Doney said that Grayson ""sees both unclassified and classified information, the sources and details of which he obviously cannot discuss."" But secret intelligence cannot be considered on the record, so we will not factor it into our rating. Our ruling Grayson said that in the event of a U.S. strike on Syria, ""the Russians will replace the weapons immediately. They’ve said it on the record. They’ve suggested they might even replace it with better stuff."" Grayson’s office offered an array of evidence, but none of it definitively proves his claim. Putin’s comments -- the only ones that could support a claim about what Russia has said ""on the record"" -- suggest that Russia is reserving the right to replace Syrian military hardware destroyed by a U.S. attack, but the Russian leader’s own words do not go as far Grayson suggests. Grayson has not provided proof that Russia has said it ""will"" pursue that course, or that Russia will do so ""immediately."" There is also no indication that Russia would supply Syria with more advanced weapons than the ones destroyed. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976A7840>],/factchecks/2013/sep/11/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-said-russia-would-replace-any-weapons/

Do 7 out of 10 Oregon families in poverty have a working parent?
","A common and perhaps reasonable assumption is that people who are poor don’t have jobs. But in an Aug. 7, 2013, infographic on its website, the left-leaning Oregon Center for Public Policy wrote that ""7 out of 10 Oregon families living in poverty have at least one parent who works."" Was this the debunking of a common myth about those in poverty? Do a full 70 percent of Oregon families in poverty have a parent who works? We first rang Chuck Sheketoff, the executive director of the Silverton-based center, who said that the figure was part of the center’s June 27, 2013, ""Working But Still Poor"" fact sheet. ""Work is not a sure path out of poverty,"" it said. A pie chart on the second page says that 69 percent of families in poverty were ""working families,"" composed of 22 percent who had ""at least one parent working full time"" and 47 percent who had ""at least one parent working less than full time."" About 31 percent of the families had no parent working.   The numbers were from the center’s analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2011 American Community Survey data. Sheketoff pointed us to Jason Gettel, the center’s policy analyst who crunched those numbers. Gettel explained that he used DataFerrett, a free data analysis program promoted on the Census Bureau’s website. DataFerrett allows users to analyze all of the survey responses to carve out data in different ways. ""We wanted to see what proportion of families in poverty had a worker present to show that people do live in poverty despite the fact that they work,"" Gettel said. ""They’re there because some jobs pay too little, or they’ve been laid off for some period of time, but not because they don’t put forth a work effort."" Gettel walked us through DataFerrett and showed us how he selected certain variables in order to limit the survey responses to arrive at the ""7 out of 10"" number. He limited the data to only the Oregon families who are in poverty with a related child. He then searched for types of work experience by different family members, such as ""householder worked full-time in the past 12 months and spouse worked full time in the past 12 months"" or ""female householder worked less than full-time in the past 12 months and no spouse present."" Finally, the numbers were weighted to more accurately reflect statewide numbers, since the American Community Survey does not count as many people as the 2010 U.S. Census. The analysis showed that there were 437,991 families with children in Oregon. Of those, 86,255 were in poverty. This is the pool of Oregon families we would use for further calculations. Next we did some simple addition and subtraction. We first added up the 3,042 families where neither the householder nor the spouse worked; the 4,429 families where single male householders did not work; and the 19,339 families where single female householders did not work. This showed us that 26,810 of the 86,255 Oregon families with children had a parent who did not work in the previous year, roughly 31 percent. Put another way, 59,445 Oregon families with children in poverty — 69 percent — had a parent who worked at least part time in the previous year. It’s worth noting here that the Census data only breaks down work experience by three different types and only over a 12-month period: full-time work, less than full-time work, or no work. That means somebody who last worked a one-month retail job during the 2012 holiday season would qualify as a less than full-time worker. We’re not sure that most people count that as a parent who works. Indeed, government officials generally categorize people unemployed for six months or longer as ""long-term unemployed."" We also want to note that ""poverty"" is defined as the federal poverty threshold. For 2011, that threshold was $18,123 for a single parent with two children and $22,811 for a two-parent family with two children. The threshold varies depending on the number of adults and children and whether the adults are under 65 years old. Next we wanted to verify that Gettel had used the right variables to arrive at the right numbers. DataFerrett, to put it nicely, is not the most intuitive program for the average user. We called the U.S. Census Bureau, where a survey statistician in the poverty statistics branch also used DataFerrett to check our variables and numbers. ""The process that was used was the correct process,"" said Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman. ""The end result was this 69 percent figure."" Lastly, we wondered if similar studies had been done. Again, we turned to the Census Bureau. One table indicated that nearly 64 percent of Oregon families with income below the poverty level in the previous year had a worker in the family. Those data were from the 2011 American Community Survey. Another 2011 Census table based on national data showed that, of the 33.1 million people in families in poverty, 21.1 million individuals were in families with at least one worker — about 64 percent. Neither of those studies was limited to families with children. We looked at some other studies, too, and saw similar percentages. None of these studies is a perfect apples-to-apples comparison to the Oregon Center for Public Policy’s data, but they show that the Oregon center’s numbers are within range of what similar studies have found. The Oregon Center for Public Policy wrote that ""7 out of 10 Oregon families living in poverty have at least one parent who works."" We checked Gettel’s analysis and confirmed his results. We also confirmed the analysis and numbers with the U.S. Census Bureau. While the numbers are accurate, under the survey design, somebody classified by federal employment officials as ""long-term unemployed"" could be counted as working under the Census definition. We think that’s an important clarification. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809697CF40>],/factchecks/2013/sep/11/oregon-center-public-policy/do-7-out-10-oregon-families-poverty-have-working-p/

Menominee tribe says Kenosha casino would be one of Wisconsin’s largest employers and its largest taxpayer
","Since 1998, Wisconsin’s Indian tribes have won more than $15 billion from gamblers at 25 sites scattered throughout the state. About a nickel on the dollar from that revenue haul was sent back to the state through agreements that vary depending on the tribe. In essence, that money represents what is known as a payment in lieu of taxes, since the tribes -- as sovereign nations -- are exempt from taxation. The state’s piece of the pie was in the news in late August 2013 when plans for an $800 million casino in Kenosha, to be operated by the Menominee tribe, won approval from federal officials. That put the project in the hands of Gov. Scott Walker, who has sole veto power over it. Opponents, most notably the Forest County Potawatomi tribe, which runs an off-reservation casino in Milwaukee, quickly argued that its facility will lose market share and suffer job losses if the Menominee plan advances. But Menominee officials say a new casino complex fits ""hand-in-hand"" with Walker’s goal of creating 250,000 new jobs in his four-year term. It is especially important, the tribe’s casinokenosha.com site says, when ""recent statistics show Wisconsin lags behind the rest of the country in private-sector job creation"" and ""Illinois comes ever-closer to putting a new casino on its side of the state line."" On the website, the tribe makes this claim: ""The Kenosha casino would be one of the state’s largest employers and pay more to the state than any other company or Tribe – essentially, it would be Wisconsin’s biggest taxpayer."" Let’s take this claim out for a spin on the Truth-O-Meter. A note before we deal the first hand: For this item, we are not checking the projections on the jobs or payments, which depend on a host of future events. But we can examine whether the predicted size would, in effect, make the casino a leading employer and payer to state government. Employment In Kenosha, the Menominee tribe says that if the multi-phase project is completed, it will mean an estimated 3,300 full-time jobs in the casino itself and related retail and hotel facilities.  It won’t be fully up and running for several years under the best-case scenario. By way of comparison, the Potawatomi Bingo Casino operation in Milwaukee -- where revenues are smaller than those projected at the Menominee facility -- has 2,631 full-time jobs and expects to add 230 more at a hotel it is building at the site. That casino is the largest in the state in revenue produced. To make its case that it would be ""one of the state’s largest employers,"" the tribe points to a 2013 ranking of Milwaukee-area private sector employers based on a survey by The Business Journal. Based on that, the Kenosha facility would rank as the 21st largest employer in Milwaukee, Kenosha, Racine, Walworth, Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties. We found no statewide rankings, and privacy laws block state and federal officials from publishing precise employment figures by company. But only 100 of the state’s more than 150,000 private employers have more than 1,000 workers. And only 21 of the state’s more than 5,000 local governments employ more than 1,000. So the tribe’s claim that it would be ""one of the state’s largest employers"" is on target, though we note the tribe is comparing current jobs figures at private companies to casino projections down the road. State payment The compact between the state of Wisconsin and the Menominee tribe spells out how much of the tribe’s gambling revenue would be sent to the state. The state is guaranteed 7 percent of the facility’s ""net win"" -- the amount lost by gamblers -- in year one of operations. Over the next four years, the payment is 7 to 7.5 percent, depending on revenue. Beyond five years, it’s 7.5 percent. (By comparison, the Potawatomi have paid between 6 percent and 8 percent, and are currently at 6.5.) The Menominee would also make payments to local governments, but the statement was ""pay more to the state,"" so that is what we are looking at. We found three different projections for the would-be casino’s ""net win."" The federal report that approved the Kenosha casino quoted a market study prepared for the tribe. That study predicted a $440 million net win in year three at the Kenosha casino. An earlier study for the tribe put the figure at $482 million. Both estimates were in 2004 dollars, however. Factoring in inflation, the revenue figure grows to more than $540 million in today’s dollars. By our calculations, the Menominee tribe could be paying the state more than $40 million a year within a few years of opening -- if its projections hold up.  Even using the lowest of the three figures, and not accounting for inflation, the payment could top $32 million. The Potawatomi revenue haul is smaller right now than those Menominee projections -- $363 million in fiscal 2013 plus its state payment of between $20 million and $30 million, according to Journal Sentinel estimates. It’s impossible to know what the Potawatomi payment would be if the Kenosha casino opens. But the Potawatomi tribe says a Kenosha casino could cut into its market and reduce its revenue by roughly one-third at the Milwaukee casino. Experts quibble with that estimate but don’t doubt the Milwaukee casino will take a hit of some size. It’s reasonable to conclude the Menominee payment would be larger than that paid by the Potawatomi. That would make its payment the largest from any tribe, based on estimates. But would its payment be larger when taxes from all private companies are factored in? We’ll look only at the income tax, because the tribal payments -- while not called a tax -- are in effect a charge against income. Again, there’s a timing problem here. We have the projected Menominee payment starting several years for now if the casino gets all needed approvals. We don’t know what private companies’ tax bills will be at that point, since such bills can vary widely year by year. Drawing a conclusion, though, is made easier by looking at what we do know about corporate tax payments. In Wisconsin, net income tax payments are public, for a fee and subject to various limitations. Jack Norman, a consultant and former research director for the Institute for Wisconsin’s Future, purchased hundreds of reports of company tax payments from the state over more than a decade. In doing so, Norman obtained tax data on many of the largest companies in Wisconsin through tax year 2009. The largest tax payment Norman discovered was $26.59 million paid by Harley-Davidson in 2004. The figure was an aggregate of Wisconsin income taxes collected from three units under the Harley umbrella. The second-largest payment Norman found was by Wisconsin Power & Light (and parent company Alliant Energy): $15.37 million. The projected Menominee payment easily tops those numbers. We can’t be certain a company has not paid more since Norman’s research ended. But we purchased the record of Harley-Davidson’s payments for 2011 and 2010, the latest available. They were $1.27 million and $704,625, respectively. And a utility spokesman told us that Wisconsin Power and Light (and its parent, Alliant Energy) paid a total of $170,000 in 2012. Tax payments can vary widely year to year based on fluctuations in taxable income, tax strategies and the availability of tax breaks. Our rating The Menominee contend that ""the Kenosha casino would be one of the state’s largest employers and pay more to the state than any other company or Tribe – essentially, it would be Wisconsin’s biggest taxpayer."" It’s a difficult claim to assess, but we found compelling evidence it’s accurate when comparing the projections for a future Kenosha casino with the biggest taxpayers and employers in the state in recent years. If we get new information on corporate tax payments that is relevant to this item, we’ll revisit our ruling. For now, with the clarifications noted concerning the timing problem inherent in the tribe’s comparison, we rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809713A300>],/factchecks/2013/sep/11/menominee-indian-tribe-wisconsin/menominee-tribe-says-kenosha-casino-would-be-one-w/

Rand Paul: Syrian rebels behead priests and eat hearts
","A major conundrum facing the United States in Syria is the prevalence of Islamic extremists, some with links to al-Qaida, among the rebel forces. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Syrian President Bashar Assad is probably a war criminal but some of his opponents are equally dangerous. ""We've seen priests beheaded by the Islamic rebels on the other side,"" Paul said on the inaugural edition of CNN’s relaunched Crossfire. ""We've also seen an Islamic rebel eating the heart of a soldier."" These are dramatic and gruesome claims that have great staying power on the Web, so we decided to see if we could verify them.  The short answer is that rebels gunned down a priest but didn’t behead him. And a rebel commander made a show of cutting organs from a dead Syrian soldier but denies actually taking a bite. The Franciscan priest A California-based news service called Catholic Online was one of the first to report the beheading of Francois Murad, a priest at a monastery in northern Syria. The killing took place on June 23, 2013, and the article appeared on June 30. There was graphic video of three men kneeling on the ground. As a crowd cheers, rebels cut their heads off. The early reports claimed the Vatican confirmed the death of the priest and took that to be confirmation that he was beheaded. The Blaze, the website of conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, carried an item of its own on June 30. The headline couched the claim as ""allegedly"" but the first line of the article was slightly less reserved with ""Syrian Catholic priest Francois Murad killed last weekend by jihadi fighters was beheaded, according to a report by Catholic Online, which is linking to video purportedly showing the brutal murder."" The Blaze article garnered nearly 41,000 re-postings on Facebook. Other websites followed with their own versions on July 1. But a more accurate account was available within hours of the original report. On June 30, an editor for the British newspaper The Telegraph, initially linked to the story of the beheading, and then issued this correction: ""I need to update and correct reports that Fr. Francois Murad, a Franciscan friar, was beheaded last week. The priest was actually shot inside his church, it seems – and the video of a beheading, which went viral, does not depict him. The Vatican was widely quoted as confirming the beheading, but an investigation by the Telegraph's Ruth Sherlock has established that this attribution was false."" We found no dispute that a jihadi group, Jabhat al-Nusra, conducted the attack. Murad was shot eight times. A fellow Franciscan collected his body, and he was buried in a nearby village. By July 2, CNN also aimed to set the record straight. An article emphasized that the rebels had killed but not beheaded the priest. The next day, two other news operations followed up with their own corrections: the right-leaning CNSnews.com (""Syrian Rebels Did Not Behead Franciscan Priest--They Shot Him 8 Times"") and the New York Daily News (""Catholic priest NOT among three beheaded on video by Syrian rebels, says head friar"") . Nevertheless, as recently as this past week, a columnist for the conservative website Townhall had the headline ""Syrian rebels attack Christian village, behead priests."" A heart or other organ Paul’s second example hews more closely to the facts. On May 12, Time reported on a video that its reporters had seen earlier but was posted anonymously on the Web that day. In the video, a rebel cuts open the body of a dead Syrian soldier and removes two bloody masses. The rebel, who has taken the nom de guerre, Abu Sakkar, says to the cell phone camera, ""I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog."" His men shout ""Allahu akbar (God is great)."" Sakkar then lifts one of the lumps of flesh to his mouth. Multiple news organizations carried the story and an edited version of the video. Time interviewed Sakkar via Skype on May 14. He did not deny what he had done. He explained that he felt his behavior was justified because his men had found a cell phone on the dead man with him abusing three naked women, a mother and her two daughters. ""We opened his cell phone, and I found a clip of a woman and her two daughters fully naked and he was humiliating them, and sticking a stick here and there,"" Sakkar told Time. Two months later, a BBC reporter spoke face-to-face with Sakkar. Sakkar at that time said, ""I didn't bite into it. I just held it for show."" However, days after the video went public, he had told the BBC that he had taken a ritual bite. The video available to us makes it impossible to tell for sure. It is also unclear what body parts he was holding. Sakkar told the BBC it was a lung; a doctor who saw the video told the BBC that’s what it looked like to him. Sakkar is the founder of the Omar al-Farouq brigade, a group of about 60 men. According to Time, the man who posted the video described him as affiliated with al-Qaida. How close he actually is to al-Qaida is unclear. The person who put the video online added the caption, ""These are the freedoms they want to import to our country."" Time reported that graphic videos of this sort have become familiar among combatants on both sides of the Syrian civil war. ""Footage of rape, torture and amputations are passed like trading cards,"" said Nadim Houry of Human Rights Watch. There is no question that such videos travel widely. Beck featured the video of Sakkar on his radio program as a clear warning against being drawn into a war in the Middle East. Beck urged viewers to share it with their friends and to contact their representatives in Congress. Paul's office sent us a statement that read, in part, ""To get caught up in the specifics of which organ was eaten or how, or the manner in which an innocent priest was murdered is to miss the truth to argue over the details: that atrocities have been committed by both sides of this civil war."" Our ruling Paul said Islamic rebels have decapitated priests, and one was seen eating the heart of a Syrian soldier. News reports show that Islamic rebels gunned down a priest but did not behead him. The murder of a priest speaks to religious warfare and that carries great weight. However, thousands of innocent people have died from gunfire in this civil war. The claim is evocative in part due to the beheading, and that aspect is plainly inaccurate. In addition, the truth has been widely available for two months and Paul had ample opportunity to know better. Paul’s claim about a rebel eating a heart is more accurate, but the details are sketchy. Both the focus on a heart and the idea of cannibalism push strong emotional buttons. But it might not have been a heart, and there might not have been an actual bite. Still, a rebel carved up a dead Syrian soldier, boasted about it as he did so, and at the very least, spoke and acted as though he were eating the dead man’s liver and heart. The first statement is flawed, and the second is largely on the mark with some weak points. Together, we rate them as Half True. Editor's note: This report had been updated to include a response we received from Paul's office shortly after our initial publication.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097022BC0>],/factchecks/2013/sep/10/rand-paul/rand-paul-syrian-rebels-behead-priests-and-eat-hea/

Rove says public tends to rally behind military action
","With attacks on Syria being debated in Washington, public opinion stands clearly opposed to a military strike. A new CNN/ORC poll shows about 60 percent of Americans think Congress should refuse to authorize the use of force. Even as an offer of Syrian chemical weapons destruction takes shape, the White House is lobbying hard to sway undecided lawmakers, hoping that classified briefings will nudge them into going against the views of their constituents. Political strategist Karl Rove gave the administration a bit of ammunition as it tries to win support for a resolution. The public’s views are flexible, he said. ""Before President Obama acted in Libya in 2011, the American people were opposed to military action by 35 to 60,"" Rove said on Fox News Sunday. ""After he took action, they were in support of it 54 to 43."" Rove’s point? ""The American people do have an animus against any kind of action, but if you take action, and you’re successful, they applaud it,"" he said. We went back to the record to check whether at the end of the day, public opinion can change direction so completely and so quickly. Rove’s office told us that if anything, Rove’s claim understated the swing in public opinion back in 2011. Three days before Tomahawk missiles struck Libyan air defenses, a Fox News poll showed just 25 percent of the people in favor when asked ""Do you favor or oppose the U.S. military getting involved with the situation in Libya?"" Those against stood at 65 percent. That was in mid-March 2011. By the end of August, a CNN/ORC poll showed 54 percent said they favored the U.S. military action in Libya, while 43 percent were against it. The timeline It helps to get a sense of what was going on in Libya when these polls were taken. As this timeline  shows, the international community quickly rallied to the cause of the protesters who sought to overthrow Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, but the conflict lasted through most of the year. February 2011 -- Popular protests begin, prompting a violent government crackdown. By the end of the month, the UN Security Council had issued a statement condemning the Libyan regime, imposed sanctions and referred Gadhafi to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. March 17, 2011 -- The UN Security Council approves a no-fly zone and the use of all necessary measures to protect civilians. March 19, 2011 -- British, French and American forces move to enforce the no-fly zone, starting with missile attacks to destroy Libyan air defenses. March 24, 2011 -- NATO takes command of the mission to enforce the no-fly zone. April - August 2011 -- Air strikes continue. Special forces from Britain, France, Jordan and Qatar aid the rebels on the ground. August 20, 2011 -- Rebel and Gadhafi loyalists battle in Tripoli. October 20, 2011 -- Rebels capture and kill Gadhafi. Opinions shift, questions matter The earliest poll we found came from the Pew Research Center. Taken around March 13, it showed a clear distaste for the military options. A slight majority favored economic and diplomatic sanctions, but nearly 70 percent opposed arming the rebels, 77 percent opposed bombing Libyan air defenses, and 82 percent opposed sending ground troops. This was very much in line with the Fox News poll. As soon as the missiles were launched, public opinion changed. On March 20,  pollsters from CBS News posed this question: ""As you may know, the U.S. military and other countries have begun cruise missile and air strikes in Libya in order to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi's forces. Do you approve or disapprove of the U.S. and other countries taking this military action in Libya?"" Nearly 70 percent of respondents said they approved. But slightly different questions revealed a more closely divided public. Polls at the end of March from Pew Research Center and NBC News/Wall Street Journal asked simply if people thought military engagement was the right or wrong decision. The question did not mention protecting civilians, and support dropped. Both polls found that half the people thought it was the right choice. About 40 percent thought it was the wrong decision and about 10 percent didn’t know. At the very end, in early November 2011, after Gadhafi was dead and a transitional government took over, CBS News asked if the United States had done the right thing by getting involved militarily. Only 37 percent thought the country had done the right thing. Nearly half said America never should have gotten involved. This was well before the attacks on the American diplomatic post in Benghazi, which happened nearly a year later, in 2012. Our ruling Rove said there was a major swing in public opinion from before military action in Libya began to after. In varying degrees, we found polling results that support that conclusion.  In general, once the missiles fly, the public tends to take a more favorable view of military engagement. However, some polls found only a modest shift, and much depended on how the question was asked. Overall, the public remained closely divided on the American role in Libya. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097015480>],/factchecks/2013/sep/10/karl-rove/rove-says-public-tends-rally-behind-military-actio/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'Terrorism', 'Ted Yoho']","
Rep. Ted Yoho says chemical weapons have been used ‘probably 20 times’ since 1990
","U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., has a question for those who support intervention in Syria’s civil war: ""Why now, and why us?"" President Barack Obama has urged targeted military strikes to punish Syria for alleged chemical attacks against its citizens, including deadly nerve gas on Aug. 21, 2013. The U.S. government says that attack may have killed more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children. But Yoho told Fox Business Network that chemical weapons have been used repeatedly since the 1990 Persian Gulf War without a U.S. military response. ""If you go back to the Iraq war, it's been used probably 20 times since then, and I just question the motive of right now in America acting out in the lead of this. I think it's wrong for America,"" he said Sept. 4, 2013. Experts have previously told us that chemical attacks have been rare since World War I. We wondered — have there been 20 such attacks in the last two decades? The question is partly one of definition. The most authoritative definition — set out by the Chemical Weapons Convention, an agreement among 189 countries to eliminate chemical weapons — is also very specific. It doesn’t include, for example, improvised use of industrial chemicals, or certain gases when used by a police force instead of a military. But it’s also a question of time line, and of evidence. Yoho’s office said he meant to include attacks prior to 1990, as well as recent attacks in Syria that are yet to be confirmed by the international community. Here’s what we found. We checked with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the group headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands, that oversees the international Chemical Weapons Convention, which went into force in 1997. Experts say it’s the most authoritative source on chemical weapons attacks. Other than alleged attacks in Syria, which it’s still investigating, the group officially acknowledges just a single chemical attack since 1990 — by a Japanese cult using homemade sarin gas on the Tokyo subway that killed 13 people and sickened thousands. The last use by a country, according to OPCW’S brief online history, was by Iraq in 1988 — before the Persian Gulf War. ""There have been numerous other alleged uses of chemical weapons in the Middle East during this period, but none has been shown to involve standard chemical weapons,"" said OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan. For example, in several countries that experienced protests during the ""Arab Spring"" of 2010 and 2011, there were allegations involving the use of tear gas, which is allowed for use in riot control by security forces, Luhan said. Other allegations included the use of white phosphorus in Fallujah, Iraq, and the Palestinian city of Gaza. But those are also allowed by the convention ""to illuminate or obscure the battlefield,"" he said. So if you look at the use of illegal gas by nations, there’s not even one example of a chemical attack like the one alleged in Syria since before the Persian Gulf War. (Our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker dug up just a handful of examples this century.) And Yoho made his comment in the context of the Chemical Weapons Convention. ""You know, this all goes back to the CWC agreement ... that stated that any country that produces, transports, stores or sells chemical weapons or weapons of mass destruction are in violation,"" he said during the Fox Business interview. So when Yoho mentioned ""probably 20"" attacks since 1990, we concluded that he meant attacks by countries, rather than by individuals or rebels. And using those parameters, you can’t get to 20. But his office suggested he was also including Syria’s own attacks since 2012. In the interview, he mentioned ""over 11"" such attacks that could have triggered U.S. action. But those attacks aren’t yet well substantiated. In April, the New York Times reported Britain and France had written to the United Nations suggesting there was evidence Syria had used chemical weapons in its civil war. It was as the OPCW was investigating allegations of those attacks that the suburbs of Damascus were attacked Aug. 21. The OPCW team changed its focus to the later attack. It’s now processing evidence from its visit. The U.S. says it ""assesses"" that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons over the last year, but isn’t specific. The French mention a handful of April attacks. The United Kingdom counts at least 14 previous attacks. Yoho also counts non-state attacks and those with rough ""improvised"" chemical weapons that don’t qualify under the CWC — and some attacks by Iraq before 1990. For example, Chechnyan and Iraq insurgents have detonated chlorine tanks, said Philipp Bleek, an expert in nonproliferation at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. The Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland counts 10 attacks that involved chlorine in Chechnya and Iraq in 1999, 2007 and 2009. Meanwhile, acknowledging that Yoho’s time line was ""a little askew,"" his deputy chief of staff, Omar Raschid, said the congressman meant to include pre-1990 attacks by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in its war with Iran and against the Kurds. Those attacks are widely held up as a notable example of government chemical weapons use since World War II. They ended in the late 1980s. And while it’s true the United States looked the other way, it later used Iraq’s chemical arsenal as part of its justification for the 2003 invasion. Yoho also cited Russian security forces’ use of a ""nonlethal"" narcotic gas when they stormed a Moscow theater full of hostages held by Chechnyan rebels in 2002. Dozens of more than 800 hostages ultimately died from the effects of the gas, prompting ""strong public debate"" about whether Russia had violated the CWC, according to a U.S. Army medical textbook. But it fell into a legal loophole under that agreement, according to a book by the late Monterey Institute expert Jonathan Tucker in his 2007 book, War of Nerves: Chemical Warfare from World War I to Al-Qaeda. So Yoho’s count — with its mix of state and non-state perpetrators and official and nonofficial chemical weapons — struck experts as odd. ""Rep. Yoho is misinformed,"" said Matthew Meselson, a professor at Harvard University who specializes in chemical and biological defense and arms control and co-directs the Harvard Sussex Program on Chemical and Biological Weapons. The most authoritative source, he said, is the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Bleek agreed, saying that while there have been a few non-state incidents, there’s no state attack in the past 20 years that compares with the Aug. 21 attack in Syria. ""The problem with it is the parallelism that it implies — that there were earlier incidents in which we should have intervened. And at that point, it falls apart,"" said Bleek, who until recently was a senior adviser to the Office of the Secretary of Defense on nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs. (He wasn’t speaking behalf of the Defense Department.) ""You have some isolated instances, but the reality is, after World War I, there's just not a lot of state uses,"" Bleek added. ""There just aren't a lot of countries in the world that stockpile or are suspected of having chemical weapons."" Our ruling Yoho said chemical weapons have been used ""probably 20 times"" since the Persian Gulf War. If you count confirmed chemical weapons attacks by governments since 1990, then the answer is zero. Using looser definitions and a longer time frame gets Yoho to or beyond 20. Even if you don’t count the earlier Iraqi attacks that fell outside of Yoho’s stated time line, it’s possible to get to 20 attacks by counting the pre-Aug. 21 incidents in Syria, the use of chlorine gas by insurgents, the Tokyo subway attack and the Moscow theater rescue. Still, experts told PolitiFact that loosening the definition of what counts as an attack doesn’t make it an apples-to-apples comparison. Yoho talked about enforcement of an international agreement against chemical weapons, but he’s only correct when he uses a definition of chemical attacks that has nothing to do with that international understanding. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA1C80>],/factchecks/2013/sep/10/ted-yoho/rep-ted-yoho-says-chemical-weapons-have-been-used-/
"['Georgia', 'Privacy Issues', 'Tom Graves']","
Your old emails could be in government inbox now
","You’ve got mail. And depending on how long its been since you’ve read it, the government can read it, too. That’s the claim U.S. Rep. Tom Graves made in a district update to his constituents this summer. ""It’s shocking, but true,"" Graves, R-Ranger, said in the emailed update. ""The government does not need a warrant to read your old emails. How can this be? Simply put, our privacy laws are outdated."" Since May, when former government defense contractor Edward Snowden leaked the details of two National Security Agency spy programs that track phone and Internet communications, there has been a heightened interest in how much privacy Americans actually have. PolitiFact Georgia gets and sends a lot of email. We wanted to know whether our bygone missives could be subject to government perusal, so we went looking for answers. Graves’ update referenced the Email Privacy Act that he introduced, along with U.S. Reps. Kevin Yoder and Jared Polis, to update the current electronic communication privacy laws. The bill, introduced in May, has gained 137 bipartisan co-sponsors and has been referred to a House committee. The Graves bill is a companion to a similar bill being pushed in the Senate by U.S. Sens. Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee. The Senate bill passed out of committee and is up for a full chamber vote. If passed, both bills would update the current law that governs data storage, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. The ECPA, passed in 1986, regulates government access to private information that is transmitted and stored on the Internet, such as email. The law considers emails stored on third-party servers for longer than 180 days as abandoned. The 1986 law allows federal agencies to obtain a subpoena -- but doesn’t require a warrant from a judge -- to view the records. (Emails less than 180 days old do require a judicial warrant to obtain.) ""The (ECPA) was written at a time when people didn’t store emails on a server and there was no cloud. Storage was expensive and most people didn’t keep emails long -- they downloaded things to the desktop,"" said Mark Stanley, a campaign and communications strategist for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit public policy organization that works to improve privacy in communications technology.    When the law was written, users of the early Internet often downloaded emails directly to their hard drives to save them.  Service providers deleted messages on their servers immediately to free up valuable storage space. Today, storage space is practically unlimited. Deleting messages from your inbox doesn’t preclude them from still existing on your computer’s hard drive, your email provider’s server, or in the inbox or on the server of the person receiving the email. Graves’ email privacy act would drop the 180-day provision from the existing law and require a warrant to obtain the emails. The bill ""would ensure that Fourth Amendment protections Americans already have for mail, phone calls, and other paper/hard documents are extended to their soft communications too,"" the three congressmen wrote in a Wired op-ed. One exception exists to the current electronic communications privacy law, but not in our area. A ruling in a 2010 federal appeals court case, United States v. Warshak, found that police violated a man’s constitutional rights by reading his emails without a warrant. The Supreme Court has not addressed this case, and the ruling only applies to states in the court’s 6th Circuit jurisdiction of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. Because of this ruling, email and Internet companies Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo require warrants and subpoenas to release emails and other stored data. But there is no guarantee that their requirements would hold up in court. A coalition of communications, privacy and human rights groups have lobbied Congress to update the current electronic data bill. The Washington Post editorial board urged lawmakers to close the email loophole in a July editorial. Privacy expert and professor John Soma, who leads the Privacy Foundation at the University of Denver,  also vouched for Graves’ claim. Soma said the legislators’ bill is tame in regards to what data management changes should be made to the law. But getting the bill passed could be difficult. GovTrack, which follows federal legislation, gives Graves’ bill only an 8 percent chance of being enacted; the Senate bill fares a bit better at 14 percent. Soma gives it a better chance, especially after Snowden revealed the government’s surveillance practices. ""I’d give (the bill) a 50-50 chance, maybe more,"" Soma said. ""We do need a change."" So, does Graves’ claim about email make it to the inbox or get filtered  into junk mail? The Georgia congressman said the government doesn’t need a warrant to read our old emails. Current law, in place before many modern technology advances, does not include a provision protecting email over 180 days old from the government’s prying eyes. Graves and a cadre of congressional members are working to update the privacy laws. But in the meantime the old rules stand. We rate Graves’ claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A0280>],/factchecks/2013/sep/10/tom-graves/your-old-emails-could-be-government-inbox-now/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Grover Norquist']","
Grover Norquist says delaying Obamacare by a year would save $35 billion over 10 years
","Grover Norquist, who heads the conservative, anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, is no fan of President Barack Obama’s health care law. In a tweet sent on Sept. 8, 2013, Norquist cites research by the Congressional Budget Office -- the independent budget-analysis arm of Congress -- to quantify how much money the federal government could save by delaying some of the health care law’s key provisions. ""CBO reports that delaying the Obamacare individual mandate will reduce the deficit by $35 billion over 10 years. Another good reason,"" Norquist tweeted. Is Norquist right? The tweet refers to a CBO analysis released on Sept. 6, 2013. The agency looked at the potential impact on the federal budget if a bill that has already passed the House were to become law. The bill includes a one-year delay of the start of the requirement that individuals secure health insurance coverage, as well as a similar delay of the tax penalties assessed for not complying with that ""individual mandate."" (The bill would also delay by a year the imposition of penalties on employers who do not offer health insurance, though the Obama administration has already implemented that change, so we will not focus on that provision in this article.) The measure passed the House on July 17 by a 264-161 vote, with a minority of Democrats -- 35 in all -- siding with all but one of the Republicans who voted to support the bill. It now awaits action in the Senate, though that is considered unlikely since the Senate is controlled by the Democrats. CBO determined that over 10 years -- its typical time frame from analyzing the fiscal impact of bills -- passing the measure would save $35.4 billion. Here’s where the bulk of that money comes from (a small share comes from other areas): • Fewer uninsured Americans signing up for government health care programs such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, because the mandate wouldn’t be pushing people to do so. Savings: $16.9 billion over 10 years. • Fewer uninsured Americans receiving federal subsidies designed to help them purchase plans on the law’s insurance marketplace. Savings: $8.9 billion over 10 years. • More Americans receiving cash in their paychecks (which is taxable) rather than health insurance (which is not taxable), balanced by the absence of collections of tax penalties for non-compliance. Additional tax revenues, on balance: $7.4 billion over 10 years. So Norquist has cited the number accurately. However, it’s worth noting a few other things CBO said that didn’t make it into the tweet. First, this boon to the federal treasury comes at a cost. CBO said that passage of the law would increase the number of people without health insurance by about 11 million in 2014, compared to what CBO estimated Obama’s law would accomplish if it remained intact. Second, Norquist correctly states that the $35 billion figure refers to cumulative savings over 10 years. However, it’s worth noting that the bulk of that savings -- 58 percent -- comes in 2014, and 87 percent comes in either 2014 or 2015. In other words, the benefit to the federal treasury is mostly a one-time event; the bill wouldn't cancel a program permanently, only delay spending for a year. So, passing the bill would not produce an ongoing stream of revenue or savings to the Treasury, since many of the people who aren't compelled to buy insurance in 2014 (or taxed for not buying it) will be shelling out for either an insurance plan or a tax penalty once the delayed requirements take effect. Our ruling Norquist said, ""CBO reports that delaying the Obamacare individual mandate will reduce the deficit by $35 billion over 10 years."" Norquist accurately reported the amount CBO estimated. However, his tweet cherry picks CBO’s conclusions, ignoring that the bill would produce 11 million additional uninsured Americans, and that the savings would amount to a one-time fiscal event. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B37C00>],/factchecks/2013/sep/09/grover-norquist/grover-norquist-says-delaying-obamacare-year-would/
"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Libertarian Party of Broward County']","
Libertarians say they're the third largest political party
","In politics -- or any blood sport -- it’s rare to hear a team proudly chant, ""We’re No. 3! We’re No. 3!"" But that’s what we heard from Libertarians in the purple state of Florida. We spotted a claim about the numbers and growth of libertarians in an announcement about a Libertarian event in Broward County: ""The Libertarian Party is the third-largest organized political party in the United States and has seen tremendous growth over the last two years as many Democrats and Republicans have become disenchanted with their respective parties."" (The article was written by Karl Dickey who serves on the Libertarian Party of Florida’s executive committee and represents Broward, Palm Beach and Hendry counties.) We found a similar claim on the Libertarian Party of Broward website that the party is ""the third-largest political party in the U.S."" We wanted to explore the numbers and the power of the Libertarian Party. Is it the third-largest party in the country? We’ve looked at the numbers of Libertarians in the past. But as Sen. Rand Paul -- a Kentucky Republican with a libertarian outlook -- makes headlines as a potential 2016 presidential contender, it seemed like a good time to revisit the numbers. Counting libertarians Libertarian activists and political scientists we contacted suggested the same source: Richard Winger, a Libertarian in California and editor of a monthly newsletter, Ballot Access News, which includes data on party registration that Winger researches. His December issue showed there were 325,807 registered Libertarians nationwide. (About half the states tally Libertarians, Winger’s data shows.) The number of registered Libertarians was higher than other national third parties including the Green, Constitution or Reform parties. But with Democrats’ registration at 43.5 million and Republicans at 41.3 million according to Winger’s data, that puts any third-place finisher trailing way behind. Also, the number of Libertarians was substantially lower than two catch-all categories which Winger calls ""indp. misc"" at 26.8 million and ""other"" at 2.9 million. The miscellaneous category includes states that have a miscellaneous category, as well as voters who write in answers (such as ""birthday party"") on their registration. Winger’s ""other"" includes a combination of actual parties. Since those catch-all categories were large, we picked a couple of states to look in more detail at third-party registrations. In California, there were 477,129 registered with the American Independent Party. In New York, there were 430,072 registered with the Independence Party as of November 2012. But Winger said those groups in California and New York aren’t ""nationally organized parties. Those are one-state parties."" That’s why when Winger talks about Libertarians’ voter registration he includes the phrase ""nationally organized"" -- something the Libertarians in Broward omitted. We’re not suggesting that those state parties in California or New York are powerful players nationwide -- or even in their own states. Some New York voters wrongly think they are registering as independents, according to the New York Daily News. Markham Robinson, a leader with the American Independent Party, told PolitiFact in an interview that he did a survey of AIP voters and of the 200 who responded, one-third didn’t realize they had registered with a party. Still, Robinson said he’d give that third ranking to his own group based on voter registration. Robinson suggested another way to measure third-party influence: a group’s registration as a percentage of total voters. By that method, he gave a shout-out to the Independent American Party in Nevada -- they garnered almost 5 percent of the state’s registration as of October. Libertarians do have a point when they say they are growing. Ballot Access News showed in 2008 there were 240,328 Libertarians, compared with 325,807 in 2012, an increase of about 36 percent. But their power lies not in electing Libertarians but more in the libertarian philosophy making inroads with the GOP. And some experts told us to examine votes received or the number of candidates who ran as signs of party strength rather than just voter registration. In 2012, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson received about 1.3 million votes -- more than any other third-party candidate. Johnson's tally, amounting to about 1 percent, is the largest for a non-major-party candidate since Ralph Nader's Green race in 2000, said J. David Gillespie, author of a book on third parties. ""Libertarians always run far more people for congressional and state legislative seats across the nation than do the Greens, Constitution Party, or any other third party,"" he said. Some libertarians choose not to register with the Libertarian Party, either because they don’t like party labels or so they can participate in the nominating contests held by the major parties. Libertarians ""do have influence beyond their size, because libertarian ideas appeal to people on both left and right,"" said Shaun Bowler, a political science professor at the University of California. Our ruling The Libertarian Party in Broward said on its website that the Libertarian Party ""is the third-largest political party in the U.S."" Quantifying the number of Libertarians is tricky; some states don’t track the affiliation. As for those officially registered with the Libertarian Party, it’s about 326,000. Some state-based parties -- most notably the Independence Party in New York and the American Independent Party in California -- have more people registered to their party than that, though. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A40B680>],/factchecks/2013/sep/09/libertarian-party-broward-county/libertarians-say-theyre-third-largest-political-pa/
"['Texas', 'Raul Torres']","
Farmers, lawyers, teachers and a ghost, but no CPAs have been Texas comptrollers

","When former state Rep. Raul Torres announced his run for comptroller, he claimed a historic advantage: ""I’m a certified public accountant and would be the very first CPA to serve in this office,"" he said in an Aug. 27, 2013, online campaign video. Torres, a Republican elected in 2010 who served one term representing Corpus Christi’s District 33, has been a certified public accountant since 1993. Later in the video, he said, ""Can you believe that this office, which manages your tax dollars, has never had an accountant as its head officer?"" Well, can we believe it? Torres told us by phone that he and his campaign staff checked Wikipedia and other online sources for biographical information on Texas comptrollers back to 1896, when the first CPA certificate was handed out in New York. ""I drew my own conclusion that there was no other person with the designation of CPA,"" Torres said. We started our research with current officeholder Susan Combs, who left the comptroller’s race wide open when she announced in May 2013 that she would retire. Combs spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us by email that she holds a law degree and directed us to her official biography online, but said the office had no biographical information on previous comptrollers. A word on the word, which some pronounce ""controller"" or ""comtroller"": The ""p"" snuck in there during the 15th century, an Oxford English Dictionary editor told the New York Times in 2010. It appears that Middle English ""counteroller,"" a person who checks two scrolls against each other, crashed into French ""compte,"" count. Texas’ comptroller of public accounts collects state taxes and predicts how much the state will be able to spend, among other duties, and checks to make sure the budget adopted by the Legislature every two years is balanced. Torres said the knowledge of professional standards and skills required to become a CPA, which include performing audits and making reliable estimates, would be of use in the job. Becoming comptroller doesn't require special qualifications, though. DeSilva said the eligibility standards are the usual ones for a Texas candidate: U.S. citizen, 18 or older, not a felon, etc. For information on comptrollers past, DeSilva suggested we consult the Texas State Library. There, reference and documents librarian Sue Troyan emailed us the Texas Almanac’s list of comptrollers since 1835, when the provisional government of the Republic of Texas created the office. The Republic’s first comptroller is listed as John H. Money, but that surname might be too good to be true; we found him identified as John H. Morey in older editions. For this fact-check we restricted ourselves, as Torres did, to comptrollers after 1896. At the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy, general counsel Jerry Hill told us by email that none of the folks on our list popped up in the database of certificates issued since 1915, when the agency began administering CPA examinations. That helps considerably, but doesn’t cover our whole timespan, and it’s limited to CPAs who were certified in Texas. So we set to gathering descriptions from sources including the Austin American-Statesman archives, the Texas State Historical Association, the state cemetery and materials sent to us by Troyan and reference librarian Kay Schlueter at the Legislative Reference Library of Texas. Our full list of sources is at right. Here are the jobs we found Texas’ chief financial officers held before they became comptrollers: Richard Watson Finley In office 1895-1901 Justice of the peace, businessman, cotton warehouse owner, financial agent for Texas penitentiaries. Robert Marshall Love 1901-1903 Teacher, Confederate soldier, farmer, sheriff, U.S. marshal. Assassinated at his desk in the comptroller’s office by an ex-employee whom he had fired. Said to haunt the Capitol. John W. Stephens 1903-1910 Farmer, merchandiser, stockman, county district clerk, chief deputy U.S. marshal to Love and then chief bookkeeper under Love in the comptroller’s office. W.P. Lane 1911-1915 Businessman -- likely including a stint as manager of the carpet department at a dry goods store -- then a state representative. Henry Berryman Terrell 1915-1920 Farmer, merchant, newspaper owner, state representative, state senator. Mark L. Wiginton 1920-1921 A state representative in 1919; possibly an anti-Prohibition activist before that, based on a Dec. 9, 1904, report in the Itasca Item, and a speaker for a fraternal group offering life insurance, according to the Feb. 19, 1917, Bartlett Tribune and News. Lon A. Smith 1921-1925 Teacher, county clerk, state representative, state senator. Sam Houston Terrell 1925-1931 Second lieutenant in the Army during World War I, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs gravesite locator. Alleged fiscal misdeeds as comptroller led to an impeachment trial, during which he resigned. George Hartfield Sheppard 1931-1949 Teacher, county tax assessor, city official, insurance businessman. Robert S. Calvert 1949-1975 Army Air Forces; worked for a railway and an electric company and was a bank teller before becoming a statistician in comptroller’s office and chief clerk in comptroller’s office. The longest-serving comptroller was among the most controversial; in 1973, aged 81, he drew notoriety by using a racial slur to describe Eddie Bernice Johnson (then a state representative from Dallas, now a U.S. representative), who sought to have him impeached for racial discrimination. Robert (Bob) Douglas Bullock 1975-1991 Air Force, lawyer, state representative, assistant attorney general, secretary of state. Credited with modernizing the office and, eventually, most of Texas’ government as well. John Sharp 1991-1999 Army Reserve, Legislative Budget Board staff, state representative, state senator, state railroad commissioner. Carole Keeton Strayhorn 1999-2007 Teacher, Austin school board president, Austin mayor, state insurance board member, railroad commissioner. Susan Combs 2007-present Lawyer, Dallas County assistant district attorney, state agriculture commissioner.   Only a few of the jobs seem related to accountancy: Stephens’ post as chief bookkeeper and Calvert’s stints as a statistician and then chief clerk, all within the comptroller’s office itself.

Is Price guilty of ""Tomfoolery""?
","Who’s side are you on, congressman? That’s the question some Georgia activists are asking U.S. Rep. Tom Price. The Georgia Campaign for Liberty recently distributed fliers that contend the Roswell Republican ""is trying to have it both ways on the small-business killing Internet Tax Mandate."" ""Rep. Price has been sending letters in support of the Internet Tax Mandate to constituents who support it … and letters expressing concern over the Internet Tax mandate to his constituents that oppose it!,"" the flier states. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the organization was correct in its assertion. The Campaign for Liberty states on its website that it believes ""the free market ... is the most just and humane economic system and the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known."" The Virginia-based group also supports a ""noninterventionist foreign policy"" and opposes the Federal Reserve system, according to its website.  The organization’s interim state coordinator, Ike Hall, sent us a copy of the flier to support its argument about Price. Hall did not know how many fliers were distributed, but the flier has been posted on various websites, which is how we saw it. On the back of the flier are two letters Price wrote to different constituents concerning the issue. Both letters were nearly identical. The key difference is one paragraph. Before we examine the contents of the letters, PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d briefly offer some context about this issue. On Feb. 14, a group of U.S. House lawmakers introduced Resolution 684, titled the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013. The legislation was intended to allow states to collect taxes on some items sold online. One study concluded that in 2012 Georgia lost about $455 million in uncollected Internet sales tax revenue. ""Small businesses and states alike are suffering from the inability to collect due – not new – taxes from purchases made online,"" said Rep. Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican who was a lead sponsor of the legislation. ""The Marketplace Fairness Act is the bipartisan, bicameral, common-sense solution that promotes states’ rights and levels the playing field for our Main Street businesses rather than continuing to allow the government to pick marketplace winners and losers."" The Senate passed the legislation in early May by a wide majority. Both U.S. senators from Georgia, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, voted for the legislation. The resolution was referred to a House subcommittee. Some activists have fought the legislation. A Facebook page was created to urge House members to hit the delete button when the legislation comes their way. Grover Norquist's influential Americans for Tax Reform has labeled it a tax increase. Former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, chairman of the Campaign for Liberty, has described the bill as an ""Internet tax mandate."" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in May that Price was unsure about his support for the bill. Price has not publicly stated a position on the bill. His office told us the congressman doesn’t want to see any changes to the tax code that would hurt the economy. Many members of Congress face difficult political choice on the legislation. Many local business communities support the tax. They contend that not charging taxes on Internet purchases gives online merchants an unfair advantage. But many taxpayers, who also vote, view the legislation as creating a new tax. The Georgia Campaign for Liberty, like its national chairman, has qualms about the legislation. It accuses Price of ""two-faced taxation Tomfoolery,"" using the letters as evidence. Hall said it received the letters from supporters and says Price has admitted he’s ""waffled"" on his position. One letter, to a supporter of the legislation, was dated July 10; the other, to an opponent, July 12. There are two differences in the letters. The second paragraph of the July 10 letter begins ""Your support for this legislation is appreciated."" The second paragraph of the July 12 letter begins ""Your concerns for this legislation are appreciated."" The only other difference in the letters was a sentence in the third paragraph. ""At a time when regulations and taxation are out of control at the federal level, it is critical that we continue to examine avenues that involve a complete and comprehensive overhaul of our tax system so that we may see a positive effect and simplification of our tax code,"" Price wrote in the July 10 letter. The July 12 letter has a sentence that begins the same, but ends differently. ""At a time when regulations and taxation are out of control at the federal level, it is critical that we do not potentially inflict further damage on an already delicate economic recovery. Responsible solutions are needed to ensure the survival of our small businesses."" So, is the Georgia Campaign for Liberty correct that Price is trying to have it both ways? ""As all can clearly see from the text of the letters themselves, any claim the congressman is expressing support for the bill in one letter and opposition to it in another is baseless,"" Price spokesman Ryan Murphy said in a statement. ""Any accusation that he is trying to provide two opposing opinions depending on the audience is a blatant PolitiFact ‘Pants on Fire’. The letters clearly show the congressman being consistent and responsive to the concerns of his constituents."" Hall chuckled when we read Price’s statement to him. ""We stand by our flier,"" he said, declining to comment further. To sum up, the Georgia Campaign for Liberty put together a flier accusing U.S. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia of writing letters for and against legislation that would allow states to tax some items sold online. The letters were nearly identical. And they are indicative of everyday correspondence from a congressman’s office to constituents concerned about pending legislation.  Part of one sentence could be interpreted as suggesting Price has problems with the bill. But the organization’s conclusion about the congressman’s position is a stretch.

NJEA ad claims politicians cut more than $1 billion from education
","Some cuts just never heal, apparently. And that is especially true for school aid funding cuts, based on claims made in a video ad released last week by the New Jersey Education Association. The ad features Trenton elementary teacher Talithea Briggs, who talks about the impact of state aid cuts during Gov. Chris Christie’s first year in office, as somber music plays in the background. ""Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education,"" Briggs says, adding that those cuts resulted in larger class sizes, less money for books and materials, and fewer computers for students. For this claim we’re looking only at how much was cut in state aid – and in this case, the NJEA’s claim is correct. Let’s begin by looking back at some of the fiscal matters challenging Christie shortly after he took office in January 2010. Faced with major revenue loss to the state as a result of the recession, Christie began making cuts in several areas of the budget. Education took among the biggest hits. The governor withheld $475 million in state aid that January and then cut another $820 million from the fiscal year 2011 budget. The FY11 plan covered the school year starting in September 2010. The National Bureau of Economic Research has defined the recession as lasting from December 2007 through June 2009. Combined, the education cuts totaled just under $1.3 billion. NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer noted that the $475 million would have paid for things such as new classrooms, vehicles, special education placements and more. The result, he said, was larger class sizes, a loss of education personnel and programs being cut. And the impact of those cuts are still being felt, he said. ""Districts are going to get squeezed more and more,"" Wollmer said. ""That’s the bottom line."" But Christie had to put more education money in the budget after the state Supreme Court in 2011 ordered him to increase aid to poor school districts by about $500 million the next fiscal year. The order resulted from a lawsuit that claimed the education cuts violated the 2008 School Funding Reform Act, which was a funding formula to support the state’s poorest districts. Christie maintained that the cuts were necessary to balance the budget, as required by state law. But New Jersey’s education funding drama didn’t end with the increased aid for poorer districts. The NJEA’s ad also notes that many of New Jersey’s school districts received a $1 increase in state aid under the current Fiscal Year 2014 budget. Still other districts had aid totals that stayed the same from the year prior. It's worth noting that as the economy has improved, Christie and the Legislature have put more money in the budget for education. Our ruling A recent video ad by the NJEA claims, ""Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education."" Christie made two rounds of cuts between the time he took office in January 2010 and in the FY 2011 budget, which was ultimately approved by the state Legislature. The combined cuts totaled just under $1.3 billion. Although some aid has since been restored, the NJEA claim is correct about the amount of the cuts. We rate the claim True.

No, Prince did not invest in Nike or design the first Air Jordan sneaker
","When it comes to Prince, it isn’t hard to believe extraordinary stories about his endeavors, business-related and otherwise. But investing in Nike and designing the Air Jordan sneaker were not among his pursuits. Shortly after the prolific musician died on April 21, 2016, rumors began to spread that Prince invested in Nike, recruited Michael Jordan to the company and designed the first Air Jordan sneaker. The only problem is, none of it is true. Social media posts, like this one recently shared on Facebook, include side-by-side images of Jordan and Prince and claim that: ""Back in 1971 Prince invested in the Nike Shoe Company. Later in 1983, he recruited Michael Jordan, designed Jordan’s 1st iconic show, and set up Nike’s Jordan 1 sales campaign. Prince set Michael up to become a billion dollar shoe mogul and few even know it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, it is improbable that Prince invested in Nike in 1971 – because he would have been only between 12 and 13 years old then. Prince didn’t achieve major commercial success until after his debut album ""For You"" was released in 1978. Next up is the claim that Prince recruited Michael Jordan to sign with Nike in 1983. Now, Jordan did join the company in 1984, but there is no evidence Prince had anything to do with it. We couldn’t find any media reports that suggest he was involved in Jordan’s Nike deal, a detail that would have been big news given Prince’s stardom in the mid-80s. The narrative also contradicts other accounts, which include Jordan’s agent at the time, of how the deal went down. Prince’s name does not come up. Prince also did not design the first Air Jordans (known as Air Jordan 1) – that was Peter Moore. Moore, along with Bruce Kilgore, also created the Air Jordan II. Joseph Vogel, author of the 2018 Prince biography ""This Thing Called Life: Prince, Race, Sex, Religion, and Music,"" told us the claim is an odd myth. ""Prince would have been around 13 years old in 1971 so the idea that he would have invested in Nike that year makes little sense and is not supported by any credible source that I'm aware of,"" Vogel wrote in an email to PolitiFact. ""Same goes for him recruiting Michael Jordan in 1983. The history of Nike and the Air Jordans has been thoroughly documented and does not include Prince. As far as I know, Prince and Michael Jordan did not have any kind of relationship, though Jordan was a fan of his music."" Shortly after Prince’s untimely death, Jordan did release a statement calling the musician a genius and said his songs inspired him throughout his career. ""Like so many people I am shocked at the news that Prince has died,"" Jordan said. ""In a world of creative performers, Prince was a genius. His impact not just on music, but on culture, truly can’t be measured. His songs inspired me throughout my career and remind me of so many moments from my life."" But that comment does not mean Prince had anything to do with Jordan’s success with Nike.

NC GOP falsely says Democrats 'forced' a special election
","After investigators found voting irregularities in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, the state Republican Party opposed the idea of a new election. In November, Republican Mark Harris held a 905-vote advantage over Democrat Dan McCready. The irregularities, the NCGOP argued, didn’t affect enough votes to make a difference in the outcome of the race. Fast forward to March. The NC elections board has called a special election in the 9th district, and the GOP is raising money to help whoever its candidate ends up being in September. In doing so, the party is misleading donors about the history of the race. A March 12 fundraising email warns supporters about ""horrible news."" ""Democrats have forced a special election in North Carolina, and the race is tied!"" the email says in bold print. Is the race tied? Only in the sense that no candidates have emerged yet from their party’s primary. We’ll also address whether Democrats ""forced"" a special election. But first, some important dates: the primary will take place May 14 and the general election will be on Sept. 10. If no candidate gets 30 percent of the vote in the primary, a runoff election will be held Sept. 10, followed by a general election Nov. 5. Now, let’s talk about how we got here. The GOP says Democrats ""forced"" a special election — which gives the impression that support for a new election was purely partisan. It wasn’t. HOW IT HAPPENED The NC elections board has jurisdiction over races for federal office across the state. In November, the board was made up of nine members — four Republicans, four Democrats and a left-leaning unaffiliated member — when it voted 7-2 against certifying the 9th district race results. In January, a court decision reconstituted the board with five members: three Democrats and two Republicans. In February, after a four-day hearing on the findings of the fraud investigation, the reconstituted board voted unanimously (5-0) to nullify November’s results and launch a new election. The board acted shortly after Harris, in a surprise move, expressed his support for a new election. ""It’s become clear to me that the public’s confidence in the Ninth District’s general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted,"" Harris said, and the New York Times reported. A GOP-BACKED DECISION Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, pointed out that Democrats controlled the elections board. ""Republicans could not force a special election, and could not certify alone,"" Woodhouse said. However, state law required four of the five board members to OK a new election, according to board spokesman Patrick Gannon. So Republicans had an influence on the decision to call for a new election. And the two Republican members of the board voted for a new election shortly after Harris (the Republican candidate) said he also supported it. Furthermore, on the day Harris called for a new election, Woodhouse said he supported Harris’ decision. ""Today I ask for everyone’s prayers for @MarkHarrisNC9 Today is a tremendously difficult day for his family, supporters and the entire @NCGOP We support our candidates decision in this matter. We will do everything we can to help the process and system improve in the future,"" Woodhouse tweeted on Feb. 21. In a statement released the same day, the NC GOP said ""we respect Dr. Harris’ decision"" and thanked the elections board. And on Feb. 26, after Harris dropped out of contention for the seat, the GOP put out another statement saying, ""This has been a grueling process for all involved, and we unequivocally support his call for a new election."" OUR RULING An NC GOP fundraising email said ""Democrats have forced a special election"" in the 9th Congressional District. Democrats held a majority on the NC elections board, but the vote to order a new election was supported by the board’s two Republican members and the Republican candidate. We rate this claim False.

How lucrative would sports betting be in Missouri?
","In May 2018, a 6-3 decision from the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a 1992 law that banned sports betting in every state except Nevada, which was grandfathered in. The ruling now lets states decide how to handle sports betting, and some were quick to legalize the practice. But Missouri was not of those fast-acting states. While some Missourians have participated in sports betting throughout the state, it is still illegal because the state has not passed legislation to allow it. State Sen. Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg, is sponsoring Senate Bill 44 that would allow people to place bets on the Chiefs, Royals, Cardinals and other sports teams. According to Hoskins, ""Revenues for the state would include a total of $12.5 to $30.9 million dollars."" Hoskins has told the estimated revenue amount to several news outlets across Missouri. In that total, he included revenue from sports betting on mobile devices, something not all states with legalized sports betting allow. We wanted to know what supported Hoskins’ statement that his bill would bring up to $31 million in state revenue. Because sports betting has not been legalized in the state, it’s not clear how many people would participate. ""It’s a gamble on how many people bet, how much they bet and how often they bet,"" Hoskins said. ""The reality is people are going to gamble whether it's legal or not,"" sports betting expert and author of The Predictive Casinos and The Predictive Sports Book, Andrew Pearson said. ""However, centralizing the gambling makes for a better product."" When we asked Hoskins about his figures, he directed us to the fiscal note for the bill. Hoskins is a member of the Committee on Legislative Research Oversight Division that drafted the fiscal note. To estimate how much money sports betting would bring in, the committee used data from Mississippi to see how it would translate to Missouri. According to Betting USA, Mississippi houses the third largest betting region in the country, behind Las Vegas and Atlantic City, despite not allowing online sports betting. The fiscal note provided by Hoskins said that Missouri Gaming Commission officials annualized Mississippi's total revenue from sports betting and found the sports betting revenue was 2 percent of its total gaming revenue. The committee assumed that Missouri’s sports betting would also be 2 percent of its gaming revenue. If Missouri includes mobile sports betting, the revenue would more than double. Looking at Mississippi’s projections, the committee anticipates the state would ""bring home"" $13 million, but it did not address the $30.9 million Hoskins estimated. Officials from the Missouri Gaming Commission also estimated this bill would ""increase total state revenue by approximately $13 million annually,"" but did not include the higher number Hoskins estimated. Based on the committee’s estimates and the proposed bill, the state would make $6.7 million on fees and $6.3 million in taxes on wagers with a tax rate of 12 percent, plus fees of 2.5 percent — bringing the total revenue to $13 million for Missouri. However, the committee estimates that number will drop to $12.7 million every year after because casinos only pay ""initial license fees"" the first time they decide to operate as a sports betting facility. Officials from the Department of Revenue also gave an estimate of how much revenue sports betting would bring in to Missouri, assuming online sports betting is legalized, using a study, Economic Impact of Legalized Sports Betting, from Oxford Economics. The American Gaming Association hired Oxford Economics to study the potential economic impacts of legalized sports betting in the US. The DOR used this study to measure the impact for all 50 states. The study takes into account illegal sports betting that is already happening in Missouri, along with how many places in Missouri are available to house sports betting if it’s legalized. This study estimates Missouri would make an estimated $29,319,000 to $36,728,500. These numbers support Hoskins higher-end estimate. TheLines has a list of the seven states that currently allow sports betting (but not all allow online sports betting): Nevada Delaware New Jersey Mississippi West Virginia Pennsylvania Rhode Island We took a closer look at Pennsylvania’s experience with sports betting so far to see what state revenue is like there. Pennsylvania is a larger state with a higher tax rate on sports betting. According to PlayPennsylvania, Pennsylvania residents have spent $71.8 million in about four months. The state’s tax rate is 36 percent, triple the rate proposed in Missouri Doug Harbach, Pennsylvania’s Gaming Control Board’s communications director, said that after paying out winning amounts, Pennsylvania has earned $1.9 million in about four months with six places across the state for people to gamble. The fiscal note estimates there will be at least five locations that would allow sports betting. Harbach said Pennsylvania’s figures are expected to jump because they ""are working on a launch of online sports wagering. So, these early revenue figures are expected to escalate significantly this year."" He also said he cannot make a judgment on if Hoskins’ projected figures are reasonable, but suggested looking at Pennsylvania’s figures for an idea. If Pennsylvania’s figures do not jump as Harbach explained, the state would make $5.7 million from sports betting in one year. This experience casts doubt on the estimates from Missouri. Pennsylvania’s population is two times Missouri’s and the tax rate is three times the proposed rate for Missouri, but the total estimates for the first year of sports betting are less than half of Hoskins’. Hoskins said, ""Revenues for the state would include a total of $12.5 (million) to $30.9 million dollars,"" if sports betting were allowed in Missouri. While it is unclear exactly how many people would participate or how much revenue sports betting could bring in, estimates from other states don’t support the higher end of Hoskins’ range. However, calculations including online sports betting do support the higher estimate.

The Pants on Fire claim that two courts backed Trump's claim of no collusion with Russia
","  Sometimes people don’t wait for the fact-checkers to ask. Sometimes they just shout their corrections in real time. This happened on March 13, during remarks on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C. It came when Kevin Downing, the attorney for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, addressed reporters and onlookers moments after his client had been sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to an additional 43 months in prison for illegal lobbying and hiding the proceeds. The sentencing by Jackson was Manafort’s second in just a few days. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis earlier handed down a 47-month sentence in a separate case tried in Virginia. In his remarks outside the D.C. courthouse, Downing said, ""Judge Jackson conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case. So that makes two courts. Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians."" Observers on the scene were having none of it. ""That’s not what she said!"" said someone as Downing continued speaking. ""You guys aren’t lawyers, man, you’re liars!"" Wow -- Manafort's attorney, Kevin Downing, is shouted down outside the courthouse after he falsely claims ""2 courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.""""Liar! That's not what she said!"" someone yells. pic.twitter.com/gGqdrP2ihJ Really? We found that the hecklers were correct in saying that Downing misquoted and misinterpreted the judge’s words. (We reached out to Downing but didn’t hear back.) First, some background on why ""no collusion"" is an important point. One of the biggest arguments President Donald Trump has made in defending himself against investigations by Special Counsel Robert Mueller is that there was ""no collusion"" between the Trump campaign and agents of Russia. Trump offered the ""no collusion"" mantra on Twitter 71 times through March 13. The Washington Post counted 226 times Trump had used the phrase in any context through March 8. Read more: Donald Trump says collusion is not a crime. That’s not right If Trump could get a federal judge — or two — to give their imprimatur to that assertion, it would be a persuasive talking point. But that’s not what Jackson said. (We are awaiting an official court transcript of her remarks from the bench; until then, we’re relying on media accounts of what she said.) In her remarks from the bench, Jackson made a point of pushing back against the ""no collusion"" argument she read in the defense’s sentencing memorandum. ""The ‘no collusion’ refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to the matter at hand,"" she said, adding, ""The ‘no collusion’ mantra is simply a non sequitur."" She also said, ""The ‘no collusion’ mantra is also not accurate, because the investigation is still ongoing."" So, contrary to Downing’s remarks, Jackson didn’t give Manafort a clean bill of health on alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Instead, she said it wasn’t at issue in the cases that reached her courtroom. So what about Downing’s assertion that another court had also given its stamp of approval to the ""no collusion"" argument? That’s incorrect, too. He was presumably referring to the earlier sentencing by Ellis in the Virginia case. In fact, Downing made that case in a statement to reporters on the courthouse steps after Ellis handed down Manafort’s sentence. ""There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official from Russia,"" Downing said. Soon after, Trump cited Ellis and Downing as support for the ""no collusion"" thesis in a tweet. ""Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!"" Trump tweeted. Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country! But that isn’t what Ellis said, either. Here’s the relevant portion of what Ellis said, according to the official court transcript: ""He is not before the court for any allegation that he or anybody at his direction colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election."" To emphasize the point, Ellis repeated it shortly thereafter. ""He's not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election."" Downing said that Jackson ""conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case. So that makes two courts. Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians."" Neither Jackson nor the judge in the other case, Ellis, said anything of the sort. To the contrary, they went out of their way to state the opposite. The street fact-checkers were right.

Do Missouri schools for the severely disabled need a kitchen?
","State Rep. Hannah Kelly, R-Mountain Grove, raised concerns about schools in her district for children with special needs not having kitchens. ""The schools in my district don't have a kitchen,"" she said in a Jan. 29 general hearing on the education budget, after members of the committee discussed services for children with disabilities. Not having a kitchen raises some important issues in terms of food and equipment, especially for children with special needs. So we decided to take a closer look at Kelly's statement, to check if these schools were really missing a kitchen. When we asked Kelly about her statement, she said she was specifically referring to Skyview, a school for children with disabilities. The school currently has 12 students. She clarified: ""The schools in my district do have a kitchen, but not one that is properly equipped for children with disabilities."" Kelly said the kitchen was not used to cook but only to heat up food. So where do meals for the students come from? ""Mountain Grove public schools deliver them food,"" Kelly said. ""But if the local school is closed, and they haven't saved leftovers, then they have no food."" The school's building administrator, Michelle Sharp, said it is challenging to figure out meals when the local schools are closed. ""On those days, it is my responsibility to find food for my children,"" Sharp said. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education requires that a school check prices at local grocery stores and purchase specific approved items. The school is required to cover those costs. Sharp said it is time consuming to meet all of the requirements in the DESE policy. Sharp has reached out to local businesses and restaurants who have provided food, and Kelly has purchased the food twice. Skyview is not the only school in this situation. Sharp also serves as building administrator for Ozark Horizon, another school for students with severe disabilities that also lacks a functioning kitchen. But there could be other schools around the state also facing these issues, Sharp said. From 2012 to 2017, Reta House worked as the building administrator at both Skyview and Ozark Horizon schools.

When asked, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education said the state doesn’t have set policies on school kitchens. Nancy Bowles, DESE communication coordinator, said, after reaching out to the spokesperson for the Food and Nutrition Services office, that there are no requirements for how large or well-equipped a school kitchen is. ""They must be able to prepare and serve a reimbursable meal."" The schools are allowed to use an outside vendor to provide meals. Kelly said, ""The schools in my district don't have a kitchen."" The schools do have a kitchen and appliances but not commercial ones that would be found in a public school. The school does not have the resources or staff to be able to prepare meals for the students in the school and has to rely on local public schools to feed the students.

No, this photo doesn't show Joe Biden engaging in disturbing behavior with a boy
","Former Vice President Joe Biden has hinted that he’s going to join the crowded group of Democrats vying for the presidency. Back in the headlines, he’s again drawing scrutiny from critics and allegations of untoward behavior. ""Countless discomforting photos of @JoeBiden have surfaced but nothing disturbs me more than this one,"" reads the text in what looks like a screenshot of a tweet that was published to Facebook on Feb. 17. ""This is a man who thinks he is running for president in 2020? Pls retweet and spread the awareness for people to look into him. #QAnon #TheStorm #FollowTheWhiteRabbit."" The post shows a photo of Biden leaning down by a boy with his hand cupped on the child’s face. In the post’s comments, the Facebook account also posted a doctored image that appears to show Biden flashing his nude body. Among the more than 18,000 people who shared the post on Facebook, one said, ""President pervert pedophile."" Another wrote: ""Handsie uncle Joe must go!"" The original post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Speculation that Biden has acted inappropriately with women and children isn’t new. In 2015, New York magazine posted nine photos showing ""times Joe Biden creepily whispered in women’s ears.""  But this Facebook post is extremely out of context. We found the original photo, among others, accompanying a June 6, 2015, Associated Press story about the funeral of Beau Biden, the former Delaware attorney general and son of Joe Biden who died of brain cancer. The photo was taken by photographer Patrick Semansky. The caption says: ""Vice President Joe Biden embraces his grandson Hunter before funeral services for Hunter’s father, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, Saturday, June 6, 2015, at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in Wilmington, Del."" We reached out to Semansky to ask more about the image. ""The extended Biden family walked in a procession behind a hearse carrying Beau Biden’s casket,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. ""They stopped roughly 30 feet in front of me, at the church’s front door, as a military honor guard removed the casket from the hearse and carried it inside for a funeral service. At different moments, the VP leaned over to comfort his grandson and granddaughter as they watched the honor guard and then followed the casket inside."" Semansky shared other photos from that day, including one that shows him kissing the top of his granddaughter’s head as she stands holding her mother’s hand, one that shows him holding his granddaughter’s hand with his arm around Beau Biden’s widow, and one that shows Joe Biden, his wife, his son’s widow and his grandchildren holding hands in a line as they approached the hearse. The Facebook post suggests that Biden is behaving inappropriately with a boy. And without context, it’s unclear what’s happening in the photo. Is he covering the child’s mouth? Is he whispering in his ear? The post exploits this ambiguity, leading to comments that take the image as confirmation that the former vice president is a ""pedophile"" or ""handsie."" Rather, he is comforting his grieving grandchildren as they say goodbye to their dad.

No, Beto O'Rourke's father in law did not buy him his congressional seat
","Editor’s note: This is one of four fact-checks featuring a claim made in Club for Growth’s TV ad about Beto O’Rourke. To read the others, click here. El Paso Democrat Beto O’Rourke, who announced Thursday that he is running for president, had been teasing a presidential bid for weeks. Speculation about his intentions prompted the conservative Club for Growth to release a television ad looking to weaken enthusiasm for O’Rourke among Democratic primary voters. The ad argues that O’Rourke has coasted through life due to ""white male privilege"" and that he is a far cry from former President Barack Obama, as many have drawn comparisons between the two Democrats.

Club for Growth provided a fact sheet detailing the source for each statement in the advertisement. Sources include newspaper articles and other sources online. O’Rourke did not return a request for comment. Did Sanders buy his congressional seat? O’Rourke married Amy Hoover Sanders in the early 2000s. Her father, William Sanders, is a wealthy real estate developer who grew up in El Paso. A review of his finances conducted by Forbes in November of 2018 found that, ""it’s unlikely, though possible, that he’s a billionaire."" It estimated that Sanders instead has a net worth of about $500 million. Sanders contributed directly to O’Rourke’s congressional campaign in 2012, giving him $5,000 in individual contributions to fund his challenge of then-U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, an El Paso Democrat who had held his seat for nearly 16 years. During the race, Reyes was targeted by the Campaign for Primary Accountability, a Super PAC with the stated goal of aiding candidates who challenge longtime incumbents from both parties. The group, which was founded by Houston’s Leo Linbeck III, targeted candidates in Texas, Ohio, Illinois and a number of other states during the 2012 election, spending upwards of $1.8 million across 15 congressional races. Campaign finance reports show that the PAC put the largest sum into the O’Rourke-Reyes race: it spent $240,000 against Reyes but did not contribute financially to O’Rourke’s campaign. Sanders did not contribute directly to the Campaign for Primary Accountability PAC, but Campr II Partners, a partnership with ties to Sanders, contributed $37,500 to the group. However, other donors contributed significantly more to the PAC than the partnership. Linebeck gave more than $775,000, businessman Joe J. Ricketts contributed $500,000 and Empower Texans Chairman Tim Dunn gave $350,000. Eric O’Keefe, a co-founder of the PAC, contributed $100,000. Our ruling Club for Growth said O’Rourke’s father-in-law, ""a billionaire real estate developer"" from El Paso, ""bankrolled a Super PAC to buy Beto a congressional seat."" Sanders is not considered a billionaire. He contributed to a PAC that was targeting longtime incumbents in Congress, including O’Rourke’s opponent.

It also claims that O’Rourke did his father-in-law’s ""bidding on the El Paso City Council, pushing a downtown redevelopment scheme to bulldoze a poor Hispanic neighborhood while enriching developers like his father-in-law."" Club for Growth provided a fact sheet detailing the source for each statement in the advertisement. Sources include newspaper articles and other sources online. O’Rourke did not return a request for comment. Plan called for city, business collaboration O’Rourke served on the El Paso City Council from 2005 until 2011. During that time, he supported a proposal that called for redeveloping about 300 acres in downtown El Paso, including the Segundo Barrio, a historic, predominately Hispanic neighborhood. The plan called for revitalizing historic buildings in the area while constructing shopping centers, restaurants and entertainment areas like an amphitheater and an art walk. It also called for the construction of an arena for sports and music events. The plan was spearheaded by the Paso Del Norte Group, a private association of dozens of business leaders in El Paso that was co-founded by William Sanders, O’Rourke’s father-in-law. The plan was initiated in 2004, before O’Rourke was in office, and was pitched as a collaboration between the local government and business leaders from the area. Most properties in the footprint of the plan were slated to be redeveloped, using a phased plan to give residents and businesses in the area the opportunity to move to new locations. Leaders of the plan insisted that relocation would not be required for all properties affected by the plan. They also pledged to move current residents of the area into new residential areas after construction finished. The proposal called for using two primary methods of obtaining property in the area slated for redevelopment: eminent domain and a real estate investment trust, established for the sole purpose of acquiring property in the area. Sanders formed the Borderplex Community Trust, a real estate investment trust, in early 2007 and by 2008 it had more than 200 investors, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Sanders originally pledged not to put his own money into the trust, but months later he announced that he did intend to invest, in the hopes of encouraging others to contribute, according to a 2006 article in the El Paso Times. But Sanders pledged not to take any profits he earned as an individual from the investment and said he would donate them to a local charity. O’Rourke spoke in favor of the proposal but he abstained on key votes related to the use of eminent domain and other elements of the project. Two ethics complaints were filed against O’Rourke alleging a conflict of interest due to Sanders’ involvement in the plan -- both were dismissed by the city’s ethics commission. The Club for Growth ad showed video footage of a bulldozer tearing down a building, but the plan in question was not implemented as it was proposed. Many in El Paso said it ""fizzled."" Other downtown revitalization efforts have been pursued, many spearheaded by local business leaders, according to the El Paso Times.

"['Death Penalty', 'Crime', 'Public Safety', 'California', 'Gavin Newsom']","
It's still True: California has ‘largest death row in the Western Hemisphere’
","Moments after signing an executive order suspending California’s death penalty, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state’s massive death row doesn’t square with its more recent efforts to reform the criminal justice system. ""The pendulum’s swinging in a new direction,"" Newsom said at a news conference at the Capitol on Wednesday, adding that the state is moving away from its tough-on-crime and ""mass over-incarceration"" approach of the 1980s and 1990s. The governor then added a familiar claim about the size of California’s death row. ""All the while we had this sore thumb that stood out in California. That is we were laying claim to having the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere. The largest death row in the United States of America -- two times the size of the next largest state: Florida."" In 2016, we fact-checked a similar claim by the Yes on 62 campaign to abolish the death penalty in California. We rated it True. In this fact check, we’ll examine the current numbers and explain whether this statement, repeated by Newsom, remains accurate. Our research Notably, Newsom’s action doesn’t eliminate California’s death row nor does it change the sentence for any inmates. Instead, it puts on hold any executions while Newsom’s in office. A future governor could reinstate capital punishment. Governors in other states, Colorado, Oregon and Pennsylvania, have already imposed suspensions on executions. Washington state had been under a similar moratorium, and last year its Supreme Court struck down the death penalty there as ""arbitrary and racially biased,"" according to The Washington Post. In 2016, California voters rejected Proposition 62, a measure to eliminate the death penalty, with 46.9 percent voting to end executions and 53 percent voting to keep it. Voters narrowly approved Proposition 66, a separate measure to speed up executions. Two months before that election, a poll found 48 percent of likely voters supported repealing the death penalty, while 37 percent were opposed and 15 percent undecided. As we reported three years ago, the size of California’s death row is striking. The largest death row populations in the Western Hemisphere belong to states within the United States, not separate countries, Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told us at the time. The Washington D.C.-based nonprofit is considered an authority on death penalty topics, and opposes capital punishment. California has fewer people on death row than are condemned to die across the United States. But experts say death rows in the U.S. are ranked individually by state, not as a national whole, making California’s stand far out from the rest. We used a similar interpretation of the claim as we examined its accuracy. In a phone interview today, Dunham confirmed there’s been no significant shift in the rankings, and that California still has the largest total in the Western Hemisphere, followed by Florida and Texas. That confirms the first part of Newsom’s claim. 737 inmates on death row California’s total death row population was 737 as of March 12, 2019, according to a tally by the California Department of Corrections. That’s down slightly from 746 three years ago. The state hasn’t executed anyone in more than a decade due to legal challenges, but the population has declined due to suicide and natural deaths. By comparison, Florida has executed more than 30 people over the past decade and Texas has put to death more than 100 inmates over that period.   Despite the small drop in California's death row total, it remains more than twice Florida’s 343 death row inmates, according to current figures from that state’s corrections agency. That verifies the second portion of Newsom’s statement. No comparison in Western Hemisphere Here’s what Dunham told us about comparisons to other countries in the hemisphere. ""Most of the Western Hemisphere has abolished the death penalty. Apart from the United States, the retentionist countries are Cuba, Guatemala and Guyana and then a couple of countries in the Caribbean. None of them have death rows that are remotely the size of California’s or even Florida’s,"" Dunham told us in 2016. Canada did away with the death penalty in 1976; Mexico eliminated it in 2005. Dunham confirmed there’s been no significant change among these countries. Our ruling Gov. Gavin Newsom repeated the claim that California’s death row ""is the largest in the Western Hemisphere. The largest death row in the United States of America -- two times the size of the next largest state: Florida."" We rated a similar claim True in 2016. At the time, we noted most countries in the Western Hemisphere have abolished the death penalty and that several U.S. states have far higher death row totals than the few remaining countries that still use capital punishment. Experts say death rows in the U.S. are ranked individually, and that the rankings have not shifted in recent years. California’s 737 death row inmates stands out considerably from other states, as well as countries in the Western Hemisphere. Newsom repeated what remains both an accurate and somber statement. We rate his claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'PunditFact', 'Matthew Dowd']","
Did Obama's final years beat Trump on jobs, stock values?
","President Donald Trump has often touted the strength of the economy’s performance during his tenure. But critics often counter that the economic gains were at least as good as, if not better than, they were under his predecessor, Barack Obama. Matthew Dowd, a former Republican consultant who now considers himself an independent and a critic of Trump, recently tweeted a statistical comparison along these lines, one that was later picked up on Facebook. ""So job growth and stock growth for the first two years of Trump are down from where they were (during the) last two years of Obama,"" Dowd tweeted on March 8. ""The budget deficit, trade deficits and hate crimes are significantly up today from where they were when Obama left office."" So job growth and stock growth for first two years of Trump are down from where they were last two years of Obama. The budget deficit, trade deficits and hate crimes are significantly up today from where they were when Obama left office. Facts. Dowd is correct about the Trump-era increases in the budget deficit, the trade deficit, and hate crimes.  But how about Dowd’s assertion that ""job growth and stock growth for the first two years of Trump are down from where they were (during the) last two years of Obama""? There, he’s on shakier ground. (Dowd did not respond to inquiries.) We looked at Bureau of Labor Statistics data for monthly increases in employment for a pair of two-year periods: Jan. 20, 2015, to Jan. 20, 2017, (Obama's final two years) and Jan. 20, 2017, to Jan. 20, 2019 (Trump's first two years). Dowd is correct that Obama’s average monthly increase was higher, though not by very much — an increase of 210,291 jobs per month for Obama over that period, compared to an increase of 205,720 per month for Trump. That’s an edge of about 2 percent for Obama. Digging a little deeper into the numbers, Jed Kolko, the chief economist for jobs site Indeed.com, noted that the average monthly employment increase declined from 2015 to 2016 to 2017. The surprise came in 2018, when the average monthly employment gain exceeded 2016 and 2017 levels. ""The tax cuts may have helped temporarily, along with a strong global economy,"" Kolko said, referring to the overhaul signed by Trump at the end of 2017. ""Both under Obama and under Trump, job growth has far exceeded what's needed to keep up with growth in the labor force and the working-age population."" Ultimately, though, ""the best characterization"" of the job data between the end of the Obama years and the first years of Trump is ""more of the same,"" said Steve Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. For this part of Dowd’s tweet, we looked at two common measures of the stock market: the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor’s 500. (As the graphs below indicate, the broad patterns were remarkably similar.) On the stocks measurement, we found, Trump has the statistical edge over the same period of time we looked at for job growth. The Dow was up by 24.6 percent under Trump, compared to 13.2 percent for Obama.   And for the S&P 500, Trump was up 17.6 percent, compared to 12.3 percent for Obama.   If you continue tallying the markets’ performance through today, the record under Trump only grows stronger — a 28.9 percent bump for the Dow since his inauguration, and a 22.9 percent increase for the S&P 500. So on this metric, Dowd is wrong. As we’ve noted, most recent presidents have seen significant stock market increases over their terms. Presidents Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, for instance, all oversaw three-digit percentage increases over their eight year terms. The one president who lost ground was President George W. Bush, whose final year in office coincided with the onset of the Great Recession. Fazzari said he’s not surprised at the stock run-up under Trump. ""One clear benefit for stock prices in the Trump period is the big corporate tax cut,"" he said. ""It’s not at all surprising that if you reduce taxes on corporate profits, stock prices will rise. The bigger question is whether the corporate tax cut has been more broadly successful for the economy. The results have been largely disappointing so far with stock buybacks rather than an investment boom and what now looks like it will be just a temporary and small bump to growth in the middle of last year."" It’s always important to note that a president doesn’t deserve either full credit for job gains on their watch (or full blame for job losses). Many other factors, from the state of the global economy to changes in technology, can have an impact. It’s also worth noting that not every American is invested in the stock market, so it’s probably a less important economic metric than either jobs or the growth in gross domestic product. Dowd tweeted, ""Job growth and stock growth for the first two years of Trump are down from where they were (during the) last two years of Obama."" Dowd is right about job growth under the two presidents, though the difference between them is quite small. But he’s wrong about the stock market, which increased by a larger percentage during Trump’s first two years than in Obama’s final two. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ADD980>],/factchecks/2019/mar/13/matthew-dowd/did-obamas-final-years-beat-trump-jobs-stock-value/
"['National', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Jay Inslee']","
Did Washington state build $6 billion in wind farms over a dozen years?
","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has made fighting climate change the top priority of his 2020 Democratic presidential bid. In a sit-down with CNN, Inslee touted his state’s success in adopting renewable energy technology over a relatively short time span. ""We have done some good things,"" Inslee told CNN’s Jake Tapper March 10. ""We have developed a wind industry from zero to $6 billion in 12 years."" Inslee’s claim about Washington state’s wind energy investment was on the money. But if it sounds like Inslee is taking credit for it, it's worth noting he was governor for only a brief period during this build-up.  We traced Inslee’s stat to a fact sheet on Washington from the American Wind Energy Association. The AWEA fact sheet puts capital investment in the Evergreen State’s wind industry at $6.1 billion through 2017. A footnote to that dollar figure states that the calculation is ""based on national and state averages."" We weren’t sure what that meant, so we reached out to AWEA and independent experts for clarification. Daniel Schwartz, a professor at the University of Washington and director of the Clean Energy Institute, walked us through how the numbers are crunched. A typical approach to estimating the value of wind investment in a given area begins by figuring out that area’s amount of generating capacity, as measured in megawatts. One megawatt is equivalent to 1 million watts. For instance, Washington state had 3,075 megawatts of wind capacity at the end of 2017, according to the Department of Energy, ranking it 10th in the nation. Texas blew away the rest of the country with 22,599 megawatts of overall wind electricity generation. Here’s a nationwide snapshot from the most recent Department of Energy report: The cost of installing a wind turbine changes from year to year based on market forces. So arriving at a grand total of wind investment requires calculating the cost for each year, then adding up those annual figures. To determine the cost of wind investment, you take the amount of megawatts of capacity added in a given year, and multiply that figure by the average cost for installed wind projects that year. Pricing data — measured in terms of dollars per megawatt — comes from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. ""We use a national or regional average price per megawatt, rather than an actual price to acquire the generating capacity,"" Schwartz explained. ""That’s because the actual contracted price each utility got from the vendor is not generally reported to the public."" AWEA confirmed this was essentially their methodology to reach the $6.1 billion figure for Washington’s total capital investment in wind farms—all of which was built in the 13 years between 2001 and 2014. (They noted that the value is a bit higher if you factor inflation.) Inslee became governor in 2013.  As for the time element of Inslee’s claim, AWEA said the state’s investment in 2001 was relatively meager. So the governor’s claim that the investment took place over 12 years is basically correct. A spokesman for the Department of Energy’s renewable energy office said AWEA’s numbers were in line with federal pricing data from the department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. They, too, noted the value is higher if you factor inflation. Inslee said, ""We've developed a wind industry from zero to $6 billion in 12 years."" His figure is backed up by the American Wind Energy Association and federal pricing data from the Department of Energy. The vast majority of Washington’s wind energy capital was invested over a 12-year period, from 2002 through 2014. It's worth noting that Inslee became governor only in 2013. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate this Mostly True.

Crenshaw falsely says HR1 would legalize the type of election fraud found in NC
","You don’t want to end up like North Carolina. That’s what some politicians have warned since February, when the NC authorities ordered a new election after finding fraud in the 9th Congressional District race. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell mentioned North Carolina in a Feb. 26 speech when he slammed HR 1, a Democrat-authored bill that aims to make voting easier. McConnell criticized the bill for not addressing ballot harvesting. On March 9, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, took the criticism a step further. Responding on Twitter to Rep. Joe Kennedy, a supporter of the bill, Crenshaw said HR1 would legalize the ""kind of fraud"" found in North Carolina. ""You do realize your bill #HR1 would actually make that kind of fraud in #NC09 LEGAL. Right? TRUTH: it would legalize vote harvesting across the entire country, use your tax $ to do it, and limit free speech drastically,"" Crenshaw tweeted. The terms ""vote harvesting"" and ""ballot harvesting"" typically refer to political operatives tracking down and collecting absentee ballots from voters. Many states have strict laws limiting who can file ballots on behalf of absentee voters. In those states, ballot harvesting is illegal. So is Crenshaw right? Would HR 1 ""legalize"" ballot harvesting across the country? A PolitiFact review of the bill found dozens of mentions of absentee ballots — but none of the proposed law changes would absolve North Carolina’s political operatives of wrongdoing. WHAT HAPPENED IN NC Republican Mark Harris appeared to beat Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes. But in February, an investigation by the NC elections board found that political operatives tampered with absentee ballots and may have gained special access to voting results in Bladen County. A new election is scheduled for September. In testimony during the North Carolina investigation, political operatives admitted they: • Illegally collected – harvested – absentee by-mail ballots. State law prohibits anyone other than a close relative from handling a voter’s absentee ballot. • Filled in votes for Republicans if absentee voters left some races blank. • Forged witness signatures on the absentee by-mail ballots. Additionally, many absentee ballots were requested but never returned. Ultimately, the NC elections board staff referred to the fraud as a ""coordinated, unlawful, and substantially-resourced absentee ballot scheme."" The board itself, a group of political appointees from both major parties, voted unanimously to nullify the November results. WHAT HR1 SAYS HR 1, also known as the For the People Act of 2019, mentions absentee voters dozens of times. But it doesn’t: HR 1 ""is silent on the question of whether states can have laws which allow people to collect absentee ballots from others,"" said Rick Hasen, professor of law and political science at UC Irvine. Hasen said Crenshaw’s tweet is ""false on a few counts."" There’s ""absolutely nothing in HR 1 that I’ve seen"" that would loosen ballot collection rules or ""legalize anyone other than the voter adding votes to a ballot,"" said Justin Levitt, a professor and associate dean for research at Loyola Law School in California. In fact, Rep. Mark Walker, a North Carolina Republican, introduced an amendment that tried to ban ballot-harvesting. But it failed. The bill does mention absentee ballots in the context of improving voting access. In that section, 305, the bill reinforces the authority of state governments to enact methods for tracking absentee ballot delivery. Another section, 307, seeks to ensure the authenticity of absentee ballots and reinforces states’ rights to craft procedures. WHAT CRENSHAW SAID So what was Crenshaw referring to? PolitiFact emailed his office at about 11 a.m. Monday. About 30 minutes later, Crenshaw tweeted a clarification. ""Worth clarifying: HR1 enables ballot harvesting via mandatory no-fault absentee ballots and by not outlawing the practice of ballot harvesting. Dems rejected our amendment to HR1 that would make it illegal. It should be illegal bc it allows fraud like we saw in #NC09,"" he tweeted. Responding to a PolitiFact email, Crenshaw spokeswoman Kerry Rom referred us to the second tweet and provided no other context. Crenshaw’s second tweet refers to HR1’s effort to allow more people to fill out absentee ballots. Some states require voters to have an excuse — illness, disability, etc. — to qualify for an absentee ballot. Some states, including North Carolina, don’t require voters to have an excuse at all. A state-by-state breakdown of voting laws can be found on the National Conference of State Legislatures website. HR 1 would expand ""no excuse,"" aka ""no fault,"" absentee voting across the country. Again, though, Crenshaw’s tweet is misleading. ""Not taking additional steps to outlaw something at the federal level is a pretty far cry from ‘making the kind of fraud in NC09 legal’,"" Levitt said. WHAT EXPERTS SAY It’s fair to claim that allowing more absentee voting may present would-be criminals with more opportunities to break the law. But his second tweet suggests that banning ballot harvesting could have prevented the fraud in North Carolina. That’s not true. Ballot harvesting ""is already illegal in North Carolina, and those laws didn’t prevent the misconduct,"" said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. What about Crenshaw’s claim about the harvesting efforts being taxpayer-funded? Part 7 of the bill calls on the federal government to reimburse states that create a ballot-tracking system. ""As to the tax dollars, my guess (and it is only a guess) is that he’s confusing a separate question related to public financing of elections,"" Hasen said in an email. ""Republicans have attacked public financing as taking tax dollars for politicians,"" Hasen continued. ""In the end, HR 1 was amended to use fees from wrongdoers to pay for the financing of elections. But whether or not it is fair to call the financing provisions taxpayer funded, that has nothing to do with the so-called ‘ballot harvesting’ issue."" OUR RULING Crenshaw said HR 1 would legalize the ""kind of fraud"" found in NC’s 9th district. There’s nothing in the bill that expands who can collect absentee ballots, allows people to fill out ballots for others, or loosens witnessing procedures for absentee ballots. Crenshaw then clarified his original tweet to say ""no excuse"" absentee voting enables ballot harvesting. The second tweet also suggested that banning ballot harvesting would’ve prevented fraud in North Carolina. That’s not true. And his arguments do nothing to substantiate his original tweet. We rate his claim False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Claims about Thomas Jefferson and marijuana are mostly off
","Thomas Jefferson was a diplomat, architect, author of the Declaration of Independence, the third president of the United States – and a pot smoker? One Facebook post makes the claim that the founding father drafted the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper and ""grew and smoked weed."" It also quotes Jefferson as saying that ""Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We previously checked out the rumor that the Declaration of Independence was supposedly written on hemp paper and rated it False. For a quick re-hashing, officials at Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, say that the document was penned on parchment, which is made from animal skin. ""A number of sites on the Internet claim that the Declaration of Independence was written on paper made from hemp. As far as we know, this is not true,"" Monticello says on its website. But did Jefferson actually grow and smoke marijuana and did he say hemp is the ""first necessity to the wealth and protection of this country?"" Well, there is one kernel of confirmable truth: Jefferson did grow hemp—but not necessarily ""weed,"" as the post suggests. While hemp comes from cannabis plants like marijuana, it doesn’t contain the same level of tetrahydrocannabinol—or THC, for short—the active chemical in marijuana that causes people to experience the ""high"" often associated with the drug. State statutes, with the exception of West Virginia, define industrial hemp as a variety of cannabis with a THC concentration of no more than 0.3 percent. (West Virginia puts it at less than 1 percent.) The level of THC in marijuana is not always the same and can vary depending on the strain or variety of the plant, the way it is grown, the part of the plant that is used and the way it is stored. Hash, for example, can have THC concentrations ranging from 10 to 20 percent, while marijuana cannabis (the dried buds and leaves of the plant) can vary widely in potency from 1 to 20 percent. It is also worth noting that the marijuana used today is stronger than it used to be. Jefferson grew hemp both at Monticello and his other plantation, Poplar Forest, but it was primarily used (along with flax and cotton) to make clothing. Other founding fathers, including George Washington, grew hemp and Americans were legally bound to grow the plant during the Colonial Era and Early Republic. But there is no record of Jefferson ever smoking the plant. The National Constitution Center, an institution devoted to the U.S. Constitution, tackled some of the most popular myths about the Founding Fathers and marijuana and noted that if Jefferson or others at the time did attempt smoking hemp, they likely didn’t experience euphoria because of its low levels of THC. Monticello addressed the rumor as well, and said there is no evidence to suggest that Jefferson was a habitual smoker of ""hemp, tobacco, or any other substance."" ""Some have pointed to a supposed reference in Jefferson's farm book to separating male and female hemp plants as evidence that he was cultivating it for purposes of recreational smoking,"" the organization wrote, ""... no such reference exists in Jefferson's farm book or any other document."" The quote that hemp is ""of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country"" can be found in the national archived Jefferson papers, which is a collection of the correspondence and papers not only written by Jefferson, as well as letters he received. This particular phrase wasn’t written or said by Jefferson, said David Sewell, manager of Digital Initiatives of The University of Virginia Press, which works in conjunction with Founders Online. What’s more, the quote is a little incomplete.The phrase was written in ""Enclosure: Notes respecting Tobacco"" on March 16, 1791, by Gouverneur Morris, a founding father, American statesman, and a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution. The full quote: ""A Fact well established in the System of Agriculture is that the best Hemp and the best Tobacco grow on the same Kind of Soil. The former Article is of first Necessity to the Commerce and Marine in other Words to the Wealth and Protection of the Country."" So while the comment was included in a letter sent to Jefferson, it wasn’t his words. ""If the words have been attributed to Jefferson,"" Sewell wrote in an email to PolitiFact, ""that is probably the result of someone’s misunderstanding of the context, or of wanting to associate them with someone with better name recognition."" It’s worth noting that while Jefferson may not have said this particular quote, he did consider hemp to be an important crop, and made several references to it in his letters. A meme being shared online claims that Thomas Jefferson penned the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper, grew and smoked marijuana, and once said the plant was of ""first necessity to the protection and wealth of the country."" The Declaration of Independence was not drafted on hemp, but on parchment made from animal skin, But Jefferson did indeed grow the plant (not necessarily weed, though). There is no evidence to suggest Jefferson ever smoked marijuana, and if he had, it likely would have been the hemp he grew, which had very low levels of THC. Jefferson also did not say that specific phrase, but his favor of the crop is well documented. With all this taken into account, we rate this post Mostly False. Update March 15, 2019: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that a quote similar to the one attributed to Jefferson in this claim is found in the Jefferson papers but was not made by Jefferson himself. This update does not affect the ruling.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C1F1C0>],/factchecks/2019/mar/13/facebook-posts/claims-about-thomas-jefferson-and-marijuana-are-mo/

Republicans botch claim comparing tuition for immigrants, veterans
","In the latest volley of Wisconsin’s budget battle, Republican lawmakers zeroed in on proposed tuition breaks for Wisconsin residents who aren’t U.S. citizens. Five Republicans who are military veterans put out a joint news release criticizing Gov. Tony Evers’ budget for proposing that non-citizen immigrants be allowed to pay in-state tuition rates throughout the University of Wisconsin System and state technical colleges. In the March 12, 2019 release, state Reps. Jesse James, Ken Skowronski, Jim Ott, John Spiros and Tony Kurtz said immigrants would get a break on tuition after three years, while military veterans must wait five years. Republican leaders took up the cause on Twitter, including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke. ""Under (Gov. Tony Evers’) budget, undocumented immigrants would qualify for in-state tuition two years sooner than our veterans would,"" Steineke, R-Kaukauna, said in a March 12, 2019, tweet. The news release and tweets all included a graphic titled ""The Fine Print,"" attributed to the Wisconsin Assembly GOP. It read: ""In state tuition for non U.S. citizens after 3 years in WI. (Veterans have to wait 5 YEARS)."" Did Republicans get their own fine print right? Not really. Let’s check out the tuition benefits available to the two groups. Differences in veteran and immigrant benefits The graphic claimed non-U.S. citizens could pay in-state tuition after three years, but veterans have to wait five years for that benefit. The first problem: The graphic conflates two different types of programs. Under Evers’ budget proposal, citizens of other countries who live in Wisconsin would be able to pay in-state tuition rates if they graduated from high school in Wisconsin, lived in the state at least three years before applying to college and show proof they have filed or will file for a permanent resident visa, according to a memo prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau Meanwhile, the veteran’s program cited is for tuition remission. That is, tuition paid for. Under the program, veterans can have all of their tuition and fees covered for up to eight semesters if they meet certain conditions, according to the memo. Requirements include serving at least two years under ""honorable conditions,"" maintaining a 2.0 GPA and being a Wisconsin resident. Veterans qualify for remission after they have used their education benefits under the GI Bill. Here is an important point: Veterans who lived in Wisconsin when they entered the service get the school funding right away. There is no wait at all. Those that moved to Wisconsin after their service must live here five years before getting the funding. So the wait is five years for one category of veterans and three years for undocumented immigrants, which is the number Republicans focus on. But many veterans get the larger benefits without a wait. In the 2017-18 school year, more than 3,300 veterans had their tuition covered through the remission program within the UW System or the state technical college system, according to the fiscal bureau. We aren’t aware of any data on the background of the veterans before they applied for the benefit, but it is likely more qualified immediately as residents than those who faced the five-year wait. Deleted tweets, amended news release The problematic comparison between the two programs led Republicans to pull back their initial salvo. Tweets comparing the tuition breaks from Vos, Steineke and the Assembly GOP were all deleted a few hours after they were posted. The Republican veterans’ news release was amended to show a new graphic. Staffers for Vos and Steineke said the tweets were removed because the graphic was ""updated."" The updated news release — and later tweets from Republican legislators — changed the veterans reference in ""The Fine Print"" graphic to say ""Non-resident veterans have to wait 5 years before the remission."" So the new version clarifies that it is referring to ""non-resident"" veterans and mentions remission. But it still has a comparison that is built on two different programs with two very different benefits. Our rating A graphic that popped up in a news release and tweets from an array of Republicans — many later deleted or updated — claimed Wisconsin residents who aren’t citizens could get in-state tuition in three years, but veterans have to wait five years. The claim is off on several counts. The available benefit for veterans is not discounted in-state tuition, but full coverage of all tuition and fees. And the five-year wait applies only to veterans who move to the state after their service time ends, not to all veterans. Many would get the larger benefits without any wait. In our view, the original claim contained an element of truth but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s what we call Mostly False.
