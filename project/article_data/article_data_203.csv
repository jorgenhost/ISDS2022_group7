Dale Peterson was in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War, but there's more to the story
","
It's the ""it"" political ad so far this season. If you haven't yet seen the ad from tough-talking, cowboy-hat-wearing, rifle-toting Dale Peterson, who is running in the Republican primary to be Alabama's agriculture commissioner, you really should check it out. Immediately.

Time's Dale Fletcher dubbed it ""the Best Campaign Ad Ever."" On MSNBC, Chris Matthews said it ""may be the most all-out, all-American, hot dog, apple pie and I love my gun, US of A political ad ever made."" A blog posting on the ad in the Los Angeles Times ran under the headline, ""We're voting for Dale Peterson for Alabama ag commissioner (because we're scared of him)."" Peterson has been a guest on the Glenn Beck radio program (he called Beck ""big guy"" several times and explained that the rifle is .30-.30 Winchester) and was interviewed on the Fox Business News channel under the banner ""Running on Anger.""

As of press time, the ad had been viewed by more than 1.2 million people on YouTube. A million-two. Again, this is a race to be Alabama's agriculture commissioner.

It's raised Peterson to a measure of cult status. Exhibit A: the website dalepetersonfacts.com that inserts Peterson into the whole Chuck Norris meme. For example: ""Dale Peterson Fact #2: Superman wears Dale Peterson pajamas"" and ""Dale Peterson Fact #15: When Dale Peterson slices an onion, the onion cries.""

And you know you've arrived when your ad spawns a spoof, courtesy of funnyordie.com.

We hate to be a wet blanket amid all this fun, but there was a line in the ad that caught our attention.

""I've been a farmer, a businessman, a cop, a Marine during Vietnam, so listen up!"" Peterson barked.

It's the phrase ""during Vietnam"" that jumped out, especially in light of the New York Times last week calling out Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat running for the U.S.  Senate, for saying that he served in Vietnam and ""during the Vietnam era"" when in fact he actually received five military deferments before enlisting in the Marine Reserve, enabling him to avoid combat overseas.

We went to Peterson's campaign website. In a bio via the link ""Meet Dale,"" it says, ""He joined the Marine Corps in 1963, returning to Birmingham in 1967, where he became a police officer.""

In a press release on the campaign website from Feb. 2, 2010, announcing his candidacy, Peterson states, ""In 1963 (Vietnam), when I joined the Marine Corps, my country needed me. In 2010 my state needs me.""

We found one more online reference to Peterson's military service, on a website for the CLI Llama Breed Association. Peterson served on the association's management team, and it includes a bio for Peterson. When we looked at the site on May 20, 2010, it read, ""After high school Dale joined the Marine Corps and served two tours during the Vietnam Conflict."" By the following day, the website had been changed to read simply, ""After high school Dale joined the Marine Corps."" (You can see the older version here; and the current one here).

We phoned Peterson to get some clarification on his military service and reached him as he was waiting in line for breakfast at Cracker Barrel. When we mentioned the ad, he shared, unsolicited, that he was wearing his cowboy hat and boots, just like in the commercial. Then we inquired about the allusion to Vietnam.

""That means exactly what it says, 'during Vietnam,' "" Peterson said. ""I say what I mean and I mean what I say.""

Peterson said he never served in Vietnam.

So where did he serve? ""From San Juan to Camp LeJeune to Parris Island.""

That's San Juan, Puerto Rico; the Marine Corps's Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.; and the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, S.C. Peterson said he was an MP (military police) in San Juan.

Does he worry that he might have given the impression that he served in Vietnam?

""All they have to do is look at the words,"" Peterson said. ""If I had served in Vietnam, I for damn sure would have said I did. I served during Vietnam, and I am quite proud if it.""

You have to remember, he said, that he enlisted in the Marine Corps at a time when the military was not very popular in the United States.

Jerry Newberry, director of communications for Veterans of Foreign Wars, thinks Peterson -- particularly in the press release -- is ""walking a fine line.""

""He's not really saying he served in Vietnam,"" Newberry said. ""But I would probably assume he did.""

""In my experience, and I have met with thousands and thousands of veterans, usually they'll attach a caveat to it. They'll say, 'I was in the Army during Vietnam, although I didn’t serve in-country,'"" Newberry said. ""He is letting people draw their own conclusions. But it's hard to say he's inaccurate.""

So is Peterson misleading voters when he says he served during Vietnam?

We don't think his comment rises to a Blumenthal level. Blumenthal said he served ""in Vietnam."" That was just outright false.

Peterson's words in the ad are technically accurate, but we think it's misleading by omission. We agree with Newberry that Peterson appears to be letting people draw their own conclusions, and we think all but the most attentive people would assume if you said you served in the Marines during Vietnam that you served in the Marines in Vietnam. And we think the wording in the campaign press release is even more likely to confuse people.

At PolitiFact, we rate statements that are accurate but ignore critical facts as Barely True. And we think that describes Peterson's claim to a ""T"": Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/may/26/dale-peterson/dale-peterson-was-marine-and-it-was-during-vietnam/

Dale Peterson squawks about chicken farm campaign funds in Alabama Ag Commissioner race
","One of the most talked-about political ads of the primary election season comes courtesy of a relatively obscure race: the Republican primary for the Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries. 

It's the tough-talking, rifle-toting Dale ""Cowboy"" Peterson who propels the ad to an instant classic. To date, the ad has been viewed more 1.2 million times on YouTube. In it, Peterson aims his most pointed verbal attack against Republican primary opponent Dorman Grace.

""Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving contributions from industries he would regulate. Bragging about receiving illegal money on Facebook. Who on earth would support such a dummy?""

It's one thing to call your opponent a dummy. It's another to call him a cheat. And so we decided to check out Peterson's claim that Grace was guilty of taking illegal campaign contributions. And then bragging about it on Facebook.

Campaign finance reports submitted to the Alabama Secretary of State, and viewable online, show that Grace has taken contributions from several ""farms."" Among them, deer and poultry farms. And on his Facebook page, Grace thanked some of the supporters who have contributed to his campaign, including some of the farmers in question.

So are the contributions ""illegal""?

In 1998, the Alabama Legislature passed a law ""to prohibit the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Industries or a candidate for the office of commissioner from accepting campaign contributions from persons associated with businesses regulated by the department.""

The contributions to Grace have given rise to several complaints with the state Ethics Commission -- not by Peterson -- but the commission has yet to rule on them.

He's no expert on election laws, Peterson said in a phone interview with PolitiFact, but this seems pretty cut and dry.

""You can readily see that industries that we regulate, he's accepting money from them,"" Peterson said.

End of story? Not necessarily.

The Grace campaign says it has done nothing wrong because the contributions to the campaign don't come from industries regulated by the agriculture commissioner.

Tullie Culverhouse, campaign manager for Grace, contends the law was intended to bar contributions from agencies regulated by the ag commissioner, such as fertilizer and pest control companies which have to come to the department for a permit to operate in Alabama.

""Poultry farms are not regulated by the department,"" Culverhouse said. ""They are serviced by the department. The only thing they do is serve the industry with disease control. This is frivolous.""

So those are the competing opinions of the two campaigns.

We spoke with Glen Zorn, the assistant ag commissioner and Democratic candidate for the top agriculture job. Zorn doesn't think it would be accurate to say, for example, that poultry farms are ""regulated"" by the commissioner. He hasn't taken any money from any poultry farmers, he said, but he would.

The law about not accepting contributions from ""persons associated with businesses regulated by the department"" has never been tested, and remains a gray area, said Jeff Webb, legal advisor to the Agriculture Commissioner.

""We can go on anyone's property that is growing hens and make sure they are following all of the mandates to prevent outbreaks of infectious or contagious disease,"" Webb said. And so, he said, ""There is an argument that they are regulated by us.""

But there's a pretty good argument in the other direction, too, he said.

Ray Hilburn, Poultry Program Director for the Alabama Department of Agriculture, said he doesn't view the department's role as a regulator of poultry farms.

""We regulate diseases,"" he said. ""We do disease work. We make sure the birds are disease-free. But we don't regulate the poultry growers themselves, in my opinion.""

Ultimately, it appears the state Ethics Commission is going to have to decide whether these contributions were improper (and it seems unlikely we'll hear a decision before next month's Republican primary). But we think it's fair to say that when the state's poultry program director and the legal advisor to the Alabama Department of Agriculture say the law is untested and unclear, it's a bit of a gray area. And so we rule Peterson's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/may/26/dale-peterson/candidates-squawk-about-chicken-farm-donations-ala/

Florida Democrats accuse Bill McCollum of reckless spending
","In 2008, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum hired a little-known psychologist to testify in favor of Florida's ban on gay adoptions. George Rekers, who built a reputation as an antigay crusader, held a day job as an officer for the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality. Fast forward to May 2010: Rekers is more well-known and so, arguably, is McCollum, the GOP's gubernatorial frontrunner. Rekers gained notoriety after a Miami alternative weekly revealed that he employed a ""rentboy"" for a European vacation; Rekers said his travel mate was helping him carry his luggage because he couldn't physically carry it. The ties between Rekers and McCollum resurfaced; naturally, the Democrats fired back. On May 18, 2010, Florida Democratic party chair Karen Thurman demanded that McCollum return the state money he used to pay Rekers -- more than $120,000 -- as an expert witness. The expense, Thurman argued, was just one example of how McCollum has flushed away tax dollars for personal and political gain.""Sadly for Florida, this fiscal recklessness is only the latest disturbing example in a long line of instances where your office wasted state funds to further your political ambitions or partisan ideology,"" Thurman wrote. ""Last year, you spent more than $2.2 million dollars to produce and air campaign-style TV ads where you were featured in almost every frame."" We were curious to know if the GOP gubernatorial candidate did indeed spend that dollar amount, and if his face appeared so prominently in the ads as alleged.Thurman is referring to McCollum's 2009 cybersafety project that featured a TV ad warning viewers about the dangers of online sex predators. The 35-second public service message, which aired statewide over several weeks, struck some as bearing too much resemblance to a campaign ad.Watch the ad for yourself and it's clear the attorney general appears in almost every single frame. When his mug isn't there, his name is. So on this point, the Democrats are right.Now how much did the ad cost? Public records show that the Office of the Attorney General paid Chris Mottola Consulting $2,267,189 for the cybersafety project in fiscal year 2009. The total spent, however, turned out to be $2,142,654, according to Sandi Copes, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's Office. The difference was returned to the State of Florida because it wasn't used, Copes said. ""It was refunded,"" she said. Copes broke the amount down further: Mottola received the full amount but he collected only $202,509 because he spent the rest on supplies and air time. The rest was spent as follows:  We should note that McCollum took heat for awarding the project to Mottola, his former political consultant, in a no-bid contract. The program was funded through settlements obtained by the AG's office, Copes said. No general revenue dollars were used.So the Florida Democratic Party said that McCollum spent ""more than $2.2 million dollars to produce and air campaign-style TV ads"" and McCollum was ""featured in almost every frame."" McCollum's office spent just under $2.2 million for the ad, but the ubiquity of the AG's mug checked out and so we rule this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/may/25/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-accuse-bill-mccollum-reckless-sp/

Steele says GOP fought hard for civil rights bills in 1960s
","When Rand Paul of Kentucky followed up his victory in the May 18, 2010, Republican U.S. Senate primary by saying that he had some reservations about the philosophical underpinnings of the Civil Rights Act, it prompted criticism from across the ideological spectrum.""I like the Civil Rights Act in a sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains,"" Paul said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. ""I abhor racism. I think it's a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant. But at the same time, I do believe in private ownership. There's 10 different titles, you know, to the Civil Rights Act. One deals with private institutions, and had I been around, I would have tried to modify that.""Paul eventually retracted his comments, but they nonetheless sparked a media frenzy.On ABC's This Week, Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele -- his party's first African-American chairman -- made a point of arguing that his party had been on the forefront of civil rights when the landmark act Rand was referring to was passed in 1964, as well as the Voting Rights Act that passed the following year.""Our party has always had a strong view on this issue,"" Steele told ABC's Jake Tapper. ""We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill.""We decided to see whether Steele was correct.The Civil Rights Act -- which is best known for barring discrimination in public accommodations -- passed the House on Feb. 10, 1964 by a margin of 290-130. When broken down by party, 61 percent of Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill (152 yeas and 96 nays), and a full 80 percent of the Republican caucus supported it (138 yeas and 34 nays).When the Senate passed the measure on June 19, 1964, -- nine days after supporters mustered enough votes to end the longest filibuster in Senate history -- the margin was 73-27. Better than two-thirds of Senate Democrats supported the measure on final passage (46 yeas, 21 nays), but an even stronger 82 percent of Republicans supported it (27 yeas, 6 nays).The primary reason that Republican support was higher than Democratic support -- even though the legislation was pushed hard by a Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson -- is that the opposition to the bill primarily came from Southern lawmakers. In the mid 1960s, the South was overwhelmingly Democratic -- a legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction, when the Republican Party was the leading force against slavery and its legacy. Because of this history, the Democratic Party in the 1960s was divided between Southern Democrats, most of whom opposed civil rights legislation, and Democrats from outside the South who more often than not supported it.This pattern showed clearly in the House vote. Northern Democrats backed the Civil Rights Act by a margin even larger than that of Republicans -- 141 for, just four against -- while Southern Democrats were strongly opposed, by a margin of 11 yeas to 92 nays.When the Voting Rights Act hit the floor in 1965, the vote results mirrored those of the Civil Rights Act. In the House, the measure passed by a 333-85 margin, with 78 percent of Democrats backing it (221 yeas and 61 nays) and 82 percent of Republicans backing it (112 yeas to 24 nays).In the Senate, the measure passed by a 77-19 vote, with 73 percent of Democrats and 94 percent of Republicans supporting the bill.So it's clear that Republican support for both bills was deep. But to make sure we weren't missing something, we contacted a number of scholars who have studied that period, asking whether Republicans were dragged into supporting the bills reluctantly, or whether they took frontline roles in advancing them.Generally speaking, the scholars we talked to agreed that Republicans were important players, usually working cooperatively with Johnson and other leading Democrats.Democrats deserve credit for being the driving force behind the legislation, our experts said, particularly Johnson, who had only been in office for three months yet who staked his own re-election prospects on a tough, divisive legislative battle. Other crucial Democratic players were Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, who had been championing the issue of civil rights for a decade and a half.But Republicans took leading positions as well, including Rep. Charles (Mac) Mathias of Maryland and Sen. Jacob Javits of New York. And during the 1950s, a Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, had supported a civil rights legislation, though he never signed anything as sweeping as either the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act.In the strategic challenge of getting the Civil Rights Act passed, Democrats knew that they would need to reach out to Republicans in order to overcome their own party's splits on the issue -- especially in the Senate, where a determined minority of one-third of the chamber could block consideration of a bill. (Today that number is two-fifths.)The key to Senate passage of the Civil Rights Act was winning the support of Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, R-Ill., our experts said. By various accounts, Dirksen had some reservations with certain provisions of the Civil Rights Act, but Mansfield and Humphrey ""worked very closely"" with him, and ""key parts of the bill were worked out in Dirksen’s office in the evenings,"" said U.S. Senate Historian Donald A. Ritchie. Other midwestern Republicans followed Dirksen's lead and supported the bill. Once the filibuster was broken, Time magazine put Dirksen on its cover.""You can gauge Everett Dirksen and the Republicans in various ways, but you have to give them real credit,"" said University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis, who called Dirksen ""a tough, veteran politician, and a pragmatist of the first order.""To be sure, Republican support was not unanimous. Most notably, the party's 1964 presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater, voted against the Civil Rights Act and stuck to that position during the campaign (which he lost to Johnson in a landslide). And Yale University political scientist David Mayhew notes that the large Republican vote totals for the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act were not replicated in other key civil rights battles, such as an earlier one relating to fair employment practices in 1949 and 1950 and a subsequent one on fair housing in 1966.But on the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, the most notable factor affecting how Republicans voted was pragmatism, said Bert Rockman, a political scientist at Purdue University. ""The Republicans of that era deserve credit, lots of it, but less in a partisan way than in a now long-lost art form – forging a consensus around critical national problems.""Back to Steele's quote: ""We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill."" The degree of Republican support for the two bills actually exceeded the degree of Democratic support, and it's also fair to say that Republicans took leading roles in both measures, even though they had far fewer seats, and thus less power, at the time. Both of these factors are enough to earn Steele a rating of True.",/factchecks/2010/may/25/michael-steele/steele-says-gop-fought-hard-civil-rights-bills-196/
"['Children', 'Education', 'Texas', 'Rodney Ellis']","
State senator thrice filed proposals to offer pre-kindergarten to all Texas 4-year-olds and thrice they stalled
","Some 181,000 Texas 4-year-olds were enrolled in state-backed pre-kindergarten in 2008-09, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research, making the state No. 1 in the number of 4-year-olds attending public-school pre-K. Separately, the Texas Public Policy Foundation has estimated that 85 percent of the state's 4-year-olds are in a public or private pre-K program. The pre-K program funded by the state mostly serves children whose families live at or near the federal poverty level — an eligibility limit that state Sen. Rodney Ellis wants to erase in hopes, he says, of helping more children succeed in school. A 2006 study by researchers at Texas A&M University concluded that permitting all 4-year-olds to enter high-quality, full-day pre-K classes, in public or private settings, would deliver benefits greatly exceeding costs. The study took into account factors including educational outcomes, increased future earnings and reduced child welfare, child care, justice system and crime victims' costs. Ellis, D-Houston, filed proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds in the 2005, 2007 and 2009 legislative sessions, but nothing happened, he complains. The May 14 issue of The Texas Observer quotes Ellis saying: “I’ve never gotten it out of committee or gotten a hearing.” We wondered if Ellis accurately recapped the fate of his proposals. First, some background on this issue. Like most states, Texas limits pre-K eligibility to targeted groups. For starters, children have to be at least 3 years old to qualify. Until recently, they also had to be homeless or unable to speak and comprehend English or educationally disadvantaged — a characterization based on family income. Since 1985, state law has required any district with at least 15 eligible 4-year-olds to offer half-day pre-K, which is supported by state education aid. Districts that offer full-day programs must fund them by charging parents tuition or using other resources including state early-start grants, according to a 2010 report by the House Research Organization. The state put nearly $777 million into pre-K classes in 2008-09, according to the Texas Education Agency. With an assist from Ellis's office, we confirmed from legislative records that for each of the three sessions, Ellis filed his pre-K bill and it failed to win a hearing or be voted out of committee. In 2005 and 2007, identical House measures likewise languished. Still, we wondered if that inaction reflects lawmakers' indifference to early childhood education in general, or simply the three proposals by Ellis. Has any House or Senate member succeeded in winning consideration—or adoption—of measures widening pre-K access? Texas experts on pre-K told us that in 2006 and 2007, the Legislature took steps intended to expand access. In 2006, legislators agreed to a move by Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, to allow toddler dependents of adults on active military duty into pre-K; the expansion was rolled into a measure focused on education and school property taxes, according to Ida Garcia, Van de Putte’s legislative director. In 2007, Garcia said, Van de Putte was among backers of a move to ensure pre-K eligibility for all children who had ever been in foster care became law. Previously, she said, children in foster care were permitted into pre-K classes but if they were later adopted, they could be barred. Pre-K experts noted too that legislators last year sent Gov. Rick Perry a proposal by Rep. Diane Patrick, R-Arlington, that directed $25 million to support full-day pre-K classes in school districts that adopted specific pre-K class-size limits and teacher-student ratios, among requirements. But Perry vetoed that bill, saying the money should be spent instead on existing grants enabling select districts to expand half-day classes to full-day offerings -- serving ""more students with greater needs,"" or 21,000 more students than would have been served under the vetoed proposal, the governor said. So how does Ellis’ statement shake out? He’s right that his proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds never drew a hearing or advanced from committee. But a few efforts to expand eligibility for — or enhance — pre-K offerings have succeeded or won wide consideration. We rate his statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/may/25/rodney-ellis/state-senator-thrice-filed-proposals-offer-pre-kin/

Chris Matthews says Cheney got $34 million payday from Halliburton
","The oil-services and infrastructure giant Halliburton is a favorite target for critics of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who used to be the company's CEO. During the presidency of George W. Bush, the company's Iraq War-related contracts attracted wide attention. Now, the company's role in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has brought Halliburton back into the headlines.

During a May 20, 2010, appearance with Jay Leno on the Tonight Show, MSNBC host and political commentator Chris Matthews revived the Cheney-Halliburton connection while discussing the spill.

At one point in the interview, Leno said, ""All right, a lot going on in politics with this BP thing. This is the one-month anniversary. Where are we? Who’s the lying scum here?""

Matthews responded, ""Yeah, it’s the scariest thing I’ve ever seen, and, you know, I don’t know where to start. I mean, Halliburton. Sound familiar? Cheney. Cheney was head of Halliburton. When he got to be vice president, when he was signed for vice president, the oil company gave him a $34 million signing bonus to become vice president of the United States.""

We'll grant Matthews some artistic license with his comment. We know he doesn't mean that Cheney literally got a signing bonus for becoming the vice presidential candidate, as a newly signed free agent would in baseball. But we thought it was worth checking whether Cheney did in fact end up with a $34 million payout when he stepped down as CEO to join Bush on the ticket in 2000. We looked at a personal financial disclosure form that Cheney signed on Sept. 1, 2000. This is the filing made once someone joins a national presidential ticket. It represents the candidate's holdings and income as of August. In the portion addressing Cheney's compensation from Halliburtion, the file lists the following categories and dollar amounts as of that date:

• Salary/bonus (gross): $4,721, 947
• Deferred salary: $1,042, 441
• Senior executive deferred compensation contributions: $654,804

Meanwhile, on May 15, 2001, Cheney also signed a second disclosure form that is supposed to update the August 2000 filing so that it covers the full year. In this filing, Cheney disclosed the following Halliburton income:

• Salary/bonus (gross): $821,896
• Elective deferred salary: $403,166
• Stock equivalent unit bonus: $396,213
• Senior executive deferred compensation contributions: $53,692
• Elective deferred salary lump sum payout: $1,140,160
• Restricted stock imputed income: $7,560,000
• Nonqualified stock option income: $21,964,254
• Senior executive deferred compensation payout: $2,797,128

However, we were unclear about whether the totals from the May 2001 filing, which amount to $35.1 million, should be added to those from the August 2000 filing, which amount to $6.4 million, or whether the amounts in the two filings overlap somewhat. Experts we spoke to expressed uncertainty on this question as well. So we decided to take the most cautious approach and only use the numbers from the second filing, which covers the whole year.

That still leaves a total of $35.1 million earned from Halliburtion reported on the May 2001 filing. Of that total, just over $800,000 represents salary and bonus, which Cheney would have earned regardless of whether he joined the ticket or not. Many of the other categories were subject to some calculation and/or negotiation, as would happen in the case of any CEO who left a position early, so it seems fair to call the rest of the income he received an exit package.

So, if you subtract the salary and bonus from the larger amount, voila -- you get $34 million and change. So Matthews is right.

A footnote: Cheney's timing was impeccable. As the disclosure forms indicate, he held a large number of stock options, which means he had been given the right to purchase shares of the company for an old (and, hopefully for the holder of the options) lower price than the current market value. When the holder chooses to exercise those options, they can buy the shares at the low price and then sell them at the market price, pocketing the difference.

It's not clear when Cheney sold his stock options, but it likely was within weeks of his being named to the ticket -- a period when Halliburtion shares hit their 2000 peak, in the low-to-mid $50 range. By November 30, 2000, the stock had fallen to $33 a share. If he'd waited until then to sell, his payday would have been one-third lower, or roughly $14 million rather than $22 million.

But Cheney does appear to have had timing on his side, so we find Matthews' statement -- that Cheney had a payday of $34 million -- to be accurate. If anything, it may have been a bit low. Either way, we give it a rating of True.",/factchecks/2010/may/24/chris-matthews/chris-matthews-says-cheney-got-34-million-payday-h/

Meek claims Greene moved to Florida two years ago
","U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek says one of his Democratic opponents for U.S. Senate, billionaire real estate tycoon Jeff Greene, is such a newcomer to Florida that he wouldn't qualify to run for any other statewide office.Meek makes the claim about Greene's residency on a campaign website he created in May 2010 called LeaveittoGreene.com: ""Jeff Greene only moved from California to Florida in the last two years. In fact, he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement.""We were interested in both parts of Meek's claim, so the questions are: when did Greene move to Florida and would his tenure here be long enough to run for any other statewide office?First, some background on Greene.Greene, 55, grew up in Worcester, Mass. When his parents moved to West Palm Beach, he stayed with his aunt to finish high school in Worcester, according to a Miami Herald Dec. 7, 2009 profile. He went to Johns Hopkins for college and spent school breaks in South Florida. Greene later went to Harvard Business School and then moved to Los Angeles in 1980, Forbes reported. Here's how Greene addressed his South Florida ties on his campaign website:""For over 40 years, Florida has been a part of my life. When I was a teenager, my family moved to Florida after my father lost his livelihood in Massachusetts. During high school I worked alongside my dad on his vending machine routes throughout South Florida. During college I worked as a bus boy and a waiter in Palm Beach. My father passed away here in Florida when I was a young man, and my 83-year-old mother has lived in West Palm Beach for over 40 years. I was born in Massachusetts and have spent time on both coasts building my real estate business. Since meeting my wife four years ago, we decided to make our home in Palm Beach where we live today with our newborn son."" The Miami-Dade property appraiser's website shows that Greene purchased a Miami Beach condo on Alton Road for $3.1 million in April 2008. The Palm Beach County property appraiser's website shows that Greene purchased a $24 million home at 1200 S. Ocean Boulevard Palm Beach in December 2009. For other official sources showing when Greene established residency in Florida, we turned to his driver's license. Greene got his Florida driver's license on March 20, 2008, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. At the same time, he registered to vote. Greene spokesman Paul Blank told us that Greene became a Florida resident when he moved to a boat docked at a Miami Beach marina in February 2008.  So we can say Greene established Florida residency in early 2008. Now what are those election requirements?The Florida Division of Elections website is clear:  With only about two years' residency, Greene falls short of qualifying to run for governor or state Cabinet positions. And, since Supreme Court justices are appointed by the governor, he couldn't run for that either. But the office of U.S. Senate requires only that the candidate be a resident of the state when elected, which is how Greene qualifies.Meek's claim was that Greene ""moved from California to Florida in the last two years"" and that ""he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement.""

Kentucky Democrats got more votes than Republican Rand Paul, DNC chair says
","Never mind all the talk about Rand Paul, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Kentucky, Democrats say. Their candidate may be poised to pull an upset in what is usually a reliably red state.Appearing on ABC's This Week on May 23, 2010, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine talked up the prospects of Kentucky's Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway, who won his party's primary May 21.During a joint interview with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, Kaine predicted that Democrats will get a boost from the passage of major health care reform and an improving economy and will remain in control of both houses of Congress.""There's been all this focus on the Rand Paul race,"" said Kaine, a former Virginia governor, referring to the tea party-backed candidate who won the nomination with 58 percent of the vote. ""The Democratic candidates in that primary in Kentucky both got more votes than Rand Paul did,"" adding that Democratic voters are ""energized.""We wanted to see if Kaine accurately described the situation in Kentucky, a state generally considered a Republican stronghold.GOP nominee John McCain carried Kentucky in 2008 with 57 percent of the vote. And in 2004, President George W. Bush received nearly 60 percent of the vote. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the chamber's Republican leader, has held his Kentucky seat since 1985. The seat Paul and Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson are fighting for is currently held by Republican Jim Bunning, who is retiring. So the state is solidly red.Yet Kaine has his numbers right when it comes to last week's primaries.In the Republican primary, Paul -- the son of 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul -- received almost 207,000 votes, easily defeating McConnell's preferred candidate, Grayson.Conway, meanwhile, received almost 229,000 votes in the Democratic primary. Second-place finisher Lt. Gov. Daniel Mongiardo received 225,000 votes.Overall, almost 170,000 more people voted in the Democratic primary than the Republican primary, according to the state's board of elections. But does that automatically translate to additional momentum for Democrats come fall?Hardly.According to voter registration figures, Democrats outnumber Republicans 1.6 million to 1 million, which easily explains much of the disparity. And while the voter edge may show in primaries, many of those Democrats end up voting for Republicans in the general election. A recent poll in Kentucky, for instance, found that less than half of Kentucky Democrats have a negative opinion of the tea party, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. ""I thought that would be much higher,"" said Del Ali, president of Research 2000, which conducted the poll. ""I would guess that if we polled other states heavy in Democratic registration like Kentucky, the attitude toward the tea party would be more unfavorable than 46 percent among Democrats.""In 2008, 600,000 Democrats voted in the U.S. Senate primary compared to less than 200,000 Republicans voting in the GOP primary. But McConnell, a Republican, still got re-elected in the general election.It was the same story in 1998, the last time Kentucky had an open U.S. Senate seat. That year, Democrats had a six-way race, with three candidates receiving more than 155,000 votes. Compare that to a two-person GOP primary, where winner Bunning got only 152,000 votes overall. Bunning, of course, went on to win in November.In trying to play up Democrats' chances in Kentucky this fall, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine had his numbers right about the Democratic primary, but his underlying point was a stretch. Those primary vote totals really aren't an indication of strong prospects for the Democratic candidate Conway, or conversely, less support for Paul.

RNC chair Michael Steele says Republican victory in Hawaii boosts GOP chances
","On ABC's This Week, the chairmen of the Republican and Democratic national parties debated the significance of Republican Charles Djou's victory in a Hawaii congressional special election on May 22, 2010 -- the first time a Republican will represent Hawaii in Congress since 1991.RNC Chairman Michael Steele called the victory significant, given Hawaii's penchant for supporting Democrats, and he noted that the state is the birthplace of President Barack Obama (Sorry, birthers).Of course, DNC Chairman Tim Kaine had a different read. He said Djou's victory was more about the unique circumstances of the special election -- which was called to replace the resigning Rep. Neil Abercrombie until the regular fall election --  than a political mood swing in Hawaii. The special election did not include a primary, which meant parties could field multiple candidates. Of the three main contenders, two were Democrats while Djou was the lone Republican. He won with a little under 40 percent of the overall vote.""In the November election, it will be one Democrat against one Republican, and we feel very, very confident about winning that race,"" Kaine said.But Steele countered, Hawaii doesn't ""have a history of throwing incumbents out of office.""It's an obvious fact that incumbents have an easier road to re-election than challengers. Since 1964, no less than 85 percent of incumbents have been returned to the U.S. House, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Since 1998, incumbents' re-election rate has hovered between 94 and 98 percent in the House. The numbers in the Senate are a little lower -- between 79 and 96 percent in elections since 1998.But do incumbents have an even easier time getting re-elected in America's youngest state?Since Hawaii wasn't incorporated as a state until 1959, there isn't a lot of history to examine. And since Hawaii has just four members of Congress (two senators and two members of the U.S. House), there are relatively few elections to scour.In fact, only 5 people have represented the state in the U.S. Senate: the two sitting senators, Democrats Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, and three others -- Republican Hiram Fong, Democrat Spark Matsunaga and Democrat Oren E. Long. None of them lost a re-election campaign for the Senate -- Fong and Long retired and Matsunaga died in office.Hawaii's two congressional House districts were created in 1971. Previously both seats had been elected at large.Djou will represent Hawaii's 1st District, the second Republican ever to do so. He replaces Abercrombie, a 10-term Democrat who resigned to run for governor. The state's 2nd District has never elected a Republican.Have any incumbents lost?Not really.In the 2nd District, Patsy Mink, Daniel Akaka and Ed Case all resigned or retired in order to run for another office. Mink was eventually re-elected to the U.S. House and died in office.In the 1st District, Spark Matsunaga, Cecil Heftel, Pat Saiki and Abercrombie all also resigned to run for another office.There's one asterisk. Abercrombie was first elected to Congress in 1986 in a special election just like Djou. But though he won the special election, he lost his party's primary to run for a full, two-year term on the very same day. We counted and found about 50 elections where the incumbent on Hawaii was on the ballot. The closest anyone got to losing was Abercrombie in 1986, but he wasn't actually an incumbent when he lost the Democratic primary.Depending how you count it, that puts the re-election rate in Hawaii between 98 percent and 100 percent, which is higher than the national average over the same period. Though Steele was talking about federal races, we also checked to see if an incumbent Hawaii governor ever lost a bid for re-election. It happened once since Hawaii became a state, in 1962, when Republican William Quinn lost to Democrat John Burns. Back to the statement by RNC Chairman Steele. He said Hawaiians don't have a history of throwing incumbents out of office and said that Djou's election to Congress in May means Republicans have a good shot of keeping the seat in November. While we're not in the business of predicting the outcome of House races, no incumbent has ever lost a November congressional election in Hawaii.

Philosophy professor says only one of 50 registered voters in the UT history department is a Republican
","
In revising Texas' social studies curriculum standards, the State Board of Education has come under fire for pushing a conservative agenda in the classroom. But the board has its defenders, including Robert Koons, a philosophy professor at the University of Texas at Austin. 
Koons wrote an opinion piece, published most recently in Tuesday's Austin American-Statesman, suggesting the board has taken steps to make the curriculum standards more objective, and blasting critics — ""a coalition of left-leaning politicians and their academic allies"" — for their liberal biases. 
""Studies have revealed how unbalanced America's humanities departments are,"" Koons writes. ""In the history department at the University of Texas, out of 50 registered voters, only one is a Republican. Moderate and conservative Democrats are also rare."" 
Only one Grand Old Partier in the history department? We wondered. 
When we asked how he reached his fraction, Koons said he referred to ""a breakdown of voter registrations by department at UT that was completed some years ago by a student working with then-Professor Joseph Horn in psychology."" Koons, saying he was ill at home, didn't send us the data before we wrapped up our research. He said: ""My understanding was that the student looked up public records concerning voter registration."" 
A little perspective: Unlike voters in some other states, Texas voters don't register their party affiliation. In Pennsylvania, for example, voters must register with a party to participate in that party's primary. When registering to vote in Texas, a person only needs to provide their name, birth date, address and driver's license number (or the last four digits of their Social Security number). 
Public records show whether individual voters have participated in specific elections, but the records don't necessarily reveal which way you swing, politically speaking. Texas is an open-primary state, which means any registered voter can vote in any party primary, switching back and forth if they so choose. That said, it's fair to say that if someone routinely votes in one party's primary, they're probably leaning in that political direction. 
With the right information — like your name and address — anyone can look up your voting history and see that you voted, say, in the March Democratic primary. 
Lacking the student study mentioned by Koons, we endeavored to check voting records of UT history professors kept by Travis County. While voting in particular primaries isn't a foolproof measure of political leanings, it's as close as public records get us. 
UT's history department lists about 125 professors and lecturers as faculty members on its website, including faculty from other departments whose courses double as history classes. We limited our initial scope to 76 professors and lecturers who have an office in Garrison Hall — the department's digs — and a history professor who offices in the Harry Ransom Center. 
Of them, we found 26 listing home addresses in the online UT Directory; we focused on them because their addresses spared us from potentially checking voters who simply have the same names as professors. 
What we found: 18 of the 26 faculty members are registered to vote in Travis County. Separately, Democratic political consultant Jeff Smith found three history profs registered in Williamson and Montgomery counties, bringing our total sample to 21. Of the 21, five voted in this year's Democratic primary; two voted in the Republican primary. 
Bigger picture: Sixteen of the 21 professors have voted in only Democratic primaries; the earliest records we could find dated to 1990. One voted in only Republican primaries and two voted in Democratic and Republican primaries in different years. Two have not voted in either party's primaries. 
Next, we made a run at gauging the voting history of the remaining 50 faculty members whose addresses aren't in the UT directory. We tried to be as accurate as possible, using middle initials and comparing each professor's birth date to their photograph on the history department website, but we acknowledge these results are less certain. 
We excluded two professors because we couldn't distinguish them from voters with identical names. Of the remaining 48, 18 weren't registered to vote in Travis County and four appeared to have no primary voting history. That left 26. As far back as 1990, 24 had only voted in Democratic primaries, while two had voted in both Republican and Democratic primaries. This March, nine of these history professors voted in the Democratic primary; two voted in the GOP primary. 
Summing up, of 76 history department faculty members, 14 voted in the 2010 Democratic primary and four voted in the Republican primary, records indicate. Historically, we found one person who had only voted in Republican primaries and 39 who had only voted in Democratic primaries. 
Where does that leave us? We don't know — and that's a significant point. 
By our count — which is by no means perfect — 45 history professors have voted in primary elections. Of them, 40 voted Democratic and four voted in both parties' primaries. Per Koons' statement, only one has voted solely in Republican primaries. 
Still, this sampling doesn't guarantee the faculty members with primary histories are Republicans or Democrats, nor does it show which party's candidate they favored in general elections. Consider Mark Smith, an associate professor in American studies whose courses are crosslisted with the history department. Smith, who voted in the March Republican primary, wondered what it means to be a Republican. ""I was an assistant scoutmaster with Rick Perry when our kids were in Boy Scouts together,"" he said. ""Does that make me a Republican? Almost all the faculty I know would consider themselves independents."" 
And in Texas at least, pragmatism can trump political ideology. In a May 2009 blog post, Texas Monthly political columnist Paul Burka advised: ""I tend to vote in Republican primaries (4 of the 6 elections starting in 1998), since that is the only election that matters for statewide candidates."" 
However, Koons has a point about the typical political lean of American academics. In 2005, The Washington Post cited a study by two political science professors at George Mason University saying that ""by their own description, 72 percent of those teaching at American universities and colleges are liberal and 15 percent are conservative... with 50 percent of the faculty members surveyed identifiying themselves as Democrats and 11 percent as Republicans."" 
Our legwork's done; how does Koons' statement look now? 
His 1-in-50 figure from dated research doesn't jibe with what we found in our review of local voting histories. Of 48 history department faculty members registered to vote in Travis County (save three registered in Williamson and Montgomery counties), five have participated in Republican primaries, four of whom voted in the March GOP primary. 
There's an even bigger issue here. Voting in a Republican or Democratic primary doesn't necessarily mean a person belongs to that party — never mind the bulk of voters (and history professors, our check suggests) who abstain from primaries altogether. Their political affiliations, if any, aren't reflected in voting records. Without polling faculty members individually, no one can say with certitude what they are. 
If Koons presents compelling evidence that indeed, as he says, one in 50 registered voters in the department is a Republican, we'll re-plumb this topic. 
We rate his statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/may/23/robert-koons/philosophy-professor-says-only-one-50-registered-v/

White says taxpayers paid for Perry to fly Texas delivering checks in five communities
","In a Facebook post Wednesday, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White suggests Gov. Rick Perry wasted government dollars flying to Texas cities to give out money. “In three days last week, Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers’ expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks,” White’s 8:43 p.m. post states. Did Perry burn tax dollars to hand out checks? Katy Bacon, White’s spokeswoman, pointed out news releases issued by the governor’s office reflecting Perry’s stops May 11-13 in Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Antonio, Palacios and San Juan. The releases state that Perry announced spending awards of $150,000, $175,000 and $2 million, respectively, in Dallas, Palacios and San Juan. Perry did not ballyhoo funding awards in the other cities, according to the releases. That’s close to what White said on Facebook: Three days, five cities, $2,325,000 in checks handed over by Perry. We wondered, though, at White’s description of Perry’s flights as costing taxpayers. For years, Perry has funded considerable out-of-town travel, for state business or campaign purposes, from non-state sources including his campaign kitty — an approach often mentioned in news articles, including a July 26 report in White’s hometown newspaper, the Houston Chronicle. The Chronicle article quotes Perry’s gubernatorial spokeswoman, Allison Castle, noting that “Perry's travel is not paid by taxpayers.” It continues: “Texas One, a corporate-finance foundation, pays for much of Perry's business development travel. Other travel is paid for by his political committee or campaign donors. And some is financed as in-kind contributions from specific wealthy donors or interest groups.” As for the flights Facebooked by White, Bacon told us in an e-mail: “These were all ‘official’ trips and events under the Office of the Governor, and this type of travel is typically paid for by taxpayers.” Not so, said Castle, who informed us the flights under fire, on private planes, were funded by Perry’s campaign. “The majority of the governor’s travel is paid for by his campaign,” she said. For each of the five stops referenced by White, she said, one state-paid travel aide and a press aide accompanied Perry. There is another cost the public pays for every Perry trip — his security detail. In a follow-up interview, Bacon took no issue with gubernatorial security expenses. Bacon also stood by White's characterization of the travel as taxpayer-funded, saying it would take time to confirm, with documents, that Perry's flights were not paid for by the state. Then again, Bacon said, spending campaign funds on the flights also doesn't pass muster. ""Either way, this is wrong,"" she said. ""He’s running around handing out taxpayer dollars to get headlines for his political career. He’s using campaign dollars to hand out state checks."" She showed us that Perry's campaign excerpted two press releases from the latest trips in a campaign e-mail blast. Bacon's charge shifts the focus from who paid for Perry's trips to the purpose of his stops. That's not what White critiqued on Facebook. All in all, White got several things right — five cities visited, press events, money awards. And it's true the state pays some costs any time the governor goes anywhere. But White's crucial assumption — that Perry's flights were at taxpayers' expense — is wrong. It's a misstep the candidate might have avoided by reading his local newspaper.

Rick Scott, former health care CEO, barely escaped prison, GOP opponent claims
","After virtually ignoring millionaire Rick Scott and his unconventional campaign for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum launched a full attack on May 18, 2010, criticizing Scott for his role as a former CEO of a national hospital chain that bilked state and federal health care programs.Scott, 57, has been running an unorthodox campaign, spending millions of dollars in television advertising three months before the Republican primary. He's casting himself as an outsider and a reformer.The descriptions get a chuckle from McCollum's campaign.""The fact that Rick Scott is running for governor as a 'reformer' would be funny if it wasn't so outrageous,"" McCollum campaign manager Matt Williams said. ""This is a man who barely escaped imprisonment, whose failure in business has been portrayed on national news and around the world. He is an embarrassment.""Democratic frontrunner Alex Sink issued a similar critique saying that Scott's company -- Columbia/HCA -- had pleaded guilty to 14 felonies as part of a federal fraud investigation and was forced to pay a record $1.7 billion in fines. You can see that analysis here.In this item, we wanted to see if the McCollum campaign is right to say Scott ""barely escaped imprisonment.""First, some background about the Columbia/HCA saga.Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals with a plan to brand hospitals -- like soft drinks or a clothes line -- through aggressive growth. The chain quickly grew, and in 1994, purchased the 100-hospital HCA chain. Over time, the publicly traded company swelled to become the nation's largest hospital chain, growing to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries.That's the good news.Now for the bad.In 1997, federal authorities went public with a massive multipronged investigation into Columbia/HCA and whether it was bilking state and federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.Specifically, authorities were investigating whether the hospital chain ordered unnecessary lab work and billed Medicare and Medicaid for the cost, whether it attached false diagnosis codes to patient records in order to increase reimbursement to the hospitals and whether it billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them.Scott resigned as Columbia/HCA's CEO in the middle of the investigation in July 1997.The fraud cases ultimately were resolved as part of two federal settlements -- one in 2000 and another in 2002 -- where Columbia/HCA agreed to pay a record $1.7 billion in fines and also agreed to plead guilty to 14 felonies in five states. The U.S. Justice Department called the Columbia/HCA deal the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history.How close was Scott to going to prison for his part in the fraud case?Not at all.Four Florida based Columbia/HCA excutives ultimately were indicted as part of the fraud investigation, but not Scott.Two executives, Jay Jarrell and Robert Whiteside, were convicted of defrauding Medicare in 1999 and were sentenced to prison. Jarrell was sentenced to 33 months in prison; Whiteside got 24 months. Those convictions, however, were overturned on appeal.Two other executives also were prosecuted in the case. A Tampa federal jury acquitted Michael Neeb and failed to reach a verdict on Carl Lynn Dick.""With the reversal of the Whiteside and Jarrell convictions, not a single individual has been convicted as a result of this seemingly limitless cost-report investigation,'' Columbia/HCA's lawyers wrote in a March 2002 court filing.Walter P. Loughlin, HCA's lawyer during the investigation, said Whiteside and Jarrell were the only two executives ever convicted. And while Columbia/HCA did plead guilty to 14 felonies, those were corporate convictions -- meaning no one served prison time. We did find an ABC News transcript from August 1997 in which reporter Brian Ross said Scott was a target of federal investigators. On World News Tonight, Ross said: ""Columbia has denied the fraud allegations. But its chairman -- Rick Scott -- and five other top corporate executives have resigned. And federal investigators told ABC News today that Scott is now considered a prime target of the investigation."" But Scott campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Scott was never even interviewed as part of the case. She pointed us to a 2009 Fortune article. ""Scott's not Bernie Madoff or Leona Helmsley,"" the article said. ""He has never been charged with wrongdoing. He was never even personally contacted by investigators."" McCollum's statement was that Scott ""barely escaped imprisonment,"" but the fact is he was never indicted, and the only individuals convicted of wrongdoing associated with the Columbia/HCA ultimately had those convictions tossed out. The corporate convictions aren't tied to any individual and carry only fines, not prison time. While one ABC News report does say he was a target of an investigation, that doesn't translate to barely escaping a prison sentence.

West claims military leadership in Afghanistan proposed a new medal for 'courageous restraint'
","Allen West is a Republican and retired lieutenant colonel who is running for a South Florida congressional seat currently held by Democrat Ron Klein. On a blog on his campaign website, he criticizes what he says is a proposed new medal for troops for ""not firing back."" Here is an excerpt from his May 16, 2010, blog:

""Speaking of miscalculation, the latest from Afghanistan is that the leadership has proposed a new medal, an award for 'Courageous Restraint.' Yes, you heard me right, the military leadership in Afghanistan is considering awarding combat troops for 'NOT FIRING BACK.' There have been some fairly insidious plans proposed in the history of warfare, but never an award for Warriors to not fight. I know, the liberal intellectual elites are going to call me brutish and mean. The leadership proposing this inane action is going to say, 'it is about protecting the Afghan civilians.' My retort is simple, and comes from two opposing Civil War Generals; General Wm T Sherman, 'War is hell' and Cavalry General N Bedford Forest, 'War is about fighting, and fighting means killing.' If we do not want our Men and Women in combat to fight and kill the enemy, I say we retrograde from Afghanistan. The promotion of hesitation in combat by senior military leaders means that more of our American treasure will lose their lives and be forever maimed. I have been in a firefight, it is about gaining and maintaining the initiative, not restraint."" The part of West's claim that we wanted to explore was whether ""the leadership has proposed a new medal, an award for 'Courageous Restraint' ... for 'not firing back.' ""

The discussion about such a medal comes at a time when coalition forces have struggled to reduce civilian casualties.

""That downward trend has abruptly been reversed: In the first three months of 2010, at least 72 Afghan civilians were accidentally killed by troops, compared to about 30 killed in the same period last year, according to a NATO official in Kabul,'' stated an April 30, 2010, New York Times article.

On the subject of a new medal, we found a few news sources discussing the topic in May 2010.

A May 4 Associated Press article stated that in an effort to reduce civilian casualties in Afghanistan, commanders were considering awarding soliders for ""courageous restraint.""

""The concept comes as the coalition continues to struggle with the problem of civilian casualties despite repeated warnings from the top NATO commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, that the war effort hinges on the ability to protect the population and win support away from the Taliban,'' the AP stated. ""Those who back the idea hope it will provide soldiers with another incentive to think twice before calling in an airstrike or firing at an approaching vehicle if civilians could be at risk."" British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, a NATO commander in Afghanistan, proposed the idea during a visit by Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Hall to Kandahar Airfield in mid April, the AP wrote. McChrystal was reviewing the proposal, according to the article, which stated that NATO wasn't planning to create a new medal, but use existing ones to recognize those who show restraint.

A May 7 article in the Washington Examiner stated that the proposal had sparked concern among U.S. soldiers because among other reasons one captain said it could lead to second-guessing decisions. The article stated that Lt. Col. Edward Sholtis (who also goes by the name of Tadd), a spokesman for McChrystal, said no final decision had been made on the award. ""The idea is being reviewed at headquarters ISAF (International Security Assistance Force),"" Sholtis said. ""The idea is consistent with our approach. Our young men and women display remarkable courage every day, including situations where they refrain from using lethal force, even at risk to themselves, in order to prevent possible harm to civilians. ... That restraint is an act of discipline and courage not much different than those seen in combat actions."" When we contacted military sources directly about West's claim, we got a slightly different story.

Here's Col. Wayne M. Shanks, U.S. Army Chief of Public Affairs International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, answering PolitiFact Florida by e-mail: ""There's no proposal to create a new medal. This was an idea floated by the commander of Regional Command South, Maj. Gen. Nick Carter (UK), which unfortunately got reported in the press before it had received any serious attention from folks here. Because some reporters pounced on it and reported it as fact, the idea acquired a specificity that it never really possessed. As Gen. McChrystal said at his Pentagon press conference Thursday (May 13), he doesn't think we need a new medal to differentiate different kinds of courage."" The transcript from the May 13 news briefing shows the following question was posed to McChrystal: ""Is it true that you are contemplating -- awarding some sort of special honor for soldiers who make a special effort to avoid civilian casualties?""

McChrystal: ""The issue of courage -- we have a number of ways to recognize courage in uniform. And I think courage in uniform can come under enemy fire in the most traditional ways, or it can come under actions that may not be as expected or as traditional -- involve killing the enemy; it may involve protecting civilians. There's a great photograph from the Marja operation. I think it's a U.S. Marine shielding an Afghan man and an Afghan child with his own body. He wasn't shooting anyone; he didn't kill any Taliban; but I would argue that he showed as much courage as any that I've seen on the battlefield. So when we talk about courage, I think -- I don't think we need a different medal to differentiate different kinds of courage. ""

Sholtis, the public affairs officer for ISAF, provided a similar account to PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail: ""The idea came up in a discussion between the commander of Regional Command South, UK Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, and Command Sergeant Major Mike Hall, ISAF's top enlisted soldier, and it was also posted to the ISAF website where it was picked up by reporters. However, at the time (and in the article) CSM Hall said the intent was not to create a new medal but to use existing medals to recognize heroism displayed in ways other than combat with the enemy -- for example, in protecting civilians. A subsequent article quoted me as saying that the idea of submitting troops for an award under those circumstances was consistent with our approach to counterinsurgency and was under review. The 'under review' bit was misinterpreted as confirming that the idea of a new medal was under review, which a number of commentators weighed in on over a news cycle or two. However, it was not the case that a formal proposal for a new medal was under review."" Sholtis added: ""We have no documentation accepting or rejecting the idea of recognizing courage demonstrated in restraint with an existing award because it is only an idea -- not a formal proposal.""

We did find one item written by the military about it: ""Honoring Courageous Restraint"" on the International Security Assistance Force website. That article stated ""there should be an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the troops who exhibit extraordinary courage and self control by not using their weapons..."" When we contacted the West campaign for any information to support the claim, campaign manager Josh Grodin told us, ""That was his opinion. It took a 2-second Google search to see the VFW is discussing the same opinion about the proposed medal.""

So where does that leave us?

West said that ""the leadership has proposed a new medal, an award for 'Courageous Restraint' ... for 'NOT FIRING BACK.' "" It's clear that military commanders did discuss rewarding troops for ""Courageous Restraint,"" but with existing medals, not a new medal. And military officials who talked to PolitiFact said it was an idea, not a formal proposal. Given those facts, we rule this Half True.",/factchecks/2010/may/21/allen-west/west-claims-military-leadership-afghanistan-propos/

We wanted to review the polls to see where the electorate stands. As a matter of simple support, plenty of opinion surveys back up vanden Heuvel’s claim. The latest results from a Bloomberg poll show 69 percent of the public supports raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour over the next three years. ABC News and the Washington Post asked if a candidate’s support for raising the minimum wage would make you more likely to vote for him or her. Half of all voters said they would be more likely to vote for that candidate. Only about a fifth said they would be less likely; most of the remainder said it would make no difference in their decision. A CBS/New York Times poll in February found 65 percent of the public favored raising the minimum wage to $10.10. So people largely support increasing the minimum wage, polls show. But polls also suggest that it’s not necessarily a high priority. A February Gallup poll found just 2 percent of respondents said wages were the most important issue facing the country. The gap between rich and poor, another Democratic theme, also came in at 2 percent. What voters cared most about in that survey, 23 percent of them, were jobs and cutting unemployment. That’s obviously connected to whether Americans have enough money to get by, but it isn’t the same as supporting a raise in the minimum wage. A Quinnipiac University poll in January had very similar results. In an open-ended question about the nation’s top priority for 2014, 1 percent of respondents mentioned the minimum wage, while 16 percent said jobs and unemployment, 15 percent said the economy in general, and 18 percent said health care. With jobs and the economy ranked so high, the latest findings from ABC News/Washington Post polling show the public equally divided on which party they trust to handle the economy. About 40 percent give the nod to the Democrats and 40 percent to the Republicans. Our ruling Vanden Heuvel said most Americans support raising the minimum wage. The polls confirm it. About two-thirds of the public consistently say boosting the minimum wage to $10.10 is a good idea and as many as a half of all voters say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who backs that increase. But how much a candidate’s position on the minimum wage matters in the polling booth is much less clear. The minimum wage is not top of mind except for a small fraction of voters. Still, vanden Heuvel's specific claim is accurate. We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2014/mar/16/katrina-vanden-heuvel/do-most-americans-favor-hike-minimum-wage/

Wisconsin GOP says Mary Burke, Scott Walker's challenger, was responsible for state budget when she served as a Cabinet secretary
","With a page on its website, the Wisconsin Republican Party claims Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke uttered four lies. We’ve already rated a version of one of the claims, about Burke’s service on the Madison School Board. And we rated versions of two claims regarding her time as state commerce secretary under Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle. We were struck by the final statement -- that Burke ""says she’s on the side of the middle class,"" but that ""Burke’s 2007-'09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310."" Burke’s state budget? Was she governor? Asked for backup to the claim, state GOP spokesman Jesse Dougherty said Burke created the Commerce portion of the 2007-’09 budget; worked with Doyle ""on his final product""; and promoted the overall budget. As we found in rating a similar claim by the state party in February 2014, Burke was responsible for and submitted the Commerce portion of Doyle’s overall 2007-’09 budget. We also found that she spoke out enthusiastically in favor of the overall plan, saying it ""identifies our priorities for success."" But to call it ""Burke’s budget"" is something different. The GOP might as well have called it Frank Busalacchi’s budget (he was Doyle’s transportation secretary at the time) or Kevin Hayden’s budget (Doyle’s health and family services secretary). For that matter, when Doyle’s 2007-’09 budget proposal was introduced it exceeded $57 billion, with the Commerce Department getting about  $413.7 million, or less than 1 percent of the total. In Wisconsin, the state budget is set by elected officials, not appointed Cabinet secretaries. The governor submits a budget. The Legislature, typically after making changes, adopts the budget. Finally, the governor signs the budget into law. As for the rest of the claim, that the budget raised taxes by $1.8 billion, Doyle’s proposed budget did seek a total revenue increase of nearly $1.8 billion -- $1.37 billion in taxes and the rest in fees. Wisconsin's total population was about 5.67 million at the time, so the total increase in taxes and fees would have been about $310 per person. But, while the figures are essentially correct, the thrust of the claim is an attack on Burke. And to say Doyle’s budget was hers goes too far. Our rating The state GOP said ""Burke's 2007-'09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310."" The figures are basically on target, but the real target of the party’s claim was Burke. And to put a governor’s entire state budget on an appointed Cabinet secretary is a misfire.

New England NAACP says African-Americans in U.S. are arrested on marijuana charges at more than three times the rate of whites
","While there’s a growing debate over whether to legalize marijuana, some are troubled by what they see as unfairness in enforcement of existing laws. Among them is the New England Area Conference of the NAACP. The organization released a statement March 3 in support of a Rhode Island House bill that would legalize using marijuana or possessing up to an ounce. Currently, possession of an ounce or less of marijuana is a civil offense, punishable by a $150 fine. Among their reasons for supporting that change, the statement said, was that in the United States, African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely than whites to get arrested on marijuana charges, based on the number of arrests and their share of the nation’s population. James Vincent, president of the Providence NAACP, said the claim was based on a June 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, ""The War on Marijuana in Black and White."" That report charted how many blacks and whites were arrested for marijuana possession and then, based on the racial population of each state, what the marijuana arrest rate per 100,000 people was for each race. The ACLU report used statistics compiled by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, a wide-ranging database of annual crime statistics that are often used in national crime studies because each state submits the same type of information, which allows apples-to-apples comparisons. Nationally, according to the report, the marijuana arrest rate for African-Americans in 2010 was 716 per 100,000, while for whites it was 192 per 100,000, meaning African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. The disparities were present across the country; in some states, the arrest rate for African-Americans was as much as 8.3 times the white rate. In Rhode Island, before possession of small amounts of marijuana was decriminalized, the arrest rate for African-Americans was 524 per 100,000, while the rate for whites was 201 per 100,000. That meant African-Americans were 2.6 times more likely to be arrested on marijuana charges than their white fellow citizens. That Rhode Island disparity was specifically cited in the bill text as a proposed ""legislative finding"" justifying enactment of the legislation. The authors of the ACLU report cautioned the FBI data wasn’t perfect. They noted that the FBI didn’t count Latinos as a separate group, usually putting them in the ‘‘white’’ classification. That has the effect of preventing an accurate measurement of Latino arrests and inflating the number of white arrests, the report said. The authors said more research could be done to explore how other factors, such as past criminal records, age of the persons arrested or the population density of the location of the arrest might affect the arrest rates. The authors said they weren’t trying to prove or disprove a particular theory on why the disparities they found existed, just that the disparities were there. And they aren’t the first to study the issue. In 2009, Human Rights Watch, based in Washington, D.C., did a similar study, ""Decades of Disparity, Drug Arrests and Race in the United States."" While the ACLU study focused on marijuana possession arrests, the Human Rights Watch looked at all drug arrests by race from 1980 to 2007. Like the ACLU, Human Rights Watch used the FBI statistics and found arrest rates for blacks were multiple times higher than whites. In the last year it analyzed, 2007, it found African-Americans were 3.6 times more likely to be arrested on a drug charge, close to the ACLU’s 3.7 multiple for marijuana arrests in 2010. Our ruling The NAACP New England Area Conference said ""African-Americans continue to be arrested at nearly three and one half times the rate of whites"" on marijuana charges. The group accurately cited a nationwide study that used a widely accepted data source, and a similar study done a few years earlier found almost the same disparity. We find the statement True.

Have 'most all' Oregon sawmills retooled over the past 20 years?
","A good way to get an argument roaring louder than a chain saw is to bring up Northwest forest policy. Topics ranging from clear-cutting to what constitutes ""old growth"" are bound to spark tussles. Forestry issues are again in the news as U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and other members of the state’s congressional delegation pitch plans to increase harvest levels from the so-called O&C lands -- 2.4 million acres of federally owned forestlands sprawled across 18 western Oregon counties. Many are watching closely, knowing decisions coming out of Washington, D.C., could have controversial implications for Oregon. Among those following the debate are Aaron Jones’ three daughters. Jones opened his Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene more than 60 years ago. Becky, Kathy and Jody Jones are taking out newspaper ads touting the benefits of ""forestry stewardship,"" among other things. An ad that ran in Oregon newspapers, including The Oregonian, on March 2, 2014, presses for more timber harvests and seeks to allay fears that old growth will be cut. It says mills are now focused on second-generation trees, and claims: ""Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?"" We revved up our saw and checked. We called Kathy Jones. She said the ads are aimed at influencing the debate over O&C lands, which could yield increased timber for Oregon sawmills. ""Some people keep saying we are ruining the forests, that we are cutting old growth at every opportunity,"" Jones said. ""It’s just not true. What is true is that almost every mill still operating in Oregon has retooled to accept second-growth logs. ""And I’m fine with that. I love those big cathedral forests. They should stay just as they are."" Jones said her definition of old growth begins when a tree’s diameter reaches 48 inches. The logs Seneca accepts average about 30 inches, she said. As for Seneca’s own retooling efforts, Jones said lasers now scan all incoming logs. Computers tell operators what sizes of studs and other lumber are most in demand at the moment, and the cutting begins. ""We have almost as many computer operators as we do people out on the floor,"" Jones said. ""That’s how this industry operates these days."" We called Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The Legislature created the group in 1991 to bring forest scientists, public agencies, forest landowners and community and conservation groups together. Barnum referred us to a 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Pacific Northwest Research Station. A chapter assessing Oregon’s sawmill sector said, in part, ""Technological improvements have made Oregon mills more efficient in numerous ways. Log size (diameter and length) sensing capabilities linked to computer determine the best sawing pattern for logs to recover either the greatest volume or greatest value from each other."" We asked Barnum about the Seneca Jones claim. ""There may be three or four mills that still process old-growth timber, which comes pretty much from private forestlands,"" he said. ""The mills still operating have retooled to concentrate on getting more value from second- and third-generation timber."" Barnum also passed along a report from Paul F. Ehinger & Associates, which said that in 2010 -- the last time the numbers were updated -- Oregon had 106 operating sawmills. For another view, we called Steve Pedery, conservation director at Oregon Wild. The group has long fought clear-cutting and old-growth harvesting, but has won U.S. Forest Service awards in recent years for helping design timber-restoration sales. Pedery passed along an Oregon Wild report detailing nine westside mills that still accept large logs. ""What this highlights,"" he said, ""is that there is still an appetite for old growth out there. If they could get it, they would."" Regarding the retooling claim, he said: ""Saying ‘most’ misses the point of the policy debate. There are still mills looking for large-diameter trees and they are all in southwest Oregon, where the remaining big trees are."" One of the mills in the report, D.R. Johnson Lumber in Riddle, is currently mothballed, according to both the report and an employee who answered our call there. Another listed as accepting large-diameter logs is Rough & Ready Lumber Co. in Cave Junction. Coincidentally, that operation announced this month that it will soon reopen a retooled small-log mill that’s been closed since last year. ""Unless you are a real niche operation looking for the occasional large log that comes along, you’ve retooled,"" said co-owner Jennifer Phillippi, whose grandfather founded Rough and Ready 92 years ago. ""You wouldn’t still be in business otherwise."" The ruling The owners of Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene want harvest levels from federally managed O&C lands increased but with primarily second- and third-generation trees. They say the timber industry agrees, adding, ""Most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years"" to accept smaller trees. A key environmental group maintains that old-growth cutting would commence if rules pertaining to federal lands are changed. The ongoing debate over timber policy in Washington, D.C., will determine whether they are. But we can look at the numbers, which show that of the 106 or so mills in Oregon, only a handful have not retooled and still look to buy large-diameter logs. The overwhelming majority, according to a forestry group created by the Legislature, use machinery that’s been added in recent years to accept smaller logs. It bears out the assertion that ""most all"" sawmills have retooled. We rate the claim True. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling.

Dan Patrick suggested every family get $5,000 voucher toward buying a car instead of Uncle Sam bailing out auto manufacturers
","A game show-themed TV ad that debuted just before the Texas Republican Party primary showed different viewers in shock as the unseen ""host"" declared objectionable ""facts"" about Dan Patrick, the Houston state senator who ended up drawing more than 40 percent of the primary vote for lieutenant governor. Patrick and incumbent Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst are slated to run off for the Republican nomination on May 27, 2014. The ad, sponsored by Dewhurst, included this curious claim: Patrick, the announcer said, ""supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car."" Did Patrick, a radio talk-show host and businessman who hasn’t served in Congress, do that? By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us Dewhurst’s backup document for the ad, which states that twice on CNN’s ""Lou Dobbs Tonight,"" Patrick suggested vouchers for Americans to buy cars instead of the federal government bailing out automobile manufacturers. On the Nov. 25, 2008, edition of the show, Dobbs suggested an urgency to the then-proposed bailout and sought Patrick’s thoughts, according to CNN’s transcript. Dobbs: ""This auto industry bailout, we got to have it. There's just no question. Whatever the reason is, national security, you name it. Three million people lose their jobs. We have got to do something. I don't get why Congress is so uptight about this idea after basically signing on for $8 trillion. Do you, Dan?"" Patrick: ""Well, I do get it from this standpoint, Lou, is until we see a plan that they're going to change their business model, we're bridging the gap until they eventually go bankrupt. I'm not in favor of any of these bailouts but I would rather see let's bail out the middle class that you had a story earlier in the show that's being hammered. Give each family a voucher for $5,000 that can only be used if they buy a new truck or automobile."" ""That will start moving inventory,"" Patrick then said. The Texan added: ""We need some practical thinking on the main street level to help the average, American family. That's what we need to help get the economy rolling. Once the economy is rolling, everything takes care of itself but I'm tired of giving money to Wall Street, tired of seeing Congress have no transparency where this money is going. ""Let's put it in the pockets of the people,"" Patrick said. ""We got here, Lou, because once upon a time, the saying was, we're spending our children's money and our grandchildren's money. This government is now spending our great-grandchildren's money and the factor of inflation and debt is going to destroy this country."" Earlier on the program, Patrick said: ""Most people don't want to see General Motors fail but they also don't want their tax dollars and bail out a company that has had bad ideas and bad management."" Patrick also brought up the voucher idea on the March 31, 2009, edition of Dobbs’ program, we confirmed from the CNN transcript. ""Six months ago,"" Patrick said to Dobbs, ""I was on your show here after the first stimulus, Lou, and I suggested that the government send a $5,000 check to every head of a household who had an auto registration and it could"" only be ""used to buy a car."" (Patrick wasn’t that specific earlier, at least according to the 2008 show’s transcript.) Patrick continued in his 2009 appearance: ""If we want to use stimulus money effectively, send a check for five grand to everyone in America, head of a household, that they can only use to buy a car. That will move cars."" Later in the interview, Patrick said: ""But instead of sending Detroit the money, send it to people"" to go buy a car. Asked about the senator’s statements to Dobbs, Patrick spokesman Logan Spence pointed us to a Patrick campaign web page including a section declaring Dewhurst’s voucher claim a lie. ""This is a misrepresentation of"" Patrick’s ""position,"" Patrick’s camp says. ""He said that the money the federal government was playing with to bail out the auto industry would be better served being returned to their rightful owner—the taxpayer—for use of buying a car should they want to."" Vouchers, Spence said by email, struck Patrick as a ""better and cheaper idea."" Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick ""supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car."" Patrick advocated such vouchers, but this claim fails to note that Patrick pitched them as a direct way of bolstering auto manufacturing instead of the federal bailout of manufacturers. It’s worth clarifying, too, that a state senator doesn't hold much sway over what the federal government does. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

Democrats say Alex Sink 'got outspent in a Republican district'
","The votes in the special election for Florida’s 13th Congressional District were barely in before the blame game began. On March 11, 2013, Republican David Jolly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in the high-profile Pinellas County race to fill the seat of the late Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young. Shortly after Sink lost, the Democratic National Committee sent out a fundraising email signed by the DNC’s CEO, Amy K. Dacey. In it, Dacey called the result ""really scary"" because ""Republican super PACs and outside groups rode to the rescue of a straight-up corporate lobbyist (Jolly) -- spending $5 million to tear down his Democratic opponent."" After urging recipients of the email to ""chip in $3 or more,"" Dacey offered an analysis of the outcome: ""In a district that Republicans have held for almost six decades, we nearly pulled off an incredible upset thanks to grassroots support from Democrats like you -- but we fell short for one reason: We got outspent in a Republican district. And call me old fashioned, but I think people, and not special interests, should decide elections."" We wondered whether the DNC is correct to say that Democrats ""got outspent in a Republican district."" We’ll address the claim in two parts. Did Democrats get outspent? Some money in campaigns is raised and spent by the candidate. Other funds are spent by outside groups, ranging from state parties to labor unions to the National Rifle Association. To fully understand how much money is sloshing around a particular race, you have to include both types. You also have to combine the money spent to promote a candidate with that spent to attack their opponent. Michael Beckel -- a reporter with the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics -- looked at how much the candidates reported raising and spending in their official Federal Election Commission disclosures through Feb. 19, the last pre-election filing date. He then looked at the amounts they reported raising when they filed more limited ""48-hour"" reports through election day. Finally, Beckel added the amounts spent by outside groups. Beckel’s total? About $6.4 million for ""Team Sink,"" and about $6.3 million for ""Team Jolly."" ""Both Democrats and Republicans went all-in,"" Beckel told PolitiFact. ""Neither side can claim to have been outgunned."" This is not to say there weren’t differences in where the two campaigns’ financial support came from. And those are relevant points when checking the DNC’s comment. When we checked with the DNC, they noted that spending by outside groups tilted toward Jolly. They are correct. Here’s a summary of both outside spending and candidate spending in the special election, using data from the Center for Responsive Politics. (It differs slightly from Beckel’s calculations, but is generally similar.)   Data through Feb. 19 Pro-Sink Pro-Jolly Outside spending $3,752,057 $5,070,604 Candidate spending $1,569,762 $857,997 Total spending $5,321,819 $5,928,601   This shows that Jolly benefited from a level of outside spending that was about 35 percent higher than what Sink benefited from. By contrast, Sink outraised Jolly in money that her own campaign raised. She raised about 80 percent more than Jolly did. On balance, Jolly and the outside groups that supported him did outspend Sink and her allies by about $600,000 -- an 11 percent edge, give or take. But this isn’t the whole story. As we noted, this data on spending stops at Feb. 19, a point several weeks before the election. Stopping here ignores what each candidate had in their war chest -- much of which they would presumably want to spend through the election. So we also looked at what each of the candidates had as ""cash on hand"" -- essentially, money that hadn’t been spent yet. Here’s what we found:
  Data through Feb. 19 Pro-Sink Pro-Jolly Candidate + outside spending $5,321,819 $5,928,601 Cash on Hand $971,587 $182,189 Spending plus cash on hand $6,293,406 $6,110,790   So, adding in cash on hand that was likely to be spent before election day, the advantage shifts to ""Team Sink."" This data suggests that her financial position was no worse in this election than Jolly’s, and perhaps a little better. And that would undercut the DNC’s point that she ""got outspent."" ""Jolly’s campaign may have been sunk without outside groups coming to his aid, but that’s only part of the story,"" Beckel said. ""Thanks to outside group activity on both sides, neither candidate was outgunned. Both Democrats and Republicans made huge investments in the race."" Is Florida’s 13th a Republican district? On this question, too, the data is mixed. On the one hand, the district's party registration breakdown is 170,402 Republicans and 159,022 Democrats (plus 111,114 without a party affiliation). The seat had been held (with some variations in its borders) by Young, a Republican, for 44 years. In recent years, his worst re-election margin was 57 percent of the vote. And a widely used method for characterizing the political leanings of districts -- the Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voting Index -- calls the 13th a ""Republican +2"" district, which means that during the previous two presidential elections, the district voted an average of 2 points more Republican than the nation did as a whole. But other factors suggest that calling the 13th a ""Republican district"" is an exaggeration. Since voters do not always vote in lockstep with their party, Democrats have fared well in the 13th in recent years. Barack Obama won the district in 2008 by nearly 4 percentage points, and in 2012 by 1.4 percentage points. Sink won the district both during her losing gubernatorial bid in 2010 and her successful run for chief financial officer in 2006. Given this, Young’s margins of victory are an outlier that have more to do with his long tenure as an incumbent. And a district that is ""Republican +2"" places it near the exact partisan middle of the House of Representatives. In the world of political handicappers, this means the 13th is a quintessential ""competitive"" or ""swing"" district, not a Republican one. ""It's about as evenly divided as you can get,"" said David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ""We thought this district was competitive before the election, and we still think it’s a competitive district after the election,"" agreed Nathan Gonzales, who analyzes races for the similarly nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Our ruling In a fundraising letter after the Florida special election, the Democratic National Committee said Democrats ""got outspent in a Republican district."" Both claims have a grain of truth, but are exaggerated. By the Feb. 19 cutoff for disclosure -- a few weeks before the election was held -- Jolly and his supporters had outspent Sink and her supporters. But if you take into account Sink’s big advantage in banked money -- dollars she was likely to spend in the race’s final weeks -- that edge disappears, and ""Team Sink"" takes a narrow overall lead. Meanwhile, nonpartisan analysts agree that the district is more accurately labeled ""toss-up"" than ""Republican"" in its partisan leanings. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/mar/14/democratic-national-committee/democrats-say-alex-sink-got-outspent-republican-di/

Does candidate's Obamacare repeal plan take bureaucrats out of healthcare?
","Georgia Congressman Paul Broun has been telling anyone who’ll listen that he has the elixir to improve the nation’s health care system. Broun, a U.S. House member from Athens, is running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate and promoting his plan -- the Patient OPTION Act -- on the campaign trail. Broun made a claim about his plan that seemed worthy of a thorough examination on the Truth-O-Meter. ""Of all of the Republican plans out there, it’s the only one that completely repeals Obamacare,"" Broun said at a recent candidate forum, organized by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. ""It takes the federal bureaucrat out of decisions for you."" Broun, a doctor, most recently introduced his bill in August. His legislation, House Resolution 2900, would allow consumers to buy health care across state lines, make it easier for small businesses and other groups to band together in an effort to establish less expensive health plans, offer tax incentives to doctors who provide free health care to indigent patients, and move Medicare and Medicaid to other programs that he believes will create greater flexibility and help consumers. ""Dr. Broun's Patient OPTION Act is the only healthcare alternative plan that repeals Obamacare in full and removes bureaucrats from one’s personal healthcare decisions,"" Broun’s spokeswoman, Christine Hardman, said in one email. The bill has yet to make it to the House floor, and it has not been reviewed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for its potential impact on the federal budget. Several congressional Republicans have pitched their own plans to repeal the health care law, but Broun says his is the only proposal that removes federal bureaucrats from the process. Hardman gave us examples to support Broun’s claim. They included:   H.R. 2900 does not require the secretary of health and human services (or anyone else at the federal level) to administer health plans put together by associations. All the other bills give the HHS secretary this power, she said. Broun’s team says his bill does not place judicial mandates on the states while the other bills have high federal involvement.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is phased out in Broun’s plan. The other bills keep CMS in place, Broun’s camp says. With no CMS, there is no bureaucracy to determine what doctors who see Medicare patients are paid, it says. Patients would be able to use the premium assistance in the bill or other means to contract with them one on one based on the services they need and want. ""Without CMS, there would also be no interference with where one gets a procedure done (a physician-owned hospital vs. a traditional one), what kinds of imaging a patient can receive, and where (can you get an MRI right there, or do you have to travel to a secondary center), what type of treatment a patient can receive (can you get all of the physical therapy your condition warrants? What kind of oxygen tanks or other durable medical equipment can you use?),"" Hardman said. One recent GOP plan to repeal Obamacare, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was put together by a trio of Republican senators. The legislation, called the Patient CARE Act, keeps some provisions such as its requirement that insurers cover adult children younger than 27. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., has authored the Patient Centered Healthcare Savings Act, which calls for repealing Obamacare. It does allow adult children to remain on their parents’ plan until they are 23. Another bill was authored by a fellow Georgian serving in the House, Tom Price of Roswell. It would offer tax credits of nearly $5,800 to low-income families, give grant money to states to provide care through various pools, allow consumers and small businesses to buy insurance across state lines, and let private insurers offer options to Medicaid. U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., offered a companion bill to Price’s legislation. Hardman said one difference between Broun’s bill and Price’s proposal is that the latter’s legislation directs the secretary of health and human services to issue best-practice guidelines for the treatment of medical conditions. That’s an example of bureaucrats getting involved, Broun’s camp says. Price’s plan requires the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement to approve Medicare program services. The American Medical Association started the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement about a decade ago with the goal of improving patient safety. William Custer, the director of Georgia State University’s Center for Health Services Research, is skeptical that Broun’s plan can be implemented. ""Administering a Medicare premium assistance program requires someone to determine who is eligible and for what,"" Custer said. ""If you’re going to give Medicare-eligible recipients (after someone, presumably in the federal government, has determined they are eligible) a voucher, are there rules as to what they can purchase with that voucher? Does it have to be health insurance, for example, and if so, are there restrictions or mandates on what’s covered? Who is going to write those rules and to ensure they are followed?""   Custer wondered who would ensure elderly Americans will be sold insurance. He also wondered who would make sure a procedure or treatment is safe if CMS is not around. Broun’s bill raises another question. Once CMS is phased out, his legislation would transfer those duties within a part of the U.S. Treasury Department. Isn’t that still part of the federal bureaucracy? PolitiFact Georgia raised that question and others to Hardman. She said there would be fewer federal people involved on the administrative level. ""There would still be federal bureaucrats involved at the administrative level, however, there would be thousands fewer than there are now, and as Dr. Broun stated, they would not be involved in making your healthcare decisions (the more personal decisions that are currently being made by a federal bureaucrat under Obamacare). So by transferring the duties of CMS to the Treasury Department, we would remove the middlemen and instead, empower Americans to take direct control of their own medical care,"" Hardman said. To sum up, Broun said his legislation would completely repeal Obamacare and takes federal bureaucrats out of individual health care decisions. There is quite a bit of context needed to understand this claim. Since the duties of CMS would be transferred to the Treasury Department, there will still be some federal officials involved in the process. Broun’s bill would make Obamacare disappear. But so would other GOP proposals. And Broun’s plan does not make the bureaucracy go away.

Ronald Reagan's son says his father got the Saudis to pump more oil to undercut USSR
","The Cold War is back. Or at least, some version of it has returned, with Russian troops on the move across the Crimean Peninsula with the oddsmakers predicting it will once again be Russian territory. For critics of President Barack Obama, this is a prime opportunity to demonstrate how poorly he stacks up compared with the man who did all he could to topple the Soviet Union, President Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s son, Michael Reagan, offered this advice for Obama on the Townhall.com website: ""I suggest that President Obama might want to study how Ronald Reagan defeated the Soviet Union. ""He did it without firing a shot, as we know, but he had a super weapon -- oil. ""Oil was the only thing the Soviets had in the 1980s that anyone in the rest of the world wanted to buy, besides ICBMs and H-bombs, and they weren't for sale. ""Since selling oil was the source of the Kremlin's wealth, my father got the Saudis to flood the market with cheap oil. ""Lower oil prices devalued the ruble, causing the USSR to go bankrupt, which led to perestroika and Mikhail Gorbachev and the collapse of the Soviet Empire."" It seems like a reasonable narrative, but as we’ll see in this fact-check, the record isn’t quite as robust as Reagan fils might like. We made several efforts to reach Reagan for official records that would back up his claim, and we did not hear back. The basic oil market numbers We can see what happened with oil markets during Reagan's time in office by looking at volume -- how much was pumped out of the ground -- and price. The U.S. Energy Information Administration provides the production numbers, and what we see partly backs up Reagan’s point and partly does not. Total Oil Supply (Thousand Barrels Per Day)    For the first five years of Reagan’s administration, Saudi production fell steeply. Then in 1986 it popped up, followed by a dip the next year, and ending with another rise. The Energy Information Administration also provides pricing data and it too both supports and undercuts Reagan’s statement. Prices fall in 1986, then recover in 1987 followed by a decline in 1988. Prices remained below what they had been in 1985. Spot price: Cushing OK WTI    By several estimates, the drop in prices cost the USSR $20 billion a year. If the plan was to hurt the Soviet Union, it succeeded. What is unclear is whether the Saudis ramped up production at Reagan’s request. We look at what the record shows on that front. The evidence in support of Reagan intervention Paul Kengor is a Reagan biographer who believes the Gipper has not received the credit he is due for waging economic warfare against the USSR. Kengor told PunditFact that Michael Reagan is correct when he says his father was behind the Saudi’s decision. ""They did this strictly to help us hurt the Soviets and as payback for us helping them in the past,"" Kengor said. ""It was a big risk for them."" Kengor pointed us to the book Victory: The Reagan administration’s secret strategy that hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union, by Peter Schweizer. In that book, Schweizer describes a 1981 meeting between CIA director William Casey and his Saudi counterpart. At that meeting, Casey shared CIA reports on Soviet oil production. ""By raising the issues of oil prices and the U.S.-Saudi Arabia security relationship in the same conversation,"" Casey was in effect saying the two were related,"" Schweizer wrote. Schweizer cites an unnamed U.S. official for this information. A former National Security Council official referred to Casey’s contacts with Saudi Arabia during a recent panel discussion but in less detail than in Schweizer’s book. But move forward to 1985, when the Saudis actually made their production hike, and Schweizer wrote, ""What factor lay most heavily on the mind of the Saudis when they made this decision is anybody’s guess."" We asked Kengor for the best documentation they could find to support the claim of Reagan’s direct intervention. We have yet to receive that. However, there is an ample public record on the factors within OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, that shaped the Saudi Arabian production strategy. Plus, the Reagan administration made efforts to push prices back up. We turn now to the information that tends to undermine Reagan’s assertion. The evidence against James Williams is an Arkansas-based consulting economist in the oil and gas industry who worked with producers in West Texas in the 1980s. Williams told us that in the first half of the decade, OPEC had an agreement to keep prices high through a system of production quotas. Members promised to limit the number of barrels they would pump. With less supply, prices would be higher. ""The Saudi Arabians were dropping production faster than the rest of OPEC,"" Williams said. ""They bore a disproportionate share of the effort to prop up prices."" The problem was, not every member followed the rules. There are many references in the public record of Saudi resentment. Economist Darwin Hall at the California State University at Long Beach described it in a 1992 article in Energy Policy. ""At the OPEC meetings in Geneva during the period from 1982 to 1985, Sheikh Yamani, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia at the time, repeatedly threatened to expand output unless Iraq and Iran stopped cheating on their agreed quotas,"" Hall wrote. (Iran and Iraq were at war and needed foreign currency to finance their militaries.) While OPEC wielded considerable clout on world energy markets, internally, it had no way to enforce the terms among its signatories. Philip Verlager, an energy consultant, said Saudi Arabia had more oil capacity than anyone and so had more power. ""From 1981 to the end of 1985, Saudi Arabia took on the swing producer role in OPEC,""  Verleger told PunditFact. ""Then in 1986, they threw in the towel and prices collapsed."" In six months, the spot price for oil was cut in half. Verleger said Michael Reagan ""is wrong."" He and many other writers say the Saudis boosted production to send a message to other OPEC members. Another bit of information from Saudi Arabia also undercuts the Reagan claim. Dick Combs, a foreign service officer and author of Inside the Soviet Alternate Universe, noted that Saudi King Fahd was not a strong supporter of the shift in 1986. He fired his oil minister and cut back ""domestic oil production to enhance Saudi revenues.""   If the Reagan doctrine was to keep prices as low as possible, U.S. actions weren’t always consistent with that goal. As prices fell, the U.S. oil industry collapsed. ""In April 1986, Reagan sent (Vice President George H.W.) Bush to Saudi Arabia to get the Saudis to cut production to bring prices up,"" Verlager said. According to newspapers at the time, Bush told King Fahd that the United States saw the hit on the domestic oil market as ""a threat to national security."" Our ruling Michael Reagan said his father got Saudi Arabia to flood the market with oil in order to drive down prices and undermine the Soviet economy. The numbers on production and pricing show that Saudi production rose, then fell, and then rose again. In the middle of 1987, prices were close to what they had been at the beginning of 1986, although they fell again and never went as high as they had been in 1985. The pattern of production and prices do not fit neatly with Reagan’s statement. We have no public documents to confirm that Reagan asked the Saudis to use oil as an economic weapon against the USSR. On the other hand, we have an extensive public record that Saudi Arabia was fighting with its OPEC partners and had warned them for years that it would raise production to make them pay a price for cheating on their quotas. We also see that Saudi Arabia charted its own course in setting oil prices and the consensus view among oil experts is OPEC, not Reagan, shaped their production decisions. Finally, we have Bush calling on the Saudis to help send prices back up. This is exactly counter to the Reagan strategy in the statement. There might be an element of truth in the claim, but the public record strongly points the other way. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/mar/13/michael-reagan/ronald-reagans-son-says-his-father-got-saudis-pump/

John Morgan says 'a SWAT team of hooligans' arrested medical marijuana activist Cathy Jordan
","Outspoken Orlando attorney John Morgan doesn’t mince words when it comes to his support of Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment. He does tend to paint his cause in broad strokes, however. During a University of Tampa debate on medicinal use of the drug on Feb. 24, Morgan argued that it’s misguided to enforce marijuana laws, using the example of Cathy Jordan, a 64-year-old Parrish resident who smokes to combat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. ""The issue for this year is very simple,"" Morgan said. ""Should about 350,000 to 400,000 people, including Cathy Jordan, who’s here tonight, who was arrested last year, drug out of her home, because she suffers from ALS, and marijuana is the only thing that will help her, the only question this year for us is the legalization of medical marijuana."" Later, he added this: ""There was an arrest of Cathy Jordan a year ago. An ALS patient who’s sitting right here ... this afternoon, and guess what? The agricultural commissioner sent a SWAT team of hooligans out to her house to drag her and her husband out because it's the only relief that she could get."" Jordan is now the president of the Florida Cannabis Action Network, while Morgan has spent $4 million of his own money on a petition drive for a constitutional amendment for marijuana. Some of the details Morgan mentioned about Jordan’s encounter with law enforcement, though, didn’t sound right, so we decided to check it out. Acting on a tip The Tampa Bay Times wrote about Jordan’s plight last year, confirming that her marijuana usage did in fact attract the attention of Manatee County sheriff’s deputies on Feb. 25, 2013. A Realtor noticed an extension cord running from a shed on Jordan’s property to an empty home’s garage next door, then saw a mature marijuana plant growing in Jordan’s garden. The Realtor called the authorities. According to an incident report, two deputies responded to the call, originally for burglary and theft of service for the extension cord, and confirmed the plant was there. The responding deputies’ reports noted that two men harassed them and recorded their arrival and subsequent investigation. One of the men (neither are named in those reports, although Robert Jordan and his son were home) reportedly bumped one of the deputies several times and attempted to prevent the pair of officers from entering their property, saying the marijuana was theirs and they wanted the deputies to leave. One deputy called his sergeant, who responded and then requested the department’s Special Investigations Division, an undercover vice and narcotics unit that responds to drug calls. Three detectives responded to the call and spoke to Robert Jordan, who let the police enter his house and explained his wife used marijuana to deal with her ALS symptoms, according to the division’s report. Police confirmed no marijuana being grown inside the house, then went outside to find three large plants in a plastic container and two smaller plants in another. Robert Jordan then opened the shed that used the extension cord to reveal 18 smaller seedlings, ""a lighting system, an air conditioner, a thermometer and a white erase board to track planting dates."" The authorities explained to Robert Jordan that growing marijuana was illegal under federal law and they could either take all the marijuana ""observed in plain view"" or they would go get a warrant and forcibly remove the plants. The report states neither he nor his wife were ever threatened with arrest, but reluctantly agreed to let the department confiscate 23 plants. No one was arrested or dragged out of their house by a SWAT team. The Jordans sued the Sheriff’s Office for the return of their plants last year. Sheriff’s Office public information officer Dave Bristow did verify that none of the officers responding drew their guns and only entered the Jordans’ property with permission. No warrants were necessary. The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office wouldn’t comment on the incident other than to confirm details in the report, citing pending civil litigation. Robert Jordan confirmed the incident happened the way the sheriff’s reports says it did, although he said the deputies who first arrived did rush up his driveway with their hands on their sidearms. He described them as ""very, very aggressive,"" although he said he was aggressive, too, arguing about whether probable cause allowed them on his property. He noted he told his wife to go across the street with friends after the deputies arrived, and no one touched her. He had a different opinion about the Special Investigations Division detectives. ""The actual narcotics officers, they were gentlemen,"" Jordan said. ""They were embarrassed, because I told them they were taking my wife’s medicine."" Two of the trio wore ski masks, Jordan said, which the Sheriff’s Office said is procedure to conceal their identities for undercover work. The unmasked detective told Jordan he had two choices: They could wait outside a couple of hours while they got a warrant. Jordan said the detective told him they would then come back and ""tear your house apart. And we don’t put nothing back."" Or the Jordans could walk them through the house and allow the unit to confiscate his plants, then wait for word on official charges. The officer then told Jordan they had a right to take anything in the shed, but opted to only remove the light bulb from the grow lamp and smash it. The same week, State Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, introduced a medical marijuana bill called the Cathy Jordan Medical Cannabis Act. The bill died, but he filed another bill under the same name in February, ostensibly to set a framework should the amendment pass in November. Robert Jordan was in the process of buying the property next door, and the utilities were in his name, so the burglary and theft of service charges were never brought, and the Realtor’s company declined to press any trespassing charges. The Manatee County state attorney’s later reviewed the case and declined to press growing and possession charges because ""the state lacks a good-faith belief it can overcome a medical necessity defense in this matter,"" according to the office’s report. Robert Jordan could have faced a felony count of possession and manufacturing of a Schedule I drug. We asked the United for Care campaign for a response. Manager Ben Pollara said Morgan’s comments were off the cuff. ""I think it’s just a case of something that happened a year ago … and he was talking from memory,"" Pollara said. A story about officers in ski masks with guns probably made it sound like a SWAT team, he said. Robert Jordan said he figured Morgan may have gotten his account from any of the numerous outlets that layered on the hyperbole about machine guns and police brutality -- he named this story by the Huffington Post as being particularly loose with the facts. ""No one asked me, or I would have told them the truth,"" Jordan said. He also said he had only met John Morgan and didn’t know him, but liked the man for his devotion to getting medical marijuana legislation passed, and how Morgan treated his wife. Having a legal supply of cannabis available would certainly make his life easier, he added. Meanwhile, the Jordans continue to cultivate their own plants, thanks to having the charges dropped. The ruling Morgan said ""a SWAT team of hooligans"" dragged Cathy Jordan out of her home and arrested her after authorities discovered her family’s tiny growing operation in their Parrish backyard. Officers obtained consent to search the property and removed mature plants and seedlings, and Robert Jordan faced charges of growing and possessing marijuana, which were later dropped. No one was arrested. No one was dragged anywhere. It seems Morgan may have read a report of the incident awash in hyperbole and recalled that. There was an incident at the Jordans’ home, but the police reaction was not nearly as drastic as Morgan described.

Mayor Tom Barrett says using cigarette tax for new arena ‘not feasible under state law’
","The wheels are turning among Milwaukee’s civic leaders as they try to address the future of the aging BMO Harris Bradley Center. The 25-year-old facility has been described as a ""senior citizen"" among NBA arenas. There’s a growing sense of urgency. The lease for the Milwaukee Bucks expires in 2017, the NBA is applying pressure, and the team’s owner, former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, is seeking additional investors in the team. Two panels of civic leaders are exploring options for the arena. So we took notice when Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett seemed to rule out one funding option -- an expansion of the cigarette tax -- that has been used in other cities to help pay for new facilities. ""I don’t think that’s feasible under state law,"" the mayor said in a March 3, 2014 interview with Wisconsin Eye. He added: ""No one has talked about that at all. I’ve never heard anybody mention that."" The two panels -- a large group led by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce that's studying the region's cultural funding needs and a smaller one focused on the Bradley Center -- have just begun their work. In theory, at least, all funding options are still on the table, although some surrounding counties are on record opposing any public funding for a downtown Milwaukee arena. So is Barrett right? Does state law block an expansion of the cigarette tax? When we asked Barrett’s office for backup for his statement, spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said: ""Mayor Barrett’s answer was referring to the fact that we can’t have a local cigarette tax because of state law."" How it works now The state now levies a tax of $2.52 per pack of cigarettes. The tax has been around since 1939, and has been increased by the Legislature 17 times, most recently in 2009. The tax raised about $587 million in fiscal year 2011-’12, and raised as much as $644 million in fiscal year 2009-’10. (Increasing the tax, as was the case in 2009, often convinces some smokers to smoke less.) Money raised from the tax goes into general state coffers. As it stands now, Wisconsin’s cigarette tax is levied uniformly statewide. There are no local surcharges, and no means for the money to be directed to local projects. That could change, but it would take the approval of the Legislature and governor, said Sean Moran, of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Moran wrote an issue paper about the state’s alcohol and tobacco taxes last year. ""There’s really no reason it couldn’t be done,"" he said. What has been discussed The Public Policy Forum  was commissioned to study a variety of funding tools, including the cigarette tax, as part of a report that will be issued March 14, 2014. Forum president Rob Henken said in an interview that the tool was being considered because of the experience in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland. Voters there approved a 30-cent county tax on cigarettes that started in 2006 and gave it a 10-year lifespan. The tax generated about $15.6 million for local arts and culture groups. (Another 4.5 cent tax on cigarettes, part of a ""sin tax"" enacted in 1990 that also includes taxes on alcohol, is dedicated to funding sports facilities. Voters will decide in May whether or not to extend that tax for 20 years.) A local cigarette tax is also in place in other areas, including Cook County, Ill. Smokers there pay $2 a pack in a county tax; the city of Chicago tacks on another 68 cents. In New York state, the tax is a whopping $4.35, tops in the country. Henken said there were pluses and minuses behind using a cigarette tax for a Bradley Center replacement. On the plus side, of course, are the dollars. The report will say that if a 30-cent cigarette tax -- the same size as Cuyahoga County -- were levied in Milwaukee County, it would generate about $11.7 million a year. Obviously, that’s not enough to pay for a new stadium on its own, but it could factor into a package of revenue tools. The downside includes the argument that such a tax  would penalize lower income people, because studies show they tend to smoke in greater numbers than higher income people. Also, the state’s cigarette tax is already high -- we’re No. 8 --  compared with the other 49 states, according to the Fiscal Bureau. The list is topped by New York at $4.35 a pack. Then there’s the ""island"" issue. Some Milwaukee County smokers would simply go elsewhere to buy their cigarettes and avoid the higher tax. In a meeting in February 2014, members of the task force looking at cultural funding needs -- not just the arena issue  -- discussed the various tax options. A Journal Sentinel report on the meeting noted that panel members meeting in small groups ""seemed to agree that a property-tax model or a sin tax to generate revenue would not be workable in Milwaukee County."" Our rating Barrett said that using a surcharge on the cigarette tax to help pay for a new downtown sports arena ""is not feasible under state law."" A spokeswoman said meant that the tax wasn’t allowed under state law as it presently exists. But that doesn’t mean that state law can’t be changed. Indeed, state approval is likely going to be needed for any mix of higher taxes that could be used to fund an arena expansion or renovation. In that respect, there is nothing different about the approval required for a cigarette tax increase, a funding option that’s used in other parts of the country. Our definition for Half True is a statement that's partially accurate but leaves out important details. That fits here. Note: An earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that the Public Policy Forum was leading a task force studying the area's cultural needs. The organization is only conducting research into the matter.",/factchecks/2014/mar/13/tom-barrett/mayor-tom-barrett-says-using-cigarette-tax-new-are/

Rush Limbaugh says Barack Obama turned NASA into a 'Muslim outreach department'
","During an epic rant about liberal laziness and the events in Ukraine, conservative radio pundit Rush Limbaugh made a striking claim about NASA’s new role under President Barack Obama. How liberal laziness, Ukraine and NASA are related is a bit convoluted, so we’ll keep this recap short and sweet. Limbaugh was going off on a Huffington Post blog written by Carolyn Gregoire. In her post, Gregoire criticized a Cadillac commercial as over-materialistic. Here’s what Limbaugh said on his March 6 show: ""Hey, Ms. Gregoire, never mind that Barack Obama made NASA into a Muslim outreach department and it's Barack Obama, your idol and hero, that makes it necessary to pay the Russians $70 million for every astronaut to the space station,"" Limbaugh said. ""By the way, with this thing in the Ukraine, with the KGB vs. Obama, i.e., ACORN, what happens if Putin says, ‘You know what, you really ticked me off and I'm not taking you back to your space station.’ How we gonna get there, Ms. Gregoire? 'Cause Obama's shut it down. NASA's a museum for Muslim outreach now."" There’s obviously some hyperbole in Limbaugh’s comments here. But we did think it worthy to attempt to answer two questions: What is Limbaugh talking about when he says Obama turned NASA ""into a Muslim outreach department?"" Did Obama shut down NASA space flights? The Muslim museum connection Limbaugh did not return a request for comment. But we’re fairly certain the origin of his ""Muslim outreach"" claim stems from the summer 2010 news cycle. New NASA chief Charles Bolden made a curious remark about Obama’s three-pronged vision for Bolden’s job description in an interview with Middle Eastern news channel Al Jazeera. Obama had made improving relations with the Middle East a priority in his first campaign and traveled to Egypt for an historic address to the Muslim world in July 2009. To commemorate the one-year anniversary of that speech, Bolden told Al Jazeera the following in Cairo (video): ""When I became the NASA administrator, (President Obama) charged me with three things. One, he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math; he wanted me to expand our international relationships; and third, and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering."" Months earlier, Bolden brought up NASA’s goal of working with ""non-traditional"" allies, such as Indonesia, in a talk with engineering students, according to the Orlando Sentinel. We wanted to know what other ground Bolden covered during the Al Jazeera interview, but we could not find a full-length transcript and video. So we turned to other recaps. A 2010 PolitiFact Texas fact-check on this topic pointed out Bolden also spoke of NASA’s focus on international exploration of deep space and using robots to knock human race-threatening asteroids away from Earth. An ABC News synopsis said Bolden said his mission was not about diplomacy but expanding international relationships for ""tangible reasons,"" such as traveling to Mars. Still, Bolden’s comment about reaching out to Muslim nations struck conservative talking heads and politicians as bizarre. Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer said Bolden’s remarks signaled ""a new height of fatuousness."" Former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, who served during the George W. Bush administration, called it a ""perversion"" of NASA’s purpose. Limbaugh was mad back then, too. The White House clarified Bolden’s remarks as outrage swelled, with spokesman Robert Gibbs saying, ""That was not his task, and that's not the task of NASA."" A NASA spokesman told PolitiFact Texas in a previous fact-check, ""NASA’s core mission remains one of space exploration, science and aeronautics. Administrator Bolden regrets that a statement he made during a recent interview mischaracterized that core mission. The success of NASA’s efforts is increasingly enhanced by mutual cooperation with dozens of other countries around the world that are also committed to these efforts."" In the years since, Bolden has traveled around the world promoting NASA but has not made many public statements. ""He misspoke a bit and has since then had a fairly tight leash put on him by the White House,"" said John Logsdon, space historian at the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, in an interview with PunditFact. Obama did not want Bolden to extend NASA’s cooperation to solely Muslim countries, Logsdon said, but also to non-traditional countries in South America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The American space program could be ""an instrument of political goodwill"" and help developing countries get involved with modern space activities, Logsdon said. We reached out to NASA for examples of collaboration with Middle Eastern countries since Bolden took over, and about Limbaugh’s characterization of Bolden’s remarks in general, but a spokesman did not answer those questions. The end of NASA’s space shuttle program The retirement of the 30-year-old space shuttle program may have happened under Obama’s watch, but the process was triggered during the administration of President George W. Bush. In 2004, Bush called for retiring the space shuttle once the International Space Station was complete. (PolitiFact looked at the origins of the phase-out of the American space shuttle program in this fact-check.) NASA retired its space shuttle fleet after the final flight for the space shuttle Atlantis in July 2011. The goal after that was to have a commercial spaceship to carry American astronauts by 2015. In the interim, NASA is paying for seats aboard Russia’s Soyuz space capsules for missions to the International Space Station. Other countries, like Japan and Canada, have reached the space station via Soyuz capsules, too. That arrangement will continue for NASA through 2017. Part of the reason for the delay is that Congress has underfunded Obama’s recent budget requests to help private companies develop their own space technology, according to Space.com, a space and astronomy news website. Regardless, one thing is clear: NASA is not closed for business. The agency has a $17 billion budget and is spending it, Logsdon said. There are satellites en route to Pluto and Jupiter, a rover on the surface of Mars, and work being done on the successor to the Hubble space telescope, he said. NASA spokesman David Weaver said the agency is working on a plan to launch American astronauts to the space station and not rely on Russian transport, but Congress needs to fund Obama’s budget requests. Our ruling Limbaugh reached into the early flare-ups of the Obama presidency for his quip about NASA’s conversion into a ""Muslim outreach department."" The notion stems from remarks by Bolden in an interview with an Arabic TV channel in 2010. Bolden identified three priorities from Obama, including finding ""a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering."" The Obama White House refuted Bolden’s remarks once outrage swelled, with spokespeople emphasizing the agency’s mission is space exploration and not diplomacy. Limbaugh also accused Obama of shutting down NASA space flights. Obama certainly played a role (the shuttle flights stopped while he was in office), but the plan to scuttle the space shuttle program started before Obama took office, and Congress has not fully funded budget requests to speed along the creation of a private American space fleet. Those omissions go beyond the realm of hyperbole. We rate Limbaugh’s claim False.",/factchecks/2014/mar/12/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-barack-obama-turned-nasa-muslim/

Rob Portman says average U.S. family is earning $4,000 less than five years ago
","Economic stagnation is an issue that has become a major talking point for both parties. Take President Barack Obama’s most recent State of the Union address, in which he said that during the past four years, ""average wages have barely budged."" We rated that claim True. Now, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, has offered an even more ominous statistic for working Americans. ""The average family,"" he said in the March 8, 2014, weekly Republican address, is ""now bringing home $4,000 less than they did just five years ago."" We wondered whether Portman’s claim was correct, so we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau collects data on family income and found that Portman is correct as long as the dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation. We looked at both the mean family income (that is, total family income divided by the number of families) and the median family income (the middle value when all family incomes are lined up from biggest to smallest). For the inflation-adjusted mean, family income fell from $87,312 in 2007 to $82,843 in 2012, the most recent year available. That’s a drop of $4,469, making Portman correct. In fact, he underestimated a bit. The difference is even more stark if you use the inflation-adjusted median. By that measure, family income dropped from $67,943 to $62,241 over the same period. That’s a drop of $5,702 -- an 8.3 percent decline over five years. So Portman’s only shortcoming is to lowball the size of the family-income decline. We should note that choosing 2007 as the starting year maximizes the decline, since the last recession began in December 2007. But we have no quarrel with the use of this period, because when looking at income trends, it seems reasonable to look at how big an impact the recession has had. We’ll also note that Portman wouldn’t be correct if non-inflation-adjusted figures are used. Without an inflation adjustment, both mean and median family incomes went up from 2007 to 2012 -- about 5 percent for mean family income, and 1.4 percent for median family income. But economists generally prefer inflation-adjusted data for situations like this, since the adjusted data takes into account the most important aspect of income -- what it can actually purchase. Our ruling Portman said ""the average family (is) now bringing home $4,000 less than they did just five years ago."" According to Census Bureau data, the decline is even greater, making Portman’s overall point even stronger than the data he offered.

","Texas Gov. Rick Perry, you may recall, isn’t impressed by states led by Democratic governors, including New York and California. Perry, who may run for president again in 2016, delivered a curiously focused dig in his well-received remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 7, 2014, saying another sign of things going well in red states and not so much in blue states lies in the relative costs of hauling stuff in a truck between blue California and red Texas. ""If you rent a U-Haul to move your company, it costs twice as much to go from San Francisco to Austin than the other way around, because you can’t find enough trucks to flee the Golden State,"" Perry said with a grin. Notably, Perry did not say it’s cheaper to live in the city by the bay. According to an online Bankrate.com cost-of-living calculator, someone earning $53,000 a year in Austin would need nearly $92,000 a year to maintain their standard of living in San Francisco. Conversely, someone getting by on $53,000 a year in San Francisco could absorb a 42 percent income cut and still enjoy an equivalent standard of living in Austin, according to the calculator. Setting aside cost-of-living differences, was Perry right about the relative truck rental rates? By email, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed suggested we check rates for ourselves. We followed Nashed’s suggested methodology: ""1. Go to www.uhaul.com 2.  Pick a date, any date (tomorrow, a week from now, the 27th… whatever) 3. Austin zip code 78701, San Francisco zip code 94114."" Upshot: Perry appears to be onto something. On the afternoon after Perry’s speech, we checked online U-Haul rental rates for five different-length trucks for four dates: March 8, March 19, March 30 and April 28, 2014. We also checked the rates for rentals from Austin’s central 78701 ZIP code to San Francisco’s 94102, which is downtown. The rates for each truck did not change by date--and each Austin-to-San Francisco rate was at least half its comparable San Francisco-to-Austin rate. The biggest difference, according to our search, was for renting a 26-foot truck. For that truck, the Austin-to-San Francisco rate, $931, was 39 percent of the $2,383 rate for renting such a truck and driving the other way. (See our chart here.) Wondering if U-Haul is unique in this price contrast, we spot-checked the rental of a Penske truck for March 19, 2014; it would cost $448 to rent a Penske truck in Austin and return it in South San Francisco in comparison to costing nearly $1,487 to take a truck the other direction. Next, we asked Nashed how Perry concluded that the price difference ties to there not being enough U-Haul trucks to flee the Golden State. By email, Nashed pointed out a question and answer posted on U-Haul’s website. Question: ""Why does it cost less to move from Point A to Point B than vice versa?"" U-Haul’s answer: ""Many variables go into establishing rates. There are times when more people are moving out of a city than into it. Because we want more equipment going back to that city we will often discount the rate."" To our emailed inquiry, Ashleigh Wagner, a spokeswoman for U-Haul International, Inc., echoed that online answer without directly addressing the Austin-San Francisco contrast. Our ruling Perry said: ""If you rent a U-Haul to move your company, it costs twice as much to go from San Francisco to Austin than the other way around, because you can’t find enough trucks to flee the Golden State."" His rate contrast is spot-on--with the difference even wider for renting a big truck. U-Haul generally says rate differences reflect its need to keep equipment available to customers everywhere.

"['Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says he has generated $2 billion in tax cuts
","Gov. Scott Walker likes to say he ""loves"" taxpayers. In early March 2014, he counted the ways and declared he’s given Wisconsin taxpayers 2 billion reasons to love him back. ""The hardworking taxpayers of Wisconsin know how to spend their money better than politicians in Madison do, so I thank members of the Senate for helping us return the state’s surplus to the people who earned it,"" Walker said in a statement for reporters after his latest tax-cut plan won approval in the Senate. He added this: ""Once our Blueprint for Prosperity is signed into law, we will have delivered $2 billion in much-needed tax relief for the people of Wisconsin and more than $135 million for worker training programs."" That $2 billion number is likely to be repeated quite a bit during Walker’s re-election bid this year. So we decided to check it out. Is Walker right? It’s clear from the statement that Walker is talking -- at the very least -- about the effect of tax changes enacted during his time in office, including in the four years covered by two budgets he’s signed. The second budget runs through June 2015, six months after Walker’s term expires. The four-year time frame means Walker is lumping into his claim the future effect of some of the tax cuts. But he made it obvious that he was talking about a tally of tax relief that will come come as a result of the actions of this term. The tax-relief number There’s more than one way to get to a bottom line, but we found that Walker’s claim is within $100 million -- high or low -- depending on various factors. Walker’s office sent us a tally of more than 65 tax changes -- mostly cuts, and a few increases -- enacted by legislators and Walker from 2011 to present, including measures from the two budgets. The state budget office calculated the tax relief total at $1.98 billion. Due to some methodology differences, the state Department of Revenue put the total at slightly over $2 billion, according to the spreadsheet provided by Walker’s office. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s director, Bob Lang, and the agency’s tax policy supervisor, Rob Reinhardt, reviewed the list at our request. They put the total at closer to $1.9 billion. ""It’s right around $2 billion,"" Lang told us. So the figure holds up. The tax relief total, we should note, is not a hard number. It can’t be, because it includes estimates of how much tax relief will flow over the course of four-plus years from various measures. And it includes various projections. But that is a routine practice in Madison math and a reasonable way to make a tax-relief claim. Where it came from Most of that total came from moves that drew big headlines, including two separate cuts in income tax rates, multiple property tax relief measures, and phasing out the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Others measured were more narrowly tailored or were overshadowed by other events. They included business tax credits for job creation, various tax cuts for business and a host of technical or small-bore changes including several new sales tax exemptions. Remember the sales tax exemption approved for manufactured homes? Or the one on the sale of oil and fat converted to motor fuel? Or the exemption for printers? We didn’t think so. The income tax cuts alone account for about $750 million in estimated relief, and property tax relief another $500 million. The Walker figures do not include changes in withholding rates that will make sure tax cuts show up in paychecks rather than requiring people to seek refunds to see the benefit. How relieving is all this tax relief? State and local taxes totaled $27.4 billion in 2013. A year’s worth of the four-year relief Walker is talking is about $500 million. So, the relief amounts to about 2 percent of total taxes, says Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Individual results would vary, of course. Finally, Walker administration officials argued that Walker would have been justified in using $2.5 billion as his tax-relief figure. He kept in place and funded several phased-in tax-cut measures put in place during his predecessor Jim Doyle’s last term, spokesman Tom Evenson noted. We’ll confine our ruling here, though, to the $2 billion claim. Our rating Walker declared that once his latest tax-cut plan is signed, ""we will have delivered $2 billion in much-needed tax relief for the people of Wisconsin."" Some of this is best guesswork, but estimates from multiple sources -- including the nonpartisan office used by the Legislature -- confirm the figure is right around that number. We rate Walker’s statement True. Note: This item was changed after publication. It originally said the Fiscal Bureau's estimate included the effect of changes to the Earned Income and Homestead tax credits.",/factchecks/2014/mar/12/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-has-generated-2-billion-t/

In ‘Between Two Ferns’ interview, Barack Obama says ‘most young Americans’ are not covered by health insurance
","The appearance by President Barack Obama on comedian Zach Galifianakis’ faux-interview show Between Two Ferns set social media ablaze. Galifianakis’ deadpan spoof of a cable-access TV interview show had already become a magnet for Web surfers, and especially for younger Americans -- the demographic that Obama has been trying to convince to purchase insurance at the healthcare.gov website. Just hours after the presidential ""interview"" went live on FunnyorDie.com, the humor site became ""the #1 source of referrals to HealthCare.gov ,"" according to a triumphal tweet by White House health care spokeswoman Tara McGuinness on March 11, 2014. Like many Americans, we watched the video and thought it was pretty funny. Most of the exchanges between Obama and Galifianakis were clearly intended to be jokes -- nothing checkable there. But we did find one snippet to put to the Truth-O-Meter -- when Obama said that ""most young Americans"" are not covered by health insurance. It came during the meat of Obama’s pitch for young Americans to get covered, and it struck us as wrong. Here’s the exchange: Galifianakis: ""So do you go to any websites that are .com’s or .net’s, or do you mainly just stick with .gov’s?"" Obama: ""No, actually we go to .gov’s. Have you heard of healthcare.gov?"" Galifianakis: ""Here we go. (Sigh) Okay, let’s get this out of the way. What did you come here to plug?"" Obama: ""Well, first of all I think it’s fair to say that I wouldn’t be with you here today if I didn’t have something to plug. Have you heard of the Affordable Care Act?"" Galifianakis: ""Oh yeah, I heard about that, that’s the thing that doesn’t work. Why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website?"" Obama: ""Healthcare.gov works great now, and millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans. And what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable health care. And most young Americans right now, they’re not covered. And the truth is that they can get coverage all for what it costs to pay your cell phone bill."" Galifianakis: ""Is this what they mean by ‘drones’?"" For answers, we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. We found an age breakdown for Americans who were not covered by health insurance at any time in 2012. (That’s the standard yardstick for determining whether someone is ""uninsured.""):   Age range Percentage in age group not covered at any time in 2012 18 to 24 years of age 25.3 percent 25 to 34 years of age 27.4 percent All ages 15.4 percent   So the description Obama offered on Between Two Ferns was way off -- the actual rate of uninsurance among both groups that could be considered ""young"" (but who aren’t children) is only a quarter, not ""most."" These percentages are very similar to those found in the most recently released Gallup poll -- 23 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds are uninsured, and a little less than 27 percent of those are age 26 to 34. (The White House did not offer any additional data when we asked.) What Obama said is ""absolutely inaccurate,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Wilensky said young people are statistically more likely to be uninsured than either children or middle-aged Americans are -- something we explored in this fact check -- but she added that most are, in fact, insured. Our ruling Obama said, ""Most young Americans right now, they’re not covered"" by health insurance. That’s wrong -- only about a quarter of Americans between 18 and 24 and between 25 and 34 are considered uninsured.

Charlie Crist says Florida's economic turnaround started at the end of his term as governor
","The Republican Party has tried to boil down the comparison between Florida Gov. Rick Scott and his rival, former Gov. Charlie Crist, with four words: ""Crist crash, Scott surge."" Crist -- a Republican-turned-independent while serving as governor from January 2007 to January 2011, was indeed in office during the economic downturn. His successor, Scott, has been in office during the recovery. Crist, now a Democrat, wants his old job back -- and he argues that the economic recovery actually started on his watch, not Scott’s. He made that argument in a March 9, 2014, interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley: Crowley: ""Can I get you in a yes or no to get you to tell me whether you think the economy is better than it was when the governor (Scott) took office?"" Crist: ""I think it is, yes. You can. And I'm always comfortable telling the truth but that turnaround started at the end of my term. And one of the reasons is I accepted the stimulus money, saved thousands of teachers’ jobs, law enforcement officers, firefighters, (is that) it was the right thing to do. … President Obama said, I want to help you, and I said yes as a Republican to a Democratic president. Not because it was political, but because it was right."" We have previously fact-checked Crist’s claims about the stimulus. But PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter revs up when we hear candidates make a point of saying they’re ""telling the truth."" Here we will fact-check Crist’s claim that the economic turnaround started at the end of his term. The economy at the end of Crist’s tenure On CNN, Crist didn’t give a specific time period for the end of his term, but we focused on data during his final year in office -- 2010. (He officially left office in January 2011.) We contrasted that with Scott’s first year in office -- 2011. Here are some statistics that will shed light on the Florida economy during that period. The unemployment rate: In January 2010, the unemployment rate in Florida was 11.4 percent. During that year, it started to improve gradually, and by January 2011 it had dropped to 10.9 percent. Then, in 2011 under Scott, the unemployment rate continued to improve, dropping below double digits in October. By December, the unemployment rate was 9.5 percent, a drop of 1.4 percentage points. This measure provides Crist with some modest support: The unemployment rate did decrease in his final year -- though a decrease of 0.5 points is pretty small. Per capita real GDP: Per capita real GDP measures the inflation-adjusted economic activity per person in Florida. In 2009-2010, per capita real GDP dropped by 0.74 percent. In 2010-11, it continued to drop but by less: 0.23 percent, before climbing in 2011-12 to 1.05. By this measure, Crist is wrong because per capita real GDP continued to drop during his tenure, even though it was a smaller drop than earlier in the recession. Former state Sen. Steve Geller, an informal adviser to Crist’s campaign, told PolitiFact Florida in an email that per capita GDP had ""turned around"" because the decline had slowed down near the end of his term. However, we'll note that even though the decreases in GDP were smaller near the end of Crist's term, GDP was still shrinking -- not what we'd consider a turnaround. Per capita personal income: Per capita personal income refers to how much income was earned per person in the state. In 2009-2010, per capita personal income grew by 3.09 percent -- a turnaround compared to drops the two previous years. It continued to grow in 2011, by 3.64 percent. This measure gives Crist support, since per capita income growth turned from negative to positive during 2009-10. Payroll employment per month: By this measure, employment rose from about 7,143,900 jobs in January 2010 to 7,230,300 in January 2011. That’s a 1.20 percent increase -- but it came during a period when population in the state grew by 1.25 percent. Since employment growth did not keep pace with population growth, this is not a very strong piece of evidence for Crist. Industrial production: Industrial production is an index that measures the value of manufacturing output, compared to a ""base"" rate of 100. Under Crist, industrial production rose from 89.94 in January 2010 to 94.29 in January 2011. This measure is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for Crist’s claim. Economists we interviewed noted several caveats about the data: the GDP and personal income data starts mid-year, and personal income includes components such as dividends, which relate to the broader financial markets rather than state policies. Proprietary quarterly estimates by Moody’s also show mixed evidence for Crist’s argument. They show that real income per capita bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2009 and rose throughout 2010. That’s good for Crist’s argument. By contrast, real GDP per capita, on the other hand, did not begin to recover by the end of Crist’s term. Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s, said the evidence gives Crist a leg to stand on. ""Taking the preponderance of data into consideration, I would agree with Crist’s claim that the economy started to recover while he was in office,"" Lafakis told PolitiFact Florida. But Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida, said Florida’s economy in 2010 showed ""a very weak pulse. The recovery strengthened slightly in 2011, but we were still limping forward."" How much credit does Crist deserve? Another concern with Crist’s claim is whether he has a basis for crediting his own policies for a turnaround. Several economists told us that it is difficult to pinpoint much blame or credit on a governor for shifts in the state’s economy that were reflected in the national economy. While the national recovery officially started in June 2009, they said, Florida's recovery did not begin until some time in 2010, and the initial recovery was slow. ""If he is taking credit for the recovery, does he also bear responsibility for the recession? I am not sure you can simultaneously take credit for the good things and eschew any responsibility for the bad,"" Snaith said. ""The reality is that Florida's economic performance is a joint function of global and national factors influenced by national and state economic policies. It is difficult to try and deconstruct and then quantify what role each of these factors played in Florida's economy.  But I don't suppose that will stop politicians from trying to do so."" The timing of Florida’s recovery had a lot to do with the national recovery as well as a comeback in certain sectors such as tourism, said David Denslow, an economist with the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. However, Denslow did offer Crist ""some credit, most importantly for trying to hold the line on government jobs, and accepting federal stimulus funds,"" Denslow said. While Crist’s decision to accept stimulus funds during the worst part of the recession mitigated the damage, ""Scott’s decision to cancel the high-speed rail line from Tampa to Orlando cost the state thousands of jobs,"" Lafakis said. Mark Vitner, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said though the unemployment rate began to fall under Crist, ""it was still extremely high, the recession began on his watch, and Florida’s economy hit rock bottom on his watch."" It takes a while to start moving a big state such as Florida in a different direction, Geller said. ""There is nothing magical about the inauguration date,"" Geller told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""Things that Charlie started continued to happen through the end of 2011.  I believe that Charlie should get at least part of the credit for the 2011-2012 increase."" Though much of the state’s economy is based on national trends, there are a few things governors can do to help the economy -- as Crist did by accepting the stimulus funds, Geller said. Likewise there are other factors a governor can’t control such as the oil spill in April 2010. Our ruling Crist said that the economic ""turnaround started at the end of my term."" During Crist’s last year in office, Florida’s economy experienced notable gains in personal income and industrial production, and more marginal improvements in the unemployment rate and in payroll employment. But GDP didn’t grow again until Scott took office. Economists say Crist deserves some credit for the economic turnaround because he accepted federal stimulus dollars, but they add that any state is inevitably buffeted by national and international trends far beyond their control. On balance, the evidence for an economic turnaround on Crist’s watch -- and for a significant role by him in a turnaround -- are mixed. So we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/mar/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-economic-turnaround-started-end/
"['Abortion', 'PunditFact', 'Ralph Reed']","
Ralph Reed: Millennials more pro-life than boomers or seniors
","In 1980, America greeted the Post-It note, the Rubik’s Cube, and the launch of CNN. Demographers and marketers also labeled it as the first year of the millennial generation, a group that today makes up about a quarter of the adult population. Both political parties have a keen desire to tap into this generation's political and social leanings. During a quick back-and-forth on NBC's Meet the Press, Ralph Reed, conservative activist and chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said millennials are hard to characterize. They are  ""more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans,"" Reed said. Political columnist Ron Fournier with National Journal quickly disagreed. ""Actually, that's not true. They're as pro-life,"" Fournier said. Enter PunditFact to see what the survey data and the people who study it have to say. We’re checking Reed’s claim, that millennials are ""more pro-life than baby boomers and older Americans."" The staff at the Faith and Freedom Coalition told us that the source behind Reed’s words is a 2010 survey commissioned by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization opposed to abortion, and conducted by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. The results showed that 58 percent of millennials felt that abortion is morally wrong, compared to 51 percent of boomers and 62 percent of seniors. Right off the bat, we can say that Reed missed the mark. From the numbers in the study itself, seniors are slightly more opposed to abortion than millennials. Reed’s words track better with his comparison to the baby boomers. However, Mary Griffith with the Marist Institute noted that asking someone whether abortion is morally acceptable or wrong is very different from asking if they consider themselves pro-life or pro-choice. ""It’s almost comparing apples to oranges,"" Griffith said. ""You get very different results."" When Marist asked the pro-life/pro-choice question in 2013, millennials were least likely of all age groups to call themselves pro-life: Millennial: 40% Gen-X:  45% Baby boomer:  47% Seniors:  53%   Pollsters define these generations by the year they were born: Millennials - born after 1980; Generation X - 1965-1980; Baby boomers - 1946-1964; Seniors - 1928-1945. Other organizations have also surveyed millennials and one, the Public Religion Research Institute, an academic research group in Washington, noted a paradox around the pro-life/pro-choice labels. ""A significant number of millennials identify with both,"" said Daniel Cox, research director at the institute. ""65 percent of millennials claim the label ‘pro-life,' compared to 74 percent who claim the label ‘pro-choice.’ "" Still, at 65 percent, millennials in that survey were less likely than other groups to identify themselves as pro-life.  Asked if ""pro-life describes you well or somewhat well,"" a higher fraction of baby boomers -- 76 percent -- said yes, as did 72 percent of seniors. Getting away from labels, many pollsters ask whether abortion should be legal in all or most cases. With that approach, the Public Religion Research Institute found millennials are much like the baby boomers, both at about 55 percent, while 43 percent of seniors take that view. These results are similar to the ones from Gallup. In 2010, Gallup reported that millennials, Generation Xers and baby boomers equally supported or opposed abortion, and seniors were least likely of all groups to support it. However, Gallup also noted that over the years, support for abortion has slipped among all age groups. A  study just released by the Pew Research Center found that millennials were slightly more likely than boomers to say that abortion should be legal in all or some cases, but again, the results clustered in the same way: Millennial:  56% Gen X:    59% Baby boomer:  52% Seniors:  42%   If the surveys don’t back up Reed’s statement today, the views of millennials might be headed in a direction he would favor. Melissa Deckman, a political scientist at Washington College, said there is evidence that if you ask millennials how they feel about abortion under specific circumstances, some of them show more misgivings about the procedure. Especially among Republican millennial women, support drops a bit when specific factors are part of the survey questions, such as the discovery of a serious birth defect in the fetus or the financial ability of the household to pay for a new child. ""They are trending slightly pro-life if you consider a wider range of restrictions to abortion,"" said Decker. Our ruling Reed said that millennial voters are more likely to be pro-life than baby boomers or seniors. Reed relied on a survey that asked about the morality of abortion. The institute behind that survey told us results were considerably different on the question of pro-life/pro-choice. Based on the latest results, millennials were least likely of all age groups to call themselves pro-life. Across multiple surveys, there is no evidence that millennials are more likely to be pro-life than other generations. The general trend is that they are about equally pro-life as Gen-Xers and baby boomers, and consistently are less pro-life than seniors. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/mar/11/ralph-reed/ralph-reed-millennials-more-pro-life-boomers-or-se/
