Pro-Bachmann group says Rick Perry is spending more money than Texas government takes in, covering deficits with record borrowing
","
A group backing U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for president says Gov. Rick Perry leads a state in fiscal dire straits. In an advertisement targeting South Carolina voters, the narrator says: ""This year, Rick Perry is spending more money than the state takes in, covering his deficits with record borrowing.""

Talk about news; is Texas state government in the red?

Some perspective: Texas is a ""pay-as-you-go"" state that, unlike the federal government, cannot borrow money to balance its operating budget. About 45 states have constitutional provisions requiring their budgets to balance, as we noted in a December 2010 fact check. The Texas Constitution says that barring a four-fifths vote of the Legislature, lawmakers may not spend more than the cash and projected revenue that the state comptroller certifies as available for appropriation.

This June, State Comptroller Susan Combs certified the state would have sufficient revenue to fund the 2012-13 state budget that lawmakers sent to Perry, the Austin American-Statesman then reported. Perry signed the budget into law that month.

So how is Texas in the hole?

The Keep Conservatives United super PAC traces its ad claim to an Aug. 23, 2011, Wall Street Journal news article which says the state’s sale that day of $9.8 billion in tax-exempt general obligation tax and revenue anticipation notes, set to mature Aug. 30, 2012, was the largest sale of short-term notes since the state started selling short-term notes in 1987.

""Such notes typically mature within one year,"" the story says, ""and are generally issued by states at the start of their fiscal years to raise cash ahead of incoming tax and revenue receivables for that year.""

The story quotes the Texas state comptroller's office saying the notes mainly would be used to support payments to public schools at the beginning of the school year, but also to avoid a temporary cash shortfall in unrestricted accounts in the state's general-revenue fund and so the state could manage its cash flow spending through  the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2012.

According to the story, the comptroller projected a maximum temporary cash shortfall of $13.2 billion within fiscal 2012 without the note proceeds and other available borrowing. The state said it expects to start fiscal 2012 with a $1.8 billion negative cash balance in the general revenue fund's unrestricted accounts, and to end the 2012 fiscal year with a negative cash balance of $6.7 billion.

Indeed, those figures are in the comptroller’s offering document describing its intended sale of the notes. But there’s more information, too, indicating the state won’t be in the hole once all funds are taken into account.

The offering document says the notes ""currently projects that the maximum temporary cash shortfall within fiscal year 2012 will be $13.2 billion before application of note proceeds and other available interfund and intrafund borrowing."" And, the document says, while the Legislature approved a balanced budget, the state ""expects to begin fiscal year 2012 on Sept. 1, 2011, with a negative cash balance in the unrestricted accounts in the General Revenue Fund of $1.8 billion. The General Revenue Fund is expected to end fiscal year 2012 with a negative cash balance of $6.7 billion in the unrestricted accounts.""

Later, the document says the state’s general revenue kitty has ""historically been subject to a temporary cash shortfall during each fiscal year because taxes and other revenues are received more slowly than expenditures are paid through the first eight months of the fiscal year."" Hence, the document says, the need for the short-term notes.

So, the state made a record sale of short-term notes and predicted a cash shortfall during the fiscal year, which ends Aug. 31, 2012.

Is that the same as running a budget deficit?

We asked Combs, Billy Hamilton, the state’s former deputy comptroller, and Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, for their views.

Combs’ spokesman R.J. DeSilva replied by email that annual sales of Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes aren’t designed to cover deficits. Instead, he said, they help the state maintain cash-flow. Looking ahead, he said, if there’s insufficient revenue to fulfill state obligations at the end of this fiscal year, the gap will be handled in the next year’s sale of notes.

Hamilton told us it’s been state practice since the late 1980s to sell the short-term notes to smooth out payments — such as those to school districts — over months that state tax revenue isn’t accumulating fast enough to immediately cover expenses.

Craymer, previously a budget adviser to two governors, said by email that the pro-Bachmann group’s claim, based on the comptroller's projection of revenues and spending for the year ending Aug. 31, 2012, overlooks the reality that Texas legislators approve two-year budgets — and the latest budget balances through August 2013.

August 2012, then, is the ""mid-point of our budget, not the end point,"" Craymer said. ""It's kind of like criticizing someone who gets paid at the end of each month because they spend more than they take in during the first half of the month.""

Craymer added that the tax-anticipation notes sold by the state are ""commonly used by states and other government entities to cover spending and revenue timing gaps within the budget. They are short-term notes paid off before the end of each fiscal year, and cannot be used to finance any deficit (in Texas or any other state).""

Craymer said in an interview: ""Washington has real debt. The states have to balance their budgets. There’s no logical connection between short-term cash borrowing and a (budget) defict. That’s a stretch.""

Our ruling is that while the state undertook record short-term borrowing, the state is not in the red by any stretch of that characterization. The two-year budget adopted by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry was required to balance--and there’s no indication that it no longer does. The ad’s statement--casting the sale of short-term notes as covering Perry’s deficits--misrepresents a routine annual sale.

This is worse than incorrect. It’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2DF780>],/factchecks/2011/sep/25/keep-conservatives-united/pro-bachmann-group-says-rick-perry-spending-more-m/

Gov. Chris Christie says Jersey Shore water quality is ‘perfect’
","
There’s a strip of coastline in the United States where the quality of the water is better than good, according to the governor.

""The water quality in the ocean is perfect,"" Gov. Chris Christie said during a Sept. 2 press conference at Point Pleasant Beach, days after Hurricane Irene blasted through. ""It’s been tested up and down every ocean shore in New Jersey.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that while test results show the water is the best it’s been in years, some environmental experts disagree with Christie’s assessment.

First, let’s look at how New Jersey reviews water quality.

The state Department of Environmental Protection, in collaboration with local health departments, tests the water from Sandy Hook to Cape May each week from mid-May to mid-September, according to department spokesman Larry Ragonese.

Water samples from swimming areas are tested for fecal coliform and other types of bacteria connected with sewage, stormwater runoff, and other pollutants, he said.

The results, Ragonese said, have come back clean consistently since at least 2006, ranking Jersey shore waters above the 99th percentile of cleanliness on a scale of 100 percent.

""There’s really been a concerted effort to really, really stress the importance of clean beaches,"" Ragonese said.

In fact, New Jersey ranked second in the nation, behind New Hampshire, for ocean water quality in 2010, according to a June report by the National Resources Defense Council.

The weekly tests check the levels of enterococcus, a bacteria normally found in the feces of people and many animals. Any level above 104 enterococci per 100 milliliters of sample is considered too high, according to state standards.

PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed test results for beaches in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties dating to 2005. We found that in most cases, water quality results have been their best since 2008, with the level of enterococci well below the state’s threshold.

If a test sample exceeds acceptable bacteria levels twice, the beach is closed until the bacteria level falls into normal range, Ragonese said. Jill Lipoti, director of the Division of Water Monitoring and Standards for the DEP, said three beaches were closed all along the shore this summer.

Still, three environmental groups challenged Christie’s claim of ""perfect"" water quality.

Trenton-based Environment New Jersey pointed to low oxygen levels in the ocean and questioned the health of the water for marine life. Pollution in Barnegat Bay and beach closures due to pollution also are a concern, said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey.

""I think the governor does a disservice to citizens in the state when he makes statements like that,"" Jaborska said. ""There are lots of issues with the ocean.""

Larry Levine, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York City, also said the Jersey shore’s water quality is not perfect.

""Every coastal state has some degree of issues with water pollution at beaches,"" in part due to stormwater runoff from urban and suburban areas where raw sewage and overflow can combine in the same pipe en route to a sewage treatment plant, Levine explained. When heavy rains are more than the treatment plants can handle, an untreated mixture of sewage and runoff can be released into waterways that lead to the coast.

""That’s an issue nationwide, not just in New Jersey,"" Levine said.

Clean Ocean Action of Monmouth County also wouldn’t qualify the water as perfect, but credited New Jersey for taking steps toward improvement.

""The ocean’s much better off than it has been in a decade and while some individual pollutants may still be low, we have taken in this state with the Legislature and the governor’s office many impressive first steps that are long overdue,"" said Sean Dixon, coastal policy attorney for Clean Ocean Action. ""There’s always more to be done.""

Our ruling

Encouraging people to return to the Jersey shore, Christie claimed the water quality is ""perfect,"" and that frequent test results have been favorable up and down the coast.

While test results show that the shore’s waters are better than in past years, some environmental organizations disagree with the governor’s assessment.

We rate this claim Mostly True.

R.I. public employee unions say changes to state's pension system have saved half a billion dollars
","
A coalition of Rhode Island’s public employees unions waging a campaign to protect its members’ pension benefits recently posted a YouTube video ""tutorial’’ entitled  ""The Rhode Island Pension Problem And Why You Need To Fight For Your Pension Now.""

Among the more provocative takeaways of the 10-minute video is the claim that over the past six years, changes to the state’s pension plan ""have saved over half a billion dollars.""

The video’s message -- that state employees have already given up over a half-billion dollars in benefits and are now being asked to give up a lot more -- is likely to make anyone with a state pension want to grab a picket sign and head for the State House rotunda.

So we wanted to know: have changes to the state pension system already ""saved"" the state $500 million?

First, some background. The cost to Rhode Island taxpayers of funding the state-run pensions for public employees has more than doubled during the last seven years, and actuaries say it could double again by 2013.

The state hasn’t set aside enough money to pay for those pensions. The current shortfall -- or ""unfunded liability"" -- is estimated at more than $7 billion. Taxpayers face another $2 billion shortfall for municipal pension plans not run by the state.

State General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, who has been leading the effort to address the problem, and Governor Chafee are expected to present a plan to the General Assembly, which is expected to reconvene to deal with the matter in October.

In the video, a ""teacher"" (played by Providence actress Kate Lohman) scribbles her pension lesson on a giant white board. (Is it just a coincidence, we wondered, that Lohman’s short, dark hair and tailored blouse give her a passing resemblance to Raimondo?)

The video was produced by consultant Brad Dufault for the Rhode Island Retirement Security Coalition, which represents nine public employees’ unions whose members include teachers, police officers, fire fighters, correctional officers, and state and municipal employees.

Posted Sept. 9, the video coincided with the coalition’s launch of a ""fight back"" campaign over the effort to pull the state’s pension system back from the brink of insolvency. Among the solutions being floated for the state pension system -- which covers more than 50,000 employees and retirees -- are freezing cost of living increases and offering new employees a hybrid pension/401(k) plan.

In the video, the actress at the white board makes her case that state employees have already sacrificed for the sake of savings.

""In fact, in the past six years alone,’’ she says, ""changes to the pension formula we told you about earlier have saved over half a billion dollars.’’

Indeed, the General Assembly has rolled back pension benefits three times since 2005. The changes include raising the retirement age, reducing the size of pensions, and trimming cost-of-living allowances, among other things.

But did those changes save $500 million? To check, we started by contacting George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, to find out where the number came from.

He sent us a screen shot from a Sept. 12, 2011, presentation to the state Senate from the actuary and consultant for the state’s pension system, Joseph P. Newton, of Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company.

The screen shot shows a bullet point that reads: ""Total estimated reduction in value as of June 30, 2010: $500 M (State Employees Only.)""

To understand what that means we called Newton.

He explained that the $500 million is an estimate as of June 30, 2010 of the projected savings from changes to the pension plan for state employees over the participants’ lifetime.

In other words, the estimated $500 million savings wouldn’t be realized until every single one of the participants in the plan as of June 30, 2010, along with their beneficiaries, has died.

(The projected savings, in this case, is only for the pension plan that covers state employees, not teachers, judges or municipal employees.)

How much of the $500 million in projected savings has been realized to date? That figure hasn’t been calculated, Newton said. However, he said, it would no doubt be a ""much smaller number.""

The irony is that the same unions which say in the video that their members have been ""giving back"" benefits worth over a half a billion dollars during the last six years also are suing the state to try to recoup some of those lost benefits.  

In their suit, filed last summer in Superior Court, Providence, the unions challenge reductions in pension benefits enacted by the General Assembly in 2009 and 2010, saying the changes are unconstitutional and infringe upon their members’ contractual rights.

If the unions prevail, there’s no telling when, or if, the state would ever realize the half-billion dollars in savings. (The unions won an initial round in their challenge, but it’s far from over.)

In summary, the union video accurately describes changes to the state pension plan which are projected to save the state more than a half-billion dollars over the lifetime of the beneficiaries.

But the claim that the money has been ""saved"" misconstrues a projected savings as an actual savings. In reality, the total savings wouldn’t be realized for decades.

For that reason, we rule the statement as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B34C80>],/factchecks/2011/sep/25/rhode-island-retirement-security-coalition/ri-public-employee-unions-say-changes-states-pensi/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Ron Paul says Rick Perry wrote a letter supporting Hillarycare
","
Standing next to the other Texan seeking the Republican presidential nomination, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Lake Jackson suggested during a Sept. 7, 2011, debate that Gov. Rick Perry had flip-flopped on health care. 
""You know, the governor of Texas criticized the governor of Massachusetts for Romneycare, but he wrote a really fancy letter supporting Hillarycare,"" Paul said, referring to two well-known health care overhaul plans that were debated about a dozen years apart. 
""Romneycare"" is a term that critics use to refer to a 2006 Massachusetts health care law signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, who is also currently seeking the Republican presidential nomination. Many Republicans have criticized the law as a government intrusion into the health care system, including through its mandate that residents obtain health coverage. As PolitiFact has noted in previous fact-checks, the Massachusetts law is similar to the act that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. 
For this article, we’re reviewing only whether Perry wrote in support of what critics call ""Hillarycare."" We’re not judging that label. 
Days after entering office in January 1993, President Bill Clinton created a task force to write health care overhaul legislation to bring costs under control and extend coverage to the nation’s uninsured. He selected his wife, Hillary, to lead it. 
In September 1993, President Clinton outlined his plan in a speech to Congress, and two months later, legislation was formally introduced by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine. According to a 1994 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, Clinton’s proposal for universal coverage built on an employer-based health insurance system, requiring individuals to have coverage and employers to provide coverage for their workers and contribute to their premiums. The plan also would have created ""health-purchasing alliances"" in which private insurers and providers would compete for business from people and businesses. 
A September 1993 New York Times news article reported that Americans ""would be guaranteed a generous basic package of coverage, negotiated separately in each state by alliances of consumers with insurance companies and medical groups."" 
During the Sept. 7 debate, Perry did not dispute that he had written a letter to the first lady in 1993 when he was the Texas agriculture commissioner. ""We were hoping that she would be able to come up with something that would not leave (out) the agriculture men and women — because I was the agriculture commissioner at that particular point in time,"" Perry said. ""We had no idea it was going to be the monstrosity that's known as Hillarycare."" 
Perry’s letter — dated April 6, 1993, and posted online Aug. 30, 2011, by the conservative website Daily Caller — was sent on Texas Department of Agriculture stationery. It opens with Perry saying that he thinks Clinton's ""efforts in trying to reform the nation's health care system are most commendable."" He continues: ""I would like to request that the task force give particular consideration to the needs of the nation's farmers, ranchers, agriculture workers, and other members of rural communities. Rural populations have a high proportion of uninsured people, rising health care costs, and often experience lack of services."" 
Perry then details some of the health care delivery problems in rural areas of Texas, including hospital closures and shortages of providers ""within a safe driving distance."" The letter continues: ""I have made economic development for rural Texans a high priority in my Administration. Leadership, education, infrastructure systems, and health care facilities can do much towards aiding a rural community to prosper."" 
In closing, the letter revisits its opening, stating that Perry thinks Clinton's efforts are ""worthy"" and asking that she ""remember this constituency as the task force progresses."" 
The letter was last brandished against Perry in 2005 when U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was considering challenging him in the 2006 Republican gubernatorial primary. In a March 2005 news article, though, the Houston Chronicle described Perry’s letter as falling ""far short of actually being an endorsement"" of the Clinton health care plan. However, the story said, the letter was penned at a time when some commentators were already describing Clinton's idea for a ""government-sponsored HMOs and health care cooperatives as 'socialism.' "" 
The Chronicle article quotes Perry's 2006 campaign manager, Luis Saenz, as saying that when the letter was written, ""I don't know that anybody knew what the final efforts were going to be."" 
In an Aug. 30, 2011, radio interview with Sean Hannity, who also has a Fox News Channel program, Perry said he wrote the letter because he didn't want the Clinton administration ""to overlook a very important constituency."" Perry said he had no idea that the ""end product"" would be ""this monstrosity of a bill."" 
Fair enough? 
Not so fast, said Gary Howard, a spokesman for the Paul campaign, who told us in an email that key aspects of the Clinton health care plan were already known before Perry signed the letter to the first lady. He pointed to a news article published in the Los Angeles Times the day before the date of Perry's letter. 
The April 5, 1993, article says that although many key details of the reform plan remained unsettled, ""the broad outlines"" were emerging. The story included specifics, including that the plan would likely create new ""government-certified regional health insurance purchasing cooperatives"" and impose a requirement that employers provide insurance to their workers. 
We checked to see what Austin American-Statesman readers were learning about the work of the health care task force around the same time. In the second half of March and first week of April 1993, the newspaper published at least 10 news and opinion articles related to the task force or its work, including reports on possible reform ideas and reactions to them. 
On April 3, 1993, the Statesman published a Los Angeles Times story on its front page noting that the Clinton plan was expected to lead to universal health coverage and a guaranteed set of health benefits for all Americans. The article quoted Ira Magaziner, a leader of the Clinton task force, as saying that care would be delivered under a ""managed competition system,"" with residents of a geographic area choosing among several health plans that meet government standards. 
The story also says the Clinton proposal would require businesses to provide health coverage for their employees. Workers could either choose their company's plan or select one offered by ""local buying organizations,"" which the employer would pay for, according to the article. The next day, the Statesman published another Times article; it details three mechanisms that the task force was reportedly considering to impose price controls on health care services. 
Our ruling 
It's correct that Perry sent a letter to Hillary Clinton commending her efforts as the head of the president’s health care task force at a time when the president’s general goals and some possible specifics of the plan had been reported. Yet Perry's letter, dispatched more than five months before the plan was finalized, is clearly a request that the task force consider the interests of rural Americans. 
We rate the statement as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B344C0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/24/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-rick-perry-wrote-letter-supporting-h/
"['Jobs', 'Texas', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney campaign says Texas unemployment doubled under Rick Perry
","
The Sept. 22, 2011, New York Times has Republican hopefuls Rick Perry and Mitt Romney trading jabs on their states’ unemployment histories with a Romney spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, saying Perry's ""own state’s unemployment rate has doubled on his watch.""

By three measures, this Romney charge is on the mark. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas’ unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in December 2000, the month Perry became governor. It was 8.4 percent in July 2011 and 8.5 percent a month later. That August rate was the highest Texas rate since November 1986, when Texas hit its worst unemployment rate: 9.3 percent.

Texas’ workforce also has increased steadily in recent decades; the state had 1.8 million more workers as of 2011 than it did in 2000. From another vantage point, some 434,000 workers were unemployed in 2000, 1.04 million in August 2011. That is, there was a 17.5 percent increase in the workforce in the decade-plus, but a 138.6 percent increase in the raw number of people without jobs.

But Texas unemployment didn’t steadily increase in Perry’s first 10 years as governor. Based on the bureau’s figures, the state’s jobless rate from late 2000 through August 2011 hit lows in 2000-01 and again in 2007, before rapidly climbing through 2009. (Click here to view a chart of Texas’ jobless rate using bureau numbers from 2000 to 2011.)

There was a big increase in national unemployment rates after 2007, too, as the economy worsened. A fall 2010 Dallas Federal Reserve Bank analysis said that Texas’ unemployment tracked the U.S. rate closely beginning in January 2007, though the state’s rate was lower by an average of 1 percentage point.

Does that mean Perry drove, or substantially influenced, the Texas changes?

We checked a similar statement last year. Examining a political action committee's claim that Perry ""had overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years,"" we said the 22-year claim was accurate, but Perry wasn’t personally to blame: Half True.

Generally, experts agreed, governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place during their terms. Paul Brace, a political science professor at Rice University, said: ""Overall unemployment wasn't (Perry's) fault, but our relatively good performance also has little to do with what he did.""

That made sense then — and it does now.

Texas unemployment, lately at its highest level in more than two decades, doubled while Perry was governor, as Romney says. But it’s wrong to conclude this was Perry’s fault, as the Romney camp does in saying ""on his watch.""

We rate the statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280F3E6FDC0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-spokesperson-says-texas-unemployment-d/

Rick Perry says Mitt Romney shifted stance when he deleted health care line from his book
","
Seems Rick Perry and Mitt Romney have each sold a few more books lately — to each other's campaigns.

Romney used Perry's comments about Social Security in Fed Up!, the Texas governor's screed against federal expansionism, to portray Perry as a foe of the popular retirement program. Then, at the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Perry struck back by suggesting that Romney had altered the paperback edition of his book No Apology to downplay his support of the Massachusetts health care plan.

PERRY: ""Speaking of books and talking about being able to have things in your books, back and forth, your economic adviser talked about Romneycare and how that was an absolute bust. And it was exactly what Obamacare was all about.

""As a matter of fact, between books, your hard copy book, you said it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them as you had in Massachusetts. Then in your paperback, you took that line out. So, speaking of not getting it straight in your book sir, that would be a ...""

ROMNEY: ""Gov. Perry, we were talking about Social Security, but if you want to talk about health care, I'm happy to do that.""

FOX HOST BRET BAIER: ""We are going to have a round on that.""

ROMNEY: ""I actually wrote my book, and in my book I said no such thing. What I said, actually -- when I put my health care plan together -- and I met with Dan Balz, for instance, of the Washington Post. He said, 'Is this is a plan that if you were president you would put on the whole nation, have a whole nation adopt it?' ""

""I said, 'Absolutely not.' I said, 'This is a state plan for a state, it is not a national plan.' 

""And it's fine for you to retreat from your own words in your own book, but please don't try and make me retreat from the words that I wrote in my book. I stand by what I wrote. I believe in what I did. And I believe that the people of this country can read my book and see exactly what it is.""

We wondered: Had Romney really touted Massachusetts-style health care for all — then deleted it?

We got copies of the paperback and hardcover editions. 

Romney's changes to the book have been explored before, by Boston political journalist David S. Bernstein. He noted in February that Romney had added harsher language on the national health care law as passed: ""Obamacare will not work and should be repealed,"" and, ""Obamacare is an unconstitutional federal incursion into the rights of states."" 
Romney more clearly explained ways that he disagreed with implementation of the Massachusetts law.

He also changed this line, which came after a paragraph touting the success of the Massachusetts health plan:

HARDCOVER: ""We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care.""

To:

PAPERBACK: ""And it was done without government taking over health care.""

Why make the change? Well, Romney was in quite a spot. His hardcover was written when the national health care policy supported by President Barack Obama included a public insurance option. So his Massachusetts plan, by comparison, kept ""private insurance and personal choice intact,"" he wrote. 
Then the Democratic plan passed, without the public option. And it looked uncomfortably close to Romney's plan. As PolitiFact's Angie Drobnic Holan has written, both leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They seek to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering tax breaks to help moderate income people buy insurance. People are required to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the ""individual mandate."" And companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases.

Suddenly, the line in the hardcover edition to ""accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country"" as Republican Romney had done for Massachusetts was pretty close to what the Democratic president had done nationally. 

So Perry was right that there was some strategic editing. 

But a closer look at Romney's original hardcover shows Perry was distorting what Romney wrote when he told the former Massachusetts governor, ""Between books, your hard copy book, you said it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them as you had in Massachusetts. Then in your paperback, you took that line out.""

Here's the quote with full context from Page 177 of the hardcover: 

""My own preference would be to let each state fashion its own program to meet the distinct needs of its citizens. States could follow the Massachusetts model of they choose, or they could develop plans of their own. These plans, tested in the state 'laboratories of democracy' could be evaluated, compared, improved upon, and adopted by others. But the creation of a national plan is the direction in which Washington is currently moving. If a national approach is ultimately adopted, we should permit individuals to purchase insurance from companies in other states in order to expand choice and competition.

""What we accomplished surprised us: 440,000 people who previously had no health insurance became insured, many paying their own way. We made it possible for each newly insured person to have better care, and ultimately healthier and longer lives. From now on, no one in Massachusetts has to worry about losing his or her health insurance if there is a job change or a loss in income; everyone is insured and pays only what he or she can afford. It's portable, affordable health insurance — something people have been talking about for decades. We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care.""

So Romney's not really saying ""it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them."" He's in fact presenting a defense of state-level choice — not a pitch for a mandatory national approach. It's like a shout-out to other state leaders: Hey, you can have what Massachusetts has!

And it's consistent with what Romney fired back at Perry in the Sept. 22 debate: ""This is a state plan for a state, it is not a national plan.""

Our ruling

Perry's right that Romney's comments about health care were edited between editions. Among other things, a line that advocated the Massachusetts model as a strong option for other states was replaced by a shorter, more generic sentence. But Perry exaggerates by making it sound as though Romney had advocated his state's plan as national health care policy -- a potentially damaging position in a Republican primary. That's not what Romney wrote. We rule Perry's claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097039240>],/factchecks/2011/sep/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-mitt-romney-deleted-health-care-li/

In the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Gov. Rick Perry again defended his foiled 2007 attempt to require Texas girls to be vaccinated against a virus that can cause cervical cancer.

Perry, responding to U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann’s charge that his Feb. 2, 2007, order intended to mandate the shots for human papillomavirus, or HPV, was an inappropriate result of lobbying by his former chief of staff, said: ""I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage 4 cervical cancer. I spent a lot of time with her. She came by my office, talked to me about this program.""

Did a cancer patient urge Perry to issue the order later nulled by Texas legislators?

Nearly three weeks after Perry issued the order, it was widely reported that a Houston woman with late-stage cervical cancer had visited with him. As reported in the Feb. 20, 2007, Austin American-Statesman, Heather Burcham of Houston spoke to reporters summoned by Perry as numerous legislators were indicating they would try to cancel the order.

Burcham said then: ""The vaccine has done its job if it saves one person from cancer, let alone knocks out cervical cancer altogether."" She also signed up to testify at a Texas House hearing, the Statesman reported, but left before she was called to speak. Earlier in the day, she said she wanted to spend the time she had left sharing her story: ""It's my wildest dream come true that I get to maybe reach one person, that my life would not be in vain, that I have lived for a purpose and that I won't die and never have done anything,"" she said.

Fast forward.

Shortly after the Sept. 22 debate, ABC News said Perry did not meet Burcham until after he’d issued his order. Its news article says Perry ""met Burcham while she was lobbying the Texas legislature to uphold the governor’s executive order. The Legislature ultimately ruled against Burcham and Perry and did away with the vaccine mandate.""

The network, crediting a recent report by Houston’s KTRK-TV, said Perry and Burcham ""struck up a friendship despite the Texas Legislature revoking the governor’s mandate. Perry invited Burcham to a ranch, rode motorcycles with her and even sat at her bed during her final days. Burcham died in July 2007."" A pre-debate ABC News post, dated Sept. 15, 2011, specifies that Perry and Burcham struck up the friendship after he issued the order.

According to a Sept. 23, 2011, Houston Chronicle blog post, Perry spokesman Mark Miner confirmed that Burcham met Perry when she began lobbying the lawmakers to uphold his order. The post quotes Miner saying: ""It was a very inspirational passionate story that he heard from her and he met with her away from the cameras and really built up a relationship with this young girl. Yes, he had (already) signed it, but it was still going through the legislative process. It had a heavy impact on him.""

As noted Sept. 17, 2011, by Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist Bud Kennedy, Perry’s YouTube posts include a video of Burcham, in a hospital bed, shown at a May 2007 Perry press conference. Seated in a bed, Burcham says: ""I want to change as many people’s lives as I can because I know there is nothing I can do for my own life, but there is something that I can do for others ... It is so important that parents get their children this vaccination.""

Finally, we interviewed Houston developer Craig Wilson, who said Burcham lived with his family off and on for about a decade before she died. Wilson said he doesn’t recall the exact date that Burcham met Perry, though they developed a relationship when she was urging legislators not to unplug the order. ""He did everything he could to make her life better,"" Wilson said, ultimately spending three hours at her bedside before she died and later delivering a eulogy. ""This shows his character as a human being.""

Our ruling: Perry had an ally in Heather Burcham in 2007, but only after he issued his order. In the debate, in contrast, Perry brought up Burcham’s heartfelt advocacy while not speaking to criticism he had been lobbied into the order by a former aide representing a drug company. His statement misled by creating the impression Burcham swayed him to proceed with the executive order. In reality, by all accounts, that just didn’t happen.

Rick Perry says he never backed moving Social Security back to the states
","
During the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News/Google Republican presidential debate in Orlando, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney continued to spar over Social Security.

The future of Social Security has turned into a key point of difference between the two candidates. Romney used a new line of attack that Perry wants to send Social Security back to the states, and Perry contended that wasn't true.

Romney clearly stated his claim in an op-ed posted on the Fox News website a few hours before the Orlando debate. He said Perry ""agrees with me that Social Security’s financing is in trouble, but from that point forward we sharply diverge. Instead of repairing the program as I aim to do, he wants to dismantle it.""

At the Orlando debate, Megyn Kelly of Fox News followed this line of inquiry. ""Gov. Romney has been hammering you on your idea of turning Social Security back to the states, repeatedly,"" she said. ""Can you explain specifically how 50 separate Social Security systems are supposed to work?""

Perry answered, ""Well, let me just say first, for those people that are on Social Security today, for those people that are approaching Social Security, they don't have anything in the world to worry about. We have made a solemn oath to the people of this country that that Social Security program in place today will be there for them.""

He continued, ""Now, it's not the first time that Mitt has been wrong on some issues before. And the bottom line is, is we never said that we were going to move this back to the states. What we said was, we ought to have as one of the options the state employees and the state retirees, they being able to go off of the current system, on to one that the states would operate themselves. As a matter of fact, in Massachusetts, his home state, almost 96 percent of the people who are on that program, retirees and state people, are off of the Social Security program. So having that option out there to have the states -- Louisiana does it, almost every state has their state employees and the retirees that are options to go off of Social Security. That makes sense. It's an option that we should have.""

Kelly asked Romney if he wanted to respond, and Romney said, ""Well, it's different than what the governor put in his book just, what, six months, and what you said in your interviews following the book. So I don't know. There's a Rick Perry out there that is saying -- and almost to quote, it says that the federal government shouldn't be in the pension business, that it's unconstitutional. Unconstitutional and it should be returned to the states. So you better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that.""

This is a lot to digest, so for right now, we’ll keep our fact check limited to this question: Is Perry justified in saying, ""We never said that we were going to move (Social Security) back to the states""?

What Perry argues in 'Fed Up!'

As we’ve noted in a previous fact-check, Perry’s 2010 book Fed Up! argues that the New Deal was a disastrous policy that expanded the federal government’s reach, curbed individual rights and state prerogatives and set the nation on a path to, as he put it, ""socialism.""

Perry has praised the decision by employees of Galveston, Matagorda and Brazoria counties in Texas to break away from the Social Security program in 1981, two years before the federal government closed off that option.

Under the plan, participants contribute to retirement accounts, supplemented by an amount from their employers, and those funds are invested in annuities through a financial-services company chosen by a county-run bidding process. (For more details on the Galveston program, you can read a fact check we did here.)

On the Nov. 4, 2010, edition of the CNN show Parker/Spitzer, Perry had a spirited conversation about this option with co-hosts Kathleen Parker and Eliot Spitzer:

Perry: Here's what I think would be a very wise thing. In 1981, Matagorda, Brazoria and Galveston counties all opted out of the Social Security program for their employees. Today their program is very, very well funded and there is no question about whether it's going to be funded in the out years, it's there. That's an option out there.

Spitzer: So you want to let people opt out?

Perry: I think -- you know what? Let the states decide if that's what's best for their system?
Spitzer: So the states will opt out of Social Security?

Perry: They should, I think it's a ...

Spitzer: I haven't seen anybody propose that before because that's ...

Perry: We just laid it on the table, let's talk about it.

Spitzer: And so that's your plan?

Perry: No, it's not my plan, Eliot.

Spitzer: Well, I know, Governor, I'm trying to get you ...

Perry: I know, you're trying to get me in a corner, and I don't corner very good. What I'm trying to do is have a discussion with the people of this country on an issue that ...

Parker: I think that's a brand new idea. Nobody has said that.

Perry: ...nobody, nobody is willing to talk about.

Spitzer: No, no, here is the problem that I have -- the tea party, and we have had everybody from Dick Armey to Richard Viguerie -- folks who have been leading this movement, dodging and dancing unable to give a single answer about what they actually support. Having a conversation is to push it someplace else. I want to know if there's an answer, will you raise the retirement age? Are you saying you want to have private accounts, you can say it, we'll disagree, but at least it's an answer.

Perry: Okay, I think all those are legitimate options out there, but let the states decide. Don't force us from Washington, D.C., to say, here is the size of tube socks that you're going to wear down in Texas, put them on.

The following day, on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Perry mentioned the Texas counties again and said, ""I would suggest to you, let's have that conversation. Is that one of the fixes? Get it back to the states. Why is the federal government even in the pension program or the health-care delivery program? Let the states do it. I'll promise you (Gov.) Bobby Jindal over in Louisiana, he'll come up with some great and effective ways and money-saving ways to deliver health care in Louisiana. And governors will look around, they'll go, you know what? That's a good idea. That'll work in our state, and they'll go get it and put it -- put it in their states.""

In both interviews, Perry stopped short of officially advocating a let-the-states-decide approach, hedging with such phrases as ""let's talk about it"" and let’s ""have a discussion."" Still, he spoke favorably of an option that would loosen the federal monopoly on Social Security and empower states to fill the role of Social Security, even going so far as saying, ""Let the states decide.""

It’s worth noting that Perry has softened his position in recent weeks, emphasizing the need to protect the program for retirees or people nearing retirement age.

For instance, during the Sept. 12, 2011, CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa, he said, ""Slam-dunk guaranteed, that program is going to be there in place for those. Those individuals that are moving towards being on Social Security, that program's going to be there for them when they arrive there."" And as we noted, Perry repeated the point in the Orlando debate.

Our ruling

Romney says Perry wants to dismantle Social Security and leave it to the states. Perry says that's not true.

Perry’s not being entirely accurate when he contends that ""we never said that we were going to move (Social Security) back to the states."" He came close to that position when he said, ""Let the states decide"" on Parker/Spitzer and ""Get it back to the states"" on Morning Joe. But in other comments, he hedged, saying it was merely an idea worth discussing.

And while Perry tried, during the Orlando debate, to draw a distinction between a state opt-out system and a mandate that every state have its own Social Security plan, we don’t see it as a major distinction in this context. He claimed to have ""never said that we were going to move (Social Security) back to the states,"" yet allowing every state, or units within a state, to opt out of Social Security empowers states to make their own decisions and ultimately establish their own alternative plans.

Perry brought up the opt-out idea by his own choice on two different television shows. Even if he mostly stopped short of explicitly advocating the let-the-states-decide idea, it’s clear that he was warm to the idea of allowing states to opt out of Social Security. We rate Perry’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1D8780>],/factchecks/2011/sep/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-never-backed-moving-social-secu/

Michele Bachmann says Barack Obama 'has the lowest public approval ratings of any president in modern times'
","Rep. Michele Bachmann says President Barack Obama's approval ratings are historically low -- and sinking even lower.

During the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Bachmann said, ""President Obama has the lowest public approval ratings of any president in modern times. He hasn't gone to the basement yet. It'll be a lot lower than what it is now.""

We can't explore her prediction, but we can examine if Obama has the lowest ratings of any modern president. Are they really worse than those of Richard ""Tricky Dick"" Nixon, Jimmy ""Malaise"" Carter and Lyndon ""Hey, Hey, LBJ, How Many Kids Did You Kill Today"" Johnson?

Not by a long shot.

We looked at presidential approval data from Gallup, which goes back to Harry Truman. It’s the longest continuous data set for presidential approval ratings. We looked at two different measurements: Each president’s lowest approval rating for their entire term, and each president’s lowest point for their first 968 days, which is how long Obama has served in office.

First, the lows for the presidents' entire terms, listed in descending order from the ""highest"" low to the ""lowest"" low:

John F. Kennedy: 56 percent
Dwight Eisenhower: 48 percent
Barack Obama: 40 percent
Bill Clinton: 37 percent
Gerald Ford: 37 percent
Ronald Reagan: 35 percent
Lyndon B. Johnson: 35 percent
George H.W. Bush: 29 percent
Jimmy Carter: 28 percent
George W. Bush: 25 percent
Richard Nixon: 24 percent
Harry Truman: 22 percent

By this measure, nine presidents hit lower lows than Obama has.

What about comparing only the first 968 days for each president? Bachmann’s closer with this one, but still wrong. Here is a list of each president’s low point during that time frame:

John F. Kennedy: 61 percent
Dwight Eisenhower: 57 percent
George H.W. Bush: 53 percent
George W. Bush: 50 percent
Richard Nixon: 48 percent
Lyndon B. Johnson: 46 percent
Barack Obama: 40 percent
Bill Clinton: 37 percent
Gerald Ford: 37 percent
Ronald Reagan: 35 percent
Harry Truman: 33 percent
Jimmy Carter: 28 percent

By this measure, five presidents had lows that were worse than Obama at this point in their presidencies.

Gov. Rick Scott says Panhandle set bed tax record
","
Not long after the April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, Florida's tourism industry faced a crisis: How would it lure tourists amid images of oil slicks and tar balls on beaches?

Under pressure to stem the flow of economic damages, BP started writing checks to tourism agencies for marketing. Now a little more than a year after the explosion, have the marketing dollars led to cha-ching for the Panhandle? 

Speaking on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Sept. 14, 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott claimed that the Panhandle had a record year. 
Host Joe Scarborough, a former member of Congress from Pensacola, started off the conversation:

""I'm going to start with Pensacola, Florida. BP that was a nightmare for the region. Even if oil didn't spill on the Pensacola beaches it scared people away for awhile. A lot of friends of mine that had family businesses for years were ravaged in the middle of a recession. But great news this year for Panhandle and for Florida.""

Scott responded: ""We've got I think the highest bed tax ever in the history of the state in the Panhandle this year. BP came up with ...""

Scarborough interjected: ""Which means tourism, tourism is flooding in...""

Scott: ""This summer it was hard to get a room, restaurants were packed. I sat down with BP and they gave us $30 million to market the Panhandle. We used it well. Tourism has come back. ...''

Did the Panhandle break its record for the highest bed tax ever in the history of the state?
For starters, Scott said ""highest bed tax ever"" and omitted a key word: ""collections."" Having the highest ""rate"" wouldn't be something that a governor brags about if he wanted to lure more tourists to the area. 

Bed taxes refers to the tax tacked onto visitors' hotel bills that help fund activities that promote tourism. In Florida, they can add between 0 and 6 percent to an overnight stay.

BP gave $25 million tourism dollars in 2010 to then Gov. Charlie Crist who dispersed various amounts to counties. The Northwest Florida Tourism Council which represents tourism development organizations in the Panhandle -- Bay, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa and Walton counties -- received $7 million in August 2010. In April 2011 the council got an additional $30 million, according to Craig Savage, BP spokesman.

The BP money allowed tourist development councils to do additional outreach -- for example Visit Pensacola used marketing dollars in more expensive media markets such as Chicago and Washington, said spokeswoman Laura Lee.

To back up the claim, Scott's office pointed us to a Sept. 2, 2011, press release from the Northwest Florida Tourism Council which boasted about summer bed tax collections. ""Summer 2011 has been a season of remarkable recovery for the tourist destinations of Northwest Florida, which are recording all-time highs in bed tax revenue ..."" the press release said. The claim was backed up by the University of West Florida's Office of Economic Development and Engagement, which compiles information on the bed tax for five of the counties -- Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton and Bay. 

University of West Florida researchers found that the counties took in $8.7 million in bed tax revenue in June 2011, more than any other month since December 2008.

But Scott said ""this year,"" not ""June"" or ""this summer."" So we decided to compare 2011 to past years. 

Those figures come from the state's Department of Revenue, which tracks bed tax collections across the state. Using the state's most recent data, which covers January-July 2011, we compared bed tax collections in the seven Panhandle counties to previous years. 

There, too, the Panhandle performed well. 2011 bed tax collections have totaled about $33.9 million through July, compared to about $27.5 million for the same period in 2010. We also checked the numbers against 2006 and 2007 -- before Florida dipped into an economic slump -- and found that the first half of 2011 remained higher.

Some of the increase can be attributed to the fact that most of the counties increased their bed tax rates in recent years. Bay County, for example, raised its bed tax rate from 3 percent to 5 percent in 2009, meaning that if all other factors were equal (room rates, and number of overnight stays), Bay County's bed tax collections would have increased 67 percent. To compensate for rate changes, the University of West Florida created a bed tax collection analysis built around hypothetically holding the bed tax rate constant at 2 percent. The study did not include Franklin and Gulf counties but found that bed tax collections, when normalized, remain highest in 2011, said Phyllis Pooley, associate director of the university's Office of Economic Development and Engagement.

Are there any other ways to measure tourist economy in Panhandle?

Smith Travel Research, a company that tracks supply and demand of hotel rooms for hotels and tourism agencies, collects data on hotel occupancy and the average daily rate for the Panhandle. STR sent us a copy of their data between 2005 and 2011 for the Panhandle but asked that we not publish their full report (which you normally have to pay for). STR's data showed that January through August 2011 was not a record year for the Panhandle. The year to date occupancy rate was 56.4 percent -- a figure that was higher in 2005, 2006 and 2007 ranging between 59.7 percent and 70.6 percent. The average daily rate year for 2011 was $100.16 -- less than it was in 2007 ($103.45) and 2008 ($103.87).

The STR report contains data from hotels in several cities within the Panhandle including Lake City, Panama City, Pensacola, Destin, Tallahassee and Fort Walton Beach.

Occupancy data isn't a perfect measure of tourism expenditures either -- for example during the oil spill some Panhandle hotels had high occupanices filled by clean-up workers or reporters rather than more income-generating tourists. After Hurricane Katrina, many New Orleans residents stayed in Panhandle hotels.

""Occupancy isn’t a record, but we’ve increased inventory,"" said Lee, speaking for Visit Pensacola. ""For example, we’ve gone from 6,500 hotel rooms in 2008 to 7,100 today."" 

We asked Pooley, the University of West Florida researcher, about the different sources of data to measure the tourist economy. She said hotel occupancy rates must be adjusted to take into account new units since if the units increase occupancy rates can decline even with more visitors. Average room rates also don't reflect the number of visitors.

""Bed taxes, adjusted for differing collection rates, are typically the choice of economists because they represent the best proxy for overall industry sales,"" Pooley said in an e-mail. ""Ideally, you would want a study that would adjust for all of the factors -- occupancy, average rates, inflation, number of rental units available of all types, etc. to truly compare visitation from one year to the next.""

Will the record high bed tax collections in the Panhandle continue? That's unlikely once the positive buzz created with the BP marketing dollars fades. 

""We do know that we are going to plateau,'' said Dawn Moliterno, chair of the Northwest Florida Tourism Council. ""We will not see these kind of numbers posted year after year."" 

Our ruling

Scott stated: ""We've got I think the highest bed tax ever in the history of state in the Panhandle this year."" The bed tax collections have set records but that isn't the only measure of how hotels or other businesses dependent on tourists are faring -- the occupancy and average daily rate for hotels have been higher in past years although those sets of data come with their own caveats, too. And those bed tax collections will likely decline after the positive spinoff effects of the BP marketing dollars fade in future years. We rate this claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A8080>],/factchecks/2011/sep/23/rick-scott/gov-scott-says-panhandle-set-bed-tax-record/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
Republican group says Rep. Tammy Baldwin backs $1.5 trillion tax increase
","
When President Barack Obama unveiled a long-term deficit-reduction plan on Sept. 19, 2011, top congressional Republicans dismissed it as a stunt featuring $1.5 trillion in tax increases leaning heavily on the wealthy.

While Obama’s plan has little chance in the GOP-controlled House, it did give Republicans more fodder to rail against Democrats for insisting on tax hikes -- and to tie Democrats to Obama’s sinking poll numbers.

One of the targets was U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for the seat that Sen. Herb Kohl, a fellow Democrat, will vacate after 2012.

The messenger was the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), a campaign arm of the GOP that issued similar news releases going after Democratic Senate candidates in states including Virginia, Florida, Montana, Missouri and New Mexico.

""Today, as Baldwin continues to double down on her support of the failed first stimulus and the rest of his tax-and-spend policies, President Obama proposed the largest tax hike in U.S. history – a $1.5 trillion tax increase on investors and small businesses that he says is needed to pay for their reckless spending agenda...,"" the NRSC news release said.

Here’s the part of the release that caught our eye (italics ours) -- a quote from NRSC spokesman Chris Bond:

""Under the Obama-Baldwin economic record, America has lost 2.4 million jobs, the federal debt has skyrocketed past $14.6 trillion, government spending has grown to record levels, and the response from Obama and Baldwin is to pass a record tax increase on the backs of Wisconsin small businesses,"" the release said.

Did Baldwin, who recently launched her Senate bid, really come out in favor of a $1.5 trillion tax increase?

When we asked Bond for evidence, he pointed to: 
The Jobs Act is separate from Obama’s broader ""Long-Term Deficit Reduction Plan,"" which would raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for the jobs bill and help fund a 10-year drive to reduce federal deficits by some $3 trillion. The president touted the principles of that plan in the same speech where the Jobs Act was unveiled but did not lay out the details until Sept. 19, 2011.

That announcement was what prompted the NRSC release -- and where the timing gets interesting.

Bond said because the Jobs Act and Obama’s long term deficit reduction plan were linked in the initial speech and have somewhat overlapping funding sources, it’s fair to say Baldwin supports the White House’s deficit-reduction plan and the $1.5 trillion in tax increases to pay for it.

""This is one big policy rollout that they are doing,"" Bond said.

Let’s look at the record.

Baldwin indeed praised the Jobs Act -- specifically Obama’s focus on creating construction jobs to erect public infrastructure so America doesn’t ""sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads.""

Baldwin’s press statement the night of the president’s speech on jobs and deficits was both broad (praising his call for ""bold action"") and specific (citing the Jobs Act infrastructure plan). The middle class, Baldwin said, ""is taking it on the chin in both the economic and political environments.""

Her comments came before and after Obama announced tax hikes to pay for the Jobs Act -- but two days before Obama released the specific and much longer list of tax hikes in his Long-Term Deficit Reduction plan. Those are the ones that tally out to $1.5 trillion.

We could not find any public comments by Baldwin in favor of the large package of tax hikes -- the one the NRSC says Baldwin is backing.

We asked Bond if he had evidence that Baldwin was specifically endorsing the tax package.

""I haven’t seen any politician say that,"" he told us. ""She hasn’t done it.""

Baldwin’s campaign confirmed this in an email: ""While Tammy Baldwin applauds the President’s plan to create jobs, she hasn’t taken a position on the (deficit-plan) revenue package and is concerned about some of the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that have been proposed.""

Obama’s deficit plan drew public praise from some liberal Democrats, especially the new minimum tax rate for individuals making more than $1 million a year, the so-called Warren Buffett rule. There was an undercurrent of caution among Democrats, though, with some saying they wanted to see details to ensure Medicare and Medicaid were protected.

Our conclusion

The NRSC contended that Baldwin backed $1.5 trillion in tax hikes in Obama’s 10-year deficit plan.

Republicans certainly have a case that Baldwin prefers what Obama calls a ""balanced"" approach to deficit fighting -- revenue hikes along with spending cuts. She may ultimately side with many of Obama’s ideas, which were sent to the congressional ""super committee"" that is to propose a major debt plan late this year.

But the NRSC itself acknowledges Baldwin has not endorsed Obama’s deficit plan, which is a much broader proposal than the Jobs Act.

Is Atlanta drowning in the nation's highest water bills?
","
t’s no secret to many homeowners in the city of Atlanta that they are floating in high water and sewer bills.

Some say they’re drowning in the money they sink into city coffers.

The issue came up during a recent City Council committee meeting where officials discussed a voter referendum set for February. The referendum would extend a penny-per-dollar sales tax to pay for ongoing work to repair Atlanta’s century-old sewer system, reduce pollution in the Chattahoochee River and improve its water quality.

The sales tax, city watershed management officials say, is projected to bring in about $113 million in 2012. And if voters don’t continue the tax? Officials say they would have to raise monthly water and sewer rates on Atlanta users.

""We can’t do a rate increase,"" Councilman C.T. Martin said.

Particularly since homeowners saw their water bills rise by 12 percent in July, thanks to a series of annual rate increases passed by city leaders in 2008.

The council’s Utilities Committee debated how legislation authorizing the referendum should be crafted at its Sept. 13 meeting. Councilwoman Carla Smith, who said she was running low on patience about the discussion, made a comment about water and sewer bills that might surprise some recent Atlanta homeowners.

""We all know our water bills are the highest in the nation,"" said Smith, former chairwoman of the Utilities Committee. ""Or the second-highest.""

The claim is repeated so often in Atlanta that we thought it’d be worthwhile to check it out.

""We are pretty sure we are first,"" said Janet Ward, a spokeswoman for the city’s Watershed Management Department, focusing on research she’s seen. ""Based on everything I know, we are No. 1.""

Here are some recent surveys we found: 


Atlanta voters have twice passed referendums, by overwhelming margins, for the 1 percent sales tax for the water and sewer improvements.

Water and sewer rates are rising across the country at rates higher than inflation, experts say.

Circle of Blue found the average water bills increased by 9 percent in the past year in the cities it surveyed. Cities say it costs more money to treat water, buy it from wholesale suppliers and pay the workers -- and they are passing those higher costs along to customers, the organization found.

Raftelis’ chief operating officer, Piper Brandt, said water and wastewater rates have each risen by an average of nearly 5 percent in large cities since 1996. Another reason governments are raising costs, Brandt said, is use is down because people are conserving more water and using more efficient appliances. Brandt believes governments had below-market prices and are trying to catch up.

""Utilities have fixed costs and revenue is variable,"" Brandt said.

Based on the research we’ve seen, none of which has been disputed, Atlanta has the highest monthly bills in most categories. When it is not first, Atlanta is typically second.

Atlanta users may not want to toast a glass of H2O to this one, but Smith’s claim appears on target. We rate it as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9CB80>],/factchecks/2011/sep/23/carla-smith/atlanta-drowning-nations-highest-water-bills/

Former Rep. Brent Barton says credit analysts realize that Oregon’s instability 'stems in large part from Oregon's kicker system'
","
Oregon’s ""kicker law"" is often kicked around in political fights over spending and taxes. Republicans, generally, want to leave the refund law alone and force the state to save money by spending less. Democrats, generally, say the kicker is a constitutionally built-in anti-savings mechanism.

For those who don’t know, the kicker is officially called the state’s surplus refund law. It requires a refund to taxpayers if the state collects more money in taxes -- by at least 2 percent -- than economists projected. The idea is to make sure legislators don’t spend every dime they get from taxpayers.

Former state Rep. Brent Barton, a Democrat who represented part of Clackamas County, recently wrote a guest column for The Oregonian in which he urged the state to divert the kicker and use the money to build a savings fund that could boost our credit rating, which in turn would save millions of dollars in lower interest payments.

""The ratings agencies will not upgrade Oregon's credit rating until we stabilize state finances, and they realize that our instability stems in large part from Oregon's kicker system,"" he wrote.

We can’t predict what ratings agencies will or won’t do, and neither can anyone else. Instead, PolitiFact Oregon had a simple question: Do credit ratings analysts actually finger the kicker as responsible for the state’s financial instability?

Steve Buckstein of the Cascade Policy Institute, which promotes limited government, argues that without the kicker, legislators would spend every penny on hand for pay raises and new programs. The pressure not to spend is too great, he said.

On the other hand, the kicker could ""kick"" at awkward times, for example, after drastic funding reductions, as The Oregonian’s Harry Esteve illustrates in this 2009 news story:
  
""At the end of each legislative session, the state economist makes his best guess about how much revenue the state stands to receive over the next two years. He has lots of data to work with, and a complex set of equations, matrices and algorithms. But it's still a guess. 
If he sets a low figure -- which makes sense this year given the current economic conditions -- and then the economy rebounds, the state could end up sending millions of dollars back to taxpayers at the same time it is making deep cuts to services. It happened during the last recession, in 2001, and there are growing fears it could happen again."" 

See the problem?

Let’s turn to the actual reports, to see for ourselves what analysts have said. Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service, and Fitch are the houses that determine our creditworthiness, which in turn determines the interest rate at which we borrow money. For example, they loved that Oregon started a savings fund in 2007 by diverting the corporate kicker that year.

All three agencies consistently cite the state’s narrow reliance on economically sensitive corporate and personal income tax revenues as a negative.

They also dislike Oregon’s active citizen initiative process because it means voters can restrict how much money we collect and how we spend that money. Their big issue is reliability.  

Many times, but not always, the kicker law is singled out as an added concern. A March 7 Moody’s report says the kicker ""adds budgetary challenges, including cash flow pressures.""

Does that mean that a repeal of the kicker would increase our rating? Or that the existence of the kicker means we’re doomed to a lower rating? Kimberly Lyons, the primary analyst for Moody’s for Oregon, wouldn’t go so far. Ability to govern is what they measure and the kicker is not a defacto defect, Lyons said.

""There are other ways to make the structure work for the state. As long as the state is structurally balanced, that’s all we care about."" 
But Gabriel Petek of Standard & Poor’s was more willing to weigh in on the kicker. He said that while Oregon’s reliance on income taxes is the ""main driver"" of the state’s financial volatility, the kicker makes it difficult to build reserves because we can’t reap the benefits of economic upsides to manage for the economic downsides. It’s as if we’ve deliberately hobbled ourselves.

Back to Barton. He checked in with PolitiFact Oregon while traveling. He said he should have stressed that the kicker magnifies Oregon’s fiscal instability rather than causes it.

""I probably should have been more precise in wording that sentence, as the verb ‘stems’ implies causation more than magnification. However, the fact remains that the ratings agencies recognize that the kicker system contributes significantly to Oregon's unstable fiscal system."" 

Finally, we checked in with state Treasurer Ted Wheeler, who manages our money.  He acknowledged that if Oregon had jobs galore and oodles of extra money in the bank, the ratings agencies could upgrade us anyway, without kicker reform. But that’s not the case, he said, and so analysts continue to call out the kicker as a concern.

But doesn’t our financial instability really stem from our unnaturally high reliance on income and corporate taxes?

""The two go hand-in-hand. You can’t really separate them,"" Wheeler said.

""You’ve got the volatility from our reliance on the income tax, which in my mind is the most significant issue. You have all of your eggs in one basket, and the basket we’ve chosen is the volatility basket, and then when you combine the kicker with that, the two really are like the evil twins. They work hand in hand to make it hard for government to plan through a reliable revenue structure.""

So what have we learned? Certainly government could save money without the kicker. But the kicker does exacerbate the volatility of the system that we’ve chosen to pay for public services. And the two analysts we interviewed were understandably wishy washy on how Oregon’s kicker figures into the state’s credit rating.

In a previous PolitiFact, we gave Rep. Matt Wand, R-Troutdale, a Mostly False for saying that previous Legislatures suspended the kicker, spent every dime and failed to stabilize state finances. (We explained that serious context was missing.)

In this PolitiFact, we come to a similar conclusion about Barton’s statement regarding the kicker’s relationship to financial stability. Oregon’s instability stems mainly from our heavy reliance on one revenue stream. The simplest way to counter that may be to divert the kicker. But a bigger difference, the reports suggest, would be made by adding other taxes -- hello, sales? -- to diversify Oregon’s revenue base. (Sorry, we had to say it.)

Florida holds the record for redistricting incumbents together, Will Weatherford says
","
Florida isn’t alone in its push to cut gerrymandering out of the once-in-a-decade process that determines districts for elected officials.

Yet the ""fair districts"" reforms in Florida’s Constitution are unique — more than is widely known. We at PolitiFact Florida realized this while checking out a claim from incoming House Speaker Will Weatherford, who oversaw the House’s redistricting effort.

""It’s the first time in the nation this many members have been drawn into the same districts where it wasn’t a court order,"" Weatherford told the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald on March 27, 2012, speaking of the House map. (The Senate’s maps are a different story.)

""From my understanding, this is the largest amount of incumbents that were pitted against each other based off the Legislature voluntarily doing that in the history in the United States,"" he added. 
His assertion about the Legislature’s unparalleled feat of forcing sitting House members to run against each other resonated with us. What a bold (and specific) claim!

Other states, like California and Arizona, have adopted independent commissions to handle redistricting instead of letting legislators draw the lines. In Florida, that power remains with lawmakers, who redrew the lines for the first time this year under orders from voters not to protect incumbents when crafting districts.

The truth behind his claim is more complicated than we thought it would be. A lot of that has to do with a lack of nationwide data, and the fact that the dust from Florida’s redistricting battle isn’t settled.

Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida political science professor, told us the true test of Florida’s ""fair districts"" experiment will be decided by the courts. 
""Nonetheless, I think the idea behind it was rather path-breaking, definitely,"" she said.

• • •

Weatherford told us he learned about his claim from House redistricting committee staffers and attorneys. ""There are other states that have a committee or a commission that does it for them,"" Weatherford said, ""but as far as the Legislature doing it to themselves, we just couldn’t find anything.""

A little background first: Many states have considered varying approaches to redistricting over widespread concerns of gerrymandering and incumbency protection. Some states, including California and Arizona, adopted special commissions to tackle the process.

Florida went with ""fair districts"" requirements, which keep lawmakers at the wheel but say they can no longer draw federal or state districts to favor a political party or an incumbent, among other things. Voters approved the standards in 2010 over objections from legislators who said the requirements would be impossible to follow.

The new maps sent several members moving across town or modifying political ambitions to avoid matchups with colleagues.

In its mandatory review of the Legislature’s plans, the Florida Supreme Court accepted the House plan and rejected the state Senate’s, saying it failed to adhere to ""fair districts."" The Legislature’s map for congressional districts and its second attempt at a state Senate map await separate judicial reviews beginning this week.

Another point of caution: Just because the House map hasn’t been challenged doesn’t mean it won’t.

• • •

So how many members does the House map affect?

It’s not so easy to nail down. A Times/Herald report pinpointed 35 member vs. member (and in a couple cases, member vs. member vs. member) races. It did not count incumbents facing term limits, since they can’t run again anyway. But the Times/Herald relied on members’ home addresses as listed on voter registration forms, which leaves open the possibility that some members’ primary residences are in their new districts.

Other estimates are higher. The Florida Democratic Party put the count as high as 58 — roughly half the chamber — in a court filing. The Florida House said it found 40 incumbent pairings through various news sources, or one-third of House members.

• • •

We consulted the country’s top redistricting experts, and none knew of a single source that tracks how many legislators had been drawn into the same district for different states after a redistricting cycle.

""It’s a great project for a grad student somewhere,"" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School associate professor who keeps tabs on redistricting efforts at the All About Redistricting website.

As for Florida’s rules, Levitt said, no other state forces the Legislature to draw boundaries with a prohibition on favoring incumbents embedded in its Constitution. Other states have these limits in their statutes, or as nonbinding guidelines, but lawmakers can easily override those, he said.

""Florida is the only one that lets its Legislature draw the lines that also has constitutional constraints against legislators helping themselves,"" he said.

A couple of experts advised us to compare Florida’s results with those in Iowa and California.

Still, they cautioned, we weren’t going to get an apples-to-apples comparison. No one does it quite like Florida, which may give Weatherford’s claim more merit.

In Iowa, the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency designs the maps and presents them to the Legislature for a vote. Lawmakers can approve or reject up to two maps from the agency and are allowed to amend a third map. They’ve never amended a map — ""a restraint that’s rare to find anywhere in elected politics,"" Levitt said.

The standards that staffers use to design their map are similar to what Florida adopted in 2010, said Ed Cook, Iowa Legislative Services Agency senior counsel. The agency kept tabs of the number of incumbent races created from redistricting cycles since 1981, the first that used the agency process. The results are close to our estimates for Florida.

According to Cook, 27 members were drawn into districts with other incumbents in 2011; 39 in 2001; 40 in 1991; and 36 in 1981.

With 100 members in the Iowa House versus Florida’s 120, Iowa has had a higher rate of incumbents pitted against each other as a result of redistricting than Florida. But Iowa’s experience doesn’t satisfy an important caveat of Weatherford’s claim — that lawmakers are the ones drawing the lines. They could draw the lines, but they don’t. There are no term limits in Iowa.

""Florida moved much closer to the Iowa system with the amendments and the way they approached it,"" said Tim Storey, the National Conference of State Legislatures redistricting analyst.

California is different, relying like five other states on an independent commission, not an agency, to draw its districts in effort to reduce gerrymandering.

California’s latest redistricting cycle pitted a combined 32 incumbents from the state Assembly and Senate in districts against other members, according to redistricting consultant Paul Mitchell. Nine districts were in the House.

So, not as many as our best estimates in Florida. But not exactly a great comparison either.
Our experts said Weatherford’s claim seems more accurate than not. Florida is ""pioneering"" the world of forbidding legislators from drawing incumbent-friendly seats, Storey said.

""He may be right,"" he said. ""With the exception of Iowa, nothing else jumps to mind.""

Mitchell wasn’t familiar with Florida’s incumbent pairings but said, ""That would be definitely unique, and it’s a strong point to be made.""

""Legislatures normally don’t do that,"" Mitchell said. ""I don’t think the California Legislature would be able to pull that off.""

There may be more data on incumbent vs. incumbent races — at least for states with the most dramatic changes, California and Florida, when the election storm calms next year.

""When the process winds down and elections get held in the new maps, the redistricting crowd will really turn its attention to what happened in California and Florida,"" Storey said.

Our ruling

Weatherford’s claim is reasonable to believe, according to our experts. We could not find direct evidence to contradict his claim, partly because Florida’s redistricting process is unique across the country. Even with data for incumbent matchups, as in Iowa and California, Florida doesn’t lend itself for an apples-to-apples comparison.

Still, none of our experts expressed absolute certainty. A rigorous 50-state study has never been conducted. Given that element of doubt, we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968AA5C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/13/will-weatherford/florida-holds-record-redistricting-incumbents-toge/

Crossroads GPS ad says oil production on federal lands dropped under President Barack Obama
","
A new Web ad from conservative group Crossroads GPS targets a presidential talking point on America’s oil production.

It argues that President Barack Obama takes credit for drilling that resulted from President George W. Bush's policies, while glossing over a recent decline in production on public land.

""Tell Obama, stop blaming others, and work to pass better energy policies!"" a narrator says.

The ad starts with Obama’s claim that domestic oil production is at an eight-year high, something we’ve twice rated Mostly True.

Then a narrator asks: ""Oh, really? His own administration admits production's down where Obama's in charge.""

On screen, the ad displays a statistic from the Interior Department published by an energy news service that, ""Oil production fell by 14 percent … on federal lands and waters.""

That’s a one-year statistic we’ve also rated Mostly True.

This ad focuses on Obama’s role in domestic oil production on government land. We’re evaluating the claim that the president's oil ""production's down where Obama's in charge.""

The data 

Greenwire, the energy news service cited by Crossroads, published Interior Department numbers for oil production on federal lands and waters in a Feb. 27, 2012, story, citing them in a second story,  which was the piece Crossroads used.

The story said, ""Oil production fell by 14 percent in fiscal 2011 below the previous year on federal lands and waters, according to statistics provided last month by the Interior Department.""

So, oil production on federal lands, onshore and offshore, fell from 2010-11, according to Obama administration agencies. So far, so good, for Crossroads’ analysis — other than the fact that it failed to cite a time period for the statistic it quoted from Greenwire.

Does that matter?

Yes, says Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration. ""From a statistical standpoint, to take one year out of three — one year is not indicative of a trend,"" he said.

We pulled the numbers since 2003 from a U.S. Energy Information Administration report, also based on data from the Interior Department and its Office of Natural Resources Revenue.

Bush was in office from January 2001 to January 2009. In our chart, we’ve italicized the years he was in office and put in bold the years Obama led.

The Obama administration points out that the average production for Obama’s first three years is a 13 percent increase over the average production over Bush’s last three years.

We note that:

• From 2004-08, well into Bush’s tenure, oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years, for a net decrease of 16.8 percent.

• From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent.

Crude oil sales from federal lands 
  
What’s likely to happen this year and next?

EIA doesn’t have projections for total production on federal lands, says spokesman Jonathan Cogan, but does project that offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico will continue to lag through 2013, with a drop of less than 4 percent from 2011. (Here’s the data in millions of barrels per day, though it’s calendar year data vs. the fiscal year data we show above.)

Who’s to credit or blame?

So, does Bush get credit for domestic oil expansion on private land and Obama the blame for a drop in public production, as the Crossroad ad describes? The picture is quite a bit more complex than a 30-second ad allows.

""I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that Bush can,"" said Hakes, the author of A Declaration of Energy Independence, which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush. ""If you're going to go back — who should get the credit — I might be able to find something that Nixon did.""

The expansion of fracking, for example — using pressurized fluid to get gas or oil out of rock formations — came about over decades.

""That's why attaching production things to any particular administration is a very, very tricky business, and probably best handled in books rather than in articles,"" Hakes said. ""There are just too many factors.""

So, Obama certainly shouldn’t be claiming full credit for increases in oil production on private land — but neither should supporters of Bush.

Meanwhile, the story of the one-year dropoff in public production has a significant asterisk: the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. A six-month moratorium on exploratory drilling followed — though it by no means stopped gulf oil production — along with changes in regulation that forced the industry to adjust. 
(Bush had his own disasters to contend with: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 also drove a decline the next year, said Shirley Neff, a senior adviser at EIA.)

Oil production on federal land — not water — actually rose 3.7 percent in 2011. It was offshore production that took the hit, falling 16.8 percent. That’s something that Greenwire, the news service Crossroads cited in its ad, pointed out in its February story.

""This is a pretty significant decline; it almost has to represent the impact of the moratorium,"" Dan Kish, senior vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research, told Greenwire for the article.

While the moratorium could have been more targeted, it wasn’t a policy choice unique to Obama, said Hakes, the former EIA director who also directed policy and research for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.

Republican President Richard Nixon, for example, ordered one in the wake of a 1969 well blowout in Santa Barbara, Calif. ""Every president, if you have a blowout like that … is going to get a moratorium,"" Hakes said.

Meanwhile, before the spill, Obama had announced a ""fairly expansive stance"" toward offshore drilling, including off the Florida Panhandle and the coast of Virginia, Hakes said. While that movement stalled with the BP disaster, the president has still moved toward arctic drilling off the coast of Alaska, alarming some environmental advocates.

(We wrote about permit approvals under Obama in a fact-check of Rick Santorum, who had falsely claimed the president ""put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling."")

Our ruling

A Crossroads GPS ad says Obama takes credit for Bush-era policies, then blames him for a downturn in oil production on federal lands. While it’s true that the effect of a president’s policies don’t show up in oil production for some time — in some cases, decades — the ad goes too far when it cites a 14 percent decline in production in a single year as evidence of the impact of  Obama's overall energy strategy. The ad says oil production's down where Obama's in charge."" The facts show that the decline represents a single year that followed years of substantial gains and occurred only offshore in the wake of a major oil disaster. The ad’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True. 
  
CORRECTION: We updated this item on April 18, 2012, to add the change from 2008 to 2009 to our net increase/decrease calculation for oil production on federal lands under Obama. That changed a small net decrease to a net increase of 10.6 percent. Our ruling has not changed.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2D6C80>],/factchecks/2012/apr/13/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-ad-oil-production-obama/

Connie Mack says Bill Nelson voted to study monkeys on cocaine
","
Florida’s Senate race has entered the jungle.

An attack ad features howling monkeys to make a point about out-of-control spending under Democratic leadership. It gets better: These monkeys are on cocaine. For science. At taxpayers’ expense.

Republican Rep. Connie Mack IV launched the ad in his quest to knock out Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. The ad hit airwaves on April 12, 2012, days before the deadline for Americans to pony up their taxes.

The desired effect, of course, is to make citizens even more upset as they part with cash, knowing it could be wasted on bizarre government exploits.

""When Bill Nelson voted for the stimulus, he voted for millions in wasteful spending, including spending our tax dollars to see how monkeys react under the influence of cocaine,"" the ad says. ""Hey Bill Nelson, stop monkeying around with our tax dollars.""

In between, video of Nelson shows him saying, ""So overall it’s a pretty good stimulus.""

PolitiFact has investigated several claims from politicians about allegedly wasteful projects bankrolled by the $862 billion stimulus package since 2009. Science grants are a popular target, especially the one about exotic ants. Crazy as they sound, many of the projects in attack ads are real (though not the one that said $2.6 million went to teach prostitutes in China to drink responsibly).

We’ve learned there’s usually more to the point of the study than the ad lets on, as well as whether the targeted lawmaker actually voted to spend taxpayer dough on it.

Such is the case with the cocaine-addicted monkeys, a two-year-old tale getting new life on a second campaign trail. 
In short, Nelson voted in a favor of a stimulus bill that directed large sums of money to scientific research. But he never actually voted to send money to a monkey-cocaine study. 
As evidence, Mack’s team pointed us to ""Summertime Blues,"" an August 2010 report on 100 stimulus projects ""that give taxpayers the blues"" by Republican Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John McCain of Arizona. Both are Republicans that have a reputation for fighting pork.

""Monkeys Get High For Science"" came in at No. 28.

""Researchers at Wake Forest University think that, in at least one case, it is good to monkey around with stimulus dollars. The Department of Health and Human Services has sent $144,541 to the Winston-Salem college to see how monkeys react under the influence of cocaine,"" the report states. 
The grant total matches the project’s profile on Recovery.gov. The title is heavy: ""Effect of Cocaine Self-Administration on Metabotropic Glutamate Systems."" Ultimately, the study is intended to find new insights into treating drug addiction in humans, officials said. 
The National Institutes of Health selected the project for the grant through a competitive process. The Mack campaign said that was irrelevant. 
""Saying the 'bureaucrats did it' is not a defense when Nelson gave them the money,"" said Mack spokesman David James. 
The conservative North Carolina-based Civitas Institute ranked the cocaine study as the worst federal stimulus project in the state, according to a March 2010 Raleigh News & Observer story. But even the analyst behind the Civitas report told PolitiFact Florida that it isn’t fair to pin the cocaine study on Nelson.

""While on the one hand it is easy to say that senators voting for the stimulus should have known it would have included funding for items many would consider wasteful, they didn't know specifically where the money was going,"" Brian Balfour said in an email. 
Not everyone, we should note, considers the study wasteful. 
National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins defended the project in 2010 , saying, ""I don’t know if the critics want us to experiment with humans, or just give up on the problem of drug addiction, but we aren’t going to do either."" 
We called Wake Forest for more details about how the study turned out and an explanation for the jobs created or sustained, but they didn’t get back to us by our deadline. A Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center spokeswoman defended the project two years ago, saying it supported two jobs and was ""valid science and good research,"" according to Winston-Salem Journal archives.

Our ruling

Mack’s claim is pretty bananas. Yes, Nelson was among senators to approve the stimulus package, which directed large sums of money to scientific research. But Nelson didn’t pick out the monkey project. A federal agency did. Even a critic who calls the project wasteful says you can't blame Nelson. 
We rate the statement Mostly False.

McDonnell say bill requiring ultrasounds before abortions passed with bipartisan support
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell spent the first few minutes of a recent interview on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" discussing jobs and Virginia’s improving economy. Then, as often is the case with McDonnell these days, the subject switched to abortion.

Luke Russert, a member of the interview panel, noted that polls in swing states including Virginia are showing that President Barack Obama has forged ahead of Republican Mitt Romney in support by independent women voters. ""How much do you feel the invasive ultrasound abortion bill in Virginia is responsible for this phenomenon?"" Russert asked.

He was referring to legislation passed by the House of Delegates in February that would have required women to have a transvaginal ultrasound before getting an abortion in Virginia. Amid a national outcry, McDonnell convinced fellow Republicans to amend the bill to mandate solely a non-invasive, abdominal ultrasound before an abortion. When the measure passed the GOP-led General Assembly, the governor signed it into law.

McDonnell replied to Russert by predicting Romney will carry Virginia in November’s presidential election.

Host Joe Scarborough broke in. He said McDonnell’s amendment was a ""good move."" Then he added, ""I just don’t think it’s going to help us with women votes. When my wife -- my conservative, pro-life wife who’s never voted for a Democratic president in her life -- goes, `What in the hell is going on in the Republican Party?’ you know we’re in trouble.""

McDonnell noted that the ultrasound measure was the only abortion bill approved by the General Assembly this year. ""I think there’s a majority of pro-life legislators, so this bill was supported by Republicans and Democrats.""

We wondered if the ultrasound bill really did pass with bipartisan support. So we went to the voting records.

The amended measure requiring non-invasive ultrasounds passed the House, 61-35, on March 1. Republican voted 59-4 for the bill. Democrats voted 31-1 against it (Del. Joe Johnson, D-Washington, was the only ""aye""). The chamber’s one independent -- Del. Lacey Putney of Bedford, who caucuses with the GOP -- supported the legislation.

The measure passed the Senate, 21-19, on Feb. 28. Republicans voted 19-1 for the bill. Democrats voted 18-2 against it.

Does that really qualify as bipartisan support?

Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s chief of communications, defended the governor’s claim. He noted the 21-19 tally in the Senate and said the bill would not have have survived were it not for the vote of one of the two Democrats who supported it -- Chuck Colgan of Prince William and Phil Puckett of Russell.

If there had been a tie vote in the Senate, the bill would have been approved because Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, supported it.

Our ruling

McDonnell said the bill requiring an ultrasound before an abortion was approved with bipartisan support. It’s true that the measure would not have passed the Senate without one of the two Democratic votes it received to complement near unanimous Republican support.

But we have to consider the context of the governor’s statement; it came in response to a question about whether the abortion bill is contributing to some dissatisfaction with the GOP among independent women voters. It’s a stretch to tell a national TV audience that the legislation had bipartisan backing when, in fact, 49 of 52 Democrats in the General Assembly voted against it.

The governor’s statement, while technically accurate, leaves a faulty impression. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A291D40>],/factchecks/2012/apr/13/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-say-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-abortions/
"['County Budget', 'County Government', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Wisconsin', 'Kathleen Falk']","
Democrat Kathleen Falk says under her leadership Dane County topped other areas in job growth
","
Democrat Kathleen Falk’s rejoinder to criticism that unemployment tripled during her time as Dane County executive is that she helped create thousands of new jobs.

She fleshed out her boast in a campaign TV ad in advance of the May 8, 2012 recall primary. The Democratic winner will face Republican Gov. Scott Walker opponent in the June 5, 2012 recall election.

Talking directly into the camera about honesty and transparency and her governing style, Falk says: ""For 14 years I’ve brought people together to solve tough problems. Together we added more jobs than any other area, while holding taxes down. That’s the Wisconsin way, and that’s the governor I’ll be.""

In an earlier item we found the Dane County unemployment rate -- though it was notably low among the state’s counties -- tripled during her tenure, as the Republican Governors Association claimed. But it was not all due to her policies.

(A new Walker campaign ad against Falk hammers on the same unemployment figures).

But if unemployment tripled, could Dane County have really posted the best record in the state on creating jobs?

In the ad, Falk does not specify what types of jobs, but we’ll examine  private and public sector ones from March 1997 to April 2011, Falk’s tenure as executive. We’ll compare it to other counties and to metropolitan areas, since she used ""other areas"" as her measuring stick.

If you look at the raw change in jobs numbers for Wisconsin counties in that period, Dane County -- home to fast-growing Madison --  did add ""more jobs than any other area."" The net gain of all jobs was 48,000 jobs, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Of course, Dane County is home to much of state government and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Even if you take out public-sector jobs, Dane County led the way with 34,000 new jobs.

Meanwhile, Milwaukee County ranked last, losing 43,000 jobs of all types. For part of that time, Falk’s top Democratic rival in the recall, Tom Barrett, was mayor of Milwaukee (2004 to present). And Walker was Milwaukee County executive (2002-10).

When we looked at the broader metro areas analyzed by the Bureau of labor Statistics, the Dane County area -- a three-county ""metropolitan statistical area"" defined by the federal government -- ranked #1 in private job growth and all job growth.

What about as a percentage growth?

Falk didn’t say ""fastest growing,"" but the county still fares well by that measure. Dane saw 19 percent growth, ranking 10th out of 72 counties, and tops among the counties over with more than 100,000 residents.

Of course, jobs are measured differently than unemployment. And in this case, the seeming contradiction -- more unemployment amid more jobs -- can be explained largely by the workforce growing faster than those jobs were created.

So Falk is on target on jobs added.

But just as in our evaluations on job loss and relative blame, there is more than the statistical side to the claim. Falk credited herself and the efforts to pull people together as the reason for the growth.

Is that alone responsible?

Of course not.

When we rated Half True a Republican Governors Association claim concerning unemployment under Barrett, we noted mayors have some role on job creation programs but that state and national economic trends influence local employment trends to a far greater extent.

The same holds true of Falk, who ran a county. In the Half True rating on a similar claim by the RGA on unemployment tripling under her watch, we felt that assigned too much blame to her.

The converse is true here; Falk takes too much credit.

Her campaign argues Falk deserves credit on job creation because she got federal dollars for infrastructure and community development, created a foreign trade zone to aid export-import opportunities and supported an early childhood program that helps working parents enter the workforce, among other initiatives.

We haven’t examined the details of each of those moves, but even if Falk deserves sole credit for all of them, they are certainly not the main drivers of job numbers.

In sum, Falk correctly brags about Dane County’s standout record on job creation during her tenure, but exaggerates her role in the trend.

MAVEN: 200,000 given chance to sound off on tax
","
A new mailer about a referendum to fund a transportation overhaul for metro Atlanta makes it appear as if voters had a hand in this plan to raise their taxes.  

Voters will decide July 31 whether they want to pay a 1 percent sales tax to build an estimated $7.2 billion worth of roads, highway interchanges, mass transit infrastructure and other projects to ease traffic in a region that’s choking on it.  

More than two dozen local leaders spent months hammering out that list of projects through state-created regional roundtables. The mailer, which appeared in a PolitiFact Georgia reporter’s home mailbox April 3, said the average Joe had a say, too.  

""[O]ver 200,000 ordinary citizens were given the opportunity to identify projects they preferred,"" it said.

It’s enough to make a populist swoon. But 200,000 people? Is that even possible?

PolitiFact Georgia called up the Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network, which sent out the mailer on the proposed transportation special local option tax, or T-SPLOST. The nonprofit’s mission is to educate voters about the referendum.

A MAVEN spokeswoman said the Atlanta Regional Commission, the region’s planning agency, contacted 1.3 million residents last year for telephone town hall meetings about the plan.

Part of ARC’s mission is public outreach, so it regularly tallies the number of residents it involves, spokeswoman Julie Ralston said.

Our research shows ARC has a track record for doing so. It counted residents who participated in Plan 2040, which identified transportation projects the region will need in the next three decades. It posted numbers on the project’s website.

T-SPLOST’s website, news accounts and ARC news releases chronicle the series of 10 evening telephone town hall meetings in June.

ARC contracted with Telephone TownHall Meeting, a Denver-area company that uses Web and telephone technology to hold virtual meetings. Members of Congress often use the meetings to connect with voters back home.

Telephone TownHall Meeting owner Curt Cerveny told us how the meetings typically work:  

The company calls tens of thousands of land lines and cellphones for their target households. Some numbers don’t work. Others send the call to voicemail or a fax machine. Sometimes, people hang up.  

About 15 percent to 20 percent of the time, someone picks up and listens in for at least one minute, Cerveny said. Usually, listeners spend eight to 10 minutes on the line.

The T-SPLOST town halls attempted to reach 1.3 million registered voters, an ARC report said. The town halls took place by county.

""It was the biggest call we had ever done,"" Cerveny said. ""It was kind of ahead of its time.""

Some 134,400 households participated. They stayed on the line for an average of 10.59 minutes. Presenters took 213 live questions.

(This PolitiFact Georgia scribe received one of those calls on her cellphone. She was in her car, stuck in gridlock.)

This number does not include calls that went to voicemail. These households received messages telling voters how they can have a say in the project. The report did not state the number of listeners per call.

This amounts to about 10 percent participation, or slightly less than what Cerveny said was typical.  

ARC launched other outreach efforts. In March and April 2011, 126 residents of the affected counties participated in a series of 12 focus groups. In July, about 200 attended a 3 ½-hour town hall meeting. In September, 12 public meetings were attended by about 1,700 people, according to ARC meeting notes.

An online survey generated 9,600 responses. Interested residents could also consult the project’s website, www.atlantaregionalroundtable.com.

Local governments and private organizations also conducted their own outreach. ARC collaborated with more than 80 of them to get the word out, Ralston said.

One is the Livable Communities Coalition, an Atlanta nonprofit that works on regional growth strategies. A ""very conservative"" estimate is that its efforts reached 5,000 people, said Jim Stokes, the group’s interim executive director.

To conclude:

Since ARC tried to reach 1.3 million people through its telephone town halls and managed to get about 10 percent of them, we think it’s safe to say that more than 200,000 were ""given the opportunity"" to participate.  

In addition, some 20,000 participated in meetings, online surveys and other outreach efforts organized by the planning agency. Local governments and other organizations performed outreach as well.

This is a lot of ""ordinary citizens,"" but their influence had limits. The decision rested with the regional roundtable. Members could accept -- or ignore -- public comments as they saw fit.  

That said, MAVEN’s mailer stopped short of saying that these voters controlled the process. Furthermore, its participation estimate is conservative. Its statement earns our highest rating -- True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C24DB80>],/factchecks/2012/apr/13/metro-atlanta-voter-education-network/group-200000-given-chance-sound-tax/
"['Ohio', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Jim Renacci']","
Rep. Jim Renacci says that since President Obama took office, federal spending went up nearly 30 percent and the national debt increased by almost 50 percent
","
With an uncontested primary victory under his belt, freshman Wadsworth GOP Rep. Jim Renacci is gearing up for a hotly contested general election battle with Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton. The incumbents were placed in the same district by a GOP-controlled state legislature, which had to eliminate two of Ohio’s current 18 congressional seats because the state’s population has grown more slowly than other parts of the country.

In an April 5 campaign email that sought volunteers and donations, Renacci touted his experience as a Northeast Ohio CPA and former small business owner in warning that ""Washington’s debt crisis threatens the prosperity of every American.""

""Since President Obama took office, our federal spending has increased by nearly 30 percent and our national debt has increased by almost 50 percent,"" it continued. ""The time to stand up and say enough is enough is now!""

The kind of spending Renacci cited sounded excessive over a bit more than three years, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to audit his numbers.

According to the U.S. Treasury Department’s website, on Obama’s Jan. 20, 2009 inauguration date, the total outstanding public debt was $10.627 trillion. By the time of Renacci’s April 5 missive,  the total outstanding public debt had risen to $15.620 trillion.  That’s almost  47 percent higher than it was the day Obama took office, a number that approximates the ""almost 50 percent"" statistic cited by Renacci.

It’s worth noting that public debt began to escalate well before Obama’s presidency. On the inauguration date of his GOP predecessor, George W. Bush, total outstanding public debt was $5.728 trillion. On April 5 of Bush’s fourth year in office, public debt had swelled by approximately 25 percent to $7.142 trillion. When Bush left office, the debt was 85 percent higher than when he entered.

Unsurprisingly, Obama’s Treasury Department blames most of the current debt on decisions made under Bush, including tax cuts (which it says cost the government $3 trillion), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which it tallies at $1.4 trillion) and the Medicare prescription drug program ($300 billion). It attributes a 12 percent fraction of the deficit to Obama administration policies like the $800 billion recovery act. Treasury Department spokesman Matthew Anderson says the recession further threw the budget out of whack by boosting the need for government aid at a time when tax revenues decreased.

Renacci also stated that federal spending escalated by nearly 30 percent since Obama took office. When we asked his spokesman, James Slepian, where Renacci got the number, he correctly said that federal spending in the last year of Bush’s presidency was $2.982 trillion. He then said that spending would rise by $820 billion, or 27 percent, if President Obama’s $3.803 trillion proposed 2013 budget were to become law.

When we observed that Obama’s proposal is unlikely to become law, and asked whether it’s appropriate to treat that number as dollars that have already been spent, Slepian replied that Obama’s budget reflects the president’s desired spending level. He also conceded it might have been more precise if Renacci had said ""Since President Obama took office, his budgets would increase federal spending by nearly 30 percent.""

Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman provided a more accurate take on  the rise in federal spending in a statement that PolitiFact Ohio examined in January. PolitiFact found that Portman’s assertion that federal spending rose 21 percent over the past three years was Mostly True, because his percentage was accurate, but his statement didn’t reflect that the extra spending was a temporary elevation driven by the economic downturn.

Renacci’s statement that the national debt has increased by almost 50 percent on Obama’s watch is accurate, although it fails to account for factors beyond Obama’s control that drove a significant part of the rise. And while federal spending has increased significantly on Obama’s watch, it hasn’t risen by ""nearly 30 percent,"" as Renacci claimed. Nor does Renacci’s statement reflect that plenty of the spending he criticizes is tied to the faltering economy and some was due to decisions made before Obama took office.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2FBEC0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/13/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renacci-says-president-obama-took-office-f/
"['National', 'History', 'Labor', 'Women', 'Workers', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney chart claims Barack Obama has 'the worst record on female labor force participation'
","
Amid signs that Barack Obama has gained ground among female voters, Mitt Romney is attacking the president on his record on women.

We have already rated one claim from the Romney campaign, that ""women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama,"" which earned a Mostly False.

Now we’ll rate a second claim posted on the Romney campaign's website that was forwarded to us by a reader.

""What president has the worst record on female labor force participation?"" the website asks. ""Barack Obama."" It adds, ""Turning the clock back 20 years on American women.""

First, it's important to note that the statement is confusing because it offers two time frames for the claim. The first sentence refers to the ""worst record,"" suggesting that Obama has the worst record of any president. But then it seems to narrow that time frame to 20 years.

We focused on the first part, since it’s so sweeping and since it's clear about what it refers to -- labor force participation, a standard economic statistic that’s checkable.

Let's define our terms. The ""labor force"" includes people who are either employed (either full- or part time) or are unemployed (available and looking for work). It does not include people who aren’t currently seeking work. The statistic ""labor force participation"" divides the labor force by the total population excluding the military and people who are institutionalized. The statistic goes beyond the familiar unemployment rate, taking into account people who have left the job market, perhaps to go back to school, become a stay-at-home parent or retire.

The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has labor force participation data going back to 1948. When we checked with the Romney campaign, a spokesman told us that the point of the claim was that Obama was the only president to preside over a significant decline in female labor participation.

So we looked at the data. Making comparisons between presidents is tricky, because different presidents served for different lengths of time. So to make things simple, we looked at the female labor participation rate at the beginning and the end of each president’s term.

It turns out that every president between Dwight Eisenhower (the first president to start a new term after 1948) and Bill Clinton saw an increase in women’s labor force participation during their terms. The two most recent presidents saw declines -- 0.7 percentage points under George W. Bush and 1.7 percentage points under Obama.

But were those losses attributable to either president? The arc of women’s employment participation rose gradually but consistently. It rose from roughly one-third of women in the work force in 1948 to about 57 percent in the late 1980s. In the almost quarter-century since then, labor force participation rates have moved in a fairly narrow range, topping out at 60.2 percent.

And the reason for the long upward climb? Far-reaching social trends that are generally out of the control of any president, including the rise of feminism, the advent of birth control, and rising interest in providing girls with an education equal to that of boys.

""Long-term social trends have pushed in the direction of rising labor force participation rates among women for decades,"" said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who served as an outside adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign.

So, the fact that the labor participation rate for women rose by 3.8 percentage points under President Richard Nixon but fell by 1.7 percentage points under Obama isn’t very illuminating. The main reason for the difference is that Nixon happened to serve during a long period of rising workforce participation rates for women, while Obama happened to serve during a period when the rate has been stuck at more or less the same level for more than two decades.

The current labor force participation rate for women age 16 and over is 57.7 percent. It’s true that this represents a low point in recent history. The last time it was this low was in April 1993, when Bill Clinton was president. That was 19 years ago -- close to the 20 years cited in the Romney web graphic.

That said, there’s a lot of critical facts that Romney’s claim ignores.

The drop in female labor participation is -- so far, at least -- pretty small.

Between February 1989 and today -- a period that includes 277 monthly data points -- female labor participation moved up and down within a range of just 3.1 percentage points, a tiny fraction of the movement it displayed between 1948 and 1989. For the sake of comparison, the unemployment rate over the same period zigzagged in a range twice that big, 6.2 percentage points.

Between January 2009, when Obama took office, and March 2012, the most recent month available, women’s labor force participation declined by 1.7 percentage points. (Starting the count the day Obama took office is probably not a fair way to measure his record, since his policies wouldn’t have had time to take effect, but we’ll use it here for the sake of convenience.)

Considering that Obama inherited what many consider the worst recession since the Great Depression, a 1.7 percentage-point drop isn’t necessarily dramatic. It certainly could turn into a worrisome trend -- but that depends on where the number goes from here.

""It depends on whether you see the recent declines as a temporary phenomenon due to a temporarily weak economy, or as the first installment that reverses much of a decades-long climb in the participation rate of women,"" Davis said.

The decline in labor force participation under Obama was similar for men.

Over the same period that the women’s labor participation rate was declining by 1.7 percentage points under Obama, the decline for men was actually steeper -- 2.2 percentage points. So labor force participation percentages don’t give much evidence that women in particular are suffering under Obama.

This point is ""what reveals it to be a political charge rather than an economic one,"" said Andrew Samwick, a Dartmouth College economist.

In analyzing this question, the age of the workforce matters.

As they age, more people tend to leave the job market. Given that the baby boomers are reaching or are already in retirement, a portion of the decline in labor participation rate for both sexes comes from the aging of the labor force.

A straightforward way of minimizing the impact of aging workers on the statistics is to take a look at a more specific slice of the population -- workers age 25 to 54, who aren’t yet close to retirement. Economists can argue about whether this is a better measure to look at than ages 16 and up -- the figure used above -- but it’s certainly an alternative way of looking at the core of the working-age population.

So how does Obama fare using this measurement?

Labor participation for women in this age group fell by 1.3 percentage points between January 2009 and March 2012. During the same number of months into George W. Bush’s tenure, the labor participation rate for women in the same age group fell by 1.4 percentage points.

Our point is not to say that Bush had a worse record than Obama for women’s employment. Rather, the fact that that Bush had slightly worse numbers than Obama did using this measurement runs counter to the Romney camp’s argument that Obama clearly had the ""worst record on female labor force participation.""

The broader lesson of this comparison is that different statistics may show different trends, and when assessing the sweeping claim that Obama has the ""worst record"" on something, it’s important to look at the numbers from more than one direction.

The decline in labor-force participation under Obama can’t be attributed to his policies alone.

Presidents do not have unfettered ability to shape the labor markets. Obama inherited a serious recession, and that has had the biggest impact on women’s employment rates. As it happens, some of the hardest-hit employment sectors during the past few years -- state and local government -- attract a disproportionate share of women.

According to BLS data, 57 percent of government workers are women. The state government workforce has shrunk by 2.6 percent since January 2009, and the local government workforce has shrunk by 3.3 percent since January 2009. Public education attracts particularly large numbers of women -- 71 percent of all employees -- and it has shrunk by 2.8 percent since January 2009.

State and local government jobs cuts can't be pinned directly on a president. In fact, Republicans played a major role in shrinking public sector employment. A recent study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute found that the 11 states that voted in Republican legislatures in the 2010 elections accounted for 40.5 percent of all state and local government job losses.

If anything, Obama’s policies may have eased the job losses in these sectors: A portion of his economic stimulus bill consisted of aid to states, which was designed to save jobs in education and other public services. A second round of stimulus worth $23 billion that Obama sought was rejected by Congressional Republicans.

Our ruling

Romney's website said, ""What president has the worst record on female labor force participation? Barack Obama.""

According to federal statistics, every president since 1948 except for Obama and George W. Bush has seen women’s participation in the labor force rise on their watch, and Obama’s decline was bigger than Bush’s. So there’s a grain of truth to Romney’s claim -- but not much.

The increases for presidents between 1948 and the late 1980s are largely due to broader social trends beyond the control of any president, so saying that Obama did worse than them is a red herring. Meanwhile, other cuts at the data paint a different picture. Under Obama, the decline in workforce participation for women was actually smaller than it was for men, and calculating the data using slightly different age groups shows that George W. Bush had a slightly worse record.

This lack of context weakens Romney’s claim that Obama has the ""worst record on female labor force participation"" of any president. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974B1640>],/factchecks/2012/apr/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-chart-claims-barack-obama-has-worst-re/
"['Oregon', 'Ted  Wheeler']","
Did Ted Wheeler’s office actually save $39 million in management costs?
","
PolitiFact Oregon is going to be bold and call the race for the state’s next treasurer. We know the election isn’t until November, but barring calamity,  we’re pretty sure the winner will be the Democratic incumbent, Ted Wheeler. (There’s no Republican candidate in the race, and, sorry third-party candidates, but you probably won’t beat him.)

The presumed win hasn’t stopped Wheeler from launching a campaign and it doesn’t stop us from checking the claimed accomplishments on his campaign website. Among them is this bullet point: ""Saved $37 million in management costs for the oversight of public investments.""

Voters tend to like it when elected officials save taxpayer money, so we set out to find out how these savings had occurred. For example, did the office, under Wheeler’s leadership, do anything different to save these millions?

We scrolled through Treasury press releases and found this from November 2011: ""Oregon Treasury saved millions in management costs, comparative analysis shows."" Here’s the smaller headline on that release: ""Oregon’s costs were $39.3 million less than expected, based on benchmark of large funds.""

Wait, so Oregon didn’t ""save"" any money? We just didn’t spend as much as others?

According to the press release, the study was conducted by CEM Benchmarking Inc. of Toronto. It rated Oregon’s costs associated with managing the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund against 18 other large pension funds.

We found the report as presented to the Oregon Investment Council, the board oversees investments. And it’s accurate to say that as benchmarked, Oregon ""saved"" $39 million because we paid less for more expensive, but more profitable, private investments for the period ending December 2010. The fund paid more than $445 million in management costs, which is less than 0.9 percent of assets.

(In case you’re wondering about the $2 million discrepancy, Wheeler’s website should state $39 million, not $37 million). In any case, that’s excellent news. But is it fair to call it money saved?

The treasurer’s office thinks it’s fair since that is money the office could have spent but didn’t.

""It is an accurate way to reflect a kind of savings,"" says Mike Mueller, the Treasury’s deputy chief investment officer and interim CIO. ""... they take a snapshot and say based on this universe, we would expect your costs to be X but your costs were Y.""

Oregon has been regarded as a pioneer in private equity -- the more expensive to manage but more profitable investments -- since the 1980s, Mueller explained. Because Oregon has an older, more mature program, our management fees have declined over time. That’s why Oregon is lower relative to the peer group, he said.

Bruce Hopkins, a vice president with CEM, says the $39 million ""is very real,"" he said. ""Oregon has been successful at getting lower fees. I would also give them some credit for seeing this as an appropriate asset class … they were getting into private equity deals that others hadn’t thought of yet.""

We checked previous years, to see how long the office has been ""saving"" money for taxpayers by paying lower-than-peer-group fees. It’s been as low as $11 million in 2001 and as high as $57 million in 2005. We should note that Randall Edwards was treasurer for much of the decade, from 2001 to 2009. Ben Westlund took office in January 2009 and served until he died of cancer in early 2010.  

Wheeler can’t take much personal credit for $39 million, although his office has negotiated savings. His spokesman sends along a 2011 press release that shows the office was able to negotiate even lower fees for a new investment. That likely will be reflected in future benchmarking reports. But that’s not what we’re talking about here.

Wheeler said he stands by the campaign statement. ""The results are for the time during which I was Treasurer and accountable for our activities and results."" He pointed out that The Oregonian has also held him accountable for past office policies.

We don’t agree. Had the treasurer’s office negotiated terms under Wheeler to net $39 million in actual savings from one year to the next, we would rate this statement much differently.

Wheeler’s savings statement contains an element of truth. A third-party report showed that Oregon paid $39 million less in fees than its peers. But just because a peer group spent more than Oregon doesn’t mean Oregon was ever at risk of spending that much. Moreover, a key reason for our lower-than-peer-average fees is that our private investments are older, a crop of decisions that have nothing to do with Wheeler.

These are critical facts that would give a different impression of the savings statement. We find the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974B6300>],/factchecks/2012/apr/12/ted-wheeler/did-ted-wheelers-office-actually-save-39-million-m/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Susan Combs']","
Comptroller Susan Combs says state lawmakers did not cut public education funding
","
State Comptroller Susan Combs, whose duties include oversight of state finances, delivered a contradictory assessment of how Texas lawmakers treated public schools while writing the state budget in 2011.

According to a news story in the Bryan-College Station Eagle, Combs was asked by a local audience member on April 4, 2012, how much the state cut from public education. The story says Combs replied that the state didn't reduce funding, instead adding $2 billion.

""It was not less, but it was not as much,"" Combs said, according to the story, which we learned of from an April 6, 2012, Twitter post by state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin. His accompanying message described Combs’ not less-but not as much statement as the ""effort to hide education budget cuts, in 1 sentence.""

Before gauging Combs’ claim, we tried to pin down what she said.

Her spokesman, RJ DeSilva, told us her appearance was not recorded by the comptroller’s office. Separately, when we inquired, Eagle education reporter Cassie Smith sent us her notes from the event, which indicate that Combs said both that school funding was not cut and that there was not as much funding as lawmakers or the state would have spent.

According to the notes, an attendee asked: ""How much did we actually cut funding from public education?""

Combs: ""Well, we didn’t actually cut it. I think the number was that we actually put in about $2 billion, if my recollections from what I read, but it was not the amount that they would have spent. So it was not less, but it was not as much. What happened was schools have to take a look at what do we do with staff. What do we do with expenditures? What do we do with various things? I know there’s been a debate about it.""

Smith’s notes say two local school superintendents then chimed in with how much less they’ll be receiving.

Combs: ""OK.""

Then, Smith’s notes say, Combs  started talking about community colleges and graduation rates.

Confirmed: Combs said that funding to school districts was not cut.

And is that correct?

DeSilva told us by email that Combs’ claim reflected figures in the Legislative Budget Board’s January 2012 ""Fiscal Size-up"" report for the current budget period, 2012-13. The report shows lawmakers put about $150 million more in state revenue into public education than was appropriated in 2010-11. Also, DeSilva said, Combs was referring to the decision to defer a $2.3 billion payment otherwise due to school districts in the current budget period to September 2013.

DeSilva said Combs’ published comment -- ""It was not less, but it was not as much"" -- reflected the fact that changes to the state’s school funding formula ""meant districts would be entitled to an estimated $4 billion less than they would have been entitled to had school finance formulas remained unchanged... So while"" state ""funding went up, schools would have received more funding if the formula had not changed,"" DeSilva said.

Our takeaway: Combs says that lawmakers put more state revenue into education, yet changed finance formulas so schools would get $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same and also deferred a regular payment to school districts to the next budget.

The latter two points are factually solid, covering territory that we crossed in checking a legislator’s claim about education funding, though the deferred payment strikes us as more indicative of less education aid in the current budget period.

However, the $150 million state spending increase relied upon by Combs delivers an incomplete picture of what lawmakers spent. The state’s ""general revenue"" increase pales in comparison to reductions in other funds appropriated for public education. Notably, $3.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid that legislators used in 2009 to cover some of the state’s tab for basic school aid was not available in 2011.

Meanwhile, public education funding from all sources in the 2012-13 state budget decreased $2.8 billion, or 5.6 percent, as the federal stimulus aid went away, according to the 2012 Fiscal Size-up.
   
Results in individual school districts would vary, but an accurate broad answer to the audience member’s question about school funding cuts would be that the schools sustained a legislated reduction in education funding adding up to more than $5 billion through 2012-13, a total that rolls in the $4 billion in reductions of formula-driven aid plus other cuts in targeted programs such as teacher incentive pay, dropout prevention funding and zeroed-out grants to the pre-Kindergarten Early Start program.
   
Our ruling
   
Lawmakers cut public school aid, mainly by changing an established funding formula and reducing aid to targeted programs. To say otherwise is inaccurate, misleading and by a wide margin ridiculous.

Republican Governors Association says unemployment tripled because of Kathleen Falk’s tax policies
","
Enter the phrase ""Madison liberal"" into Google and up pop 17,000 hits.

Many of those involve conservatives affixing that label to Kathleen Falk, the labor-backed Democrat seeking to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election.

As the recall election became official, the pro-Walker Republican Governors Association got in on the action. In a TV ad by its political arm (Right Direction Wisconsin PAC), the group features a mock Internet search on Falk, who was the Dane County executive from April 1997 to April 2011.

(It’s similar to the ad taking on Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, another Democratic candidate in the race, a claim we already evaluated)

""Kathleen Falk is a longtime Madison politician,"" the narrator says as search results pop up. ""Huh."" ""Backed by government employee unions. Oh boy.""

It continues: ""She raised taxes every year she was county executive. Huuuuh. And under her watch, unemployment tripled. Oh oh.""

The narrator’s final words: ""Typical liberal Madison politician. Raised taxes and lost jobs. Kathleen Falk for governor? I don’t think so.""

We previously rated True a claim by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch that Falk raised property taxes by millions of dollars every year and approved the second highest increase in the state in 2010.

But what about the joblessness claim -- that unemployment tripled during her time? And that the blame for the rise falls solidly on Falk’s shoulders?

The numbers

Dane County’s low unemployment rate compared with the rest of Wisconsin is notable. The county’s rate is typically a couple percentage points or more lower than Wisconsin as a whole, thanks in part to state government and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show.

Unemployment was at just 1.7 percent when Falk took office in April 1997, and in her first full month on the job dipped to 1.5 percent.

It held mostly under 3 percent until 2002, hovered between 3 and 4 percent until 2009, then spiked up for almost two years before receding a bit as she left office in April 2011. Dane County was growing at the time and overall employment was up, but the labor market couldn’t keep up with those seeking work.

When Falk stepped down, the unemployment rate was at 5.2 percent, compared to Wisconsin’s overall rate of 7.5.

In sum, the county’s unemployment rate grew during her tenure.

Did it triple?

It more than tripled if you compare the rate in her first full month to her last full month. The same is true when comparing the raw number of unemployed at those two points. And the same is true if you use her partial month in April 1997 as the baseline.

There’s still another way to get there: When unemployment reached 6.7 percent at its height during her term, that was well over three times higher than Dane County’s rate when she came in.

So the RGA is solid on the numbers.

Responsibility

But beyond the numbers the ad asserts that Falk and her policies were directly responsible for the jump.

In the ad, the narrator notes the increase happened ""under her watch.""  A website the RGA PAC set up to accompany the ad makes a stronger cause-and-effect link: ""With Kathleen Falk’s tax hikes, came higher unemployment, too.""

As noted, taxes did go up. And some economists link high taxation to limits on economic growth. But it’s a stretch to pin the ups and downs of the economy in Dane County solely on Falk alone, much less pinpoint her tax increases alone.

The trends are the work of multiple forces at the local, state, national and global level. The two big spikes in unemployment during Falk’s time coincided with national recessions, the latest fueled by the global meltdown in housing and financial markets.

And on taxes, Falk mostly held to a yearly tax hike tied to inflation plus population growth. Only 15 of the state’s 72 counties had a lower cumulative tax levy increase during the time she was exec, we found in an earlier item.

In short, the RGA claim is accurate on the numbers, but misfires by tying Falk so closely to the unemployment rise.

Cory Booker claims Jeff Vanderbeek “took us into arbitration” in dispute over Prudential Center
","
A day after a panel of arbitrators ruled that Newark owed money to the New Jersey Devils, Mayor Cory Booker stood outside the Prudential Center and lambasted Jeff Vanderbeek, the team’s managing partner.

But the mayor should remember it was city officials who initiated that arbitration process.

Yet Booker claimed twice during his April 4 news conference that Vanderbeek ""took us into arbitration.""

""He’s dragged my team through courts for five and a half years, millions and millions of dollars of legal fees he has swept up from the city pressing frivolous claims,"" Booker said. ""How do I know they’re frivolous claims? Think about how much of a pathetic penny pincher he’s been.

""He took us into arbitration, not just for that one letter that I mentioned. He took us into arbitration because he said, ‘Oh, you didn’t get the streets straightened in time.’ He was responsible for the construction of this arena, but he said, ‘Oh, it wasn’t done on time,’"" the mayor continued. ""Every legal manipulation and exploitation he could pursue to get another dime and dollar out of our city, he’s gone after.""

After reviewing the arbitrators’ decision and an application filed on the city’s behalf, PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Booker is wrong. The arbitrators’ decision resulted from an arbitration request filed in 2010 by the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena.

In a series of e-mails, Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres acknowledged that the authority initiated the process, but claimed that the Devils left city officials with no choice.

""The Newark Housing Authority would never have demanded an arbitration if the Devils had paid their rent, however, because of their recalcitrance and failure to follow through on their commitments, the Newark Housing Authority and the city were forced into arbitration,"" Torres wrote. ""It should be noted that these were the facts behind the Mayor’s statement.""

Torres later added, ""The Mayor knows that the Housing Authority initiated the arbitration, that’s no secret.  What I am saying is that when he says ‘they took us into arbitration’, he’s saying this because they left us with no choice.""

Let’s explain the timeline of events leading up to arbitration.

The Devils and the authority approved a lease agreement in February 2005 for the Prudential Center, which later opened in October 2007. But the two sides became divided over a host of issues, including unpaid rent and parking revenues.

Following years of negotiations, the authority sent a ""notice of dispute"" to the hockey team, starting the process toward arbitration, according to a May 2010 Star-Ledger article. The lease agreement provides for arbitration as a method of resolving disputes.

In June 2010, the authority filed a ""demand for arbitration"" with the American Arbitration Association, according to the arbitrators’ decision and the application filed at the time.

The arbitrators’ decision released last week addresses the unpaid rent, parking revenues and other issues, but ultimately leaves Newark owing about $600,000 to the Devils.

Our ruling

At an April 4 news conference outside the Prudential Center, Booker claimed twice that Vanderbeek ""took us into arbitration.""

But as a spokeswoman for the mayor acknowledged, the Newark Housing Authority initiated the arbitration process. We rate the statement False.

Cory Booker claims Devils managing partner Jeff Vanderbeek refused to give any of the charitable dollars required under lease agreement for the Prudential Center
","
Newark Mayor Cory Booker doesn’t know whether Jeff Vanderbeek was acting out of callous disregard or indifference, but the mayor claims the managing partner of the New Jersey Devils broke his legal obligation to provide funds to the city for charities and job training.

A long-running feud between city and team officials over unpaid rent, parking revenues and other issues at the Prudential Center culminated last week in a decision from a panel of arbitrators. That decision leaves Newark owing about $600,000 to the Devils.

A few days after denouncing Vanderbeek as a ""high-class, high-falutin’ huckster and hustler,"" Booker continued his battle against the hockey team owner during an April 9 interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe program.

""Not only did he make those promises, but he was required to do so by the contract,"" Booker said. ""He froze all those monies during the toughest years in ‘08-’09, when our economy was falling out. He refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract.""

For the most part, the mayor’s claim is on solid ground, PolitiFact New Jersey found. As the legal dispute rolled on, the Devils did not make $1.5 million in combined payments over three years of the lease agreement for youth and community sports programs and job training programs, according to the arbitrators’ decision.

But the hockey team did pay $346,576 toward those programs for the first year of the lease agreement, according to the decision.

In a statement, Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres argued that ""the $346,576 paid only represents a fraction of what is owed.""

""We’re disappointed that Politifact is choosing (to)...ignore the facts surrounding Jeff Vanderbeek’s decision to neglect his public commitments to the city,"" Torres wrote. ""Year after year, the Devils have denied resources to charities and job training programs.""

Let’s explain how those programs factor into the lease agreement for the arena.

Under a February 2005 lease agreement with the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena, the Devils agreed to pay rent consisting of four components. At the outset, two of those components were $250,000 annual payments for youth and community sports programs, as well as $250,000 annual payments for job training programs.

The Devils paid $173,288 for each of the two sets of programs for the first year of the contract, which ran from October 2007 to June 2008, according to the arbitrators’ decision. The payments were smaller because the first payments applied to less than a full year.

But as a result of the legal dispute, the Devils paid no rent in years two through four of the lease agreement, according to the arbitrators’ decision. The team was asserting its right to withhold rent under a clause in the lease agreement, the decision states.

Arena spokesman Robert Sommer argued that both the city and the team were withholding payments to each other.

""They withheld money as well,"" Sommer told us. ""No payments were being made in either direction.""

Among other rent payments, the arbitrators determined that the Devils owe $1.5 million for the sports and job training programs for those three years. The hockey team also owes an additional $2,738 for the first year, according to the decision.

But instead of getting money back, city officials end up owing money to the Devils, because of parking revenues and other issues addressed in the arbitrators’ decision.

Our ruling

In an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Booker claimed Vanderbeek ""froze all those monies during the toughest years in ‘08-’09"" and ""refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract.""

According to the arbitrators’ decision, the Devils paid $346,576 toward youth and community sports programs and job training programs for the first year of the contract. But the hockey team did not pay $1.5 million in combined payments over the next three years of the contract.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

"['Abortion', 'Tennessee', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Matthew Hill']","
Matthew Hill says abortion doctors flying in, out of Tennessee to perform procedures
","
During House floor debate on this year’s most prominent abortion bill in the General Assembly, Rep. Matthew Hill declared that one reason enactment is needed is that physicians are currently flying into the state and then flying out, leaving their patients with little recourse should complications arise.

The bill (HB3808) requires abortion providers to have hospital admission privileges in the county where the procedure is performed or an adjacent county. Critics contended the bill, titled ""The Life Defense Act of 2012,"" is unnecessary and intended as an impediment to providing abortions in Tennessee.

Hill, R-Jonesborough, is vice chairman of the House Health and Human Resources Committee, chairman of the House Health Subcommittee and lead sponsor of the bill.

In explaining why passage is needed, he told colleagues in the March 29, 2012, floor debate that, first of all, abortion doctors were traveling across the state to perform abortions and then going back home. That’s not the claim we’re checking; his second reason is what brought forth skepticism from his colleagues.

""Number two,"" Hill said, ""we have abortion physicians that are flying into this state and that they are performing abortions."" He continued: ""They’re flying into this state, performing abortions and flying out. And what happens is when a woman has complications, the doctor who performed that abortion is long gone. So if anything -- and I know it’s true – this legislation will expand critical, possibly life-saving access to care to the woman who has complications from the abortion. That’s why I’m bringing the legislation and that, in all practicality, is what it’ll do.""

Hill’s assertion about doctors flying in from out of the state was challenged by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Turner of Nashville. Turner first asked, ""How many doctors are flying in and performing abortions?""

Replied Hill: ""I don’t have the exact number. You can probably call Planned Parenthood if you like.""

Turner pressed the point, asking if ""you know any place this is happening.""

Hill: ""I do know of one physician that is driving from Northeast Tennessee across the state of Tennessee to do this.""

Turner: ""But you said out-of-state … You don’t know that for sure?""

Hill: ""I do not have direct knowledge of that, no, sir.""

That left hanging the question of whether there actually are abortion doctors flying into the state, performing the procedures, then flying away. We decided to seek the answer.

Bill Christian, spokesman for the state Department of Health, said that a physician performing an abortion in Tennessee must be licensed to practice medicine within the state under current law. But that does not mean the physician has to be a Tennessee resident. It would be legal, he said, for a non-resident doctor to fly into Tennessee and perform an abortion – so long as he or she was licensed within the state.

Christian said the department has no information on whether any doctors are doing so and no indication of any doctor being prosecuted for performing an abortion without a license in the state. But the statistics collected by the department on abortions would not necessarily cover that information, he said.

Hill, asked for his source for the assertion, said he had been told of fly-in doctors by leaders of Tennessee Right to Life, an organization of anti-abortion activists.

Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life, said he believes there are cases of fly-in abortion providers, but declined to provide any specifics because of ""circumstances now evolving on another front.""

""All around the country, I don’t think it’s an unusual practice,"" said Harris, adding that the practice may increase because the number of abortion providers is declining nationwide.

Harris said there is at least one case of the reverse situation – a Tennessee doctor flying out of the state to perform abortions. He cited Dr. Gary Boyle of Blountville, who was arrested in October, 2010, on charges of pointing a gun at anti-abortion protesters outside a clinic in Charleston, S.C. Boyle has pleaded not guilty to the charges and the trial is still pending.

And former state Rep. Chris Clem, an attorney in Chattanooga, says there was a lawsuit filed years ago against two Alabama doctors alleging malpractice in an abortion performed at a now-closed Chattanooga clinic. But Clem could not provide the doctors’ names or any details of the case, which he recalls was settled out of court more than a decade ago.

On the other hand, leaders with Planned Parenthood in Tennessee say Hill’s claim is blatantly wrong.

""That has never happened,"" said Jeff Teague, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee. ""All the doctors we use (in Planned Parenthood clinics) are from Tennessee and, from conversations with others (who provide abortion services in the state), they have Tennessee physicians, too.""

Planned Parenthood has two regional offices in Tennessee. Barry Chase of the Greater Memphis office, concurs with Teague:  ""Rep. Hill needs to find out what the truth is and stick with it in the future.""

Teague said that Hill’s reference to calling Planned Parenthood during the debate is an example of his organization being ""used as a punching bag all of the time."" Planned Parenthood has been at pains to point out, for instance, that abortions only account for 3 percent of the services it provides. Said Teague: ""They (anti-abortion activists) like to throw out false accusations on a whole lot of levels . . . They just like to make us out as the bad guys, the evil forces, all of the time.""

Our ruling

Hill at first boldly claimed that doctors who perform abortions were flying in and then out of the state, but when challenged by a Democratic colleague acknowledged he had no specific knowledge that it had occurred. The director of Tennessee’s leading anti-abortion would not provide any evidence that the practice has occurred either. Planned Parenthood claims this does not happen. With no evidence to support this claim, we rule it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097913380>],/factchecks/2012/apr/12/matthew-hill/matthew-hill-says-abortion-doctors-flying-out-tenn/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
The National Republican Senatorial Committee says the health care law slapped Ohio small businesses with a $500 billion tax increase
","
With Congress out for its Easter-Passover break, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown started making the rounds with constituent and factory visits in early April. One of those stops was at the Nucor steel plant in Marion, where the Democratic freshman discussed what he calls the unfair trade practices of China.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee meantime had a list of other subjects it thought Brown, who faces reelection in November, should discuss during his local visits. Making suggestions in a pointed news release, NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox said, ""One of the things we expect that Brown will not be discussing is his 60th vote for Barack Obama’s job-killing health care law, which slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase.""

This single statement had several elements that made us say, ""Huh?"" Was Brown the 60th vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act? That’s a point of dispute, because the NRSC had already said that Montana Democrat Jon Tester had that honor (though Tester’s staff debunked it with a videotape showing him as the 52nd ""yes"" vote, Politico reported). The NRSC or its affiliates have also accused Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Claire McCaskill of Missouri of casting that crucial vote. Taking heat for being the 60th senator to actually commit that he would vote ""yes,"" thus assuring passage regardless of the order in which the actual roll call went, was Ben Nelson of Nebraska.

But Brown certainly voted for the health care bill, so let’s not get hung up on which senator had the ultimate vote. More intriguing than that was the NRSC’s claim that the bill ""slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase.""

That would be a heck of an increase, were it true.

But it is not. Every piece of information the NRSC sent us to back up its $500 billion claim pertained to a national figure, not a figure for a single state. And it applied to all taxes and fees associated with what both parties are now calling Obamacare, not just the portion that would be paid by small businesses.

The NRSC’s sources for this included testimony and supporting documents from the Congressional Budget Office, submitted to the House of Representatives’ Energy and Commerce Committee’s health subcommittee on March 30, 2011. PolitiFact recently examined another claim based on this figure and its supporting documents, after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce used the number in an ad criticizing Tester. There’s no need to repeat that  examination at length, but we’ll note that PolitiFact found that the $500 billion number was ""a fair number for total revenue raised by the 2010 health care law as estimated when Tester voted — but the number for just taxes is lower, likely between $400 billion and $465 billion.""

The rest was for various other fees and revenue enhancements, which opens a debate as to whether they should be called taxes. But there’s no need for that here.

Yes, some businesses will pay higher taxes if the law is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The NRSC sent us plenty of examples from news stories as well as a recent editorial from the Columbus Dispatch. Among the companies already preparing for this are medical device manufacturers like Invacare, based in Elyria, which has estimated a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices could cost it anywhere from $12 million to more than $20 million annually. Backers of the health care law suggest that medical device companies will make up at least some of the revenue because more people will have health insurance and buy medical products. Industry officials are skeptical.

Invacare is a global company, however. There are certainly small, Ohio-based companies that will be taxed more under the law. But will these small Ohio businesses be slapped with a $500 billion tax hike, thanks to Brown and others who supported the bill, regardless of their order?

No.

We are not aware of a good analysis to show the exact share that small Ohio businesses would pay of that $500 billion in new revenue that the government will raise, or whatever the figure will prove to be. We could try to extrapolate, but what’s the point? The NRSC figure is off by a factor of, well, we can’t tell you. We just know that there are 50 states and the CBO figure was for all new revenue nationwide, not just for the share to be paid in taxes by small businesses in Ohio. The NRSC conceded this when we talked it over.

Plenty of people dislike the Affordable Care Act. That is a fact. Brown voted for it, and that’s a fact, too. But to pick a national number and apply it to one segment of one state is not accurate and is simply ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter, ridiculous claims get a rating of Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809702B1C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/12/national-republican-senatorial-committee/national-republican-senatorial-committee-says-heal/

Mike Huckabee says President Obama's refusal to issue offshore drilling permits is one reason gasoline prices are soaring
","A robocall we received last week, recorded by Fox News host and former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, claims that President Obama’s refusal to grant permits for offshore drilling is a key reason why gasoline prices have been rising.

Huckabee says the call is on behalf of the conservative group Presidential Coalition. In it, he claims ""the potential for $5- or $6-a-gallon gasoline this year terrifies Barack Obama, and it's an issue that we can lay directly on his doorstep. Obama's veto of the Keystone pipeline, his refusal to drill in Alaska or grant permits for offshore drilling, his cozying up to the Middle East and weakness on the energy issue, that's the reason gas prices are soaring, and don't let anyone tell you different.""

First, Obama never vetoed the pipeline, which originally had a route that was opposed by Nebraska's governor, a Republican; it has never come to his desk for a signature. Obama expressed opposition to a Republican bill designed to push it through without going through the normal approval process.

But we were more interested in checking one of the other key parts of Huckabee’s claim -- that the president had refused to grant permits for offshore drilling.

That claim has been around for a while. In March 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, also a Republican, reported that only one new oil drilling permit had been issued since Obama took office.

That statement earned her a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact National in part because Bachmann made her statement 15 days after Obama reported at a news conference that more than 35 new offshore drilling permits had been approved. (A moratorium on permits had been imposed to implement new safety and environmental standards in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.)

To get the latest count for the Gulf of Mexico, we turned to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, BSEE.gov.

Since new shallow water well regulations were put into effect June 8, 2010, the bureau reports, 122 permits for drilling where the water depth is 500 feet or less have been approved.

New regulations for deep-water wells took effect Oct. 12, 2010. Since then, 167 have been  permitted by the Obama administration. BSEE spokeswoman Eileen Angelico said 27 of those permits were for existing wells where drilling was suspended during the moratorium.

That leaves 140 new deep-water wells just in the Gulf of Mexico.

In fact, federal authorities have also approved two other drilling permits -- for wells off the Alaska coast.

Our ruling

Mike Huckabee is telling people who receive his robocall that Obama has refused to issue offshore drilling permits -- one reason, he says, why gasoline prices are soaring.

In fact, 140 permits for new deep-water wells have been issued since the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. More than hundred shallow water permits have also been issued since the moratorium was lifted, but we didn't ask how many of those were new because it is clear, just from the deep-water data, that Huckabee's claim is bogus.

""Don't let anyone tell you different,"" Huckabee says in his robocall as he faults the president for not approving new wells.

Well, we're telling you different. His statement is so ridiculously at odds with the facts, we've tapped our own reservoir of flammable hydrocarbons to give him -- and by association, the Presidential Coalition -- a Pants on Fire!

"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
Allen West says about 80 House Democrats are members of the Communist Party
","Speaking at a town hall meeting, Republican Allen West made the startling claim that many of his fellow members of the U.S. House of Representatives are members of the Communist Party.

The TCPalm, a newspaper that covers northern Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, reported on comments the South Florida congressman made at a town hall in Jensen Beach on April 10, 2012. The article reported that West claimed up to 80 House Democrats are Communist Party members, though he didn’t name names.

West’s words went viral. Some of the responses were funny: A commenter on the the Palm Beach Post website pretended to be Joe McCarthy, the red-baiting senator from Wisconsin: ""I told you there were 80 communists in Congress!"" 

By the next day, West’s Democratic opponent, Patrick Murphy, had posted a 26-second video of West’s statement. West’s campaign then distributed their own slightly longer version of the video. The audio is somewhat difficult to discern in parts, but here’s a transcript of what we heard: Moderator: ""What percentage of the American legislature do you think are card-carrying Marxists or International Socialist?""

West: ""It's a good question. I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party who are members of the Communist Party. ... It’s called the Congressional Progressive Caucus.""

So how many -- if any -- Democrats in Congress are communists?

West points to the Progressive Caucus

We asked West’s spokeswoman Angela Melvin for an explanation: ""The congressman was referring to the 76 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The Communist Party has publicly referred to the Progressive Caucus as its allies. The Progressive Caucus speaks for itself. These individuals certainly aren't proponents of free markets or individual economic freedom.""

On Facebook, West elaborated: ""I stand by the point of my comments. The press wants to write gotcha stories and talk semantics, but just look at the words and actions of the Progressive Caucus. You can call them socialist, Marxist, communist or whatever you want, but the point is, they oppose free markets and individual economic freedom, they want to redistribute wealth, and they want to see the nation fundamentally transformed. Their policies are destructive and I will stand up to them regardless of the critics. Members of this Caucus lavished praise on Fidel Castro following a 2009 visit, just to name one example. The Communist Party USA claims the Progressive Caucus as its ‘ally.’""

West’s campaign manager Tim Edson told the Washington Post that some Democratic members have traveled to communist Cuba or praised Fidel Castro. (The Post noted that some Republicans have gone to Cuba too.) From the Post:

""Pressed on whether those members are actual communists, Edson said the label isn’t the point.

""We can quibble about the terminology used to describe them, but it’s clear. Whatever you call people that oppose capitalism and free markets and individual economic freedom — maybe it’s ‘socialist,’ maybe it’s ’communist’ — but that’s the point the congressman was making, and he stands by the words.""

It might surprise you to know that PolitiFact has already checked claims about how many members of Congress are socialists. In the past, though, it’s been a claim confined to bloggers. (See these fact-checks from PolitiFact state sites in New Jersey, Texas and Oregon.)

Here in Florida, we previously ruled on a claim from bloggers that three Florida Democratic members of Congress are socialists; we rated that Pants on Fire. Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus -- the largest caucus within the House Democratic caucus. Founded in 1991, the group of lawmakers supports policies that advance economic justice, civil rights and other causes.

The Progressive Caucus is co-chaired by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota. We asked Ellison’s spokeswoman Jennifer Gore if any members of the caucus, which she said numbers 78, are communists: ""That would really be a surprise to us. ... I don’t know how anyone would know if someone was a card-carrying member unless he or she said they were,"" she said.

Eric Johnson, a consultant for Murphy’s campaign, joked in response to West’s claim: ""50 million Americans are living under communist rule if every member of the Progressive caucus is a communist."" (He multiplied the 78 caucus members times the average district population of 646,000 based on the 2000 census. That gets you to about 50 million.) The Communist Party responds

Communist Party USA does describe the Progressive Caucus as ""our allies"" on its website, and we found several other positive mentions of the Progressive Caucus on the site as well. But it also dishes out some criticism of Democrats in general as being ""accommodationist.""

There are no members of Congress who are members of the Communist Party, said Libero Della Piana, vice president of the Communist Party USA, which has fewer than 5,000 members.

Applicants have to apply through the national or local organizations and pay dues. Even if prospective members applied through a local group, Piana said he’d hear about it. (Generally, the party no longer issues cards. If someone asks for them, there are some older cards on hand.)

""Trust me -- if a member of Congress applied to join the Communist Party we would know about it,"" Piana said. ""It would set up some red flags -- pardon the pun.""

The Progressive Caucus promotes policies that the Communist Party thinks are better for the country than some promoted by other caucuses, but ""our support of their policies does not mean they support us or our policies. That is pretty much guilt by association on steroids,’’ Piana said.

We read West’s claim to Bertell Ollman, a professor who teaches political theory at New York University and an expert on Marxism. Ollman said he considers himself a Marxist and a communist with a small ""c’’, since he’s not active in a political party.

""I wish he was right,"" Ollman said of West’s claim. ""If it was even 10 percent true I would be dancing in the streets. It would indicate that the Democrats are much more to the left than they really are.""

And what’s the difference between Marxism, communists and socialists? Ollman said Marxism is more of an analytical tool, looking at what capitalism is as a system and how it works for some and not others. Communists draw more on Marxism than socialists do and are generally critical of socialists for being too moderate. Also, he added, communists tend to argue a lot more among themselves about political theory.

Our ruling

West said, ""I believe there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party who are members of the Communist Party."" West said he was referring to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and that the Communist Party has publicly referred to the Progressive Caucus as its ally. But just because the Communist Party has spoken positively about the Progressive Caucus doesn’t mean that the Democrats in that Caucus are communists. Heck, West has often pointed out that he and U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich -- a liberal Democrat from Ohio -- agreed on a  resolution  calling for withdrawing from Libya. That doesn’t make West a Democrat. West is using guilty by association here, and has failed to prove that any member of Congress is a communist.
