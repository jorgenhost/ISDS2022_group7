No evidence to support Paul Walker-Clinton conspiracy theory
","A recent Facebook post pushes a persistent conspiracy theory that the Clinton family murders their enemies — adding a tragic celebrity twist, again without proof. Sometimes dubbed the ""Clinton body count,"" these baseless claims say that investigators found the remains of missing women in steel barrels on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s property, and that Chelsea Clinton’s bodyguard was found dead in a river after telling ""damaging information"" about the family. (Here are some others that we have fact-checked.) This one involves Fast & Furious star Paul Walker, who died in 2013 after the car he was riding in crashed at a speed of more than 100 mph and burst into flames. Both Walker and the driver, Roger Rodas, were pronounced dead at the scene The Facebook post displays a black-and-white image of Walker and says:  ""Nov 30th 2013, his car hit a tree and caught fire. The video however, looks more like an explosion. He was set to come forward exposing the Clinton Foundations crimes against children in Haiti. He discovered this through his charity work."" It also shares a link to this one-minute YouTube video that appears to show footage of the crash from beyond a set of trees.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Outside of vague, unsourced posts, we couldn’t find any credible details that claim Walker had evidence of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation. The article mentions Walker’s charity work. The only connection between Walker and the Clinton Foundation is that both were involved in relief efforts in Haiti. The rest is speculation. Walker founded the nonprofit Reach Out Worldwide after he organized a relief team to respond to the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti. Reach Out’s website says that, while on the trip, Walker saw a need for skilled personnel in post-disaster situations and created the charity, which helps bring first responders to disaster areas.  There is also no evidence that the car was tampered with. The Los Angeles coroner's office report found that the Porsche Carrera GT was traveling near 100 mph at the time it impacted a power pole and several trees. Investigators determined that the cause of the fatal collision was ""unsafe speed for the roadway conditions."" Walker’s daughter, Meadow, did file a wrongful death lawsuit against Porsche, claiming that the carmaker took production shortcuts that prevented her father from surviving the crash. The two parties resolved the lawsuit in 2017 and kept the terms of the settlement confidential. As for this claim, it rates Pants on Fire!","[('Facebook post, July 21, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2504608142904547&set=a.1509253919106646&type=3&theater'), ('YouTube, security camera video, Dec. 4, 2013', 'No link'), (""The Guardian, Paul Walker died after crashing at over 100mph, coroner's report reveals, Jan. 3, 2014"", 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GColnCQmc7w'), (""ABC News, Paul Walker's daughter settles wrongful death lawsuit with Porsche, Oct. 24, 2017"", 'No link'), ('CNN, Coroner: Car carrying Paul Walker going 100-plus mph', 'https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/03/paul-walker-died-car-coroner-report'), (""CNN, Paul Walker death: Actor's fatal accident his own fault, Porsche says, Nov. 17, 2015"", 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/10/facebook-posts/no-evidence-support-paul-walker-clinton-conspiracy/

New York’s longtime stargazing permit draws new attention
","Update Feb. 13, 2020: The Free Thought Project, in a quick response, disagreed with our Mostly False ruling but also changed its post to reflect our findings. Shortly after we published our fact-check, the site changed its headline to make it clear the state requires a permit for only certain parks. In a note to its readers, the site explained the change, said it never intended to mislead them, and apologized for any confusion. The site acknowledged how its original wording -- that New York ""forces"" citizens to purchase a stargazing permit – could be interpreted differently by its readers, so it revised its headline.   A story about how New York state requires a permit to look at the stars in state parks at night appears to have started on Twitter. It spread among conservative and libertarian media outlets, whose writers pointed out what they called  the high cost of living in a state where Democrats control state government.  ""State Forces Citizens to Pay for ‘Stargazing Permit’ to View Night Sky in Public Parks,"" according to The Free Thought Project. ""With New York City’s bright lights making stars over the metropolis nearly invisible, many New Yorkers head to state parks to get a glimpse of the night sky, but now they’ll need permission from the state to do so,"" according to InfoWars. ""That’s right, citizens are being forced to pay fees to the state to enjoy taxpayer-funded parks."" Red State put it this way: ""Here is a story that shows progressive policies to be not only destructive, but also depressingly stupid."" Even astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted about it, saying, ""back in the day, you didn’t need permission to look up at the sky.""  A reader asked us to look into this claim, and given its coverage on the internet, we agreed.  We reached out to The Free Thought Project. Matt Savoy, who writes under the name Matt Agorist, said his post specifically cited state parks for night-time stargazing.  ""We are not claiming at all that people need to buy a stargazing permit to look up at the stars … only for after-hours access to the state parks,"" Savoy said.  Indeed, New York state requires a permit for stargazing in certain parks on Long Island. These parks include Hither Hills, Jones Beach, Montauk Point, Robert Moses, Sunken Meadow and Wildwood.  But the permit is not new, as some blog posts, such as Red State, indicated, and it’s unclear why it is getting attention now. The permit has been in place since the 1970s for select parks on Long Island, said Brian Nearing, deputy public information officer in the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. The permit, valid for a calendar year, costs $35 for state residents and $60 for non-residents. Permit-holders can park their vehicles in certain areas of the parks after dark for stargazing only.  The permit allows people interested in stargazing into areas of the parks that would typically be closed. The fee helps cover administrative, staffing and security costs at the parks, he said.  ""Access by permit helps prevent vandalism and criminal mischief as well as reduce the potential of the public putting themselves into a dangerous situation such as entering the water at our ocean beaches,"" he said.  For special astronomical events, such as meteor showers, the state often waives the fee, he said. The state maintains a list of scheduled stargazing activities in parks all over the state, like night-time nature walks and full moon parties. ""No one is ‘forced’ to apply for a permit that allows entry to these facilities beyond normal operating hours,"" Nearing said.  State parks users pay fees for other activities, too, like fishing and taking a four-wheel-drive vehicle on the beach.  Permits are handled on a regional level, Nearing said. The Long Island region began issuing stargazing permits decades ago as a benefit for residents of the heavily populated and developed New York City region, where the demand is high for after-hours access, he said. The demand is much less upstate, he said.  Stargazing without an express stargazing permit happens in other state parks, though other park fees may apply. Each state park has its own operating hours. Niagara Falls State Park, for example, stays open 24 hours a day, and the park charges for parking at all times.  The Free Thought Project said that New York State ""forces"" citizens to pay for a permit to look at the night sky in public parks.  The statement contains an element of truth. Indeed, there are annual stargazing permits issued in certain parks on Long Island to cover staffing and security costs for the stargazing areas of the parks that would otherwise be closed at night. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. The state doesn't issue such permits at other state parks, including Niagara Falls State Park, which remains open 24 hours a day. And for special astronomical events, such as meteor showers, the state often waives the fee.  We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Twitter, @SallyMayweather, tweet, Jan. 22, 2020.

Bloomberg wrong about North Carolina's primary rules
","Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is trying to boost election participation in North Carolina. But a recent piece of campaign mail offers misleading information about who can vote in North Carolina’s primaries. Bloomberg, who entered the presidential race late, has spent millions of dollars on television ads in an attempt to compete with other Democratic candidates such as Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and others.  In the letter obtained by WRAL, Bloomberg criticizes President Donald Trump for creating ""chaos"" while in office -- and asks the recipient for her support. Bloomberg then closes the letter with this line: ""P.S. North Carolina election law allows all registered voters, regardless of registration, to vote in the Democratic Primary."" The letter was first reported by The Richmond Observer. So is it true that any registered voter can vote in any party’s primary? No.  Semi-closed primary North Carolina has what’s known as a ""semi-closed"" primary, according to the NC board of elections. This means that anybody who is registered with a specific party can only vote in that party’s primary. Unaffiliated voters can also participate in one party’s primary election -- but only if that party opens its doors to those voters. In North Carolina, political parties aren’t required to open their primaries. Each of North Carolina’s recognized parties has until the first day of December to inform the NC elections board whether it wants to open its primary. This year, the Democratic, Republican and Libertarian parties will have open primaries, according to the elections board. In other words: if you are registered as an unaffiliated voter in North Carolina, you can participate in one of their primaries. Meanwhile, the Constitution and Green parties are closed -- meaning you have to be registered with those parties to participate. A follow-up letter It’s unclear how many letters the Bloomberg campaign sent in North Carolina. LaToya Evans, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg, told us that the campaign is working to rectify the situation. ""Last week, the campaign sent a letter introducing Mike Bloomberg and his record targeted at Democrats and unaffiliated voters in North Carolina,"" Evans said in a Feb. 4 email.  ""These voters can show up on election day and vote in the Democratic primary. We are sending a follow up mailer to those who received the letter to clarify how they can participate in the upcoming primary. We regret any confusion this may have caused."" In the meantime, the NC elections board is hoping voters will rely only on official government communications for information. ""We always encourage people to rely on county and state elections boards and their materials for reliable information about elections,"" board spokesman Pat Gannon told PolitiFact. Our ruling Bloomberg’s letter said ""North Carolina election law allows all registered voters, regardless of registration, to vote in the Democratic Primary."" That’s not true. North Carolina has a semi-closed primary.  If you’re an unaffiliated voter, you can vote in one of the major party’s primaries. If you’re registered with a certain party, you cannot participate in another party’s primary like Bloomberg’s letter implies. We rate this statement False.","[('Story by The Richmond Observer, ""Bloomberg campaign mailer gives misleading information,"" posted Jan. 29, 2020.', 'https://richmondobserver.com/national-news/item/7301-bloomberg-campaign-mailer-gives-misleading-information.html'), ('A PDF copy of a letter to North Carolina voters from the Michael Bloomberg 2020 campaign.', 'No link'), ('Information about the 2019 North Carolina primaries, on the NC State Board of Elections website.', 'https://www.ncsbe.gov/Portals/0/Forms/NOTICE%20TO%20UNAFFILIATED%20VOTERS.pdf'), ('Interview with Pat Gannon, spokesman for the NC State Board of Elections.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/07/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-wrong-about-north-carolinas-primary-rule/

No, Nancy Pelosi didn’t vow to impeach Trump again
","The Senate acquitted President Donald Trump of charges of abuse of power and obstruction on Feb. 5, but an old Facebook post suggests he could soon face another impeachment trial.  The Jan. 19 post has this quote over a photo of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: ""If the Senate conducts a sham trial, our caucus will just impeach the president again.

Headline falsely claims Mitt Romney could be removed from office over impeachment vote
","Utah Sen. Mitt Romney cast the only Republican vote to convict president Donald Trump in the impeachment trial – marking the first time in U.S. history a senator voted to convict a president of the same party. Trump was acquitted on both charges, but that didn’t stop Romney’s vote from making him a top target of misinformation online.  One viral blog post circulating on Facebook claims that Romney could be removed from office over his vote. Its headline reads:  ""#RecallMitt Movement: With His ‘Guilty’ Vote, Mitt Romney Could Be Removed From Office."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline makes it appear as if his vote alone could have him removed. That’s not true. The body of the post goes into specifics about a state measure introduced in Utah that would allow voters to recall their senators. It’s a proposal and not official law.  ""As Mitt Romney grandstands in the U.S Senate’s doomed Trump impeachment trial in an effort to demonstrate his own moral superiority, the Utah legislature is mulling a measure that would allow the state’s citizens to recall their senators. The measure could hypothetically be used to recall Romney from office."" The bill, HB217 was introduced on Jan. 29 by Rep. Tim Quinn and would create a system where Utah voters could set up a ""recall election to remove senators.""  Quinn maintains that the bill’s timing is coincidence and has nothing to do with Romney. He told Utah public radio station KPCW that the bill stems from constituents’ concerns with the 17th amendment, which established the six-year term for U.S. senators. The measure says 25% of ""active voters"" (Utahns who voted in the last two elections) would have to sign a petition requesting a recall vote. Senators could not be recalled within the first year of their term or within a year of the end of their term. But, if passed, the bill would likely face a constitutional challenge. Some states have recall provisions for state offices such as governor, attorney general or state representatives, but the U.S. Constitution doesn’t provide for the recall of federally elected officials. A similar legal precedent may be a 1995 Supreme Court ruling that struck down an Arkansas challenge to set term limits on its representatives. The court ruled that states did not have the right to impose requirements for individuals to qualify for federal office. The blog post’s headline falsely states that Romney could be removed from office over his impeachment vote. It oversimplifies a state bill that contains several requirements, hasn’t passed and may not be constitutional if it does.  We rate this False.","[('WebArchive.org, #RecallMitt Movement: With His ‘Guilty’ Vote, Mitt Romney Could Be Removed From Office, Feb. 6, 2020', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200207134135/https://happynewyear2020greetingscards.com/2020/02/06/recallmitt-movement-with-his-guilty-vote-mitt-romney-could-be-removed-from-office/?fbclid=IwAR11axar-uKbi0xekaoTdZHj0kTGKan3kMXOJUmcx5LrGKvrjVVqJ_kt4OU'), (""NBC, Trump world wages war on Romney as he fears 'unimaginable' consequences for impeachment vote, Feb. 4, 2020"", 'No link'), ('Utah.gov, H.B. 217 Recall of United States Senator, Jan. 29, 2020', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/romney-bracing-unimaginable-consequences-trump-attacks-his-impeachment-vote-n1131511'), ('KCPW, Wasatch Back Lawmaker Proposes Bill To Recall U.S. Senators, Feb. 1, 2020', 'No link'), ('National Conference of State Legislatures, Recall of State Officials, July 8, 2019\xa0', 'https://le.utah.gov/~2020/bills/static/HB0217.html'), ('Deseret News, Utah lawmaker files bill to allow recall of sitting U.S. senator, Jan. 29, 2020', 'No link'), ('Utah Policy, Legislative lawyers warn a bill establishing recall elections for U.S. Senators is unconstitutional, Feb. 6, 2020', 'https://www.kpcw.org/post/wasatch-back-lawmaker-proposes-bill-recall-us-senators#stream/0'), ('Cornell Law School, RAY THORNTON et al.

In an attack on Mitt Romney’s father, post exaggerates link to Saul Alinsky and Satan
","After U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney cast the lone Republican vote in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump, viral news about the Utah politician flooded Facebook. One post zeroed in on his dad: ""You see, his father, U.S. Senator George Romney, was a liberal Republican who had ties to Saul Alinsky, yes, the same dude who wrote the book, Rules For Radicals and dedicated to Satan,"" states the Feb. 6 post. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post wrongly called George Romney a U.S. senator — he was governor of Michigan between 1963 and 1969. (The author of the post later changed the wording to call George Romney a politician.) Gov. Romney was known as a moderate who was sometimes at odds with his Republican Party. In 1969, he was appointed by President Richard Nixon as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  A spokeswoman for Sen. Mitt Romney declined to comment. We found that Gov. Romney did meet with Alinksy, a famous liberal community organizer, in 1967. That’s not much of a tie. Nor is there much to the claim that Alinsky dedicated a book to Satan. Alinsky only mentioned Lucifer in one paragraph of his book. Alinsky was a Chicago community organizer who wrote the 1971 book ""Rules for Radicals: A Practical Primer for Realistic Radicals."" The book offers advice to activists seeking to influence public policy, covering topics such as class differences and tactics such as disrupting meetings and winning media attention. Alinksy didn’t dedicate his book to Satan. The word ""dedication"" isn’t included in the intro — though he does have a ""personal acknowledgments"" section where Alinsky listed his wife and editors. However, Alinsky did indeed include an opening blurb on Lucifer, attributed to Alinsky himself. The epigraph is one of three; the other two quote Rabbi Hillel and philosopher Thomas Paine. ""Lest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins — or which is which), the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom — Lucifer. — SAUL ALINSKY"" His point seems to be acknowledging Lucifer in a figurative sense, rather than advocacy for satanism. The rest of the book includes no real discussion of Lucifer or Satan, though it does talk about the way people demonize political opponents so that others see their opponents as ""devils."" As we noted, Mitt Romney’s father George Romney did meet with Alinsky. BuzzFeed reported that after the 1967 riots in Detroit, Romney met with Alinksy to discuss the grievances of the urban poor. The Library of Congress preserved photos of Alinsky meeting with black community organizers as well as meeting with Romney.  T. George Harris's 1968 book Romney’s Way quoted Romney saying to his ""reluctant white friends"": ""I think you ought to listen to Alinsky. It seems to me that we are always talking to the same people. Maybe the time has come to hear new voices,"" he said. A Facebook post said Mitt Romney’s father ""U.S. Senator George Romney, was a liberal Republican who had ties to Saul Alinsky, yes, the same dude who wrote the book, Rules For Radicals and dedicated to Satan."" The elder Romney was the Michigan governor when he met with Alinsky after the 1967 Detroit riots. That’s not much of a tie. And as for Alinsky, he did not dedicate his book to Satan. What any of this has to do with Mitt Romney’s impeachment vote? You’re guess is as good as ours.   We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Facebook post, Feb. 6, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/marcya.smith.9/posts/500325967568281'), ('BuzzFeed, Photo Exclusive: When George Romney Met Saul Alinsky, Jan. 24, 2012', 'No link'), ('Daily Kos, When Romney met Alinsky', 'https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/andrewkaczynski/photo-exclusive-when-george-romney-met-saul-alins'), ('New York Times, Full Transcript: Mitt Romney’s Speech Announcing Vote to Convict Trump, Feb. 5, 2020', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, Mitt Romney’s Mormon faith motivated him to vote for Trump’s removal from office, Feb. 5, 2020', 'https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2014/9/22/1331552/-When-Romney-met-Alinsky'), ('Vox, Who is Saul Alinsky, and why does the right hate him so much?

Does San Antonio have lowest per capita income of 'major' Texas cities?
","During a meeting with the San Antonio City Council, former mayor Henry Cisneros made a pitch for a new transportation plan that emphasizes roads over public mass transit. Cisneros, who served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton, highlighted the need for more money to go toward transportation and explained how this kind of investment could transform the city. ""We are a poor city,"" Cisneros said of San Antonio. ""We have the lowest per capita income of any major Texas city.""

Census figures show rankings To check this claim, we looked at yearly estimates of per capita income from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Per capita income is ""the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group,"" according to the Census Bureau. In this case, those groups are Texas cities. The per capita income is calculated by ""dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group."" The final figure is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. In 2018, the per capita income in Texas was $30,641. In the United States, it was $33,831. Looking at individual Texas cities reveals a wide range of values, from $65,743 in The Woodlands, a master planned community north of Houston, to $15,369 in Pharr, a city on the Texas-Mexico border east of McAllen. In San Antonio, per capita income in 2018 was $24,684. San Antonio is the second most populous city in the state (1.5 million), preceded by Houston (2.3 million) and followed in order by Dallas (1.3 million), Austin (964,254), Fort Worth (895,008) and El Paso (840,758), according to 2018 population figures.   Here’s the per capita income in 2018 in these cities, presented from highest to lowest: An analysis of the rankings of these cities each year from 2010 through 2018 shows that San Antonio is low on the list, followed by El Paso. Another way to assess income in a community is to look at median household income or median family income. Median household income includes the income of the householder and anyone else living in the home over 15 years old. This figure is different than median family income, according to the Census Bureau: ""Because many households consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than average family income."" Median family income looks at incomes of ""all members 15 years old and over related to the householder."" In 2018, the median household income in San Antonio was $49,024, lower than all of the six most populous Texas cities besides El Paso ($45,031). San Antonio’s median family income was $60,689 in 2018, a higher figure than Dallas ($58,835), Houston ($56,693) and El Paso ($50,245). Poverty in San Antonio Cisneros made this claim after stating that San Antonio is ""a poor city,"" so we also looked at poverty data available from the Census Bureau for the 10 most populous cities in the state. In 2018 in San Antonio, about 19% of its population was living below the poverty line — more than any of the other cities with populations over 500,000. Take at look at each city and the percent of its population below the poverty line, ordered from highest to lowest:  Another factor worth mentioning here is cost of living. San Antonio may be among the cities with the lowest per capita income, but the cost of living is also on the lower end. The Economic Policy Institute‘s Family Budget Map shows an estimated cost of living for a two-parent, two-child family in counties across the state. Here is the cost of living per year in the predominate county in each city with a population over 500,000, in order from highest to lowest: Our ruling Cisneros said that San Antonio has ""the lowest per capita income of any major Texas city."" San Antonio is among the six most populous Texas cities with the lowest per capita income. El Paso has consistently recorded a lower per capita income than San Antonio. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[],/factchecks/2020/feb/07/henry-cisneros/does-san-antonio-have-lowest-capita-income-major-t/

Donald Trump says Nancy Pelosi’s speech tear was illegal. That’s wrong
","President Donald Trump repeated a false claim about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., telling reporters on the White House lawn that Pelosi ""broke the law"" when she ripped up her copy of his State of the Union address. ""I thought it was a terrible thing when she ripped up the speech,"" Trump said. ""First of all, it's an official document. You're not allowed. It's illegal what she did. She broke the law."" ""It’s so disrespectful to our country,"" he added. ""And actually, very illegal, what she did.""  President Trump: ""I thought it was a terrible thing when she ripped up the speech. First of all, it's an official document. You're not allowed. It's illegal what she did. She broke the law."" pic.twitter.com/Co1j7ljpGU We fact-checked a similar claim when Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk first floated it on Twitter. Legal experts told us Pelosi was in the clear. The papers she tore up were not the official record of Trump’s speech, nor were they the only copy in existence. ""I take it that this is a printout of the Trump speech, in which case it is absurd to suggest that Pelosi can be prosecuted for doing with it whatever she pleases,"" said Heidi Kitrosser, professor of law at University of Minnesota. Since our fact-check of Kirk, Snopes and other news outlets have also concluded that Pelosi did not violate the law. So has Jonathan Turley, the George Washington University law professor who testified against impeaching Trump in the House Judiciary Committee. Even Fox News host Laura Ingraham, whose on-air commentary is typically pro-Trump, knocked the idea in an interview with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi.   The federal statute in question sets a penalty for anyone who ""conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys"" any government record ""filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States.""  The statute also says that any person with ""custody"" of a government record cannot ""willfully and unlawfully"" conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify or destroy it. ""The point of the statute is to prevent people from destroying records in official repositories like the National Archives or in courts,"" said Georgetown Law professor Victoria Nourse. Experts told us Pelosi’s move was not illegal because her copy of Trump’s speech wasn’t the official government record that would need to be preserved. The State of the Union text was never ""filed or deposited"" with her, nor did she have ""custody"" of it in the legal sense.  Trump handed her and Vice President Mike Pence copies before he began speaking.  President Donald Trump hands copies of his State of the Union address to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence before delivering it to Congress on Feb. 4, 2020, in Washington. (AP) ""Her copy of the State of the Union address is not a government record or government property at all,"" Douglas Cox, professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert in the laws on the preservation of government records, told us. ""It is personal property.""   Under House rules, members of Congress are encouraged to preserve their records or donate them to a research institution for historical study, Cox said. Unlike congressional committees, members are not legally required to hold onto their office’s files. ""They can keep them private, they can destroy them, or they can rip them up,"" he said. RELATED: No evidence Pelosi planned to tear Trump’s State of the Union speech at start This is in contrast to presidential records, which have been considered government property since the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and are supposed to be stored with the National Archives for safekeeping. ""The State of the Union is a presidential record, which must go to the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act,"" Nourse said ""(Pelosi) did not mutilate the record that is filed with the Archives."" There are probably countless copies of Trump’s address, such as the version the White House posted online. Pelosi’s action did not preclude future generations from accessing one. ""If the statute were not read this way, then any copy of the State of the Union held by anyone could never be destroyed,"" Nourse said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump said Pelosi ""broke the law"" by ripping her copy of his speech. That’s not how the law in question works. The copy Pelosi tore was not the official document that would be shipped to the National Archives for preservation.  We rate this statement Pants on Fire!","[('C-Span on Twitter, Feb. 7, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1225821330370711552?s=20'), ('Jonathan Turley, ""No, Nancy Pelosi Did Not Violate Federal Law . . .

Biden’s campaign moved a flag for an event, but not to avoid pledging allegiance
","On Jan. 24, before the Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, Jill Biden, the wife of former Vice President Joe Biden, held a meet-and-greet at a library in Corning, Iowa. Soon after, allegations about the Bidens’ patriotism appeared on social media.  Folks began sharing a screenshot of a Facebook post that claims the Biden campaign clashed with library staff over an American flag. ""This happened in my hometown this week in Iowa. It makes me so sad,"" reads the screenshot, which we found being shared on Feb. 2. ""Joe Biden’s wife stopped in town at the library this week. The library staff was told to remove the American flag as they did not want to say the pledge of allegiance. The librarian refused so the campaign people went out and took it down themselves! Now explain to me why someone representing her husband running for President of the United States would do this?""   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to the person who wrote the original post — the one that people are sharing the screenshot of — but we didn’t hear back. And it appears the original post recounting the flag flap has been removed from public view.  We also reached out to Joe Biden. In a statement, his campaign told us that before Jill Biden went to the Corning Public Library, a campaign staff member arrived and saw that the American flag in the conference room reserved for the meet-and-greet ""was not properly dressed."" In this case, according to the campaign, it wasn’t draped correctly.  ""Out of respect for the flag — because it could not be dressed properly in time for the event — the staff member asked the library if they were comfortable moving it to another room. The library staff member then moved the flag out of the room. In no way did this have anything to do with the pledge of allegiance and in no way did a directive come from Dr. (Jill) Biden. This is pure misinformation swirling around Facebook. The Bidens are a military family. Any insinuation they would somehow disrespect the flag — or our veterans — is shameful and categorically false."" We called the library, which referred us to Corning Mayor Janice Mercer Leonard. Leonard told us that she had heard several different accounts of what happened at the library, though she was not there to witness it herself.  Leonard said one of the librarians told her that Jill Biden’s staff arrived at the library before the event and wanted to remove the flag from the conference room, where it was hanging on a stand in the corner.  ""I heard two different stories,"" Leonard said. ""One was the advance staff asked to remove it and one story was they weren’t asked and just went ahead and set up the room the way they wanted to set up the room.""  The flag was relocated to the hallway, she said. ""What possible reason could there be to remove the flag?"" she asked. She heard two explanations from people she said attended the meet-and-greet but who did not see the room being set up. One person told Leonard that ""they didn’t want to say the pledge of allegiance,"" she said, and another told her that there was a smudge on the flag.  In a letter to the editor, Leonard pointedly questioned why the Biden campaign removed the flag.   ""Did you think you were going to have such a large turnout that you needed that two foot space in the corner where the flag was located?"" she wrote. ""Was this just a stop to check off little Adams County so you could say you visited all 99 counties?"" Snopes, which also looked into this claim, spoke with Fred Shearer, president of the library board in Corning. Shearer said the campaign rented the room and arranged it themselves, moving the flag ""probably 5 feet into a hallway next to the room,"" according to Snopes.  Our ruling A viral post says Joe Biden’s campaign told an Iowa library where Jill Biden was holding an event ""to remove the American flag as they did not want to say the pledge of allegiance."" It’s true that a flag was removed from the library conference room where Jill Biden held a meet-and-greet. While the mayor says Joe Biden’s campaign staff moved the flag and the campaign says a library staff member moved the flag, it’s clear that it was moved to accommodate the campaign.  But beyond unsourced reports on social media, we found no credible evidence that the flag was relocated to the hallway because Jill Biden didn’t want to say the pledge of allegiance.  We rate this Facebook post False. ","[('Mobilize America, Corning, IA: Meet and Greet with Dr. Jill Biden, visited Feb. 6, 2020', 'https://www.mobilize.us/joebiden/event/209340/'), ('Facebook post, Feb. 2, 2020', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Guidelines for display of the flag, visited Feb. 6, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2505516899702864&set=a.1570017469919483&type=3&theater'), ('Snopes, Did Biden’s campaign demand an American flag be removed from a library?

Evidence lacking that President John F. Kennedy smoked marijuana in the White House due to ailments
","Nearly 50 years later, Tommy Chong promoted his drug of choice by invoking one of Nixon’s political rivals and predecessor as president, John F. Kennedy. Chong, an actor and part of the former Cheech and Chong comedy team, made his plug for pot with a Jan. 30 post on Instagram that has more than 70,000 likes. The post features a black-and-white image of Kennedy in a shirt and tie. Kennedy appears to be exhaling smoke while holding perhaps a cigar of some sort. Text below the image claims: ""JFK SMOKED CANNABIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHILE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE HE SUFFERED FROM SEVERE BACK PAIN & ADDISON'S DISEASE."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Kennedy suffered from a number of serious ailments, including chronic back pain and Addison’s disease (which causes extreme fatigue and other symptoms). He was known for trying to keep them secret. He served less than three years as president before being assassinated in Dallas in 1963. There’s no proof he smoked marijuana to treat his ailments. We asked historians and consulted the history books. A 1998 book on Mary Meyer, one of Kennedy’s mistresses, recounted a 1976 National Enquirer story that said Meyer and Kennedy smoked marijuana once at the White House. The information in the article was attributed to the late Jim Pruitt, who by then was a former Washington Post editor, who said Meyer told him about the encounter. The Washington Post reported on the Enquirer article at the time. According to the Post, Pruitt confirmed his account about the marijuana smoking, said he had given the marijuana to Meyer, and he said the Enquirer had paid him for the story. But none of that goes to the idea that Kennedy regularly used marijuana at the White House in order to fight his ailments. Stacey Flores Chandler, a reference archivist at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, told us the foundation has Kennedy’s medical records from the 1950s and ‘60s as well as records of several of Kennedy's physicians.  ""I haven't found any evidence in either the records here or in secondary sources that the president used cannabis as a treatment for any of his medical conditions,"" she told us. Chandler also noted that historian Robert Dallek, who had access to Kennedy’s medical records, wrote about amphetamines, steroids, painkillers and other medications prescribed for Kennedy’s back and Addison’s, but made no mention of marijuana.  We messaged Chong’s website but didn’t get a reply. A social media post claims Kennedy ""smoked cannabis in the White House, while president, because he suffered from severe back pain and Addison's disease."" There is an unconfirmed, secondhand account that Kennedy once smoked marijuana at the White House. And he did suffer back pain and Addison’s, according to records.

President Trump scores with claim on number of U.S. workers
","President Donald Trump loves to brag about the economy. Trump frequently points to economic success to make his case for re-election. He did so in his State of the Union address — just as he did in his Jan. 14, 2020 visit to Milwaukee.  ""Very close to 160 million people are now working in the United States,"" Trump told a crowd of supporters in Milwaukee. ""Nobody's ever even come close to that number."" The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks a range of data including jobs, unemployment and the number of people working. Trump’s statement focused on one such tool to measure the economy — but it’s one that doesn’t consider changes to the population over time. How does the president’s claim rate? Breaking down employment numbers Trump claimed nearly 160 million people are working in the United States. When asked to back up the claim, Trump’s campaign pointed to data from the BLS’ Current Population Survey, also known as the household survey. The survey, best known for producing the national unemployment rate, samples households every month to provide a snapshot of the labor force at that time. The campaign specifically cited the seasonally adjusted version of the survey, which controls for changes in the market throughout the year based on seasonal events and does not show annual averages. According to that measure, roughly 158.8 million people were working in December. By comparison, the unadjusted data show 158.5 million people working in December, with a 2019 average of 157.5 million.  ""Just to note, this is different from the number of jobs added (nonfarm payroll),"" Trump aide Zach Parkinson said in an email. ""The BLS breaks down that difference here, but the short story is the employment level counts people with jobs, while nonfarm payroll counts jobs. Someone with two jobs would be counted once in the employment level, but twice in nonfarm jobs, so employment level is the better measure for seeing how many people are working."" The household survey also includes categories of workers not counted in other BLS measures, such as those who are self-employed and work in agriculture.  The Trump campaign is largely correct about the difference between the household survey and the Bureau’s other tool, known as the Current Employment Statistics survey, or payroll survey.  Both occur monthly, but the payroll survey samples businesses to determine how many jobs are on their payroll. Because this survey counts jobs, not people, someone who works at two different places will be counted twice, said Nicholas Jolly, an associate professor of economics at Marquette University. That survey tallied nearly 152.4 million jobs in December 2019 when seasonally adjusted. Context is key When Trump said nearly 160 million people are working in the United States, he added ""nobody's ever even come close to that number."" The implication here is that employment is better than it’s ever been. But the number Trump cites to support that claim isn’t the only — or the best — way to analyze it.  The U.S. population and size of the labor force have grown over time, with both at their own peak. ""If you look at the number of employed individuals, it is higher than it has ever been,"" Jolly said. ""That makes sense because the civilian labor force is higher than it’s ever been."" According to the BLS, the population of people 16 and over who are not in the Armed Forces or residing in an institution — such as a prison or nursing home — averaged 259.1 million in 2019. Compare that to  101.8 million in 1947 and 189.1 million in 1990. Indeed, that number has steadily increased over time. The same can be said for the size of the civilian labor force, which covers people who are either working or actively seeking employment. The average size of the labor force in 2019, unadjusted, was 163.5 million. In 1947, it was 59.3 million. When assessing the workforce, economists say it’s important to account for the overall population. The BLS has a tool for that: the employment-population ratio. This shows what percentage of the civilian noninstitutional population is employed. This is where the numbers start to deviate from the trend Trump referenced. According to unadjusted BLS numbers, 60.8% of the population on average was working in 2019. That percentage has increased gradually since 2010, as the country began to bounce back from the recession. However, BLS data show that peak employment occurred from 1998 to 2000, when the employment-population ratio sat at around 64%. The numbers today are trending back that direction, Jolly said, but are not currently at historic highs. Our rating Trump said: ""Very close to 160 million people are now working in the United States. Nobody's ever even come close to that number."" The president is on point with the numbers, but when you compare the number of people employed against the number in the labor force, the nation is not quite at its peak. Our definition for Mostly True is ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.","[('Email from Zach Parkinson, Donald J.

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We will save you the trouble of hand-cranking your own ice cream and let you know right now: We couldn’t find any evidence that this was true. And it just so happens your friendly PolitiFact writer has made homemade vanilla ice cream without preservatives. The recipe, a lot like this one, called for milk, cream, sugar, egg yolks and vanilla. The vanilla extract was brown. But because the amount of vanilla the recipe called for was a fraction of its total volume, the end product was merely off-white—a lot like the vanilla ice cream at the grocery store. Historical photos show ice cream of a similar color. Though it’s unclear what kind of ice cream the ""society women"" in this photo from 1900 are eating, the scoops are light. So what about that black ice cream? It was a trend a few years ago when some shops used activated charcoal to create it’s dark hue. Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream in New York sold a coconut ash ice cream cone. A 2017 Eater story says: ""The idea of charcoal as a detoxifier isn’t going away anytime soon, but consumers are now more interested in charcoal-tinted ice cream and pizza because it makes for excellent Instagram fodder. The black ice cream from shops like Morgenstern’s in New York City and Los Angeles’ Little Damage have been posted to social media thousands of times, along with inspiring countless copycats at ice cream shops across the country. This time, the craze isn’t necessarily attributed to activated charcoal’s purported health benefits. Instead, the appeal is directly attributed to the fact that black-hued dishes are relatively rare and unique — and also happen to look really, really cool."" The claim that vanilla ice cream used to be black appeared online around the same time. Snopes, for example, fact-checked it back in 2017.

Photo blaming environmentalists for trashing a park on Earth Day is really from a football tailgate
","A viral photo making the rounds on social media claims that environmentalists littered a California park on Earth Day. But the image wasn’t taken in California, nor does it depict the aftermath of an Earth Day event. Text below the viral photo reads, ""Earthday in California. This is how environmentalists left a park in California after an Earthday celebration."" The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo began to pop up online shortly after Earth Day celebrations on April 22. The image isn’t fake — but it is miscaptioned. The photograph was captured nearly 10 years ago to show trash that was left from a University of Georgia tailgate party following the school’s home opener football game against South Carolina on Sept. 12, 2009. A reverse-image search shows that the photo was published in a story by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in September 2009 to illustrate the trashed lawn. The newspaper reported that crews collected about ""70 tons of trash"" following the tailgate. A local radio station also uses the same photo, credited to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in a 2011 story about the university’s tailgating policies. The caption explains the scene was ""in front of the University of Georgia Law Library one Sunday morning in September 2009, the aftermath of tailgating activities during a football game the night before."" In response, the university tightened rules around tailgate parties but relaxed them in 2011. A viral photo that shows trash strewn across a lawn comes with the claim that the littering was caused by environmentalists after an Earth Day celebration in California. The photo has nothing to do with environmentalists, California or Earth Day. It was captured in 2009 following a tailgate party at the University of Georgia.

Levar Stoney mostly right about Richmond's rein on real estate tax rates
","The Richmond City Council passed a budget on May 13 that fulfilled Mayor Levar Stoney’s goal of increasing school funding, but rejected his call to raise the real estate tax rate. Seeking to generate $21 million - mostly for education - Stoney proposed lifting the tax rate from $1.20 to $1.29 per $100 of assessed value. The council instead came up with the money by cutting other spending and upgrading revenues forecasts. The next day, Stoney didn’t rule out seeking a tax increase again next year. ""I’m always going to swing for the fences,"" he said at a May 14 news conference. ""I’ll do whatever is necessary for our kids."" During a radio interview on WRVA that day, Stoney said Richmond is one of the few Virginia cities that has a lower real estate tax rate today than it did prior to the Great Recession - which started in December 2007. ""Richmond was one of the only cities in the state that did not roll back their real estate tax to those pre-recession rates,"" he said. Stoney made similar comments throughout the spring while trying to convince Richmonders they are overdue for a tax increase if they want to improve their schools in performance and physical structure. We wondered if he’s right that Richmond is among the very few cities that hasn’t raised its real estate tax rate to pre-recession levels. We turned to annual reports on tax rates in Virginia localities published by the state Department of Taxation. We charted the real estate tax rate enacted by each of 38 Virginia cities every year since 2006 - the last full year before the recession. The Great Recession began in the U.S. in December 2007 and lasted until June 2009, although its after effects lingered for several more years. Richmond’s real estate tax rate was $1.23 per $100 in assessed value in 2006. The next year, it dropped to $1.20 and has remained unchanged. Only five Virginia cities, five join Richmond in having a lower tax rate today than in 2006: Chesapeake; Hopewell; Martinsville; Norfolk and Portsmouth. Three cities have the same rate today they had in 2006: Lynchburg, Petersburg and Salem. The average rate for all cities was 96 cents in 2006 and $1.08 in the first half of 2019. That’s an average increase of 12 cents per $100 of assessed value. It could be argued that 2007 is a a more precise starting point because the recession didn’t begin until that December and all cities had their rates enacted by mid year. Anticipating a healthy economy, 16 cities cut taxes that year. Measuring from 2007, two cities now have lower real estate tax rates: Chesapeake and Martinsville. The rates haven’t changed in four cities: Richmond, Charlottesville, Martinsville and Salem. The average rate rose from 92 cents to $1.08 -- a 16-cent increase. It should be noted that even though the Richmond’s real estate tax rate hasn’t budged since 2007, tax bills for city homeowners have steadily increased. That’s because th4 assessed value to of real estate - to which the tax rate is applied - has risen. Recession and taxes Stoney’s mention of returning to ""pre-recession rates,"" raises the question whether there was a sweeping move by cities to cut real estate tax rates during the downturn. The answer is no. Thirteen cities lowered their tax rates between 2007 and 2010, with most of them at least returning to their old rates by 2013. Eighteen cities kept their rates steady through the recession and seven - mostly in Northern Virginia - raised their rates during the downturn. Our ruling Stoney said, ""Richmond was one of the only cities in the state that did not (increase) their real estate tax to those pre-recession rates."" His statement generally holds up. There are 38 Virginia cities. Richmond among only five that has a lower rate in the first half of 2019 than it did in 2006 - the last full year before the Great Recession. The Richmond rate was $1.23 then, and it’s $1.20 now. The recession began in the U.S. in December 2007, and if you start with that year, a slightly different picture emerges. City budgets went into effect in mid 2007 and Richmond’s real estate tax rate was $1.20 - same as it is now, not higher. So by this tougher measurement, Stoney’s claim falls a hair short. Only two cities have lower rates now than in mid 2007, and only four - including Richmond -  have held the rate steady. Finally, Stoney’s statement suggests that there was a wholesale move by cities to lower their rates during the recession. In fact, only 13 did. We rate Stoney’s statement Mostly True.  ","[('Levar Stoney, Radio interview on WRVA, May 14, 2019.', 'https://newsradiowrva.radio.com/hosts/richmonds-morning-news-john-reid?fbclid=IwAR2UCnng0EpdNo-waiwms2xC8SIRkdSBNpYz6MBuG8WmCHzETMVj7U2EJ3U'), ('Stoney, comments at a news conference, May 14, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Richmond Times Dispatch, ""Stoney doesn’t rule out pursuing real estate tax increase again as he touts budget approved by City Council,"" March 14, 2019.', 'https://www.richmond.com/news/local/city-of-richmond/stoney-doesn-t-rule-out-pursuing-real-estate-tax-increase/article_91815308-93c3-517f-ad06-00d217c0815b.html'), ('City of Richmond, ""Mayor’s FY 2020 budget makes historic investments in schools and streets,"" March 6, 2019. \xa0', 'No link'), ('Virginia Department of Taxation, ""Local Tax Rates,"" 2006-2018.', 'https://richmondvaannouncements.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2019-03-22T11:28:00-04:00&max-results=7'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/may/21/levar-stoney/levar-stoney-mostly-right-about-richmonds-rein-rea/

Fact-checking Wayne Messam on Florida law, mayors discussing gun reform
","Democratic presidential candidate Wayne Messam said he’d make the prevention of mass shootings his No. 1 priority if elected to lead the nation. Messam, a city mayor in the same county where the 2018 Parkland school shooting happened, claimed that his abilities are restrained now, because a Florida law prohibits him from even talking about changing gun laws. ""Last year, I sued the state to allow local leaders to protect our residents from gun violence because in Florida, it’s illegal for mayors to even bring up gun reform for discussion,"" Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Fla., said on his campaign website. Is it true that Florida mayors are legally barred from discussing gun laws? Messam’s claim needs context. The state Legislature in 1987 passed a law to give the state the exclusive right to regulate firearms and ammunition. And in 2011 the state added penalties that can be imposed on municipalities and local officials who violate the law by ""enacting or causing to be enforced any local ordinance or administrative rule or regulation"" on firearms and ammunition. The law doesn’t explicitly say they can’t talk about it. The penalties were added to prevent local officials from making and enforcing their own rules. Miramar and several other Florida cities have filed a lawsuit against the state. That lawsuit isn’t seeking to nullify the 1987 law that originally banned local officials from enacting gun laws, rather to get rid of the penalties added in 2011. What are the penalties? If a court finds the violation ""knowing and willful,"" the local official gets a civil fine of up to $5,000. The governor can also remove the person from office. ""The law appears to aim at stopping mayors from regulating via executive order,"" said James B. Jacobs, a law professor and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at NYU School of Law. ""But it surely doesn’t prohibit advocacy or discussion."" In recent years, including after the Parkland shooting, some mayors have publicly called for stricter gun control measures.  Messam’s lawsuit against the state acknowledges that penalties in the law are for voting on and enacting ordinances. But the penalties violate the right to free speech and have the effect of silencing officials, the lawsuit argues. Elected officials don’t even debate ordinances out of fear of being penalized, the lawsuit said, adding that the penalties ""impose substantial burdens"" on constituents and elected officials’ ability to ""engage in core political speech leading up to a vote."" Messam’s spokeswoman, Cassandra Fenelon, said the law opens ""many questions as it pertains to municipal authorities and exceptions."" As a result of ambiguities in the law and the accompanying penalties, Fenelon said, local municipal attorneys advise officials not to discuss or enact policies on firearms and ammunition. The Legislature intends ""to chill and deter local governments from taking any action at all that might affect firearms, even when such action might not be preempted,"" Fenelon said. Messam said that in Florida, ""it’s illegal for mayors to even bring up gun reform for discussion."" Florida law prohibits local officials from enacting rules on firearms and ammunition. There are penalties for officials who enact or cause the enforcement of such regulations. Officials may choose not to discuss changes to gun laws, since they can’t legally enact them. But that law doesn’t directly prohibit the discussion of gun laws. Messam’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Yes, U.S. suicides have risen by 30% in past decade and a half
","During a Fox News town hall, Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar made a pitch for greater attention to mental health services. She cited the mental-health difficulties experienced by farmers and veterans, and she told the story of her father’s struggle with alcoholism. She summed up by telling her audience that ""we’ve had a 30% increase in suicides in this country in just 15 years."" (It’s around the 25:00 mark.) That’s a sizable increase. Is she correct? We didn’t hear back from her campaign, but we found data that supports the statistic. The main suicide data page at the website of the National Institute of Mental Health includes data for the suicide rate between 2001 and 2017 -- a 16-year span, but close enough for our purposes. The data was collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To analyze Klobuchar’s statement, we used the national suicide rate -- that is, the number of suicides per 100,000 population -- rather than raw numbers of suicides, because using the rate factors out any increases that are simply due to population growth. In addition, the CDC’s numbers are ""age-adjusted"" -- a statistical process that evens out differences in the age of the population for better year-to-year comparisons. Here’s what the data shows: The rate went from 10.7 suicides per 100,000 in 2001 to 14.0 in 2017. That's an increase of 30.8%, making Klobuchar right on target Part of the reason for the rise may stem from better reporting of suicides, following the implementation of CDC’s National Violence Death Reporting System, said Carol W. Runyan, a professor of epidemiology and community and behavioral health at the Colorado School of Public Health. But she added that researchers believe there are substantive reasons as well. ""It is probably a combination of things, including inadequate access to quality mental health care, increased access to guns -- which are the most lethal means of attempting suicide -- and drugs, as well as social factors that relate to depression,"" Runyan said. Klobuchar said, ""We’ve had a 30% increase in suicides in this country in just 15 years."" Between 2001 and 2017, the suicide rate rose by exactly 30.8%.

Cory Booker points to Connecticut, where he says a tough gun law led to fewer deaths
","If he wins the presidency, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker says he will fight to deliver tougher gun control laws. In an interview on ABC This Week, the senator from New Jersey pointed to what he said was the success of a gun licensing law in Connecticut. ""When Connecticut did licensing, their shootings dropped, their murders dropped 40%. Suicides dropped 15%,"" he said. ""These are things that have been tried and done and that work."" We found that he correctly cited two studies, but experts said more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions. Booker was referring to two different studies about the effects of a 1995 Connecticut law requiring handgun purchasers to get a license. The law was passed after a series of gang shootings in 1993 and 1994 claimed dozens of lives. One study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2015 examined the impact of the Connecticut law on subsequent homicides. (Researchers were from Johns Hopkins as well as University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco.) Under the law, a prospective handgun buyer had to clear an application process that included a background check to obtain a license. The buyer also had to apply for a permit with local police. The law also raised the legal age to buy a handgun from age 18 to 21, and it required applicants to undergo at least eight hours of gun safety training. Researchers found the ""permit to purchase"" law was associated with a 40% reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. The reduction amounted to 296 lives. They determined this by comparing Connecticut’s homicide rates after the law went into effect to rates that would have been expected if the law had never passed. Researchers used comparison data from other 39 states that did not have a similar law. Researchers also discovered the large drop in homicides was found only in gun-related killings, not homicides caused by other means, which suggests the law was the driving force behind the reduction. The other paper, which appeared in Preventative Medicine, examined the effects of two opposing state measures on suicide rates. In addition to the Connecticut law, Johns Hopkins researchers looked at a 2007 repeal of a 1921 Missouri law that had required anyone who wanted to buy a handgun to obtain a permit from the sheriff’s office. Using similar methods as the homicide study, the researchers calculated the cumulative percent change in firearm suicides during the post-law change periods for Connecticut (1996–2005) and Missouri (2008–2012). They found a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with Connecticut's law. Missouri's repeal of its law was associated with a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates. Daniel Webster, an author of both studies and gun researcher at Johns Hopkins, said it is impossible to determine with certainty causal connections of the effects of the law.   However, researchers used the best available data and forecasted what would have happened to Connecticut’s homicide and suicide rates had the state never implemented such a law, he said. Webster said there is debate among researchers whether one should forecast counterfactuals — what would have happened without the law, in this case — for a longer period than 10 years. While generally more data are better in research studies, too many years of data can make it harder to determine the impact of a law in some cases. However, Webster said that he has extended his research to look at the impact of Connecticut’s gun law through 2017 and found that the trend of the impact of the law continued. Researchers plan to submit their findings to a journal. While other experts have cited the Johns Hopkins studies, the RAND Corporation in a 2018 review of studies found the effects of licensing and permitting on homicides and suicides inconclusive. (RAND examined thousands of studies about the effects of various types of firearm laws in various places.) RAND doesn’t consider studies about a single state to show a causal effect that can be generalized to the United States population.   ""These particular studies are well-conducted and useful, but are not scientifically definitive,"" Terry Schell, senior behavioral scientist at RAND, told PolitiFact. However, RAND’s ""inconclusive"" finding should not be treated as evidence that there is no true effect of the Connecticut policy or that Johns Hopkins findings were wrong, Schell said. RAND’s finding only concludes that more research — for example, in different states or using different methods — is needed. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, explained it to us this way: the Johns Hopkins studies are strong but they are not definitive proof of the impact of these laws. ""There is a strong belief that licensing is one of those crucial things if you want to get a handle on trying to reduce gun violence,"" he said. That’s different from other types of research that have been replicated multiple times, such as showing that seat belts help keep passengers safe. Booker said, ""When Connecticut did licensing, their shootings dropped, their murders dropped 40%. Suicides dropped 15%."" Booker is correctly citing research by Johns Hopkins University. Researchers found that Connecticut’s 1995 law was associated with a 40% reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. In a separate paper, researchers found a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with the law. However, more research is needed on the topic to draw further conclusions.

"['Economy', 'Taxes', 'Illinois', 'JB Pritzker']","
Pritzker’s latest sweeping tax claim falls flat
","Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker is mounting a full court press to overhaul the state income tax, and critics are equally aggressive in trying to stop him. That’s led to a lot of questionable claims on both sides about the financial upside of Pritzker’s plan to switch Illinois to a graduated tax from a flat tax. Pritzker fired yet another volley recently during an address before two big business lobbying groups which oppose his plan. The case he made for a graduated tax, which the governor calls a ""fair tax,"" was one we hadn’t heard before. ""States with a fair tax create jobs and grow their economies faster than we do,"" Pritzker said. It’s not our role to weigh in on the merits of the graduated vs. flat-tax debate. But in the past we have fact-checked sweeping assertions from both sides that failed to measure up on closer inspection. Pritzker’s recent claim, we found, doesn’t hold up much better. Forty-one states levy a broad-based tax on income, 32 of them under a graduated-rate structure. Pritzker, in his speech, didn’t go into specifics so we reached out to his office for details. Jordan Abudayyeh, a Pritzker spokeswoman, responded with an email comparing compound annual growth rates for employment and Gross Domestic Product in Illinois over a five-year period to those of five other states: California, New York, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, all of which tax income at graduated rates. Compound annual growth rates help to measure trends over time. ""Whether you compare Illinois to other large state economies or our neighbors with a fair tax, Illinois underperforms them on economic growth and employment,"" Abudayyeh wrote in an email. The data she sent us came from two federal sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Her figures for those states check out, but they don’t come close to telling the full story. GDP has grown at a faster clip over the past five years in all five states Abudayyeh cited than it has in Illinois, and every one but Iowa beat Illinois on employment growth as well. But that’s just a small sampling of states, and Pritzker made a sweeping assertion that doesn’t hold up when analyzing all 50 states. Pritzker’s analysis ignores that all but one of the nation’s nine flat-tax states also bested Illinois’ growth rate for GDP during that five-year period. And more than a dozen states with graduated tax systems saw rates more anemic than Illinois.’ The same pattern holds true for employment growth. In fact, more than half of all states that tax income — whether by flat or graduated rates — showed more pronounced economic growth than Illinois during the period Pritzker sampled. That says far more about Illinois’ own economy than it does about the merits of a graduated-rate structure compared with a flat tax writ large. Experts we spoke with agreed that Pritzker’s evidence was far from compelling. ""You can’t just pull out some handpicked states and say, ‘Well, they grew faster, therefore if we changed (rate structures) we’d grow faster,"" said Kenneth Kriz, a public finance expert at the University of Illinois-Springfield. ""There’s not enough ‘there’ there."" Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, also said Pritzker oversimplified things. A graduated rate structure is a tool by which states can raise more revenue without increasing the burden on those who make less, Auxier said. But there’s no guarantee doing so will provide a broader economic boost. ""The flip side of this is arguing you should get rid of your tax,"" he added, pointing to the growth enjoyed by large states such as Texas and Florida, both of which outperform Illinois yet levy no income tax at all. To be sure, none of this lends credence to the graduated-tax critics who predict dire consequences for Illinois’ economy should it switch rate structures either, though. Experts we queried told us existing research does not suggest any significant connection one way or the other between the type of income tax a state employs and its overall economic performance. ""Even those (studies) that are finding any effect, they’re never big effects,"" said Therese McGuire, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who studies regional economic development. ""I don’t think we have really strong evidence to go out and say anything strong."" Referring to a graduated income tax, Pritzker said ""states with a fair tax create jobs and grow their economies faster than we do."" To support that claim, a Pritzker spokeswoman pointed us to five states — two with large populations and three that border Illinois — that levy their income tax at graduated rates and saw greater economic growth than Illinois over the past five years, according to federal data. But that tiny sample overlooks what else those datasets show: GDP and employment increased at faster rates than Illinois’ in nearly every other flat-tax state as well, along with a number of states that levy no income tax at all. Experts told us a graduated income tax is not likely to solve Illinois’ every economic ill, as Pritzker suggested, nor drive workers and businesses away in droves as critics of his proposal predict. We rate Pritzker’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Tumors on deer in viral photo were not caused by Monsanto’s Roundup
","A disturbing photograph of a white-tailed deer covered with large tumors is back to making the rounds on social media. Text above the photo says, ""A deer became riddled with tumors from eating plants sprayed with Monsanto’s Roundup. It seems fairly common."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The hairless protrusions are called Cutaneous fibromas, commonly referred to as deer warts, and are found in deer herds in a majority of U.S. states, according to a report by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. As a result, the organization says, the warts are considered to exist in the entirety of the white-tailed deer range. But such fibromas are not caused by ""Monsanto’s Roundup,"" or any other herbicide. The warts are caused by a viral infection believed to be transmitted through various biting insects. The viral agent may also be transmitted through direct contact with damaged skin. Once the virus enters the skin, the warts have been found to start forming within about seven weeks. The disease is also temporary, researchers say, and only lasts about two months before it starts to regress in most deer. Kevin Hynes, a wildlife biologist at New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation, confirmed to PolitiFact by email that the protrusions in the photo are, in fact, fibromas. ""They are fairly common in N.Y. deer and are caused by a virus spread by biting insects or by direct contact; the virus does not infect humans or pets,"" Hynes wrote. ""Fibromas are typically found in younger deer and they usually regress, dry up and fall off leaving no evidence they were ever there. Fibromas only cause problems for deer if they cover the eyes or are very large and/or numerous (as in your photo) and become secondarily infected with bacteria.’"" While their appearance may be grotesque, fibromas are not typically harmful to the deer, according to a 2011 publication by the USDA National Wildlife Research Center. However, the report says, deer with heavy tumor loads may suffer from ""exhaustion and incapacitation due to tumors interfering with vision, respiration, food ingestion, and locomotion."" Occasionally, researchers say, the fibromas can create a bacterial infection. While our efforts to find the origin of this photograph using reverse-image searches were not conclusive, fact-checking website TruthOrFiction reported it first appeared in October 2017 on a Facebook page for hunters in a post that went over the actual cause for the growths. Regardless of the origin, we do know that the picture shows a deer with growths that appear consistent with a condition commonly known as deer warts. The claim that such blemishes are caused by an herbicide is not true. We rate this claim False.","[('Facebook post, May 8, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2522487981148199&set=a.498843040179380&type=3&theater'), ('Reverse image google search, May 15, 2019', 'No link'), ('Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, Cutaneous Fibromas: A Closer Look, Accessed May 15, 2019', 'https://www.google.com/search?num=20&safe=off&hl=en&q=deer+covered+in+warts&tbm=isch&tbs=simg:CAQSmQEJNiCpdhTEhsAajQELEKjU2AQaBggVCAIIBAwLELCMpwgaYgpgCAMSKPEKwxaOBPAKwhaNBPIK0AucFfcKjiq5OI0qsDiPKro42CuLKsgrxyAaMHCd-aS3Er6rfI5d8qB5CGtVA5wmIyeT_1UjM-fESKcg1IK37gpD_1K47fXpJhZYSY0CAEDAsQjq7-CBoKCggIARIE36N9FQw&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjnuj1zIveAhWF_1QKHSuxCXQQ2A4IKigB&biw=1185&bih=601#imgrc=_'), ('Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Accessed May 15, 2019', 'No link'), ('USDA National Wildlife Research Center, Diseases and Parasites [of White-tailed Deer], 2011; Accessed May 15, 2019', 'https://www.mdwfp.com/wildlife-hunting/deer-program/diseases-and-abnormalities/cutaneous-fibromas.aspx?fbclid=IwAR24hMix2WgV8gfLnATxmkM0I_WZWHRRctcvbKa_-CaecQYur0ADHfwJIzk'), ('BuckManager.com, White-tailed Deer Warts, Feb. 10, 2010', 'No link'), ('Science Direct, Purification and chemical analysis of Shope papilloma virus, Accessed May 15, 2019', 'https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=2386&context=icwdm_usdanwrc'), ('TruthorFiction, The Case of the Monsanto Deer, Oct. 16, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Kevin Hynes wildlife biologist at New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation, May 16, 2019', 'https://www.buckmanager.com/2010/02/10/white-tailed-deer-tumors-or-warts/')]",/factchecks/2019/may/17/viral-image/no-deer-covered-tumors-viral-photo-was-not-caused-/

Del. Bob Thomas misstates provision in Virginia abortion bill
","During a recent radio interview, Del. Bob Thomas, R-Stafford, predicted abortion will be a major issue this fall when all 140 seats in the General Assembly will be on the ballot. He said Republicans need to campaign on a failed bill introduced by a Democratic legislator winter this that would have repealed some of Virginia’s abortion restrictions. Thomas said the laws ""safeguard"" against third-term abortions in Virginia, where two have been performed in the last 17 years, according to the state Department of Health. Talk show host John Fredericks, during the May 8 interview, asked Thomas to identify the ""safeguards"" the bill would have removed. ""One: The woman has a right to talk to the doctor who’s going to perform the abortion, and (Democrats) wanted to strip that out,"" Thomas said. There’s been a lot of partisan debate on this bill, but we hadn’t heard anyone say it would have deprived a woman of the her right to talk to the physician who was going to carry out her abortion. We wondered if Thomas was right. Thomas was referring to a bill introduced by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax. It would have repealed hospital building codes for abortion clinics and ended requirements that a fetal ultrasound be performed and offered to the woman at least 24 hours before her abortion. Most of the debate, however, focused on the bill’s provisions for rare third-trimester abortions, which are allowed if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would ""likely"" kill a woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" impair her mental or physical health. The legislation would have lowered the threshold from three physicians to one. That doctor would only have to certify that the pregnancy would damage a woman’s health. The ""substantial and irremediable"" test would have been repealed. Tran, under tough questioning by Republicans during a Jan. 29 hearing, acknowledged that her bill would allow an abortion when a mother is dilating. In a year when partisan control of both General Assembly chambers is up for grabs, Republicans are planning to use the bill and Tran’s statement to argue that Democrats support abortion until almost the time of birth. We asked Thomas to back his claim that the bill also would have rescinded a woman’s ""right to talk to the doctor who’s going to perform the abortion."" He pointed to a section that would have repealed requirements that the woman undergo an ultrasound and be presented with information about the benefits, risks and alternatives to having an abortion. Among the laws that would been erased was, ""An offer for the woman to speak with the physician who is to perform the abortion so that he may answer any questions that the woman may have and provide further information concerning the procedures and protocols."" Upon questioning, Thomas acknowledged that his statement was imprecise, and that woman’s - or a man’s - right to find a physician who will speak to her wouldn’t have been curtailed. He said his concern is, without the offer, many women wouldn’t ask to speak beforehand to the doctor performing the abortion. ""My speculation is that it’s very scary time wrought with emotion and you might not think you have the options you have,"" he said. ""Everyone wants these women to make the most informed decision they can,"" Thomas added. Our ruling Thomas said a Virginia woman ""has the right to talk to the doctor who’s going to perform the abortion and (Democrats) wanted to strip that out."" He’s referring to a failed bill that would have repealed many abortion laws, including a requirement that a woman be offered an opportunity to talk beforehand with the physician who will perform the procedure. The legislation was sponsored by a Democrat. The bill would not have tinkered with a woman’s right to choose a doctor who would speak to her before performing an abortion. It would have simply removed a requirement that she be offered an opportunity to speak to the physician before the procedure. There’s a big difference between those two provisions. We rate Thomas’ statement Mostly False.

No, Netflix doesn’t have a show to “make little boys into ‘sexy’ little girls”
","Not everyone is thrilled that former President Barack Obama and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, have signed a deal to produce shows and movies for Netflix.

It debuted in October 2018 — about five months after Barack Obama announced his Netflix production deal.

The Dancing Queen reality show followed and, as Vanity Fair recalled in this October 2018 article, the first two episodes show Johnson officiating a wedding of friends in full Alyssa Edwards drag, him buying his first home, and him visiting his childhood home in Mesquite, Texas.

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Dan Crenshaw']","
Are the vast majority of asylum claims without merit?
","During an appearance on"" The View"" in early May, U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw sparred with host Sunny Hostin as they discussed border security and immigration issues. ""Aren’t you bunching everyone together when you’re talking about undocumented immigrants?"" Hostin said to Crenshaw, a Republican from Houston, who was discussing new reports about the number of people apprehended in recent months after crossing the border illegally. ""Many of these people are seeking asylum,"" she said. ""What happened to our country’s promise of give me your tired, your weak and your poor; people who are truly coming here to seek a better life?""   ""As it turns out, about 80 to 90 percent of those don’t have a valid asylum claim, once we actually get their documentation,"" Crenshaw said in reply. This isn’t the first time PolitiFact has checked a claim about the percentage of asylum claims that are valid — we rated a similar statement from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions false last year.   The truth is, about 20 to 30 percent of asylum requests have been granted annually since 2009, but experts said that does not mean that the remaining 70 to 80 percent of cases are invalid. There are many reasons why an asylum case might otherwise be dismissed or closed. Asylum claims Before we dive into the numbers, let’s take a look at the two main processes for seeking asylum, as outlined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security: Affirmative asylum: a person living in the United States can voluntarily apply for asylum through this process — regardless of their immigration status or how they arrived in the country. Defensive asylum: a person can apply for asylum through this process to avoid being removed from the country — this process can only be pursued by people who are in removal proceedings. Defensive asylum claims can include those filed by individuals who were apprehended at the border while attempting to enter the country without authorization or by people here illegally who were apprehended by law enforcement officials within the country (at a traffic stop, for example). Crenshaw’s office directed us to a report from the Executive Office for Immigration Review within the Justice Department that looked at asylum cases that originated with a ""Credible Fear Claim,"" which falls under the defensive asylum process.   These claims originate from individuals who were apprehended by Border Patrol officers while attempting to enter the country without authorization and were placed into the expedited removal process. If a person in these circumstances claims to have a credible fear of persecution or torture if they were to be removed from the country, they meet with an asylum officer who determines whether to refer their case to an immigration judge for a full hearing. Once a case is referred to a judge, a person must submit an application for asylum to the court. The Justice Department data shows that in fiscal 2018, asylum was granted in 16% of cases that originated from a credible fear claim. About 29% of requests were denied and roughly 15% of cases were closed for administrative or other reasons. In the remaining 40 percent of cases, individuals who were booked with a credible fear claim did not end up submitting an application for asylum. While just 16 percent of these cases resulted in asylum being granted, experts said there are many reasons why cases might be closed or requests might be denied, regardless of the merits of a claim. And just because an individual does not submit an asylum application after a credible fear interview does not mean that they do not have a valid asylum claim, according to Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. ""One of the reasons it is so common to see people who pass the credible fear test and don’t ultimately apply for asylum is that they don’t know that they have to and are confused about the process,"" Pierce said. Some asylum seekers assume that their credible fear interview with an asylum officer is their application for asylum, since they are allowed to enter the country while they await their court date, Pierce said. But in actuality, they have to submit a paper application to the court formally requesting asylum. Looking at the roughly 15% of cases that were closed for unspecified reasons, Pierce said that this group could include individuals who applied for other benefits before an immigration court at the same time as they sought asylum and were granted those other benefits instead. ""When you’re in front of an immigration judge, there’s no limit to what you can ask for,"" Pierce said. ""When I first started practicing, my old boss used to say that I should throw as many wet noodles at the wall as I can to see what sticks."" Similar points were raised by the experts we consulted in our 2018 fact-check of a similar claim from Sessions. Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School, said cases can be dismissed for a number of reasons unrelated to the merits of an individual’s claim. ""Many cases are denied for procedural reasons not related to the merit of the claim, or because the applicants are unrepresented or poorly represented and therefore don't have the chance to make their case in an effective way,"" she told PolitiFact. James Hathaway, a law professor and director of the Program in Refugee and Asylum Law at the University of Michigan Law School, said it’s also important to count the number of cases that were reversed through the available appeals processes. The same is true for all asylum cases Another important caveat to consider is that credible fear claims do not make up the majority of the asylum cases that come before judges in the United States. Justice Department numbers show that, of all asylum cases closed in 2017 (the latest year with complete data available), about 20% of claims were granted and about 34% were denied. The remaining cases were closed or dismissed for unspecified reasons. Regardless of which dataset you consult, experts said the same things are true: just because a case is denied does not mean an individual does not have a valid claim (cases can be denied for procedural reasons unrelated to the merits of a claim); asylum cases can be closed or dismissed for many reasons, none of which invalidate an individual’s claim; and just because someone does not apply for asylum after claiming credible fear does not mean their asylum claim is not credible. Our ruling Crenshaw said that about 80 to 90 percent of individuals seeking asylum do not have a valid claim. While data shows that in 2018 about 16% of asylum cases that originate from a credible fear claim were granted and about 20% of all asylum claims were granted, experts said this does not mean that the remaining cases do not have merit. Crenshaw would have been accurate to say that 16% of people who apply for asylum after making a claim of credible fear have an eligible asylum claim, but the inverse — what Crenshaw said — is inaccurate. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.","[('Youtube, Texas Rep.

Can cell phones, Bluetooth defeat credit card skimmers?
","Should you be worrying about credit card fraud when you pull up to the gas pump? A post circulating recently on social media says you can deploy your cell phone to stay safe. An April 14, 2019, post on a Facebook page called ""Local Jackson County News WV"" told readers they can use their cell phones at gas stations to determine whether a pump has a credit card skimmer -- a device that can steal credit card numbers. The post said, ""Just a tip, When you pull up to the gas pump to fill up your car, get your cell phone and search for Bluetooth devices. If a sequence of letters and numbers show up don’t pay at the pump. One of the pumps has a credit card skimmer inside of it. All of these skimmers run on Bluetooth."" Can Bluetooth sensors always determine if there are credit card skimmers in gas pumps? We took a closer look. First, some basics: Credit card skimmers are real, and they’re illegal. When installed in gas pumps, skimmers listen for the data traffic from the credit card reader, record it to memory, and pass that data onto the pump controller. Skimmer technology has become so advanced that thieves do not have to return to the pump to retrieve the stolen information. Perpetrators can simply sit in their cars and download credit card information to a laptop. A special agent with the U.S. Secret Service told NBCNews last year that the agency recovers 20 to 30 skimmers a week, with an average skimmer holding information from 80 credit cards. Bluetooth can be a useful tool for consumers who want to protect their information, but they are far from foolproof. Paige Anderson, the director of government relations with the National Association of Convenience Stores, a trade group representing gas stations and convenience stores, told PolitiFact that there are too many kinds of credit card skimmers to rely on a phone to detect them. ""Some use Bluetooth technology, some use cell service, and some skimming devices store the data themselves,"" Anderson said. Vassil Roussev, a computer scientist and director of the University of New Orleans Cyber Center, said that a ""hit"" on Bluetooth ""could very well be an indicator of compromise by a skimmer, but it could also be any number of other devices within 30 feet or so, such as devices in other cars. More importantly, not finding one does not mean the pump is safe."" The skimmer need not be detectable by Bluetooth, he said, or it could be programmed to send signals only at certain times. ""Overall, I would say that this tip offers a low level of protection,"" Roussev said. Anderson added that checking for skimmers is something gas station owners and workers need to do on a daily basis. Retailers should conduct daily internal and external checks and take other measures to foil data thieves, she said. These practices reduce the risk of potential credit card theft, she said, though they may not eliminate it. Local Jackson County News WV published a post that said, ""Just a tip, When you pull up to the gas pump to fill up your car, get your cell phone and search for Bluetooth devices. If a sequence of letters and numbers show up don’t pay at the pump. One of the pumps has a credit card skimmer inside of it. All of these skimmers run on bluetooth."" Checking a Bluetooth sensor in your cell phone before inserting your credit card in a gas pump may be able to determine whether the pump has been compromised. However, skimmer technologies vary, and many types of skimmers won’t be detectable using the Bluetooth method. We rate the statement Half True.","[('Local Jackson County News WV, Facebook post, April 19, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/localravenswoodnewsbyjim/photos/a.580427098752759/2022145654580889/?type=3&theater'), ('Snopes, ""Can a Mobile Phone’s Bluetooth Sensor Be Used to Detect Card Skimmers?,"" Feb 19, 2019', 'No link'), ('NBC News, ""Secret Service cracks down on credit card skimming at gas pumps nationwide,"" Nov 23, 2018', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bluetooth-gas-pump-skimmers/'), ('CNET, Credit Card Thieves, April 4, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Paige Anderson, NACS, April 22, 2019', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/secret-service-cracks-down-credit-card-skimming-gas-pumps-nationwide-n939496'), ('Email interview with Vassil Roussev, director of the University of New Orleans Cyber Center, May 16, 2019', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/may/17/facebook-posts/can-cell-phones-bluetooth-defeat-credit-card-skimm/

","Just what is the state of funding for public education in Wisconsin? According to Gov. Tony Evers, it’s bad enough for residents to be voting to voluntarily raise their own taxes to fully fund schools. ""More than a million Wisconsinites have voted to raise their own property taxes because Republicans have failed to fully fund our public schools for the past eight years,"" Evers tweeted on April 3, 2019. Last year was a record year for school referendums, as voters approved more than $2 billion in additional school spending. But have 1 million residents really voted to raise their own taxes through referendums? And is it reasonable to attribute that decision to Republicans failing to ""fully fund"" schools? Let’s study up. Simply put, a referendum is a vote on a specific issue. Local school districts can propose referendums to replace or upgrade a building that is aging or becoming too small, or to approve spending for ongoing budgetary expenses beyond what is otherwise allowed. And these have spiked in recent years.     Wisconsin voters approved $1.8 billion in referendums in 2016, set a record of more than $2 billion in 2018 and voted for another $783 million in spring of 2019. Overall, voters across the state favored 45 of the 60 referendums in the 2019 spring election, a 75% approval rate. Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said the governor was referring to the number of voters who supported referendums since 2012. That data, gathered by the state Department of Public Instruction, includes both referendums for exceeding spending caps and building construction or upgrades. About 2 million voters supported additional spending of some kind since 2012 — 1.1 million backed taking on debt for buildings, and more than 900,000 supported additional money for ongoing expenses. In our view, the ongoing expenses number is more important. It represents borrowing for ongoing expenses, not capital projects such as buildings that aren’t as directly related to funding levels. Still, using just the second measure, Evers’ 1 million number is in the ballpark. A record number of referendums have been approved with the state under Republican control in recent years, but is it fair to connect those two facts? We’ll get back to Evers’ claim, but first a little primer on school funding. Local school districts are subject to state-mandated caps that were instituted by former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson. The cap — called a revenue limit — restricts how much money the district is able to spend per pupil. For 2018-’19, that limit was an average of $10,677 per pupil statewide. The revenue limit includes both money brought in through local property taxes and general school aids the state provides to local districts. The revenue limit was initially set to go up with inflation, but over time that changed. The increases slowed under Democrat Gov. Jim Doyle, and the limit was frozen starting in 2015-’16 under Republican Gov. Scott Walker. On a statewide basis, it has been frozen since. The state has steadily increased general school aids in recent years -- from $4.49 billion in 2015 to $4.6 billion in 2017 and $4.67 billion in 2019, according to Wisconsin Policy Forum. But since the cap hasn’t changed, that additional money simply provided tax relief by lowering the amount of property taxes districts were allowed to levy. It didn’t increase per-pupil spending. So districts that wanted to spend beyond the revenue limit needed voters to approve it in a referendum. Which brings us to the claim from Evers, who was the longtime state schools superintendent before being elected governor. Evers spokeswoman Baldauff said the ""fully fund"" part of the tweet references the caps Republicans have placed on school spending. ""At a minimum, fully funding our schools means allowing school spending to keep pace with inflation, with the state contributing a fair share of those costs,"" Baldauff said. ""While the previous administration eventually restored some of the funding they cut (state support of costs), they held spending relatively flat. Districts were forced to use referenda, their only tool available, to protect educational programming, retain staff, and keep the lights on."" So Evers draws a direct line from funding levels to referendum success. But many factors can affect whether voters support a referendum. Jason Stein, research director for Wisconsin Policy Forum, said other types of state aid and the health of the economy both can factor into voters’ willingness to support a referendum. For example, per pupil aid -- a category of state school funding that isn’t subject to the revenue limit — rose from $150 per student in 2015-’16 to $654 per student in 2018-’19. And of course there are local factors at play — a rise or decline in enrollment and the age and condition of the district’s school buildings could have played a role in the unprecedented level of spending approved by referendum in recent years. ""You don’t typically get record levels without multiple factors,"" Stein said. Evers tweeted that ""more than a million Wisconsinites have voted to raise their own property taxes because Republicans have failed to fully fund our public schools for the past eight years."" It’s not necessarily fair to blame construction-related referendums on funding levels — those are heavily determined by building condition and enrollment trends — but narrowing the focus to referendums for ongoing spending still shows more than 900,000 votes in support. That’s close to Evers’ claim of 1 million. Blaming Republicans for all those referendums over-simplifies the matter, however, ignoring other factors that can play a role in voters’ decisions. We rate Evers’ claim Half True.

Fact-checking median pay for black, Hispanic, Native American women
","In a tweet timed for Equal Pay Day, the West Virginia Democratic Party sought to spotlight differences in pay between women of color and men. The April 2 tweet said, ""Black women make only around 63 cents while Native American women earn 58 cents, and Hispanic women make just 54 cents in comparison to every dollar a man makes. Today we not only acknowledge the pay gap, we recommit to closing it. #EqualPayDay2019."" Black women make only around 63 cents while Native American women earn 58 cents, and Hispanic women make just 54 cents in comparison to every dollar a man makes. Today we not only acknowledge the pay gap, we recommit to closing it. #EqualPayDay2019 pic.twitter.com/rz5lb0SjZn Is this correct? After looking at the underlying data, we found that it’s not far off. When we contacted the party, they pointed us to a report produced by the National Partnership of Women and Families in April 2019. The report said that ""among women who hold full-time, year-round jobs in the United States, Black women are typically paid 61 cents, Native American women 58 cents and Latinas just 53 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men."" Those aren’t exactly the same numbers that the party offered, but they match the previous year’s version of the partnership’s report. So the data is slightly out of date. In addition, we should note that the state party left out part of the description. The National Partnership of Women and Families was comparing women who hold full-time, year-round jobs, not just women who are working any amount of time. And they were also comparing those figures to white, non-Hispanic men, not to men more generally. Potentially, this could make a difference. So we decided to look at the underlying Census Bureau data for the comparison the tweet actually made -- earnings by black, Native American, and Hispanic women compared to all men. Overall, according to the Census data, the median earnings for all male workers was $44,408. For black women, it was $29,708, and for Hispanic women, it was $24,245. That means that African-American women earned 67 cents for every dollar a man made, while Hispanic women earned 55 cents. The data for Native American women was harder to locate. The National Partnership of Women and Families pointed us to a different data set from the Census Bureau. According to that data set, men earned a median of $39,819, while Native American women earned $23,214. That works out to 58 cents on the dollar, as the tweet said. All told, the tweet’s figure for African Americans was off by four cents, the figure for Hispanics was off by one cent, and the figure was accurate for Native Americans. So, two of the tweet’s figures are off the mark, but not by much. A final note: as we’ve written previously, this figure refers to the general disparity between what men and women earn, and does not compare cases of apples to apples. These comparisons do not adjust for such factors as the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, or the years of experience they’ve had. Other studies have shown a closer match for men and women holding the same jobs. The West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted, ""Black women make only around 63 cents while Native American women earn 58 cents, and Hispanic women make just 54 cents in comparison to every dollar a man makes."" The tweet is right for Native American women, but the figures for black women and Hispanic women are 67 cents and 55 cents, respectively. That’s not exactly what the tweet said, but it’s not far off. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('West Virginia Democratic Party, tweet, April 2, 2019', 'https://twitter.com/wvdemocrats/status/1113161402972241920'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""PINC-05.

About 40% of people living in poverty are non-Hispanic white
","""When you’re white, you don’t know what it’s like to be poor,"" reads the text of a May 6 Facebook post featuring photos that show impoverished tableaus and a photo of Sen. Bernie Sanders. The quote is close to something Sanders said: ""When you’re white, you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto. You don’t know what it’s like to be poor."" We fact-checked the abbreviated quoted in 2016, and Sanders got it wrong — we rated it False. But we were drawn to a statistic at the bottom of the Facebook post. ""Fact,"" it says, ""70% of Americans in poverty are white. Stop dividing us. Stop pitting us against each other."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to Poverty Solutions, an initiative at the University of Michigan aimed at preventing and alleviating poverty, for insight about the Facebook post statistic. Natalie Peterson, a data and evaluation associate, pointed us to the most recent official poverty report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Income and Poverty in the United States was released September 2018 and reports on data for 2017. According to the report, nearly 39.7 million people were living in poverty in the United States in 2017. Of that group, 17 million were non-Hispanic whites. That means that non-Hispanic whites accounted for 42% of all people living in poverty. She also pointed us to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017. This is a broader measure of poverty in the United States, Peterson said. It includes people living together who aren’t related, including unmarried partners, and it has a wider definition of what qualifies as income, including non-cash public benefits like food stamps and Medicaid. By that measure, there were nearly 45 million people living in poverty in the United States in 2017. Of that group, 19 million were non-Hispanic white. That means that non-Hispanic whites accounted for 43% of people living in poverty under the supplemental poverty measure. Next, we asked Peterson about a 2012 Census Bureau presentation slide we found as we were searching around for evidence that 70% of people in poverty are white. The slide is titled: ""Are most people in poverty white?"" According to the slide, which looks at data from 1960-2011, 31.7 million whites were living in poverty at the end of the time period being studied. That’s compared to 14.5 million non-whites. That would mean that about 69 percent of those living in poverty then were white. But Peterson noticed a caveat: ""White,"" in this case, includes Hispanics who identify their race as white. Looking at historical data in the official poverty report, in 2011, 46.2 million people of all races were in poverty. Of that group, 67% of the all people living in poverty were ""white alone."" But looking at ""white alone, not Hispanic,"" the percentage dropped to 41% living in poverty. In 2017, among the 39.7 million people living in poverty, 26.4 million were ""white alone,"" or about 66%, while those who were ""white alone, not Hispanic"" was 42%. The Facebook post claims that 70% of Americans in poverty are white. Including people of Hispanic origin, that’s close: In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, 66% of people living in poverty were white, including people of Hispanic origin. But that number drops to 42% — under the official poverty measure — when people of Hispanic origin are omitted. This Facebook post, published by a Facebook account called ""Fed Up Deplorables,"" shows people with fair skin in what look like seemingly poor, rural settings. And then there’s the quote from Bernie Sanders, which Sanders made in response to a 2016 debate question from CNN’s Don Lemon about ""racial blind spots."" His answer distinguished white Americans from people of color. So, while there are context clues that suggest this post is meant to give the impression that 70% of people who live in poverty are not people of color, a strict reading of the claim leaves enough wiggle room that we can’t discount the fact that demographers sometimes use the word ""white"" to include those who describe themselves as being Hispanic. Because it depends on whether ""white"" includes those who are Hispanic or not, we rate the Facebook claim that white people account for 70% of Americans living in poverty Half True.","[('Facebook post, May 6, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/fudeplorables/photos/a.1440142929386125/2263654627034947/?type=3&theater'), ('PolitiFact, ""Bernie Sanders wrong to say, ‘When you’re white … you don’t know what it’s like to be poor,’"" March 7, 2016', 'No link'), ('The Washington Post, ""13 million people in poverty are disconnected from the social safety net.

No, Maxine Waters wasn’t indicted for steering TARP money to her husband’s private bank account
","U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has served California’s 43rd congressional district for going on 30 years; she was elected to her 15th term in November. She is also the first woman and first African American to chair the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services. It’s an appointment that’s drawn fire from detractors who are dusting off some old allegations against the congresswoman. ""In 2010, Maxine Waters steered $12 million in TARP funds to her husband’s private bank account. She was indicted but served no time,"" reads a May 6 Facebook post featuring a photo of Waters shrugging. ""2019, she will become the committee chair of U.S. Finances that oversees banks."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In 2017, PolitiFact checked a similar claim about Waters that was circulating online. Bloggers then said that ""California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts."" That got a Mostly False rating because it distorted the facts. Here’s how that allegation and this Facebook post intersect. In 2009, reports surfaced that Waters had allegedly helped the CEO of a bank called OneUnited secure a meeting to ask for $50 million in bailout funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program—or TARP—to help recover from the Great Recession. The bank ultimately got $12 million to help offset losses from investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to an article in the Los Angeles Times. But those reports triggered a House ethics investigation and, in 2010, the House ethics committee charged Waters with breaking three rules by allegedly trying to assist OneUnited, a bank in which her husband held a sizeable stock share. Mikael Moore, Waters’ chief of staff, was also charged. In 2012, the ethics charges against Waters were dropped. A lawyer hired by the committee to review the case found Waters thought she had been acting in the interest of all minority-owned banks, not just OneUnited. She had called for a meeting to help those banks and ended her involvement when she learned OneUnited was part of the group. Moore was given a letter of reproval because the committee ruled ""he should have known"" about his boss’ ties to OneUnited and stopped helping the bank. Our ruling The Facebook post says Maxine Waters in 2010 steered $12 million in TARP funds to her husband’s private bank account. The post also says that she was indicted but served no time. This is incorrect on several points. First, OneUnited received $12 million in bailout funds, not Waters’ husband, though he did have a financial stake in the bank. That conflict of interest led to a congressional investigation after Waters called then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2008 (not 2012, as the Facebook post says) on behalf of minority-owned banks.","[('Facebook post, May 6, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/rondwyersettingtherecordstraight/photos/a.1073045076156839/2161524420642227/?type=3&theater'), ('PolitiFact, ""U.S. Rep.
