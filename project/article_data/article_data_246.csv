Website recycles 2017 information to claim Target is recalling Easter egg toys in 2018
","It is true that Target issued a recall for certain Easter egg toys, as claimed by a blog, however, the recall was for toys sold last year. ""ALERT: Massive Easter Egg Recall Leaves MILLIONS Of Children In Danger- THROW THEM AWAY- They WILL Kill Your Kids,"" said the headline for a story posted Feb. 8 on news24fresh.info. The story claims Target ""has issued a massive recall for water-absorbing egg toys ahead of Easter Sunday after discovering the object can expand inside a child’s body, causing life-threatening conditions if ingested."" Even though the story correctly identifies the toys and associated complications if ingested, it fails to mention that the toys were sold February 2017 through March 2017, with an April 13, 2017, recall date. The toys were recalled ahead of Easter Sunday 2017. Not Easter 2018. Facebook users flagged news24fresh.info’s story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. News24fresh.info’s website does not list any information identifying its mission statement, who runs it or who’s behind it. However, the website does accurately note that the recall involves Hatch & Grow Easter Eggs, Easter Grow Toys (with model number 234-25-1200 on the back of the packaging) and Hatch Your Own Dino (with model number 234-09-0016 on a label inserted in the packaging). The website also has the right description of the potential health problems and complications that can happen if a child ingests the toy; that surgery may be required to retrieve it from the body; and that it may not show up on an X-ray. The approximate amount of toys sold — 560,000 — its estimated $1 price tag and Target’s offering of a full refund due to the recall is also accurate, matching announcements posted by Target and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Target also told PolitiFact that the recalls in the news24fresh.info post were all from last year. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission told PolitiFact that generally there’s no end date to recalls, unless there’s an update about a company no longer being in business. Consumers can still follow up on Target’s 2017 recall for the described Easter egg toys, the commission said. Target did issue a recall for Easter egg toys. But it did so last year. While recalls generally don’t expire, it seems clear to us that by reposting this story, news24fresh.info is trying to trick people into thinking the recall is new.

Was Russia 'exempted' from latest round of North Korea sanctions?
","A few days after the United States announced stepped-up sanctions against entities doing business with North Korea, Laurence Tribe, a prominent Harvard University law professor, tweeted what he saw as an anomaly -- one that benefited the country at the heart of Robert Mueller’s investigation. ""Trump’s latest set of sanctions against companies and countries benefiting North Korea includes every nation but one making shipments to (North Korea). The one nation Trump exempted from his punitive ban was ... wait for it ... drumroll: Russia. How in the world did you guess?"" Trump’s latest set of sanctions against companies and countries benefiting North Korea includes every nation but one making shipments to NK. The one nation Trump exempted from his punitive ban was . . . wait for it . . . drumroll:Russia. How in the world did you guess? The notion that Russia might be helping North Korea evade sanctions has been widely speculated, and on March 3, the Washington Post ran a detailed story alleging that North Korea had essentially been laundering coal through Kholmsk, an obscure port in eastern Russia, for sale elsewhere. A reader asked us to take a look at Tribe’s tweet, so we did. Experts told us that Tribe has a point, but that he had garbled some aspects of his message. The sanctions are the latest round in an ongoing effort to isolate North Korea for its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons, as well as missiles to deliver them. On Feb. 23, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced what it said were ""the largest North Korea-related sanctions"" to date, ""aimed at disrupting North Korean shipping and trading companies and vessels."" Specifically, the announced sanctions targeted ""one individual, 27 entities, and 28 vessels located, registered, or flagged in North Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Marshall Islands, Tanzania, Panama, and Comoros. Under the sanctions, the department said, ""any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of U.S. persons or within the United States must be blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with any of the designated parties."" The department said the sanctions were enacted ""consistent with the North Korea Sanctions Policy and Enhancement Act of 2016 as well as the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017."" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin briefs reporters about new sanctions intended to pressure North Korea, at the White House on Feb. 23, 2018. (AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Russia was implicated, but not sanctioned directly, in the Feb. 23 announcement. The Treasury Department designated a Taiwanese citizen, Tsang Yung Yuan, for, among other things, having ""coordinated North Korean coal exports with a Russia-based North Korean broker."" In 2017, the department said, Tsang and Marshall Islands-based Kingly Won International Co., Ltd., ""attempted to engage in an oil deal valued at over $1 million with the Russian firm Independent Petroleum Company."" The sanctions announcement also cited another suspected transaction involving Russia that involved the offloading of fuel oil from an unnamed Russian vessel. For this transaction, the Korea Samma Shipping Company, a North Korean-owned firm, and its oil tanker SAM MA 2 were specifically targeted in the new round of sanctions. So Tribe has a point that despite such allegations of Russian involvement, there were no Russia-flagged vessels or Russian-owned companies specified in this round of sanctions. However, experts offered several concerns about what Tribe tweeted. • Sanctions of these sort are issued as information allows. Just because no Russian entities are on the Feb. 23 list doesn’t mean there won’t be in the future -- or that there haven’t been in the past. ""The most recent sanctions list basically contains the names of firms that U.S. intelligence knows or thinks are involved in sanctions busting activities,"" said Stephan Haggard, director of the Korea-Pacific Program at the University of California-San Diego. As further intelligence is gathered and confirmed, that could change. Indeed, it’s important to note that the Trump administration has previously targeted Russian firms for North Korea-related sanctions, just not in this round. The Russian company cited above -- the Independent Petroleum Company -- along with one of its subsidiaries, AO NNK-Primornefteproduct, have already been sanctioned during Trump’s tenure in the White House. They were sanctioned on June 1, 2017, for suspicion of being ""involved in circumventing North Korean sanctions."" Trump has also publicly expressed concern about Russian actions in regard to North Korea. Shea Cotton, a research associate at the Monterey Institute of International Studies’ James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said that one of the few times he recalls Trump saying something negative about Russia was on the topic of North Korea sanctions. ""Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea,"" Trump said during an Oval Office interview with Reuters in January 2018. ""What China is helping us with, Russia is denting. In other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing."" • Tribe’s wording was imprecise. Tribe tweeted that Trump had ""exempted (Russia) from his punitive ban,"" but in reality, the language of the sanctions doesn't affirmatively ""exempt"" Russia. ""The term ‘exemption’ is wrong because the designation process goes after specific individuals, entities and ships,"" Haggard said. ""There are no ‘exemptions.’"" Indeed, this round of sanctions operated entirely below the country level. Tribe also referred to countries making ""shipments to"" North Korea, but many of the allegations of sanctions-busting activity has involved taking North Korean products and ""laundering"" them for sale elsewhere. When we reached out to Tribe, he said, ""I meant ‘to or from’ and was using ‘exempted from’ to mean ‘not included in’ or ‘excluded from.’"" • There may not be anything nefarious about why Russian entities didn’t make this list. Joseph DeThomas, a former diplomat and a professor at Penn State’s School of International Affairs, said that he, too, noticed the absence of Russian entities from the list. But he added that it would be wrong to assume that a desire to protect Russia is the reason why. ""It could be that the cases against Russian entities were not complete yet,"" DeThomas said. ""It could be that a diplomatic process is going on behind the scenes to get the Russians to crack down on something. It could even be that there are no new Russian entities to be sanctioned. It may turn out that there is something nefarious in the absence of sanctioned Russian entities but there are enough plausible alternatives to withhold judgment."" Cotton agreed. ""There are plenty of benign-ish explanations which could account for this,"" he said. ""It could be that the administration believes it can get Russia to comply with these without the need for sanctioning Russian entities. Or perhaps it believes Russia is making a good faith effort at enforcing these domestically and believes unilaterally sanctioning Russian entities would undermine Russian cooperation. It could also be that the administration has yet to obtain firm evidence regarding which Russian entities are involved and doesn’t want to do anything until they catch someone in the act."" In response, Tribe called such speculation ""quite empty and says nothing I’d not already considered."" Tribe said, ""Trump’s latest set of sanctions against companies and countries benefiting North Korea includes every nation but one making shipments to (North Korea). The one nation Trump exempted from his punitive ban was . . . wait for it . . . drumroll: Russia."" The most recent set of sanctions doesn’t specifically target any entity linked to Russia. However, sanction lists are dependent on intelligence findings, and when the U.S. government had intelligence relevant to sanctions-busting, the Trump administration has slapped sanctions on Russian entities in the past. In addition, while this sanctions list targeted violators, it didn’t proactively ""exempt"" any countries (something Tribe acknowledges). Finally, experts offered a variety of potential alternative explanations beyond Trump doing this to protect Russia. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/mar/06/laurence-tribe/was-russia-exempted-latest-round-north-korea-sanct/

Florida lawmaker mangles Nazi gun control history
","During a key vote in the Florida Senate to reject an assault weapons ban, Republican Sen. David Simmons argued that the original reason for the Second Amendment was so people could protect themselves from a tyrannical government. Simmons invoked the Nazis to drive home his point. ""Adolf Hitler confiscated all the weapons -- took all the weapons, had a registry of everybody -- and then on the night of June 30, 1934, sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents,"" Simmons said March 3. ""You think it doesn't happen in a free society? It does."" We reached out to Simmons and did not hear back, but Hitler’s gun policies are a familiar talking point among opponents of gun control, and one that we explored during the 2016 presidential campaign. Simmons’ statement misses several historical facts. By the time Hitler took power in 1933, Germany had been operating under the 1928 Law on Firearms and Ammunition. The measure relaxed strict controls imposed after World War I that banned all gun ownership, and created a system to register and sell firearms. Columbia University law professor Bernard Harcourt translated a couple of key provisions in the law that exempted ""officials of the central government, the states, as well as the German Railways Company"" and ""community officials to whom the highest government authority has permitted acquisition without an acquisition permit."" Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University, told us in 2015 that the Nazis introduced a collective gun license for members of Nazi organizations. One of the main beneficiaries was the paramilitary Sturmabteilung, or brownshirts. After the German parliament, the Reichstag, granted Hitler emergency powers in March 1933, he had a free hand. ""Under totalitarian rule, it took just a few weeks to drastically increase the number of Germans who held private weapons,"" Ellerbock said.  An armed member of the Sturmabteilung guards Communists arrested in Berlin following a key parliamentary Nazi victory March 5, 1933. (German Federal Archives via Wikicommons) At the same time, the German state confiscated weapons from Jews, Communists, Social Democrats and unions that refused to affiliate with the Nazi Party. Did the 1928 registration law make this easier? Perhaps, but Ellerbock’s research showed many holes in the system. For the most part, it recorded only new sales, while many people had unregistered weapons dating from World War I. When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation. ""In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns,"" Ellerbock told us. So registration was spotty, confiscation was selective and Nazi allies found it easier, not harder to get weapons. Much later, in 1938, the Nazis passed a new law that liberalized gun ownership in many respects, while simultaneously banning ownership and manufacture by Jews. Simmons brought up June 30, 1934, when Hitler ""sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents."" That was the night of Operation Hummingbird, Hitler’s crackdown on a very specific group – the Sturmabteilung that he had nurtured and encouraged to intimidate any group that stood in his way. The paramilitary group’s leader Ernst Röhm was eager to consolidate his power, and that set him on a collision course with established leaders in the German military and Hitler’s top advisers. They persuaded Hitler that Röhm was planning a coup. Over a span of several days, Röhm and scores of Sturmabteilung leaders were arrested and executed. The Nazis killed at least 85 people, most but not all associated with Röhm. Specific to Simmons’ remark, the incident had more to do with internecine fighting among the Nazi community than with going after disarmed citizens. Quite the opposite, the Nazi leaders knew full well that they were going up against a group that had plenty of weapons. At one tense moment, a truckload of armed brownshirts drove up to the hotel where Röhm was being arrested. According to Hitler’s chauffeur, Hitler himself walked up to the unit’s leader and told him to ""drive back to Munich immediately!' The man complied. Simmons said that Hitler ""took all the weapons"" and had a registry of everyone and then, on the night of June 30, 1934, murdered his political opponents. This oversimplifies and mangles the historic facts. While Hitler did take weapons away from Jews, Communists and Social Democrats, he also armed private citizens to better terrorize those same political opponents. To reduce Nazi gun policy to confiscation of weapons is to miss at least half the story. According to a German historian who has gone through the records, Hitler ""drastically increased"" the number of privately held weapons. On the confiscation side, she noted that the registry was limited and far from comprehensive. Contrary to what Simmons said, Hitler didn’t take everyone’s weapons and the registry at the time was so incomplete that many Jews retained their weapons. Furthermore, Simmons miscasts the connection between Hitler’s gun policies and the events of June 30, 1934. Far from targeting disarmed leaders, it was a strike at the well-armed pro-Nazi Sturmabteilung. Hitler’s real desire to disarm his opponents doesn’t overcome the flaws in this statement. We rate this claim False. Update (March 7): Simmons responds After we published we heard from Simmons. He told us that when he made his remarks, he was referring to the people Hitler subjugated and killed, primarily the Jews. ""I do not believe I am in error,"" Simmons said. ""All Jews were denied the ability to have weapons. They had registries of everyone who was Jewish. And they killed 6 million."" Simmons said that on the Senate floor, ""you only have so much time and you have to condense things."" Videotape of Simmons’ remarks shows no mention of the Jews. The claim we checked is complete and omits no context.",/factchecks/2018/mar/06/david-simmons/florida-lawmaker-mangles-nazis-gun-control-history/

In GOP Ohio primary for governor, Mary Taylor said Mike DeWine flip-flopped on guns
","Among Ohio’s Republican candidates for governor, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor portrays herself as more conservative than Attorney General Mike DeWine when it comes to Second Amendment issues. ""I do not trust Mike DeWine on guns,"" Taylor said during a Jan. 29 speech at the Washington Heights Baptist Church. ""He flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA. I have an A with the NRA."" Taylor and DeWine are competing in the May 8 Republican primary for governor with hopes to replace term-limited Gov. John Kasich. There is no disputing that DeWine once received an F grade from the NRA, which was based on his stances while in the U.S. Senate more than a decade ago. In 2002, the Columbus Dispatch described DeWine as a ""Republican who's not afraid to stand up to the National Rifle Association."" But when DeWine ran for Ohio attorney general in 2010, his positions on gun laws changed. Taylor omits that DeWine’s grades from pro-gun groups have risen as he has taken stances more in line with the NRA. The NRA did not respond to our requests to confirm DeWine’s grades, but DeWine’s campaign spokesman sent PolitiFact documents showing his grades by the NRA, as well as from a state group, the Buckeye Firearms Association. DeWine has served in elected office since he won a county prosecutor position in 1976. We largely focused our search of his gun stances starting with his tenure in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007. Taylor’s campaign spokesman Michael Duchesne pointed to Vote Smart’s compilation of DeWine’s ratings from groups that take stances on gun laws. The NRA gave DeWine a 46 percent in 2000, an 8 percent in 2006 and an F in 2010. DeWine supported multiple gun control measures while a senator, including restrictions on sales at gun shows and the assault weapons ban. In 1999, DeWine was one of a handful of Republicans to side with Democrats to support an amendment to enact a waiting period on sales at gun shows following the mass shooting at Columbine High School. ""The amendment seemed on balance to make sense,"" he said a year later. ""I feel that the requirement to follow the Brady gun-check law should apply to everyone at a gun show and that's what this amendment did."" In 2001, Dewine co-sponsored a bill with U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to impose a three-day waiting period on gun show purchases, which was opposed by the NRA. DeWine was outspoken in favor of extending the assault weapons ban. In 2005 when Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation to re-establish the expired ban, DeWine was among a group of bipartisan cosponsors. ""Re-establishing the assault weapons ban is simply good public policy. The law modestly prohibits a select few military-style weapons, all the while protecting the rights of legitimate gun owners nationwide,"" DeWine said. ""As a former prosecutor, I understand the challenges Ohio's mayors and law enforcement officials face, and we owe it to them to reestablish this law."" In 2006, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed DeWine in his re-election, according to news reports. DeWine lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Sherrod Brown that fall. The Columbus Dispatch later wrote, ""DeWine's 2006 defeat was primarily because voters were sick of the war in Iraq, not because they believe everyone in Ohio should own a machine gun."" In 2010 while running for attorney general, DeWine’s campaign told sportsmen and Second Amendment groups that he regretted his assault weapons vote, said Ryan Stubenrauch, who has worked on behalf of DeWine’s campaigns between 2010-18. Stubenrauch said that while DeWine was in the Senate, he heard from law enforcement officials who said they supported the assault weapons ban. But he later concluded the assault weapons ban ""didn’t do anything."" (Firm conclusions about the impact of the ban are not possible, PolitiFact has previously concluded.) In 2010, the NRA still gave DeWine an F. But his support from gun rights groups would change after he was elected attorney general. While attorney general, DeWine repeatedly took stances in favor of gun rights by supporting legislation in Congress and the Ohio Legislature. He also signed on to amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, including in support of the Illinois State Rifle Association, opposed a federal proposal to ban a certain type of ammunition and supported efforts to arm school teachers. In 2012, DeWine supported the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act to allow any person with a valid state-issued concealed firearm permit to carry the concealed firearm in many other states. He also supported state bills that removed some requirements for concealed carry license holders. When DeWine sought re-election in 2014, the Buckeye Firearms Association gave DeWine a B grade and endorsed him while the NRA gave him a C plus. DeWine’s campaign spokesman said as of Feb. 21 he wasn’t aware of any grade by the NRA for his current race. One other sign of DeWine’s pro-gun stance: He named Secretary of State Jon Husted, who has received an A plus from the NRA, as his running mate. Our rating will only be based on information that was available at the time that Taylor made her statement in January, but we will note that in February the Republicans split endorsements from state gun-rights groups. DeWine was endorsed by the Buckeye Firearms Association, and Taylor was endorsed by Ohioans for Concealed Carry. Taylor said DeWine ""flip-flopped on the gun issue and has earned an F from the NRA."" DeWine did receiving failing grades from the NRA based on his record in the U.S. Senate, including in 2010 when he ran for Ohio Attorney General. As Taylor noted broadly, DeWine did flip-flop. As attorney general he has taken several stances more aligned with the NRA and no longer supports an assault weapons ban. Taylor zeroes in on DeWine’s record from many years ago and omits that by 2014, he had clearly earned the support of the Buckeye Firearms Association when it endorsed his re-election.

Does America own 42 percent of the world's guns?
","In the aftermath of the mass shooting at a high school in Florida, politicians and pundits quickly offered facts and figures about guns in the United States. NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said that in one year, mass public shootings caused more deaths and injuries in France than in the United States throughout the entire Obama administration. (That’s Mostly False.) Bernie Sanders said that ""40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."" (That’s False.) In North Carolina, Democratic state Rep. Pricey Harrison of Greensboro recently tweeted statistics that emphasize America’s obsession with guns. ""The US has approximately 5% of the world's population and 42% of civilian gun ownership,"" Harrison tweeted on Feb. 15. She has about 4,000 Twitter followers. She continued: ""We must change the gun culture to gun violence prevention. NC Dems have filed comprehensive gun safety bills repeatedly since the Sandy Hook tragedy w/zero movement."" She’s roughly correct about the United States accounting for 5 percent of the world’s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Experts agree that Americans have more guns than citizens of any other country in the world. But, globally speaking, is Harrison right about the United States’ share of gun ownership? 10-year-old stats She cited a story on Vox.com – ""America’s gun problem, explained in 5 facts"" – as the source for her tweet. Vox, for its part, cites a 2007 study by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey. ""... in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people,"" the writer, German Lopez, explained. ""Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms,"" Lopez wrote. The Switzerland-based group actually offered a less specific estimate. On page 46 of the survey itself, the group estimated that the United States is home to ""roughly 35-50 percent"" of the world’s civilian-owned guns. Lopez, for his part, told PolitiFact that he split the difference in the range. ""It's pretty typical in research to just take the average of a range,"" he said. ""So the range here is 35-50. If you take the average of this, it lands at about 42. That's with a margin of error of about 7.5, obviously, but it's just a shorthand for what the research finds."" The Small Arms Study from 2007 remains the most comprehensive research private gun ownership worldwide, said Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama and author of the widely-cited study ""Public Mass Shooters and Firearms: A Cross-National Study of 171 Countries,"" published in 2016. The Small Arms Study is an independent research project located at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva that’s supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as donations from other governments. The project compiles data using a ""worldwide network"" of researchers. Lankford agreed with Lopez’s methodology. If you take the survey’s average total of civilian firearms in the U.S. (270 million) and compare that with the survey’s average total globally (645 million), you get 41.8 percent. Guns are hard to track A 2009 National Institute of Justice report found the number of civilian-owned guns in the United States to be about 310 million, but didn't provide comparable global data. Pew Research Center, one of the world’s leading nonpartisan research firms, recently published a study on guns in America that found 42 percent of Americans live in a household with a gun. But the center hasn’t collected data from other countries, ""so we can’t compare our US gun data to the rest of the world,"" spokeswoman Haley Nolan said. Governments don’t track firearms across the board. And many surveys rely on people to self-report guns. ""We only have a rough guess of what there is in the U.S. We have no idea how many guns are in South America,"" said Philip J. Cook, professor of public policy studies at Duke University and co-author of the book ""Gun Violence: The Real Costs.""  South America has a lot of guns that were bought underground, he said. In the ballpark? David Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard University and author of the book ""Private Guns, Public Health,"" agreed that global estimates are squishy. ""It’s very, very hard,"" Hemenway said. The best way to estimate the number of firearms in each country would be to have every country track guns that are bought and sold, he said. ""Even then, you only get the legal guns."" That said, he thinks Harrison’s claim is generally accurate compared to other estimates. ""That sort of number is thrown around all the time,"" Hemenway said. ""It’s pretty high validity. This seems to be in the ballpark of the figures I’ve seen."" Our ruling Harrison said that the United States has approximately 5 percent of the world's population and 42 percent of civilian gun ownership. Those numbers are based on a study that’s now 10 years old. And experts say tracking guns is very difficult. But Harrison’s claim is on roughly par with the information available.

Fox Business host makes 2 errors with steel tariffs and Electrolux deal
","A fair bit of uncertainty surrounds President Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Trump said he wanted a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, but the White House gave no additional details, such as whether any countries might be exempted. It’s also unclear how other countries might respond. Fox Business host Stuart Varney discussed the potential for retaliation, saying American producers of corn or beef might see new tariffs imposed overseas for their products. That all remained to be seen, but Varney ended with one immediate example he had just learned about. ""Electrolux, Sweden's largest appliance maker, has just abandoned a $250 million investment in the United States because of the steel tariffs,"" Varney said. ""That is retaliation."" We looked at two questions: Did Electrolux cancel plans to expand its plant in Springfield, Tenn.? And does its decision amount to retaliation? Electrolux said Varney got it wrong. It hasn’t canceled anything. ""It’s not accurate to say that we have abandoned the investment,"" said Daniel Frykholm, the top spokesman for Electrolux. ""We are concerned about the negative impact, financially and on the overall competitiveness of our U.S. operations. Until we have the final order and can understand the details, we are putting our commitment to invest $250 million in Tennessee on hold."" Electrolux buys only American steel for the Frigidaire-brand refrigerators, dishwashers and other home appliances it makes in the United States. The trade experts we reached said they wouldn’t call Electrolux’s move retaliation precisely because its operations are exposed to changes in the price of steel. ""If steel in the United States is now much more expensive because of Trump’s national security tariffs, then it would be cheaper to make the appliances in another country,"" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade Washington think tank. ""That is a business decision, not retaliation."" Frederick Abbott, law professor at the Florida State University College of Law, said legally, Electrolux’s announcement doesn’t fit the definition of retaliation. Exactly as Varney was saying before he mentioned Electrolux, nations retaliate, not companies. ""Action by a privately owned company would not be considered ‘retaliation’, which would generally be understood to refer to a governmental measure, such as the imposition of tariffs or quotas,"" Abbott said. The only gray zone in trade law, Abbott said, is in the case of state-owned industry, for example in China. But Electrolux is owned by a broad range of investors, including American retirement funds such as Vanguard and TIAA, and many others. Electrolux doesn’t fall into any gray zone, Abbott said. ""The decision by Electrolux would not be considered retaliation by knowledgeable trade lawyers and economists,"" Abbott said. We reached out to Fox News and did not hear back. Varney said that Electrolux had abandoned a $250 million investment in an American plant in ""retaliation"" for steel tariffs announced by Trump. The statement errs on two points. Electrolux said it had put its plans on hold until it better understood the impact on the price of steel, a key input in the home appliances it makes. Trade experts said that pause is a business decision, not retaliation. In trade, retaliation is the province of governments that might choose to slap their own tariffs on another country’s goods to get even for new tariffs their companies face. Electrolux did put its investment on hold, but beyond that basic fact, Varney was off the mark.

Rauner’s head-spinning claim that arch conservative opponent Jeanne Ives is a Mike Madigan lackey
","As governor, Republican Bruce Rauner has waged a ceaseless battle with Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. But in seeking re-election, Rauner also is fighting off a primary challenge from state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton, one of the most conservative Republicans in the House. The deep-pocketed Rauner is now seeking to combine his two political enemies into one by portraying Ives as a Madigan stooge in TV ads. One ad intersperses clips of Ives speaking about Madigan with an announcer leveling damning accusations. ""Who’s really behind Jeanne Ives’ campaign for governor?"" the announcer asks ominously. ""Mike Madigan’s corrupt insider machine. They’ve bankrolled her campaign with thousands in shady labor union cash, turning Ives into another Madigan lackey. Jeanne Ives, she can’t serve you because she already serves him."" Hyperbole and exaggeration are commonplace in political ads, but this one struck us as not just over the top but ridiculous. Ives is the ideological opposite of Madigan and his Democrats. How then could she be doing his bidding, as Rauner’s campaign asserts? We decided to take a closer look. We asked Rauner’s campaign to explain how it linked Ives to Madigan, and spokesman Justin Giorgio pointed to $6,900 in political cash Ives has received from a political action committee of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 in Countryside. The union represents heavy equipment operators and mechanics and industrial machinery operators. In an email, Giorgio described Local 150 as a ""Madigan-aligned labor group."" But Marc Poulos, executive director of the PAC, said it has donated to Democrats and Republicans alike who support road building and other construction projects. Ives, he noted, backed a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2016 that barred state officials from diverting transportation related tax revenue for other purposes. The group contributed most of its money to Ives before she announced her run for governor. Since 2010, the union PAC has given $13.9 million to Democrats and Republicans, state records show. Four political committees controlled by Madigan, including the Democratic Party of Illinois, have received more than $1 million from the labor group. But Republican legislative leaders, as well as rank-and-file GOP lawmakers like Ives, also received money. State records show that since 2010, the Local 150 PAC has showered $45,000 in campaign cash on current state Senate Republican leader Bill Brady of Bloomington, who is backing Rauner in the primary. Brady recorded receiving $5,000 of that as recently as March 1 at a time the Rauner attack ad on Ives was already airing. Another $32,000 in Local 150-connected donations have also been directed to Senate Republican caucus whip Karen McConnaughay of St. Charles. Meanwhile, House Republican leader Jim Durkin has been the recipient of $170,500 in Local 150 PAC donations since 2010, though the money flow has stopped in the current election cycle when the union broke with Durkin and began actively trying to defeat him. Rauner, however, has received no donations from the Local 150 PAC, records show. It’s interesting to note that Rauner’s campaign hangs its argument about Ives and Madigan on a tiny sliver of her political financing while making no mention of her main source of funding, Lake Forest businessman Richard Uihlein. Uihlein is the wealthy owner of a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company and a major donor to an array of causes and candidates attractive to the far right of the Republican Party, including the failed Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore. Records show Uihlein has donated $2.5 million to the Ives campaign for governor, about 70 percent of all money she’s raised since announcing her candidacy in December. Four years ago, Uihlein donated $2.6 million to Rauner for his initial run for governor. Also included in the Rauner campaign ad are video snippets of comments Ives made during a debate with Rauner earlier this year before the Chicago Tribune editorial board. At one point, she can be heard chastising Rauner for ""picking on Mike Madigan again."" At another point, Ives reacts to a Rauner comment about Madigan by saying, ""I don’t think that’s any way to deal with the powerful speaker of the house, Mike Madigan."" The context of her comments was far different from what the cherry-picked segments used in the Rauner campaign ad make them appear. The full video of the debate makes it clear Ives was not defending Madigan but rather criticizing Rauner for what she claimed was his ineffectiveness in working with and negotiating with the Democratic majority in the Legislature. Rauner’s campaign ad said: ""Who’s really behind Jeanne Ives’ campaign for governor? Mike Madigan’s corrupt insider machine. They’ve bankrolled her campaign with thousands in shady labor union cash, turning Ives into another Madigan lackey."" A political committee that has supported Michael Madigan and a number of other politicians of both parties gave money to Jeanne Ives. And records show the contributions to Ives total $6,900, a far cry from the $2.5 million she has received from a conservative businessman who once was a major donor to Rauner. Ives was once a loyal supporter of Rauner in the Illinois House, but broke with the governor last year because she claimed he had become too liberal on social issues. Central to her complaint was Rauner’s signing of abortion rights and immigrant rights legislation that Ives opposed and Madigan backed. That is hardly a portrait of a Madigan lackey. Indeed, it is the opposite. Rauner campaign claims about Ives and Madigan turn credibility and rational argument inside out.

Greg Abbott says Texas ranks among 5 top states for its high-school graduation rate
","Gov. Greg Abbott told voters in advance of the March 2018 party primaries that Texas ranks very high nationally in its share of students graduating from high school. In a conference call with campaign supporters, Abbott said Feb. 19, 2018: ""This is one of those facts that you are able to disarm liberals about. Listen, Texas has one of the top five states in the nation for high school graduation rate. More kids are graduating from high school, more kids are graduating from college than ever before."" It shouldn’t surprise that in fast-growing Texas, more students graduate from high school and college than in years past. We focused on whether Texas still ranks among states with the highest high school graduation rates. By phone, Abbott spokesman John Wittman told us Abbott relied on a federal chart showing state-by-state high school graduation rates in 2015-16. According to the chart, posted by the National Center for Education Statistics, Iowa led the nation that year with a 91.3 percent high school graduation rate. The chart says New Jersey ran second, with a 90.1 percent rate, followed by West Virginia (89.8 percent) and Nebraska (89.3 percent). Texas landed fifth, the chart says, with a rate of 89.1 percent, just ahead of Missouri (89 percent). The nation’s high school graduation rate was 84.1 percent, the chart says. That fifth-place standing means Texas didn’t rank as highly as some other years. We asked the Texas Education Agency about the apparent slippage. By email, Lauren Callahan replied: ""Yes, the rankings merely reflect relative performance and are accurate to the extent that the rates used for the rankings are accurate. However, we would like to also note that our graduation rate has consistently increased year over year for each graduating class."" The statewide graduation rate in 2014-15 was 89 percent, the agency says, compared with 88.3 percent in 2013-14, 88 percent in 2012-13 and 84.3 percent in 2009-10. Another metric From past fact checks, we recognized another method is often used to gauge progress through high school — by comparing a year’s count of graduates to the number of ninth-graders three years earlier, with the difference indicating student attrition. Julian Vasquez Heilig, a professor at California State University Sacramento, has urged us to put stock in the attrition indicator because, he said, it shows the substantial drop-offs in student enrollment between ninth grade and the end of 12th grade. After Abbott spoke, we looked for a recent state-by-state breakdowns--getting a reminder that there are two ways to make this alternate comparison. In 2014-15, according to the NCES, 89 percent of Texas high-school students graduated three years after finishing ninth grade. According to the agency, Texas tied Alabama and Nebraska for third place nationally by this metric with Iowa (91 percent) and New Jersey (90 percent) leading the nation. Texas lags more states by a cruder yet popular measure based on tallying high school graduates each year and comparing that count to the number of students who completed ninth grade three years before. In 2012-13, the latest year analyzed by the NCES, Texas tied with California with an ""averaged freshman graduation rate"" of 83.6 percent. Twenty states had higher rates, a center chart says, with Nebraska No. 1 (93.3 percent rate) followed by Wisconsin (93 percent), North Dakota (91.4 percent), Minnesota (91 percent) and Iowa (89.4 percent). For this fact-check, Heilig guided us to David Hinojosa of the San Antonio-based Intercultural Development Research Association, which has tracked high school completion rates for decades. By email, Hinojosa pointed out the group’s October 2017 report stating that through the 2016-17 school year, the state’s attrition rate, not counting charter schools, hovered around 24 percent to 25 percent for five years--down from 33 percent in the mid-1980s. ""Texas public schools are failing to graduate one out of every four"" high school ""students,"" the report says. To our inquiry, state education officials didn’t have a comparable attrition rate for 2016-17. DeEtta Culbertson, a TEA spokeswoman, emailed us agency information indicating that for 2015-16, the state calculated an attrition rate of 19.6 percent. Culbertson had no comment on the IDRA analysis. Our ruling Abbott said Texas ranks among ""the top five states in the nation for"" its ""high school graduation rate."" Texas ranked No. 5 nationally for its 2015-16 graduation rate. Abbott was not talking about an alternate metric by which Texas in 2012-13 trailed 20 states for its share of students graduating compared to the number of ninth-grade students three years before.

Jason Isaac makes Mostly False claim that abortion is the leading killer of black Americans
","A candidate seeking the Republican nomination to succeed Lamar Smith of San Antonio in the U.S. House says more black Americans die from abortion than any other cause. We wondered about that. State Rep. Jason Isaac of Dripping Springs, asked what policies he’d pursue to address safety and inequalities facing women and people of color, opened his reply: ""I will work to end abortion, which is the leading cause of death for black Americans and kills as many as 1,000 black children every day."" That question and Isaac’s full reply appear in a voters guide published before the March 2018 party primaries by the League of Women Voters of Texas and League of Women Voters Austin Area. Katie Tahuahua of Isaac’s campaign, asked the basis of Isaac’s claim about black deaths, responded by email that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease caused the deaths of the most U.S. black residents in 2015 (75,249). She noted that the year before, according to CDC figures representing data from 47 states, over 200,000 ""black babies were aborted."" Upshot: ""This is far more than the leading reported cause of death for black Americans,"" Tahuahua wrote. We’ll unpack those figures. But it’s worth noting for starters that Isaac’s characterization of abortions as killing babies is disputed. Abortion rights advocates, noting the Supreme Court legalized abortion in every state in 1973, typically refer to unborn fetuses. Also, the CDC doesn’t say abortions kill babies; it defines a ""legal induced abortion"" as ""an intervention performed by a licensed clinician (e.g., a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) that is intended to terminate an ongoing pregnancy."" In addition, an unknown share of aborted pregnancies wouldn’t have resulted in live children, due to the natural risk of miscarriages and stillbirths. Causes of death We confirmed from a CDC table pointed out by Tahuahua that heart disease killed the most black residents (75,249) in 2015 and also was the leading cause of death for all Americans. Lesser causes of death for black Americans included cancer, stroke and diabetes, the table indicates. The table doesn’t list abortion as a cause. Our own search of CDC-posted statistics led us to a table stating that nationally in 2015, 6,907 black infants died. Among the table’s 15 listed leading causes of death, disorders related to short gestation and birth weight accounted for the most deaths, 1,513, nearly 22 percent of the total. The table lists congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities as the second most-prevalent cause, accounting for 930 deaths, nearly 14 percent of the total. The table doesn’t list abortion as a cause. Abortions by ethnicity Tahuahua said Isaac got to his declaration of more than 1,000 black child deaths a day because the CDC ""reports that 35% of aborted babies are black."" For our part, we confirmed that the CDC says that in 2014, there were 652,639 legal induced abortions nationally. Apply the 35 percent figure offered by Isaac and it looks like black women obtained 228,423 abortions for a rate of 626 a day. Then again, Tahuahua noted, the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights, separately estimated 926,200 U.S. abortions in 2014 which, if you apply Isaac’s methodology, signals that black women obtained 324,170 abortions for a rate of 888 a day. The Guttmacher count of abortions appears in a January 2018 institute ""Fact Sheet"" that also says that white patients accounted for 39 percent of U.S. abortion procedures in 2014, blacks for 28 percent, Hispanics for 25 percent and patients of other races and ethnicities for 9 percent, according to an institute survey of abortion patients. Applying the institute’s 28 percent figure to the institute’s abortion count suggests that black women obtained 259,336 abortions for a rate of 711 a day. The institute’s May 2016 recap of its survey results also walks through the proportion of abortion patients in given subgroups (e.g., a particular age-group) relative to the proportion of all U.S. women aged 15–44 who are in that same subgroup--what the authors call an ""abortion index."" By this metric, the recap says, white ""women were slightly underrepresented among abortion patients in 2014, having an abortion index of 0.7, while black women were substantially overrepresented, with a relative abortion rate of 1.9. Hispanic women were slightly overrepresented among abortion patients in 2014 (1.2)."" Institute: Black women experience higher rates of unintended pregnancy The institute’s Rebecca Wind, responding to our query about Isaac’s claim, said by email that higher abortion rates among black women reflect higher rates of unintended pregnancy. A 2008 institute paper by Susan A. Cohen states: ""These higher unintended pregnancy rates reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high-quality contraceptive services and in using their chosen method of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time."" As of 2004, Cohen wrote, about one-third of abortions were obtained by white women with 37 percent obtained by black women. Overall, she wrote, ""black women are three times as likely as white women to experience an unintended pregnancy; Hispanic women are twice as likely. Because black women experience so many more unintended pregnancies than any other group—sharply disproportionate to their numbers in the general population—they are more likely to seek out and obtain abortion services than any other group,"" Cohen wrote. ""In addition, because black women as a group want the same number of children as white women, but have so many more unintended pregnancies, they are more likely than white women to terminate an unintended pregnancy by abortion to avoid an unwanted birth,"" Cohen wrote. We circled back to Isaac about our findings. He replied by email: ""You're correct that the CDC identifies heart disease as the #1 cause of death for black Americans; however, were abortion considered a cause of death, it would be the #1 cause by far."" Our ruling Isaac told the voters guide that abortion is ""the leading cause of death for black Americans and kills as many as 1,000 black children every day."" Opinions about this claim likely divide over Isaac’s definition of a fetus as a child--and by Isaac’s reasoning, we find this claim has an element of truth in that black women in 2014 accounted for about 711 U.S. abortions a day. In fact, however, heart disease was the leading cause of death for black and other Americans in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency didn’t list the abortion procedure among causes of death. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Georgia senator's False claim about Delta discount for Planned Parenthood
","Georgia state Sen. Michael Williams received some on-air fact-checking from CNN when he criticized Delta Air Lines for ending a discount partnership with the National Rifle Association while favoring ""liberal-leaning organizations"" such as Planned Parenthood. Delta ended a discount agreement with the NRA in order to remain ""neutral"" in the national debate over gun control, which resurfaced after a Feb. 14 mass shooting in Florida. ""If they're going to pull the discount for NRA members, why not pull it for Planned Parenthood or some of the left organizations out there?"" Williams, R-Cumming, claimed during a Feb. 27 interview with CNN’s Brianna Keilar. Keilar asked for his source of information to back up Delta discounts for Planned Parenthood. Williams said he and other state senators ""looked it up on Google."" ""Just to be clear, no, we looked it up as well. And it doesn't appear, after some digging, that we have been able to determine that that is actually factual, because you're indicating something that may not be true there,"" Keilar responded. Williams, who’s running to become Georgia’s governor, said he ""very firmly"" believed that Delta ""is out there giving discounts to left-leaning organizations as well."" ""But if you're making that argument,"" Keilar said, ""shouldn't you have your facts straight?"" Like CNN, PolitiFact Georgia found no evidence to support Williams’ claim. Williams’ campaign did not provide evidence to prove it, and Planned Parenthood told us there are no perks, discounts or deals that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member — whether with Delta or any other company. ""There are no corporate perks that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member,"" said Erica Sackin, director of political communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Delta did not respond to our query. Williams and Keilar’s debate continued off-air on Twitter: Keilar asked for backup on the Planned Parenthood claim. Williams tweeted back that his team had responded. Keilar said his statement still did not back up his ""bogus claim."" Williams ultimately tweeted a statement saying Keilar was pushing a ""false narrative."" Williams’ statement mentioned ""Delta's history of supporting left-wing organizations that donate to abortion provider Planned Parenthood."" That’s a few steps removed from what he said in the interview about Planned Parenthood receiving the discount itself. Williams started to backtrack from that in the Keilar interview. Here’s a transcript of the original exchange on CNN: Williams: ""You're telling me that Delta … is not giving away discounts to left-leaning organizations? Is that what you're telling me?"" Keilar: ""No, you told me that it was Planned Parenthood. I'm just talking to you about what you said to me."" Williams: ""I know, but is that not a left-wing organization? ... It is a very left-leaning organization."" Keilar: ""There's no indication they are giving discounts to that organization, is my point."" Williams: ""Again, let's, I guess, agree to disagree, because, again, we cannot -- bring me back on and I will have the information for you about where they're giving away these discounts to (a) left-leaning organization that support(s) Planned Parenthood.""
  So in addition to Williams saying Delta gives discounts to Planned Parenthood, he backs it up to say Delta has ties with left-leaning groups that in turn support Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions. That doesn’t check out either. Williams’ spin that Delta has ties to the Susan. G. Komen Foundation, which supports Planned Parenthood, is also wrong. ""A quick Google search reveals Planned Parenthood receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from Delta partner Susan G. Komen,"" Williams said in his printed statement. ""It's as simple as that. Has Delta cut their ties with the Susan G. Komen Foundation like they did the NRA?"" Andrea Rader, spokeswoman for the breast cancer research organization Susan G. Komen, told PolitiFact Georgia, ""Komen does not and has not had a partnership with Delta at either the state or national level."" Komen does have seven grants in local markets to Planned Parenthood, totaling $277,000, for breast exam services, Rader said. Williams may have conflated Susan G. Komen with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, an actual Delta partner. The Breast Cancer Research Foundation told PolitiFact Georgia it does not give money to Planned Parenthood. Greg Bluestein, a political reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, tweeted to Williams that Komen said his claim about a Delta partnership is incorrect. Williams tweeted back, ""They may want to issue a new statement"" and included a link to a website for Flashpoint Agency, billed as a marketing agency. Flashpoint Agency’ page has photos of a white and pink plane with a pink ribbon that appears to be Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s logo. ""As part of Delta’s work with the Susan G Komen Foundation Flashpoint was brought in to help launch the ‘Pink Plane’ for Breast Cancer Awareness,"" the website said, incorrectly identifying the partnership. We found a Reddit post where a user wrote ""Delta ends NRA discounts. Keeps relationship with Planned Parenthood."" The user included a screenshot of a Twitter exchange asking Delta, ""Did you end your discount for Planned Parenthood?"" The Delta Twitter account responded, ""Hey Stuart. We don't handle this over Twitter however I will send you the link below where you could find further information. http://bit.ly/2CRW68T  Have a fabulous day. *TLJ"" (Delta sent the user a broken link, which the user noted in a reply.) We asked Delta if it offered discounts to Planned Parenthood but the airline did not respond to that specific question. Delta shared a memo from CEO Ed Bastian to Delta employees regarding the company’s NRA decision and subsequent action by Georgia lawmakers to remove a jet fuel tax exemption from a tax bill that could have saved Delta millions of dollars a year. ""While Delta’s intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course,"" Bastian said. ""Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale. We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature."" Williams said Delta offers a discount to Planned Parenthood. We found no evidence that supports Williams’ claim. Planned Parenthood said its donors and members do not receive any corporate perks from Delta, and Williams failed to show that one exists. Williams’ campaign said that a Planned Parenthood supporter is a Delta partner, but that’s also not true.

","Fake news again targeted the Clinton Foundation with a story that falsely said a ship owned by the nonprofit was caught smuggling hundreds of people into the United States. ""Clinton Foundation Cargo Ship Raided At Port Of Baltimore Reveals Sick Secret,"" read the headline on a May 11, 2017, post on DailyUsaUpdate.com, a site we know traffics in bogus news articles. The secret, according to the story, was that 460 undocumented ""refugees from places like Yemen and Syria"" were hidden in 14 shipping containers aboard a ship called the Chelsea. The story said some refugees told authorities they had paid $40,000 for passage to the United States. Some of the other containers, the post claimed, carried other contraband, like illegal fruit and several kinds of drugs. The article was flagged by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake posts being shared in news feeds. It has appeared on other sites, as well. The Clinton Foundation was recently the subject of fake news posts that falsely said Chelsea Clinton had been charged with fraud for essentially stealing from the nonprofit, which was shut down.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim Russia story 'made-up' by Democrats
","In his interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt, President Donald Trump dismissed the very idea that there was any tie between his presidential bid and the Russians. ""This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump said May 11. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."" Made-up? By Democrats? With multiple investigations under way, we don’t know whether there was collusion between members of the Trump team and Russian interference in the election. But that isn’t the question. The question is whether Democrats plucked the idea out of thin air. A few highlights from the past year say otherwise. First, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report expressing with ""high confidence"" that the Russian government put its thumb on the scale in favor of Trump. ""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,"" the Jan. 7, 2017 report said. ""Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary (Hillary) Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump."" In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency was investigating Russian efforts to interfere with the election. ""That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts,"" Comey said March 20, 2017. Comey added that the investigation began in late July 2016. Asked what evidence it took to launch this sort of investigation, Comey answered, ""A credible allegation of wrongdoing or reasonable basis to believe that an American may be acting as an agent of a foreign power."" Let us pause here to note that these points alone rebut Trump’s description of this story. The investigation began with the FBI, not the Democrats. It started in July 2016, a full three months before the election. It was not invented, but was based on evidence serious and credible enough to launch an investigation. We can go further. Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating, and Republicans control both chambers. Democrats don’t set the agenda. Steven Aftergood with the Federation of American Scientists, a group that advocates for more transparency in government, said the fact of a Trump campaign-Russia connection is well established. ""It is supported by statements from Trump family members and associates, who have described financial relationships with Russian sources,"" Aftergood said. ""The only question is whether the various Trump-Russia connections violated any laws. That is what the FBI and Congress are trying to determine."" Lastly, former director of national intelligence James Clapper was asked in a May 12 MSNBC interview if he thought that the investigation was a witch hunt. ""I don’t believe it is,"" Clapper answered. Our ruling Trump said, ""This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."" The record shows that credible evidence led the FBI to begin investigating possible ties between the Trump team and Russia in July 2016. That is the start of the story, more than three months before the election. The American intelligence community expressed with confidence that Russia aimed to interfere in the election to harm Clinton and help Trump. Democrats did not create the story, nor do they control the agenda of the House and Senate committees which are conducting their own investigations.

"['City Government', 'Elections', 'Pennsylvania', 'Michael Untermeyer']","
Philly DA candidate who used to be GOP: Actually I’ve almost always been a D
","The race to become the Democratic nominee to be district attorney of Philadelphia is anyone’s game at this point, but two candidates have traded barbs more than the rest. Democrats Joe Khan and Michael Untermeyer, both former prosecutors, have spent the last several weeks launching negative attacks against each other ahead of the Tuesday primary. One of the most recent is a television ad spot put out by the Untermeyer campaign that connects Khan to the Bush Administration. In the ad, a narrator also claims that ""Michael Untermeyer has been a Democrat for more than 40 years."" But a spokesman for Khan’s campaign said that’s ""laughable,"" pointing out that Untermeyer twice ran for local political office as a Republican and told a columnist last fall that ""only a Democrat can win this office."" So who’s right? Prior to the current race to be the Philadelphia district attorney, Untermeyer unsuccessfully ran for political office three times. In 2007, he ran for sheriff as a Democrat; in 2009 he ran for district attorney as a Republican; and in 2011 he ran for City Council, also as a Republican. Sam Miller, a spokesman for Untermeyer’s campaign, said Untermeyer has been a Democrat for more than 40 years in total, but not consecutively. He said Untermeyer, who is 66, first registered as a Democrat in New York ahead of the 1972 presidential election, when the campaign says he voted for Democratic Sen. George McGovern, who lost to then-President Richard Nixon. Miller said Untermeyer moved to Philadelphia in the 1980s and remained a registered Democrat through 2009, when he switched his party registration to Republican before his first run for district attorney. Untermeyer addressed this himself in a 2009 Philadelphia Inquirer profile, saying before his run for DA: ""I was a Democrat until, like, 10 weeks ago."" The writer continued: ""The Democratic field for district attorney was crowded, and, [Untermeyer] said, he joined the race too late to become known before tomorrow's primary. He figured that as a Republican, he'd be the lone candidate and have until November to present himself."" Untermeyer’s current campaign says he switched back to Democrat in 2014, meaning that he would have been a registered Democrat for a total of about 41 years. Their claims about party switching in the 2000s also check out. City records show Untermeyer changed his registration from Democrat to Republican in February 2009, then switched back from Republican to Democrat in July 2014.  But counties in Pennsylvania switched to a statewide voter registration system in the early 2000s, so there’s no record of Untermeyer’s party affiliation in current voter systems from prior to 2006. The earliest voter registration form the campaign could produce was from 2003 and showed Untermeyer was a registered Democrat at the time.  The Board of Elections in New York City wasn’t able to pull Untermeyer’s voter history, and the New York state Board of Elections confirmed Untermeyer is no longer a registered voter in New York. That office also was unable to pull historical data on Untermeyer’s party affiliation there. So though Untermeyer has taken heat from Khan’s campaign for his past voter registration, his campaign is unable to prove he was a registered Democrat before 2003. But there’s also no evidence suggesting the contrary. The Untermeyer campaign is defending their candidate’s ""progressive"" values, saying he has believed in the priorities ""of the Democratic Party since he was at least 12 years old,"" producing a letter dated June 1963 from the Office of President John F. Kennedy that was responding to a correspondence from Untermeyer advocating for passage of civil rights legislation. Our ruling In a recent campaign ad, a narrator claimed Michael Untermeyer ""has been a Democrat for more than 40 years."" There’s nothing to suggest that isn’t true, though the campaign was unable to produce — and PolitiFact was unable to locate — any voter registration forms from prior to 2003. But the claim is leaving out a caveat: He wasn’t a Democrat for more than 40 years consecutively, and it certainly wasn’t the last 40 years. Untermeyer spent five of the last 10 years as a registered Republican.

The Republican replacement for Obamacare does not contain massive tax cuts for the wealthy?
","Regarding taxes, headlines about the Republican replacement for Obamacare were blunt: GOP Health Care Bill Will Result In A Huge Tax Cut For The Rich -- Forbes

One Certainty of GOP Health Plan: Tax Cuts for the Wealthy -- New York Times Republican health-care bill will 'cut the hell out of taxes' for the rich, says Warren Buffett -- CNBC Indeed, Buffett, the billionaire investor, said his personal tax bill would be 17 percent lower under the plan —a cut of about $680,000 on his tax bill of a little less than $4 million. So, it was puzzling to hear this exchange on May 9, 2017 between Erik Bilstad, a radio host at WTMJ in Milwaukee, and U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis.: Bilstad: Congressman, does this bill give massive tax cuts to wealthy Americans? Duffy: No; no. Duffy’s next words were a bit confusing, as he appeared to argue that in repealing Obamacare tax hikes, the GOP bill would benefit non-wealthy people, too: I mean, what happened was, if you look at even the medical device tax. Well, you can say the makers of medical devices may not be taxed, for example, but we all know that those medical device makers pass that tax on to middle-, average- and low-income Americans. They are the ones who actually pay that tax. I think that’s just a Democrat -- they’re throwing everything at the wall. Who wouldn’t expect Democrats, at every turn they could, to go, ""Tax breaks for the wealthy""? Well, that’s what they do. The upshot is: Duffy said the GOP replacement for Obamacare does not give massive tax cuts to wealthy Americans. As we’ve covered in a previous fact-check, there’s no question that people at the top of the income scale would be singled out for tax cuts that, over 10 years, are estimated to be worth what can be considered a massive amount: hundreds of billions of dollars. The bill In a major political victory for President Donald Trump and U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the GOP bill was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives five days before Duffy’s statement. Even Republicans, though, say the legislation will likely be changed in the Senate. The House version would repeal nearly all taxes contained in Obamacare and make other tax changes. No official estimates have been done on the current version of the bill, which was changed after the original bill was voted down by the House in March 2017. But the tax cut figures are expected to be similar. The tax cuts Obamacare imposed a series of tax increases, primarily in an effort to provide health coverage to nearly all Americans. Some of those were aimed squarely at the wealthy. We found U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., went too far when he said that under ""Trumpcare,"" as some Democrats call the GOP health bill, ""$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country."" Our rating was Half True. The tax breaks don’t help only the wealthiest -- but people on the high end of the income scale certainly benefit. Estimates on the original bill by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, which is staffed by independent professionals, put the value of the tax cuts at $600 billion over 10 years (2017 through 2026). Fully $275 billion would go only to high-income earners -- families with $250,000 or more in income ($200,000 for singles). That would be accomplished by repealing two of the key tax increases that fund Obamacare: a 3.8 percent tax on investments (capital gains, dividend and interest income) and a 0.9 percent Medicare surtax. According to the nonprofit Tax Policy Center: 85 percent of the benefits of repealing the investment tax would go to the top 1 percent of income earners. Ultimately, repealing the investment and the Medicare taxes would mean a 2 percent increase in income for the top 1 percent -- or $43,000 per year. Duffy’s staff argued that the GOP plan does not include tax cuts because it merely repeals tax increases, and that the tax increases themselves were never portrayed as ""massive."" But the $43,000 in additional income that the top 1 percent would get from the tax reductions begins to approach the median household income in the United States -- $55,775 per year. As for Duffy’s reference to repealing a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device makers, that could result in lower prices for average consumers. And some other tax changes in the GOP health plan would benefit the middle class. But that doesn’t negate the fact that other tax breaks specifically help the rich. Our ruling Duffy says the Republican replacement for Obamacare does not give massive tax cuts to wealthy Americans. The bill that some call ""Trumpcare"" includes the repeal of tax hikes that specifically target the rich. Indeed, over 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts would benefit only those earning $200,000 a year or more. We rate Duffy’s statement False.",/factchecks/2017/may/12/sean-duffy/republican-replacement-obamacare-does-not-contain-/

In Iowa, GOP's Blum off target on AHCA impact
","Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, faced a feisty crowd at a high school gymnasium in Dubuque when voters in his district pressed him on his vote for the House Republican health care bill, the American Health Care Act. Blum aimed to put the bill’s changes into perspective. ""This bill, Trumpcare — whatever you want to call it — is about the individual market only,"" he said May 8. ""That’s 12,000 people in my district. So if you’re in the group health insurance program through your employers, if you’re getting your insurance through the group health insurance, nothing changes."" In this fact-check, we look at whether the House GOP measure changes nothing in employer-based plans. In reality, the bill does change the rules in a couple of ways that could affect employer plans. But the impact is far from certain. Core benefits One of the changes has to do with a key amendment authored by Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J. It gives states the option to pick their own list of ""essential health benefits,"" the services that every plan must provide. Under the Affordable Care Act, that list includes 10 services, from hospitalization to prescription drugs to pediatric care and more. Under the American Health Care Act, states could apply for waivers to drop some items from that list. Some common examples are maternity care or mental health, services that weren’t always part of insurance plans before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Blum’s spokesman Paul Smith told us it is wrong to focus on the MacArthur waivers. Blum ""was speaking about the large-group market, not the small-group market where the MacArthur waivers could potentially apply,"" Smith said. Smith is correct that the amendment only addresses the individual and small-group markets. But that doesn’t settle the question. First, Blum spoke about employer-based insurance generally. The distinction between  small- and large-group plans might have been lost on his audience. Yet even if he was thinking about large employer plans, which cover about 110 million people nationwide, health law analysts say the Republican bill could touch those plans and those people, too. The link between the list of benefits and financial protection The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has two financial cushions for people. It bans annual and lifetime limits on coverage and requires insurance companies to put a cap on how much a person needs to pay out-of-pocket. In theory, no matter how big the medical bills get, they won’t drive someone into bankruptcy. The important thing is, both protections apply only to services on the essential benefits list. There’s another wrinkle. Companies that offer insurance through a large-group or a self-insurance plan are not required to provide every service on the essential benefits list, but for any item on that list that they do offer, those financial protections kick in. With that, we get to the significance of the MacArthur amendment. No one knows how many states will want to trim the essential benefits list, but the possibility could create some new options for the larger plans. ""Employers could choose to base the plans they offer on a definition of essential health benefits that is considerably weaker than the current one,"" Matt Fiedler, a health studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, said. Fiedler said any service not on a state’s list is not subject to the financial protections of no yearly or lifetime limits. Health law professor Allison Hoffman at UCLA gave the hypothetical case of maternity and newborn care. ""If the American Health Care Act becomes law, a state might define essential health benefits not to include maternity and newborn care,"" Hoffman said. ""Then, an employer could once again cap them."" Neither Fiedler nor Hoffman said that this would definitely happen; only that it could happen. Thomas Miller, a health law fellow at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, doesn’t argue the point. But Miller does downplay the significance. ""It's not unusual for the first round of voting on bills with recently revised amendments  to fail to connect and integrate fully with pre-existing law,"" Miller said. He described this intersection between the MacArthur amendment and current regulations, an ""indirect bankshot"" that has nothing to do with the amendment’s purpose or intent. Miller and Fiedler said the problem could be avoided through new regulations. End of the employer mandate Under the American Health Care Act, no one must buy insurance, nor do employers have to offer it. Fiedler called this change ""clear and unambiguous."" ""The Congressional Budget Office projected that there would be a change in behavior,"" Fiedler said. The CBO didn’t look at the individual and employer mandates separately, but in its initial assessment of the House Republican bill, it said eliminating both would ""substantially reduce the number of people with health insurance coverage."" Miller noted that since large employers regularly offer insurance in order to compete for workers, keeping or ending the mandate would make little difference. Our ruling Blum said for people who get their insurance through their employer, the American Health Care Act changes nothing. The experts we reached said that there actually is a way that the GOP bill could affect employer plans. States could decide to trim the list of essential health services. Employers could still offer a fuller range of services, but the extra ones wouldn’t be subject to the rules that protect households against massive medical bills. No expert said this was certain to happen. Right now, it is a legal possibility. The end of the employer mandate also changes the rules for large employers, ending penalties for those that don’t offer insurance. But for different reasons, the impact is uncertain. Blum's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. We rate it Half True.

CDC accepts all manner of reported vaccination effects--even symptoms of the Hulk
","Addressing a physician during testimony about Texas laws affecting vaccinations, state Rep. Bill Zedler said a federal program that gathers reports of vaccination side-effects doesn’t draw in all kinds of outcomes. The Houston physician disputed Zedler on that, leading us to roll out the Truth-O-Meter. We heard about the pair’s vigorous public back and forth from Jason Sabo, a lobbyist for the Immunization Partnership, a Katy-based nonprofit focused on eradicating vaccine-preventable diseases. Sabo emailed us a web link to a video excerpt from the April 25, 2017, hearing of the House Public Health Committee on House Bill 1124, which would make it easier for parents to opt children out of having immunizations required to attend public schools. The video initially shows Lindy McGee, a physician at Texas Children’s Hospital, opposing the measure on behalf of herself and the partnership. Zedler, R-Arlington, then pressed McGee about his conclusion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database that more people have died from the measles vaccination than from measles, a claim he repeated in our May 2017 follow-up interview with him (there’s a fact-check in the works). At the hearing, McGee replied that the database, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS, doesn’t ""report causality. People report to that system what they’ve seen. So I can report if I get hit by a truck after I’ve gotten a vaccine and that would be reported as associated with a vaccine. It does not make any implication of causality. That’s just the way it is."" McGee went on: ""So that is just everyone reporting any time they’ve had an adverse event, any time within a certain amount of period from having a vaccine. It does not make any implications about causality. That’s the way it’s set up."" The parry-and-thrust went on: Zedler: ""So in other words, all you’ve got to do is just think it could be."" McGee: ""Yes. That’s exactly what it is. So I could break my arm the next day and I can report that to that reporting system. And I want the reporting system, it’s meant to be set up that way because that’s how we can figure out if vaccines cause injury."" Zedler: ""No, no, no, no, are you going to tell me that if somebody got a vaccine, and within hours to days had died, that it’s not due to the vaccine?"" McGee: ""It’s not necessarily due to the vaccine, no, absolutely not. I could have a vaccine and I could get hit by a truck tomorrow and die. I could have a vaccine and I could commit suicide tomorrow and die. I could have a vaccine and have a heart attack tomorrow."" Zedler: ""Whoa, stop, stop. Nobody puts that down."" McGee: ""Yes, they do."" Zedler: ""No, they don’t."" McGee: ""Yes, they do."" Zedler: ""Let me tell you, that is patently false and you know it."" McGee: ""It’s not. You can look at it. You can look at the reports."" Zedler: ""So they put on there and they say, oh, just any death, and we don’t have to prove causality?"" McGee: ""Yes. It’s not a system to prove causality. It’s a system to track data and then the physicians or researchers at the CDC go and determine causality after that. It is not a system that could determine causality, it’s not."" Zedler said a moment later: ""For you to get up and tell this committee that in essence they can put anything down there they want is quite a dishonest."" McGee: ""No, you can. You can report anything you want to."" Zedler: ""Well, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I don’t buy that. And you know what? For you to tell this committee that is dishonest."" McGee: ""I welcome committee members to look up the system."" Zedler reaffirms statement We took McGee up on that, also reaching out to the CDC, also following up with Zedler, who said in an interview off the House floor that he was trying to say at the hearing that people don’t routinely report automobile accidents and the like as the result of vaccinations. ""Now you might find one or two kind-of unusual ones,"" Zedler said of reports recorded in the VAERS (pronounced vairs). ""That they were killed in an automobile accident--nonsense."" Program open to reports of effects from anyone The VAERS, according to the CDC, is a national vaccine safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration that, since its launch in 1990, has collected hundreds of thousands of reports of ""adverse events"" that occurred after the administration of vaccines in the United States. ""Anyone can file a VAERS report,"" CDC says, ""including health care providers, manufacturers, and vaccine recipients. The majority of VAERS reports are sent in by vaccine manufacturers (37%) and health care providers (36%). The remaining reports are obtained from state immunization programs (10%), vaccine recipients (or their parent/guardians, 7%) and other sources (10%)."" By email to our inquiry, CDC spokeswoman Martha Sharan stressed that the program accepts all reports without rendering judgment on clinical importance or whether a vaccine or vaccines might have caused the adverse event. Investigators focus, though, on ""the reports that ‘signal’ a possible safety problem,"" Sharan wrote. On its website, the agency similarly says that every adverse effect recorded by the program isn’t confirmed to have resulted from a vaccine. ""VAERS receives reports of many adverse events that occur after vaccination. Some occur coincidentally following vaccination, while others may be caused by vaccination,"" CDC says. ""Studies help determine if a vaccine really caused an adverse event."" Even the Hulk? Rehka Lakshmanan of the Immunization Partnership, responding to our inquiry, suggested we look up an anesthesiologist she described as having reported to the VAERS that after a vaccination, he felt like he was turning into the Hulk of Marvel Comics fame. In a July 2005 web post, Dr. James R. Laidler wrote: ""The chief problem with the VAERS data is that reports can be entered by anyone and are not routinely verified. To demonstrate this, a few years ago I entered a report that an influenza vaccine had turned me into The Hulk. The report was accepted and entered into the database. ""Because the reported adverse event was so… unusual,"" Laidler wrote, ""a representative of VAERS contacted me. After a discussion of the VAERS database and its limitations, they asked for my permission to delete the record, which I granted. If I had not agreed, the record would be there still, showing that any claim can become part of the database, no matter how outrageous or improbable."" We did not find primary documentation of Laidler’s described VAERS submission though he reaffirmed such actions in a phone interview. Laidler, of Portland, Ore., said he recalled submitting a report in the early 2000s stating that after a measles vaccination, his skin turned green, his muscles grew and he started having rage problems--all symptoms intended to show he was becoming the Hulk. Laidler said his greater point, in the face of others who were citing VAERS entries as an indication the measles vaccination causes autism, was that anyone may report any adverse effect of a vaccination to the program. By email, the CDC’s Sharan separately replied that the Hulk story ""is true."" Checking reported effects from Texas, U.S. Online, we queried the VAERS database for serious reported side-effects of vaccinations in Texas. Among 635 summarized results dating from 1990 into February 2017, we spotted one mention of suicide; after a person got a seasonal flu shot in 2013, he was diagnosed with Auto Immune Limbic Encephalitis, according to the entry, and had suicidal thoughts. We also looked for entries about car or truck accidents. According to one entry, a physician reported in 2008 that a woman who received a dose of Gardasil was subsequently ""found dead in her truck from a blood clot that traveled from her legs to her lungs."" Another entry says an 18-year-old woman vaccinated against meningitis ""passed out while driving her car and crossed over the highway into oncoming traffic"" before dying. A third entry says a woman who’d received a flu shot ""passed out while driving. She required emergency abdominal exploration for bleeding"" and internal injuries, the entry says. Our search yielded three reports of Texas heart attacks after vaccinations. In October 2007, an entry says, a 68-year-old man got a flu shot, then died from a heart attack by the next morning. In 2015, a person had a heart attack on the day he or she got vaccinated against pneumococcal pneumonia, subsequently spending five days in a hospital, the entry says. In May 2016, according to another entry, a 61-year-old man died after a heart attack and car accident that occurred 10 days after he got a shot. We ran a similar search for serious reported post-vaccination events nationally in the year up to March 2017. From 159 results, we identified a reported fatal heart attack reported in Indiana after a flu shot in 2016. Our ruling Zedler said a federal program that compiles reported side-effects of vaccinations doesn’t take in reports of extreme results such as road accidents, heart attacks and suicides. It looks to us, from our sampling, that some results such as suicides are rarely reported as related to vaccinations. Still, the CDC-run VAERS evidently accepts reports of all kinds of outcomes from all corners, though having a submission accepted doesn't equal federal confirmation that a vaccination caused any effects. Further investigation might. We rate Zedler's claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

GOP health care bill charges five times more for people over 50, liberal group says
","A group fighting against the Affordable Care Act repeal says that House Republicans voted for a health care bill that would lead to skyrocketing costs for older consumers. Save My Care, a health care advocacy group, launched an ad attacking two dozen GOP House members who voted for the American Health Care Act including U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Miami.   ""Congressman Curbelo just voted for a disastrous health care repeal bill opposed by the American Medical Association, AARP and the American Cancer Society. Curbelo voted to raise your costs and cut coverage for millions, to let insurance companies deny affordable coverage for cancer treatment and maternity care, and charge five times more for people over 50. Curbelo voted yes even though the bill makes coverage completely unaffordable to people with pre-existing conditions,"" the ad claims. The same ad also attacks U.S. Rep. Brian Mast who represents Florida’s Treasure Coast and members in many other states, including moderates who could face tough re-election campaigns in 2018. The ad is largely digital but in some districts it will appear on TV. Formed in 2016, Save My Care is affiliated with Eric Kessler, a former White House appointee, helping to manage conservation issues during Bill Clinton’s administration. It operates out of the same office as the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) that launches projects related to global health and other areas. There were a lot of claims to check out from the ad, but we wanted to know whether the bill allows insurance companies to ""charge five times more for people over 50."" One provision jumped out right away: Insurance companies could charge five times more for those ages 50-64 buying insurance on the individual market. Some viewers might assume the five-fold increase starts from zero. What the ad doesn’t tell you is that insurers can already charge older people more than younger adults — three times as much. Age ain’t nothing but a number (but it could make insurance more expensive) For this fact-check, we’re looking at what the proposed House health bill does about older adults between ages 50-64 on the individual health insurance market. So this doesn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people between 50 and 64 years old who have employer-sponsored coverage. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. This is known as 3-to-1 ""rate banding."" The House bill increases the ratio up to five times starting in 2018, unless states set a different age ratio. Before the Affordable Care Act, premiums for older adults were typically four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That more accurately reflects the actual higher costs spent for older adults’ health care, said Linda Blumberg, health policy expert at the Urban Institute. So the lower 3-to-1 age ratio in the ACA was a better deal for older adults. The goal was to make coverage more affordable for older adults regardless of their health status. If the House bill with the 5-to-1 rate banding were to become law, older adults would pay more than current law, according to an estimate by the Rand Corporation, which evaluated an earlier version of the American Health Care Act, or AHCA.  (The research was funded by the Commonwealth Fund, which aims to increase health care access for the poor.) The increased costs would occur, Rand Corporation said, as a result of tax credits in the House bill not increasing with age as steeply as premiums. Young people, however, would get a break on premiums. Older Americans could get hit with other costs, too The change in age ratios is just one of many provisions of the House proposal that could change the costs for older adults. The legislation would replace the current income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. For adults over 60, that would mean a $4,000 credit. For adults under 30, the credit would be $2,000. The legislation phases out tax credits for individuals who make more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who files jointly earning $150,000). Kaiser created an interactive map to show that the cost impact varies based on several factors. ""Generally, people who are older, lower-income or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA,"" Kaiser concluded about the House bill. A Congressional Budget Office analysis of an earlier version of the legislation (the final legislation did not receive a CBO score) concluded that it would disproportionately increase the number of uninsured ages 50-64 with incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty limit. For an example: Under current law, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 would pay a net premium of $1,700 after factoring in a tax credit. Under the House bill, according to CBO, that person’s premium rises to $14,600. (See table 4) Older Americans could see more changes if states choose to redefine essential health benefits for coverage in the individual market. ""I cannot imagine a scenario where the AHCA is not worse for older adults than the ACA,"" Blumberg said. Curbelo’s spokeswoman told us Curbelo has called for improving the bill that he voted for. ""The congressman is continuing to work to ensure that all Americans have access to coverage options they can afford, focusing specifically on making sure we increase the amount of the tax credits for lower income Americans and for those nearing the age of retirement,"" Joanna Rodriguez told PolitiFact. Our ruling The Save My Care ad says that Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies ""charge five times more for people over 50."" The ad refers to a provision that will allow insurance companies to charge adults five times more for insurance than younger people buying on the individual market. But the ad could leave a misleading impression that it’s five times more than the current situation -- and that’s not the case. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to charge this age group three times as much for insurance (which was considered a better deal than the situation before).

Paul Ryan's Pants on Fire claim on Air Force pilots forced to scrounge for airplane parts in museums
","Lauding Republican legislation that would increase defense spending, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan attacked former President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress, charging they had put the military in a ""readiness crisis."" And he made a claim -- about the Air Force and museums, of all things -- that we want to check. ""Under President Obama, Democrats insisted that an increase in defense spending be tied to an equal increase in non-defense spending,"" the Wisconsin Republican said at a news conference on May 2, 2017. ""You want to help the troops? You want to help the military? I need just as much money for domestic discretionary spending. ""That was the Obama rule that we lived under for eight years. They insisted on this even as our military plunged further and further into a readiness crisis. Well, we got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years."" So, this is a sweeping claim: Air Force pilots, crippled by inadequate funding, being forced to scavenge for parts in museums to keep their own planes flying. Typically we don’t use many quotes in our fact checks. But in this case, they seem to tell the story about Ryan’s claim: ""That’s a grotesque distortion,"" said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group Corp., which does research on the aerospace and defense industry. ""It’s grossly misleading,"" said Benjamin Friedman, a Cato Institute defense and homeland security studies research fellow. ""While I admire Ryan, and agree that there are some problems in military readiness, this kind of hyperbole needs to be called out,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. 
Ryan’s evidence Ryan’s staff noted to us that PolitiFact Texas in July 2016 checked a similar but much more involved claim made by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Our colleagues found that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz. -- a practice that goes back decades because it saves money and keeps the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made. But that fact check didn’t get to whether the Air Force takes what seems like a more desperate step of sending parts hunters to museums. The only example Ryan’s office cited was a May 2016 Fox News article in which an Air Force captain said spare parts needed for a B-1 bomber at a base in South Dakota were taken from seven ""museum aircraft"" from around the country, including the South Dakota Air and Space Museum.  So, Ryan’s evidence is pretty thin: An isolated example to back a broad claim. Expert views Conversely, more than a half dozen experts confirmed to us that it has been common for decades to retrieve parts in military airplane ""boneyards."" Indeed, that is one of the main purposes for collecting and preserving older planes at such sites. Davis-Monthan, according to AirplaneBoneyards.com, is the largest aircraft boneyard in the world. Known officially as the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, the boneyard has more than 4,400 aircraft from the Air Force, other military branches and other federal agencies, according to the base. Besides storing aircraft that can be tapped for parts, the base also restores planes to put them back into operation. The boneyard also offers tours. But that hardly makes it a museum. As for Ryan’s slap at the Obama administration’s military spending, PolitiFact National found in December 2015 that the spending did drop during Obama’s tenure. But O’Hanlon, Todd Harrison at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Laicie Heeley at the Stimson Center and other defense experts agreed that lack of funds has not been a problem in terms of the Air Force finding spare parts. Our rating Saying the military was plunged into a readiness crisis under Obama, Ryan claimed: ""We got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years."" It is a broad claim, but his office cited only one news article that quoted an Air Force captain as saying parts for seven planes were obtained from ""museum aircraft."" Meanwhile, defense experts told us that Ryan’s claim was highly misleading, in that any such museum scrounging, if it has ever occurred, is isolated. Indeed, the Air Force operates a base whose main functions include storing thousands of planes to be available for spare parts. The experts also agreed that even as defense spending dropped under Obama, the Air Force had sufficient funding to prevent the need for pilots to hunt for airplane parts in museums. We rate Ryan’s claim Pants on Fire. Editor's note: This item was updated on June 9, 2017 to say that the Fox News report did identify one museum. That information does not change the rating.",/factchecks/2017/may/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-pants-fire-claim-air-force-pilots-force/

Pants on Fire: Claim that University of Texas student with gun helped stop knife attacks
","Web posts assert that the May 1, 2017, stabbing attacks at the University of Texas ended after a heroic student pulled out a handgun. A reader inquiry after the incident that left one student dead and three wounded led us to fact-check a May 2, 2017, web post on ihavethetruth.com headlined ""Texas Campus Concealed Carry Student Stops Slaughter at UT Austin."" That post says: ""Eyewitnesses reported that a student pulled out a concealed handgun on the suspect and made him back down, stopping what was heading towards a slaughter! Although Fox has reported the incident, the local media is working real hard on not covering that little fact. Imagine that!"" Ihavethetruth.com doesn’t describe itself as a news source--or much otherwise. Its ""About"" web page says only: ""I Have The Truth is where you show up every day for your marching orders."" No evidence, newspaper says A day after the site said a student intervened with a gun, the Austin American-Statesman published a news story finding no confirmation that a gun-toting student got involved. The prospect of someone pulling a gun had seemed especially possible because the Texas law allowing individuals with state-issued permits to carry a handgun on public college campuses took effect in August 2016. The American-Statesman story, partly headlined ""VIRAL ITEM DEBUNKED,"" said chatter about a student possibly brandishing a gun to help police end the incident appeared to have originated in an anonymous Twitter feed, whose user posted a screenshot of a conversation thread in which someone – whose name was blurred out – claims to have ""grabbed my gun and ... chased the kid briefly."" According to the story by reporter Marty Toohey, UT police termed the rumor of help from an armed student false and said they’d found no corroborating evidence, be it video or first-hand accounts. ""It’s a rumor and there’s nothing to verify it,"" campus spokeswoman Cindy Posey said. Meanwhile, the student-with-a-gun account also was trumpeted on the InfoWars web site under the headline ""Report: Student with gun stops mass stabbing at University of Texas."" Its post pointed to a May 1, 2017, tweet by @TexasRebel56, who appears to have shared a screenshot of a private message of someone – the names of the people on thread are obscured – claiming: ""I ran inside and grabbed my gun out (sic) and came back and chased the kid briefly but I wasn’t comfortable shooting because people were around."" Also on May 1, a UT student who arrived at the scene after the attack told the American-Statesman that another student told him he had ""flashed"" a gun at the suspect. But police said they couldn’t confirm that story, adding that it was unlikely based upon the incident's brief timeframe. The same day, UT Student Government Vice President Binna Kim was among those who repeated the rumor, though after sending it via GroupMe she promptly tweeted an apology that stated the rumor had not been confirmed. Police chief a day later At a May 2, 2017, press conference, a reporter asked UT Police Chief David Carter: ""There was a rumor on social media that someone with a concealed handgun prevented further attacks. Is there any validity to that?"" Carter replied: ""So one of the things that bedevils police departments on occasion is the information that comes across social media. ""Yes, we’ve heard that,"" the chief said. ""We have no verification of that. I will tell you, if you look at the sequence of events and the timeline, it doesn’t appear likely."" Carter said that a minute and a half elapsed between the stabbings and before the student accused of the knife attacks, Kendrex White, was apprehended as he moved toward a campus dormitory knife-in-hand. A day earlier, Carter specified that that about 1:49 p.m. May 1, his department got a call about an individual who ""actually attacked or assaulted somebody"" near a gym. In less than two minutes, an officer was on the scene. The officer observed the individual walking away from an individual who was down on the ground,"" Carter said. ""He was armed with a large, Bowie-style hunting knife."" The officer confronted the man, Carter said, drawing his weapon and ordering the man to the ground. Then the suspect was taken into custody. On May 4, 2017, the debunkists at Snopes.com found ""unproven"" the idea that a student with a concealed handgun stopped the knife attacks. Then an Associated Press news story, published May 7, 2017, said that during the UT incident, ""no gun-toting student or professor pulled a pistol to stop the man in his tracks. No shots were fired and no gun was even drawn until police swarmed in to subdue the suspect."" No changes, UT says We asked UT if there were developments since the knife attacks suggesting a student with a gun helped quell the attacker. By email, Shilpa Bakre replied: ""This is an incorrect rumor."" Bakre said a UTPD officer ""took the suspect down and arrested him – no civilians with guns were involved. Police have interviewed over 40 witnesses thus far, as well as reviewed video footage to support this."" Our ruling A web blog said a UT student used a concealed gun to help police stop knife attacks on the campus. In a week-plus after the attacks, there were no credible news reports or law-enforcement confirmations of this claim which looks to us like it was bandied by pro-gun advocates presuming or perhaps wishing it was so.

What will happen to North Carolina premiums if the AHCA replaces Obamacare?
","One of the Republicans key to the American Health Care Act’s passage was North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd, who had said in March he would oppose the bill but in May ended up voting for an amended version of it. He was one of about three dozen Republicans who flipped from a No to a Yes, according to a Washington Post tally. The bill needed 216 votes to pass and squeaked by with 217. ""Ultimately, the legislative process is a human process with all the flaws that entails,"" Budd said, explaining why he supported the AHCA. ""The results of that process are never perfect, and this bill isn’t either. What I believe it will do is significantly reduce insurance premiums in our state, and help put the individual insurance marketplace on a more sound financial footing."" The claim that the AHCA will ""significantly reduce insurance premiums"" in North Carolina stuck out to us. Budd clarified in an email that he was talking about premiums for people who don’t buy health insurance through work. So we kept our research focused on non-employer coverage. Half a million North Carolinians buy their health insurance on the individual market. A general summary For people who get health insurance on their own, experts agree that premiums nationwide would likely rise in the short-term but decrease in the long-term if the AHCA replaces the Affordable Care Act. So from that birds-eye view, Budd’s claim could be called right or wrong. PolitiFact previously ruled Half True a claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan that ""the American Health Care Act will lower premiums."" We asked Budd for proof about his claim that focused on North Carolina; he responded that national factors will apply to North Carolina as well. ""Reducing premiums by increasing flexibility will in turn provide the incentive for young and healthy people to re-enter the insurance market, making the insurance pool as a whole healthier,"" he said. ""A healthier pool is more cost effective and sustainable."" He’s right that healthier pools are cheaper for everyone. But unfortunately for his argument, the AHCA is expected to do the exact opposite of what he described, at least in the beginning. Short term vs. long term By 2026, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in March, 24 million people are expected to drop their health insurance if the AHCA passes. The AHCA was amended since then, but there’s no new CBO analysis yet. First, healthy people who don’t need coverage will drop it because the AHCA would get rid of Obamacare’s penalties for being uninsured. As they leave, the CBO found, premiums will rise and millions more will drop their health insurance as it becomes unaffordable. And in those next few years, North Carolinians on the individual marketplace would be worse-off than people in every other state but Alaska, according to a study by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, based on CBO data. North Carolinians would face an average $5,900 premium hike, as we found in a previous fact-check of Democratic N.C. Rep. David Price. As insurance becomes less affordable, that’s where Budd’s explanation about healthier people re-entering the market fits in. ""Over the long run premiums would go down as expensive-to-cover people (primarily older buyers) are priced out of the market,"" Duke University health care researchers David Anderson wrote in an email. By 2026, the CBO estimated, premiums would be 10 percent lower under the AHCA than under Obamacare. Not apples-to-apples There are more caveats to Budd’s claim. One is that North Carolina might not just be an outlier in the short-term, but also the long-term. ""North Carolina is an expensive state with high premiums,"" Anderson said, due in part to its unusually large rural population. But right now there’s no way to know exactly what might happen to premiums by 2026 in North Carolina if the AHCA passes – either for us or for Budd – because no nonpartisan analysis at the state level goes that far into the future. Budd might well end up being right, but he has no evidence. In general, Anderson said, young people and wealthy people will likely end up paying less while poor people and older people will either have to pay more or stop being insured. It’s also impossible to gauge a last-minute change to the AHCA, to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions more than Obamacare would allow. The House passed the bill before the CBO could analyze the financial impact it would have. For more on that procedural oddity, see PolitiFact’s ""Full Flop"" ruling for House Speaker Paul Ryan. Another caveat is that long-term cost savings will only materialize if people accept plans with fewer options, since the AHCA would allow insurers to offer less coverage than Obamacare. The Brookings Institution found that if people want to keep their same level of coverage, in 2026 premiums would actually be 13 percent higher under the AHCA – not 10 percent lower. The final caveat is that even people with lower premiums might still pay more for health care. That’s because the AHCA would also allow insurers to charge higher deductibles. Premiums are what you pay to buy insurance, and deductibles are what you pay before that insurance kicks in. People who wouldn’t max out their deductibles under the ACA wouldn’t notice the difference, of course, but Anderson said people who would hit those caps under the ACA will certainly feel the pinch of having to pay even more money under the AHCA. ""Increasing out-of-pocket maximums harms people who are already at the limit,"" he said. Our ruling North Carolina Republican Rep. Ted Budd defended his vote for the American Health Care Act, saying it will ""significantly reduce insurance premiums in"" North Carolina. In the short-term, insurance premiums on North Carolina’s individual market would actually increase. It’s not a small increase, either, but is rather expected to be the second-largest in the nation. Budd does have a point that premiums are expected to decrease in cost nationally a decade from now. People can quibble over whether an expected 10 percent decline is ""significant,"" but it is a decline. However, that’s a national estimate. There’s no solid analysis yet into how North Carolina specifically might fare, a point against Budd. It's also just an average. Some people will see lower premiums, while others will see higher premiums – for many of them, high enough that experts believe they'll drop insurance entirely. And finally, even people with lower premiums might still pay more in the end, since their deductibles could be higher under the AHCA.

Fact-check: AG Jeff Sessions claims district attorneys charge immigrants for lesser crimes
","Attorney General Jeff Sessions raised concerns to New York law enforcement officers over practices of some district attorneys that he said favored immigrants. ""It troubles me that we’ve seen district attorneys openly brag about not charging cases appropriately under the laws of our country, so that provides an opportunity for individuals not to be convicted of a crime that might lead to deportation,"" Sessions said April 28 in Long Island, N.Y. ""Some have advertised that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense than presumably they would charge a United States citizen, so they won’t be deported. That baffles me."" Is Sessions right about district attorneys advertising leniency in charges toward immigrants over U.S. citizens? The Justice Department, led by Sessions, referred us to policies and practices of the Brooklyn District Attorney, Santa Clara District Attorney and Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office. While all three jurisdictions refuted Sessions’ characterization of their policies, we found that some offices are considering alternative offenses a defendant can plead to in order to avoid ""disproportionate collateral consequences,"" such as deportation. They also point to a U.S. Supreme Court case that said considering deportation consequences in the plea-bargaining process may be a wise move for defendants and states. Here’s an overview of those policies. Brooklyn Sessions spoke about ""criminal aliens,"" a term generally applied to non-U.S. citizens – living in the United States legally or illegally – who are convicted of crimes. On April 24, Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced a new policy for the handling of cases against non-U.S. citizens defendants, designed to minimize ""collateral immigration consequences of criminal convictions, particularly for misdemeanor and other low-level offenses."" The office hired immigration attorneys to advise prosecutors when making plea offers and sentencing recommendations for non-U.S. citizen defendants, the DA said in a news release. Certain convictions put immigrants in the country illegally at risk for being a priority for deportation. For instance, the state misdemeanor of possession of marijuana is a felony for immigration purposes, but trespassing is not, the DA’s office said. As a result, attorneys may consider ""reasonable modifications"" in sentence recommendations and alternative offenses that a defendant can plead to in order to reach an ""immigration-neutral disposition,"" the policy said. In certain cases, a non-U.S. citizen if appropriate may be offered a plea for a lesser offense ""in light of the disproportionate immigration consequences a higher level offense may result in,"" the office said in its release. ""When possible, the alternative should be similar in level of offense and length of sentence to that offered to a citizen defendant, while the charge may be different,"" the Brooklyn DA said. Sessions said DAs advertise ""that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense,"" but a spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA said their policy ""does not pertain to charging decisions."" But rather to the sentencing recommendations and offenses to which defendants can plead, which happens after charges are made. ""The charges decision is completely neutral. The charges happen before there’s even thought about immigration status,"" Oren Yaniv, spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA’s Office told PolitiFact. It’s toward the end of the case when the office takes into consideration their policy, he said. The American Bar Association describes the plea bargaining process as involving ""the defendant's pleading guilty to a lesser charge, or to only one of several charges. It also may involve a guilty plea as charged, with the prosecution recommending leniency in sentencing."" The policy ""does not create two systems of justice, one for immigrants and one for citizens, as some have alleged,"" Oren Yaniv, spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA’s Office told PolitiFact. The goal of policies like the one in Brooklyn is to ensure that appropriate pleas are offered and entered in light that deportation might also be added onto any criminal penalties, said Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. ""Rather than ‘special treatment,’ the policy might be looked at as trying to ensure that the punishment fits the crime,"" Johnson said. Santa Clara In September 2011, Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen issued a memo to fellow prosecutors for the consideration of ""collateral consequences"" in certain cases. The consideration should not apply to cases involving a serious or violent felony, he said. The memo said a prosecutor may alter a charge toward an ""immigration-neutral result,"" where the conviction does not lead to deportation. ""The contention that we charge an immigrant with a ‘lesser’ offense is false. In some appropriate cases, we agree to immigration-neutral charges, but as a practical matter this results in a longer sentence or greater number of charges -- or a quicker guilty plea,"" Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen told PolitiFact. ""Our collateral consequences policy -- which can also factor in employment, education, housing, pregnancy-- is open to both citizens and non-citizens."" Rosen cited the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court case Padilla vs. Kentucky, which centered on a lawful permanent U.S. resident facing deportation after pleading guilty to drug distribution charges in Kentucky. The defendant claimed his counsel failed to effectively advise him that pleading to that charge could lead to deportation. The U.S. Supreme Court held that counsel must inform a client whether a plea carries a risk of deportation. Justices also noted that prosecutors and defense attorneys may consider immigration consequences when negotiating a settlement, and that this could better satisfy the interest of both parties, Rosen said. Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said the main obligations are for criminal defense attorneys, who should not accept a plea for their client that would have negative immigration consequences unless they advise the client specifically about those consequences. The underlying proposition, Gilman said, is that the whole criminal justice system (including prosecutors) must understand immigration consequences to be tightly intertwined with criminal consequences. The Supreme Court’s opinion was recently enshrined into California law, Rosen said. Part of that law says the prosecution ""shall consider the avoidance of adverse immigration consequences in the plea negotiation process as one factor in an effort to reach a just resolution."" Baltimore The Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office issued a news release May 4 saying it had instructed prosecutors to ""strongly consider their prosecutorial discretion"" related to minor, non-violent criminal cases that involve immigrant victims, witnesses and defendants. The Baltimore Sun reported the directive April 28. Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said prosecutorial discretion should be used to consider ""the unintended collateral consequences that our decisions have on our immigrant population."" The release did not specify what the prosecutorial discretion entailed. Our ruling Sessions said district attorneys ""advertise that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense than presumably they would charge a United States citizen."" District and state attorneys in Brooklyn, Santa Clara and Baltimore have issued directives for prosecutorial discretion in the handling of non-violent cases involving non-U.S. citizens (which includes immigrants living in the United States legally and illegally). Attorneys told us that the alternative sentences are designed to help people avoid deportation for minor crimes, and that sometimes the plea deals mean the person ends up with a stricter or longer sentence, or a faster guilty plea. They also contend that they are not charging immigrants favorably over citizens, as policy consideration goes into effect after charges are made. The Supreme Court recently recognized that deportations can represent a disproportionate punishment. A recent case found that defense attorneys must inform their clients when a plea carries a risk of deportation. Justices also noted that considering deportation consequences in the plea bargaining process may benefit both defendants and states. Sessions’ statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Sally Hernandez says cities labeled as sanctuaries have less crime, according to FBI statistics
","Don’t force local police to double as immigration law enforcers, sheriffs including Sally Hernandez of Travis County unsuccessfully urged lawmakers in an April 2017 commentary in the Austin American-Statesman. Republican proponents tout Senate Bill 4, the measure signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott on May 7, 2017, as once-and-for-all preventing local police and elected officials from shielding unauthorized immigrants from deportation. Violators could be fined or even removed from office. In opposition, Hernandez and four other sheriffs, fellow Democrats from Dallas, Harris, Bexar and El Paso counties, wrote that the proposal would ""coerce"" local law enforcement to divert scarce resources to enforcing federal immigration laws at a risk to public safety. As it is, the sheriffs went on, ""FBI crime statistics have found that labeled ‘sanctuary’ cities experience lower rates of all crime types, including homicides."" Is that so? There's no such FBI report, we found, while PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., noted in a November 2016 fact check that a study published in August 2016 by researchers at the University of California at Riverside and Highline College found sanctuary policies did not affect crime rates either way. The study included analysis of violent crime, property crime and rape. Also, we’ve been fact-checking claims about so-called sanctuary cities for half a dozen years so we recognize that defining such a city can be slippery. In 2006, the non-partisan Congressional Research Service listed Houston and Austin among only 32 localities nationally that had sanctuary policies. Hernandez points to D.C. report To our inquiry, Kristen Dark, spokeswoman for the Travis County sheriff’s office, advised by email that the sheriffs drew their claim about less crime in sanctuary cities from a January 2017 report that considered more than 600 counties to be sanctuary locales. The report by the Washington-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy group, ""The Effects of Sanctuary Policies on Crime and the Economy,"" states that crime in 2015 was significantly lower in 608 ""sanctuary"" counties than in counties where law officers were more compliant with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to detain locally-held suspects. Tom K. Wong, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, wrote: ""There are, on average, 35.5 fewer crimes committed per 10,000 people in sanctuary counties compared to non-sanctuary counties. Altogether, the data suggest that when local law enforcement focuses on keeping communities safe, rather than becoming entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts, communities are safer,"" the report says, plus there are other advantages such as stronger economies. ""Large central metro sanctuary counties have 65.4 fewer crimes per 10,000 people than large central metro non-sanctuary counties,"" Wong wrote. ""Noncore, rural sanctuary counties have 59.4 fewer crimes per 10,000 people than noncore, rural non-sanctuary counties."" Counting 'sanctuary' counties The report doesn’t identify any counties. But to our inquiry, Wong provided his list of 608 ""sanctuary"" counties. Further, Wong said by email that he zeroed in on the counties based on information obtained from ICE by the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center; he forwarded what he described as an ICE spreadsheet with entries for 2,768 counties in 49 states plus other jurisdictions and said a column identifying individual counties as accepting or not accepting ICE detainer requests helped him single out the counties tallied as sanctuary counties. The spreadsheet shows the majority of the listed counties as going along with ICE detainer requests--including Travis County, a reminder the spreadsheet was put together before Hernandez, elected sheriff in 2016, implemented a policy in 2017 of not automatically granting ICE detainer requests, a move that spurred interest in SB 4 while leading Abbott to cut off millions of dollars in law enforcement grants to the county. It’s worth noting too that no federal law defines ""sanctuary city."" Different jurisdictions that use the term -- and even some that shy from it -- may have some policies in place that other cities don’t, and vice versa. But generally speaking, it means a community has policies limiting how much local law enforcement assists federal immigration authorities seeking to apprehend and deport people living in the country without authorization. The modern-day sanctuary concept stems from the 1980s when churches opened their doors to shelter Central Americans who fled violence in their countries and lived illegally in the United States, fearing deportation. Lena Graber, a special projects attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, has estimated there are more than 500 counties and 38 cities with policies not to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Yet when we asked Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors less immigration, to appraise Wong’s analysis, Vaughan said by email she’d classify a locale as a sanctuary only if it has a policy saying as much; a March 2017 CIS map pinpoints about 300 such places, including Travis County. Concentrated in west? Wong, answering our bid for more detail, emailed a chart showing he identified sanctuary counties in 29 states--with most such counties, we noticed, concentrated in a dozen states: South Dakota (62 counties); Colorado (56 counties); Minnesota (54 counties); California (53 counties); New York and North Dakota (50 counties each);  Florida (43 counties); Washington (32 counties); Oregon (28 counties); New Mexico (26 counties); Iowa and Wyoming (23 counties each). Wong, we noticed, classified every Wyoming county as giving sanctuary. We wondered about that, spot-checking a couple by phone. Dick Blunt of the Sweetwater County sheriff’s office told us that county doesn’t hold anyone solely due to an ICE detainer request. In contrast, Michael Sorenson of the Laramie County sheriff’s department said that agency always accedes to ICE detainers. Sorenson, saying he’s been a department employee for 23 years, said: ""I can’t ever remember us telling them no, we won’t accept their detainers."" Crime rates Let’s turn next to crime rates. The report by Wong drew crime rates from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting system tallies for 2015. The report states: ""Crime is defined here as the total number of violent crimes—murders, rapes, robberies, and assaults—and property crimes—burglaries, larceny, motor vehicle thefts, and arsons—per 10,000 people."" We didn’t have the firepower/know-how to replicate Wong’s work. Still, we compared total 2015 crimes rates for a few counties considered sanctuary communities by Wong compared to counties not bestowed with that label--and got mixed results. In our sampling, an Oregon ""sanctuary"" county in the study had the lowest total crime rate for 2015, 93 per 10,000 residents. Yet next-lowest was an Arkansas likely ""non-sanctuary county,"" which had a rate of 94 crimes per 10,000 residents. That pattern, a sanctuary county followed by a non-sanctuary county, mostly played out through the dozen counties we checked (see our work here). In the report, Wong said the statistical technique he applied, ""coarsened exact matching,"" strengthened the cause-effect implication that sanctuary counties tend to have less crime. ""CEM is a method for improving causal inferences that estimates the sample average treatment effect on the treated, or SATT,"" the report said. ""In other words, CEM statistically matches sanctuary counties to comparable non-sanctuary counties; compares differences in outcomes between sanctuary counties and the matched non-sanctuary counties; allows us to evaluate these differences while controlling for differences in population, the foreign-born percentage of the population, and the percentage of the population that is Latino; and then uses the results of the analysis to estimate the effect that being a sanctuary county has on crime and the economy."" Criminologists comment Experts on crime statistics who we queried told us Wong’s statistical work looked solid. They were less sold on reaching cause-effect conclusions. Tony Fabelo, an Austin-based researcher for the Council on State Governments, said by email: ""You may assume that the theory behind the relationship between sanctuary cities and crime is that law enforcement practices are more effective in engaging the community, not alienating Latino, or immigrant communities, and, therefore, maybe this influences crime. ""For example,"" Fabelo wrote, ""if local law enforcement is not occupied by questioning and detaining suspected undocumented aliens, maybe their resources are better spent on usual crime fighting. Still,"" he said, ""there are so many things not controlled here that can impact crime, that maybe the statement is a little stretched (sentencing practices, program resources to deal with drug treatment, mental health, security technologies in higher income places, and more importantly the number of police per capita in the community)."" Bill King, a professor at Sam Houston State University, called Wong’s methodology rigorous. By phone, though, he said absolute causality is hard to nail. ""The flip side is the takeaway: Being a sanctuary city does not make community residents unsafe--and that’s big,"" King said. King, Fabelo and Alfred Blumstein, a professor emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University, each said the study would have benefited by focusing on rates of specific crimes such as homicides and robberies. By email, Blumstein said the FBI’s total crime rates are overly influenced by the frequency of larceny. Separately, Fabelo said the total crime rate doesn’t capture many drug arrests and related crimes as well as lower-level crimes not tallied by the FBI. Fabelo said he’d be interested in tracking ""what happens in cities that were sanctuary cities, that later were not, and see any improvement over time"" in crime rates, which would control for unseen factors in the studied city, he suggested. Homicides Wong earlier pointed out that the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, with his help, made a run at analyzing just homicide rates before reporting in January 2017 that the typical sanctuary area saw one less homicide per 100,000 people in 2015 than the typical non-sanctuary area. ""While the difference is small,"" the newspaper said, ""Wong's statistical tests indicate it is highly significant."" Wonkblog also said: ""The data only shows correlation; Wong says more research needs to be done to determine whether a causal effect is at work here. But he said he suspects that, by becoming a sanctuary area and refusing to involve local authorities in deportation matters, a city or county may actually make itself safer. If immigrants who came to the United States illegally fear working with police will lead to deportation, they're less likely to report crimes and assist with investigations."" We asked Wong if it could be happenstance that the identified sanctuary counties had lower overall crime rates than non-sanctuary counties. Happenstance, he emailed, is ""too liberal a term in this case given the rigor of the analysis."" Our ruling Hernandez said: ""FBI crime statistics have found that labeled ‘sanctuary’ cities experience lower rates of all crime types, including homicides."" Any implication the FBI reached this conclusion is wrong; the agency has not aired such findings. Still, an outside analysis of 2015 FBI-collected crime statistics supports the idea that communities offering sanctuary to unauthorized residents have less total crime. Then again, that analysis didn't independently confirm the sanctuary status of each county nor did it fine-tune the crime statistics as much as criminologists would prefer before reaching cause-effect conclusions.

Claire McCaskill cites disproven figure on opioid use
","The state of opioid abuse in America has been deemed an epidemic. Overdose related deaths involving prescribed opioids have reached an all-time high, jumping from 19,000 in 2014 to 22,000 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Considering all opioids (not just prescribed ones), the figures get even worse: In 2015, 33,091 died from opioid related overdoses. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill has set her sights on curbing the issue, writing an op-ed in the Kansas City Star and dedicating a page of her website to facts and figures. One tweet in particular caught our eye: ""We have 5% of world population. 80% of opioids."" Such drastic numbers paint a dire picture for the state of opioid use and abuse in America. We wanted to fact-check her claim. What we found was that while America certainly consumes more opioids than any other country, the notion that we consume 80 percent of the global supply is greatly exaggerated. ‘One startling number’ Checking the first part of McCaskill’s claim was simple: The United States’ population is, according to the U.S. Census bureau, 324.8 million. The global population is 7.4 billion. That means the United States accounts for roughly 4.4 percent of the total world population. Checking the other half was more complicated. We reached out to McCaskill’s spokesperson, Drew Pusateri, and he supplied us with the source of the figure: a CNBC article published on April 27, 2016. And while the article provides the figures McCaskill cited, it is vague about where exactly the 80 percent figure comes from. Upon its first reference it is simply ""one startling number from recent years,"" and later it is noted that the figure was ""cited in various studies,"" including one by Express Scripts. The Express Scripts study, ""A Nation In Pain,"" was released on Dec. 9, 2014. And while it does cite the 80 percent figure, it was not a study designed to measure American opioid consumption or global consumption. The reality, according to Christopher Jones, the director of the Division of Science Policy in the Department of Health and Human Services, is that America consumes 30.2 percent of globally distributed opioids. 30.2 percent According to data collected by the International Narcotics Control Board, the United States consumed roughly 30.2 percent of opioids in 2015. A Vienna-based ""quasi-judicial expert body,"" the International Narcotics Control Board is tasked with tracking global opioid consumption, among a myriad of other things. The board releases three annual reports on narcotic drugs. ""Narcotic Drugs: Estimated World Requirements for 2017; Statistics for 2015"" is the most recent publication, and includes data for the year 2015. Using the International Narcotics Control Board figures, Jones calculated that the United States consumed 173,332 kilograms of 574,693 kilograms of opioids consumed globally (382,131.6 of 1,266,981.2 pounds), or 30.2 percent. The drugs Jones included in the measurements are: codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, hydrocodone, morphine, oxycodone, pholcodine, dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylate, methadone, pethidine and tilidine. The figures also include the calculated consumption of buprenorphine. To be clear, Jones noted, such data is limited in several ways. The first is that it is government-reported data. The second is that many drugs are marketed in one country and not another; while used frequently in the United States, hydrocodone is virtually unused elsewhere. Additionally, some of the data include drugs that may have been exported from the country of manufacture and consumed in another country. Thus, data from INCB should be considered with great care when comparing consumption levels of narcotic drugs across countries. And finally, the board makes special note that comparing countries by the weight of opioids consumed is not recommended. Instead they suggest using a statistical measurement called ""defined daily doses."" Defined daily doses A defined daily dose is the quantity of a particular narcotic drug used in a day by one individual. It is not a recommended dosage, but rather it is a calculation created by the International Narcotics Control Board to statistically measure opioid use with a ratio that directly relates a country’s population to its consumption.  For example, the daily dose of hydrocodone is 15 milligrams. So, if 60 milligrams are consumed, four defined daily doses would be recorded. The final results are calculated per million inhabitants. The United States consumed the most using this measure from 2013 to 2015: 47,580 doses of narcotic drugs were consumed per day per million people. Canada comes in second with 34,444 defined doses consumed per day, and Germany in third with 30,796. Using such a measurement, it is easy to see that consumption in America, while noticeably higher than in similarly developed countries, is not as astronomical as McCaskill’s cited figure makes it appear. ‘A life of its own’ Jones said it’s common for people to cite the 80 percent figure that McCaskill did, despite its inaccuracy. ""I would say it is a commonly quoted statistic...people across a variety of disciplines, who even are somewhat expert on the topic, have repeated that statistic,"" he said. Jones said he believes the number originated as the percentage of oxycodone that America consumes compared to the world. From there, he said, the figure has ""taken a life of its own. It’s now a ‘fact’ because it’s been repeated so many times."" But it’s not the full picture. Because while America does consume over 75 percent of oxycodone, and 99 percent of hydrocodone, it doesn’t consume even half of all opioids globally, according to the International Narcotics Control Board data. Which, in part, according to Jones, has to do with marketing. Oxycodone and hydrocodone are marketed in America. Similar opioids are more prevalent elsewhere. Drug control systems Despite conflated numbers, experts agree there is a problem. Martha Maurer, a policy program manager and researcher at the Pain and Policy Studies Group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed that opioid abuse in the United States was an epidemic. But part of the solution, she said, was continuing to figure out how to view the problem. ""It’s clear that there has been a lot of harm associated with overdose and abuse,"" Maurer said, ""but it goes back to the question of where (abused) medication is coming from, which we just don’t know."" Something worth noting, Maurer said, was that when you look at the milligram-per-person statistics, ""some countries, including Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland, have opioid-consumption levels comparable to that in the US, but they are not having the same problems with harms caused by overdose. Their drug-control systems ensure a balanced approach to opioid access."" For Jones, it’s about finding the right balance. ""From a policy perspective, we’re trying to ensure that opioids are available when they are needed, but that they are being used as a part of comprehensive evidence-based pain care,"" he said, ""not that we’re relying on them just because they’re the easiest thing to prescribe, or there are other external pressures to prescribe them."" Our ruling In setting out to combat America’s opioid epidemic by holding pharmaceutical companies accountable, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said that with just 5 percent of the population, the United States consumes ""80 percent of opioids."" McCaskill’s figure, widely cited as it is, is inaccurate. It presents a narrow view of opioid consumption globally, where some opioids are marketed in select countries, but not others. It also discounts using defined daily doses, which provide a far more accurate representation of consumption when comparing nations. So, while the United States is clearly the largest consumer of opioids, it, at most, accounts for roughly 30 percent of global consumption.

Would GOP bill expand women's health care by curbing Planned Parenthood?
","Moments after the House passed a bill to significantly overhaul the nation’s health care system, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., blasted an email to constituents. While the bill ""doesn’t fix the entire problem,"" he said, it ""begins the process of fixing our broken health care system."" A PolitiFact reader sent us a copy of Loudermilk’s email and asked us to fact-check it. We zeroed in on one of the exchanges in a ""frequently asked questions"" section that sought to explain some of the bill’s provisions:    ""Why are you cutting women’s health services?""    ""We’re not. In fact, we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics."" Could pushing Planned Parenthood out of the picture really expand women’s access to health care? We found that there are indeed more community health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics -- but that doesn’t mean that redirecting dollars to them will amount to ""expanding women’s access to health services."" Some background The GOP health care bill bill would effectively block Planned Parenthood for a year from securing reimbursements from Medicaid -- not just for abortions, which is already the case, but for any services, from pap smears to birth control. Planned Parenthood says abortion services are already walled off from payments they get for services that have nothing to do with abortion. But abortion opponents have long argued that the government is tacitly supporting abortion even by reimbursing Planned Parenthood for non-abortion services, saying such money is fungible once it reaches Planned Parenthood’s coffers. The bill’s change could have a significant impact on Planned Parenthood: About 43 percent of the group’s budget comes from the government, including grants and reimbursements, much of which comes from Medicaid. The group says the bill, if enacted, could lead to closures of clinics and leave women without access to vital services, especially in medically underserved areas. Do community health centers ""vastly outnumber"" Planned Parenthood clinics? Loudermilk has a point on the numbers of clinics. We looked at a census of clinics that provide contraceptive services published in April 2017 by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health nonprofit. The group tallied up various types of clinics, the most numerous of which are ""federally qualified health centers"" -- defined by the federal government as ""safety-net providers that primarily provide services typically furnished in an outpatient clinic."" Such facilities can include community health centers, migrant health centers, homeless health care centers, and public housing primary care centers. For 2015, the census tallied 5,829 federally qualified health centers nationally, compared to 676 Planned Parenthood clinics. That’s a ratio of greater than 8-to-1, so the adjective ""vastly"" seems appropriate. Would the bill redirect money from Planned Parenthood to community health centers? Not necessarily. Planned Parenthood received about $553.7 million from the government in 2015 for its services; the group, however, does not make public what portion of that is specifically from the federal government because the funding streams from different levels of government are sometimes hard to disentangle. The best estimate we can get comes from the Congressional Budget Office, which projected that the provision blocking federal funding to Planned Parenthood would result in $178 million in reduced federal outlays. If the CBO’s projection is accurate, then the increase in federal funding to community health centers in the bill -- $422 million -- would represent a larger federal investment than the money being held back from Planned Parenthood. At first glance, that would seem to make the bill a net expansion in dollars, if you consider only these two line items. However, a couple issues balance against the notion that that this will represent an expansion of care. First, there is no guarantee that the $422 million spent would go towards the same patients, and for the same services, that would be lost due to the Planned Parenthood cuts. The bill does not explicitly require that. Another caveat comes from a different conclusion in the same CBO analysis. ""To the extent that there would be reductions in access to care under the legislation, they would affect services that help women avert pregnancies,"" CBO wrote. ""The people most likely to experience reduced access to care would probably reside in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations. CBO projects that about 15 percent of those people would lose access to care."" The immediate loss of care for 15 percent of Planned Parenthood patients also undercuts the argument that money would simply flow from one type of clinic to the other. Would redirecting funding to these centers expand women’s access to health services? There’s reason to be skeptical. For starters, common sense suggests that even if community health centers ended up being able to serve every single patient currently served by Planned Parenthood, that wouldn’t qualify as ""expanding women’s access to health services"" -- it would simply be maintaining it. The closure of as many as 676 Planned Parenthood facilities would require an awful lot of expansion of resources elsewhere just to keep pace, before any ""expansion"" of access begins. And there’s reason to believe that community health centers may not be able to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood centers disappear. First, there’s a capacity problem. Planned Parenthood centers tend to be unusually efficient in providing health services to women, because that’s their specialty. The average Planned Parenthood clinic served 2,950 patients for contraceptive services in 2015, compared to 320 for the average federally qualified health center, according to the Guttmacher census. ""Because by definition health centers are in medically underserved communities with elevated risk and insufficient primary care, the last thing one does is get rid of any supply,"" Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, told PolitiFact. ""This is the corker. Health centers are overwhelmed with need."" And currently, community health centers are already operating with a shortage of staff, making any rapid expansion that much trickier. ""Workforce challenges are one of the primary barriers to health center patient growth,"" the National Association of Community Health Centers concluded in a 2016 report on its sector. ""If all health center clinical vacancies were filled today, health centers could serve 2 million more patients."" And second, community health centers and Planned Parenthood clinics aren’t interchangeable, experts say. Guttmacher data indicates that Planned Parenthood centers ""are considerably more likely to offer a broad range of contraceptive methods than sites operated by other types of agencies. Nearly all Planned Parenthood health centers offer the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved reversible contraceptive methods,"" compared to half of federally qualified health centers. Rebecca Kreitzer, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recently told the Atlantic that oral contraceptives and condoms are cheap enough that community health clinics can afford to give them out and then request federal reimbursement, but IUDs and contraceptive implants -- two long-term but reversible methods -- are often too expensive for clinics to front without immediate payment. By contrast, Planned Parenthood is a big enough network that it can afford to provide more expensive methods immediately. Because of this, Planned Parenthood clinics are also likelier to have staff on hand with the requisite expertise. ""Just because there is a federally qualified health center near where there is a Planned Parenthood Clinic does not mean we can assume the women going to Planned Parenthood would easily be served,"" said Keith J. Mueller, head of the Department of Health Management and Policy at the University of Iowa. When the Atlantic investigated how prepared Iowa health clinics were to pick up patients from Planned Parenthood, they found that lists of clinics provided by Republican lawmakers included ""a dentist’s office, a school nurse, and a youth shelter"" as well as one clinic that had closed and several that didn’t provide family-planning services. ""They're assuming we're the alternative,"" Ted Boesen, CEO of the non-profit Iowa Primary Care Association, told the magazine. ""But we're waiting to see what kind of a scale it is."" Finally, the Energy and Commerce Committee said it’s possible to argue ""that Planned Parenthood provides inferior overall service because they cannot offer holistic care to their patients, as they are a boutique reproductive health provider."" But experts say the committee’s emphasis on full-spectrum health care is more expensive than reproductive health care ""Because health centers must think about the full spectrum of primary health care for all patients, the absence of a specialized safety-net provider such as Planned Parenthood would be deeply problematic,"" Rosenbaum has written. ""When health centers attempt to respond to a surge in demand, they must think about not just the specialized services lost, but all of the health needs of the patients who find their way to a health center, not to mention those of their families. … As a result, the anticipated cost per patient served is far higher than family planning and related services alone."" In other words, the higher cost of providing care at community health centers is another reason why the increased federal funding figure in the bill may not be sufficient for replacing the lost Planned Parenthood services. Our ruling Loudermilk said that in the House Republican health care bill, ""we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics."" Purely on the numbers, he has a point that there are more federally qualified health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics. But the notion that bypassing Planned Parenthood would mean ""expanding"" access is dubious. Challenges of geography, capacity, specialization and cost raise significant questions about whether existing centers, even if they were provided with Planned Parenthood’s federal revenue stream, would be able to maintain the current patient load, much less expand it. We rate the statement Mostly False.

Would the Republican health care bill take away anyone’s Medicaid?
","Soon after narrowly passing a major health care bill, Republican House members took to the airwaves to put a positive spin on a bill that critics say will roll back coverage for America’s poorest and most vulnerable. ""We’re not taking a benefit away. Nobody on Medicaid is going to be taken away,"" Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told CNN May 4. Compared with current law, the Republican plan is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $880 billion, or 25 percent, over the next decade and reduce enrollment by 14 million, or 17 percent, according to the an analysis of an early version of the bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. When we asked McCarthy’s office whether these steep cuts would cause any states to pare down their Medicaid programs, his spokesman Matt Sparks replied, ""That is a decision that states will have to make."" Sparks added, ""Regarding Medicaid, there are no changes until 2020. Then states will continue to receive the enhanced federal match for current enrollees."" Given the dramatic financing and enrollment changes contemplated in the bill, we decided to look into McCarthy’s claim, with a focus on the bill’s impact on state Medicaid enrollment. We found the changes will almost certainly result in reduced enrollment. Ending more generous federal cost-sharing A key feature of the the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is the option for states to expand Medicaid with generous federal cost-sharing. Thirty-one states plus D.C. have opted to make Medicaid benefits more widely available to their residents. Obamacare allowed states to extend Medicaid benefits to all adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. In exchange, the federal government covers 90 percent or more of the cost of newly-eligible Medicaid recipients. The portion of funding shouldered by the federal government is known as the ""federal match rate."" Critics have pounced on the Republican bill for choking off the Obamacare Medicaid expansion by lowering the federal match rate for those who are new to the program. Under the bill, the 90 percent federal match rate drops to its pre-Obamacare average of about 57 percent in 2020 for new applicants. The bill ""grandfathers in"" the higher match rate for those who enrolled under Obamacare and maintain continuous coverage. But based on historical data, the CBO estimates more than two-thirds of this group would lose coverage due to churn within two years, and that 95 percent would lose their grandfathered-in status by the end of 2024. McCarthy spokesman Sparks was careful to note that the congressman was only referring to ""current enrollees."" But the fact is about 10.5 million of the the roughly 11 million low-income enrollees who now enjoy enhanced federal matching would lose it by 2025. Impact on states If the House bill becomes law, expansion states would immediately face the thorny question of whether to continue expanded coverage without the federal government’s added boost -- at an average cost increase of 33 percent. Some states actually have trigger laws on the books -- that predate the Republican bill’s passage -- that say federal cuts would legally force the state to end Medicaid expansion. According to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, lowering the federal match rate would automatically end or curtail expansion in seven states -- Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Washington. ""Laws in these states either explicitly require the expansion to end if the federal Medicaid matching rate decreases, or they require the state to take action to prevent an increase in state Medicaid costs,"" according to a paper by the center. The group said that some 2.6 million newly-eligible adults would immediately lose coverage under this scenario. Other states might curtail coverage even without state law. Health policy experts in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Jersey and Ohio quoted in a May 4 article in Modern Healthcare magazine predicted that their states would end their coverage expansions if the current Republican plan became law. ""It's almost beyond imagination that Pennsylvania's Medicaid expansion could survive the reduction in enhanced federal funding,"" Andy Carter, CEO of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, told Modern Healthcare, adding that Pennsylvania, which already faces a $3 billion budget deficit, would have to come up with $2 billion to $3 billion just to replace lost federal funding. Additionally, a chorus of governors have expressed uneasiness about the proposed changes to Medicaid, with some warning that federal cuts are tantamount to ending the Medicaid expansion. ""They are going to eliminate Medicaid expansion,"" Ohio Gov. John Kasich told CNN May 7. ""In Medicaid, you are going to knock all these people off after 2020, which is just a few years away, these people who now are getting covered across the country."" Our ruling McCarthy said, ""We’re not taking a benefit away. Nobody on Medicaid is going to be taken away."" Technically, the bill passed in the House would not directly strip Medicaid coverage from people who currently have it. It would ultimately be up to states to take away Medicaid coverage from current beneficiaries. But the House bill, if enacted in its present form, would at the very least force some states to pull out of Medicaid expansion due to trigger laws that would go into effect if the federal contribution dries up. Blaming the states rather than the House bill for the loss of Medicaid coverage amounts to an exercise in blame-shifting. More broadly, the CBO, health policy experts and governors have warned that the federal Medicaid cuts in the Republican plan would start a domino effect that ends with millions of people covered under expanded Medicaid losing their benefits.

Calif. Democrat repeats misleading claim rape a pre-existing condition under GOP bill
","Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu of Los Angeles County repeated a deceptive claim about the GOP health care bill last week after it narrowly passed the U.S. House. Chu said the legislation ""would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition,"" in a press release on May 4, 2017. Chu and all other Democrats in the House opposed the bill, which has an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate. The national PolitiFact team fact-checked similar claims in the headlines of several blogs and rated them Mostly False. It called the statements ""bombastic"" and ""misleading."" The Washington Post Fact Checker also rejected this claim, giving it four pinnochios. PolitiFact noted that some blogs have changed their headlines or issued corrections. In a written statement on May 10, 2017, Chu said she stands by her claim: ""While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the (American Health Care Act),"" she said. Summary of PolitiFact’s findings PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at the national PolitiFact’s analysis and summarized it’s findings this way: The GOP bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable. Here’s what’s wrong with the claim Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Republicans’ Affordable Care Act replacement — the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 — weakens those protections. These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can’t afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault. But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says. They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically. But the Republican bill doesn’t pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that’s something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems. Problems prior to the Affordable Care Act The blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage. These women weren’t necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist. None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify ""sexual assault"" or ""rape"" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone’s eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions. For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market. If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn’t necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance. ""This is not something specific about sexual assault,"" said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. ""But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they’re very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future."" What repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Actand how repealing the law would affect women.  Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge. The Republicans’ bill doesn’t change what is or is not a pre-existing condition. What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. ""The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point,"" Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition. To be clear, the bill doesn’t allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual’s ""health status."" Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn’t change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare. This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said. ""Could"" is the key word. What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond. The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco. For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line. Sexual assault ""is the tip of the iceberg,"" Brindis said. ""There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can’t plan for, can’t avoid."" Our ruling Various bloggers, and some members of Congress, wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault and domestic violence is a pre-existing condition. Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from ""would"" to ""could."" The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health. The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don’t know for sure given the bill’s current form. PolitiFact National rated this claim Mostly False. Following the same analysis, PolitiFact California rates Chu’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. UPDATE: This fact check has been updated with a response from Rep. Chu, who issued a statement on May 10, 2017, which reads in full:  ""As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered ‘essential’. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill ‘would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.’ While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA. We should not even be discussing how women can be charged more for their care, even if it requires 2, 3, or 4 extra steps. This bill represents a step backwards for Americans’ health in a number of ways.""

Was Chelsea Clinton charged with fraud as Clinton Foundation shut down? No, it's fake news
","A fake news story that reads like a page out of conspiracy theory Mad Libs said that Chelsea Clinton was charged with essentially stealing from the Clinton Foundation, which had been ordered to shut down. ""Clinton Foundation ordered to cease operations – Chelsea charged with fraud!"" read the headline on a May 3, 2017, post on Liberty-Courier.com. The post was flagged as being potentially fake by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from user feeds. Among the numerous allegations made in the post, it said Chelsea Clinton was CEO of the Foundation (that would currently be Kevin Thurm; Chelsea is vice chair). The foundation had been told to stop operating, although the post didn’t say who or what made such a demand. For the record, Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra said the post is definitely incorrect. The story is full of falsehoods and paranoid nonsense, the details of which are almost certainly deliberately inane. For example, one passage reads: ""During (Hillary) Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, it’s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with the creator of ISIS and Osama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories. ""Bin Laden, who trained the 9/11 terrorists, was then sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death. Documents linking the Clinton Foundation directly to General George Hammond of SG Command were the final piece of the puzzle."" For the record, Gen. George Hammond was the one-time leader of the fictional Stargate Command. We also highly doubt Osama bin Laden and Hillary Clinton went toe-to-toe over Scattergories at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The fake post then focuses on how Chelsea Clinton supposedly ""used her family foundation’s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents."" We found several examples of this story online, most of which appeared to point back to the same May 3 post at USAPoliticsToday.com. The only source cited in that story was a Nov. 6, 2016, article from the New York Post. That article said there was evidence from WikiLeaks’ hack of former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails that Chelsea Clinton had taken money from the foundation to pay in part for her 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker had examined that same claim in January 2017, noting that the New York Post was the only U.S. newspaper to run the story, which was picked up by British tabloids and right-leaning news outlets like Fox News. ""Despite the breathless reporting, it’s hard to tell exactly what is going on in the email exchange, which is dated Jan. 4, 2012,"" the Post’s Glenn Kessler wrote. ""There is no mention of actual Foundation monies being used for the wedding."" Chelsea Clinton herself has decried how the Clinton Foundation has been a target of fake news outlets and conspiracy theorists. ""The lies were absolutely frustrating because the facts didn’t seem sufficient to put them to rest,"" she told Variety magazine in April. ""I think that was so odd about the whole experience — either the truth was insufficient or people just didn’t care."" In any event, Chelsea Clinton remains free, and the Clinton Foundation is still open for business.
