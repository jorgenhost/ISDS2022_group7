Bloomberg claims education gains
","Michael R. Bloomberg may be laying the groundwork for a presidential run. Or he may not. He is traveling around the country, delivering speeches that emphasize his record over 12 years as mayor of New York City and what he has been doing since his last term ended in 2013. In a speech to the National Action Network, the civil rights organization, on Martin Luther King Day, Bloomberg talked about his education record as mayor. ""So we closed schools that had been failing mostly minority communities for decades, and we opened new ones in their place that outperformed the old schools,"" he said. ""We gave New York City teachers a 43 percent raise to attract and retain the very best, and we more than doubled the education budget while I was in office. We also got some important help from President Obama, who worked closely with his team and us on New York’s Race to the Top application, and which helped us raise standards and increase quality schools options, including charters, for families who had long lacked them. All of this work helped us increase graduation rates by 42 percent and substantially reduce the racial achievement gap."" Given his potential presidential candidacy, we wondered about his claims. Did graduation rates increase by 42 percent, and was the racial achievement gap ""substantially"" reduced? Bloomberg, sworn into office in January 2002, was granted mayoral control of the public school system that year by the State Legislature and governor. That meant power and accountability were centralized in his office, not spread across a board of education. The system remains in place today. As evidence of Bloomberg’s claims, his longtime mayoral spokesman, Stu Loeser, offered data from the state Department of Education, as reported by the city. For the class that started high school in September 2001, and graduated by June 2005, 46.5 percent graduated. By August of 2013, Bloomberg’s final year in office, 66 percent of students graduated within four years. That’s a 42 percent increase.   Experts who study education data did not take issue with Bloomberg’s claim that graduation rates went up during his tenure. For eight years, Ray Domanico led an independent effort to evaluate the successes of mayoral control as part of New York City’s Independent Budget Office. As the director of education research, Domanico had access to the school’s data. He had been publicly supportive of Bloomberg but said he was curious before he started the job about the results of all of the changes Bloomberg was making.   ""On the graduation rate, I think that is unambiguously true,"" said Domanico, who is director of education policy at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. Experts, however, warn about some pitfalls when measuring graduation rates. Students' school years generally span more than one mayor, said Aaron Pallas, chair of the Department of Education Policy and Social Analysis at Teachers College, Columbia University. Nonetheless, Pallas said his analysis showed that Bloomberg’s claim on graduation rates was ""not outlandish.""   The Research Alliance for New York City Schools at New York University counts students differently than the city and state education departments, and it came up with a 36 percent increase in on-time graduation rates for all students obtaining any type of diploma, said Chelsea Farley, communications director. She called the findings ""generally consistent"" with Bloomberg’s claim.      Racial gap There a couple of often-used ways to examine the racial achievement gap - graduation rates and test results - and experts who analyzed data from both ways voiced doubts about Bloomberg's claim that his initiatives ""substantially"" narrowed the gap. Supporting Bloomberg’s claim, Loeser offered four-year graduation rate data from June 2005 and August 2013, broken out by racial group. White, Asian, black and Hispanic students all saw increases in on-time graduations, though white and Asian students were still more likely to graduate from high school than their black and Hispanic peers. In August 2013, 81.1 percent of Asian students graduated on time, up from 66.3 percent in June 2005. In August 2013, 79.7 percent of white students graduated on time, up from 64 percent in June 2005. In August 2013, 61.2 percent of black students graduated on time, up from 40.1 percent June 2005. In August 2013, 59 percent of Hispanic students graduated on time, up from 37.4 percent in June 2005. The gap between white and black students was 18.5 percent points in August 2013, compared with 24 percentage points in June 2005. The gap between white and Hispanic students was 20.7 percentage points in August 2013, compared with 26.6 percentage points in June 2005. That's a decrease of about 6 percentage points for each group. Bloomberg’s team uses graduation rate data to support his claim. Pallas, at Teachers College, Columbia University, characterizes the change in racial and ethnic gaps in graduation rates as a ""modest reduction."" ""It's still the case that the typical white or Asian New York City public high school student was much more likely to graduate from high school than the typical black or Hispanic students at the end of the Bloomberg era,"" Pallas wrote in an email. Farley, of the Research Alliance, said its analysis showed the gap in graduation rates for black and Latino students compared with white students narrowed from the cohort that entered 9th grade in 2001 to the cohort that entered in 2012 - roughly Bloomberg's mayoral tenure - by about 11 percentage points. As for state test scores, experts caution about relying on them to make conclusions about the racial achievement gap over time. The state changed the difficulty of its testing program numerous times between 2001 and 2013. Using the National Assessment of Educational Progress exam scores, or NAEP, to demonstrate changes in the achievement gap is also complicated by selecting which starting point to use, Domanico said.    The Independent Budget Office studied 71,000 students who were in third grade in 2008-09 and then in eighth grade in 2013-14. Looking at their scores on English Language Arts and math exams, researchers found that the gap between white and Asian students and their black and Hispanic peers widened over that period. When Pallas analyzed data from the National Assessment of Education Progress Urban District Assessment in 2012, he found that the racial/ethnic achievement gap under Bloomberg did not budge.    Our ruling Bloomberg said that graduation rates under his administration increased by 42 percent, and that the racial achievement gap was ""substantially"" reduced. The data shows the graduation rate increased by 42 percent. As for Bloomberg’s claim that his administration ""substantially"" reduced the racial achievement gap, he looks chiefly to graduation rate data, which showed that the racial achievement gap narrowed. But this part of his statement needs additional information. By a different measure - test scores - experts found that the racial achievement gap was not substantially reduced, and in some analyses didn’t budge or even widened.  We rate Bloomberg’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/feb/07/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-claims-education-gains/

Ocasio-Cortez says there is 70% support for Medicare for All
","After President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said that she feels that Trump is losing to Democrats on the issues. ""Every single policy proposal that we have adopted and presented to the American public has been overwhelmingly popular,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on MSNBC on Feb. 5. ""When we talked about a 70 percent marginal tax rate on incomes over $10 million, 60 percent of Americans approve it. Seventy percent of Americans believe in improved and expanded Medicare for All."" We evaluated American support for a 70 percent marginal tax rate in a separate fact-check. In this fact-check, we wanted to parse her statement about U.S. support for Medicare for All. It’s trickier to fact-check than it might appear. Ocasio-Cortez combined support for Medicare for All, which is a sweeping single-payer health care proposal, with expanded Medicare, which potentially is much narrower and certainly is less well defined. Medicare for All is a relatively new proposal for the Democrats and not fully fleshed out. Americans haven't had a lot of time to assess the details and the issues, which affects poll results. Ocasio-Cortez’s number comes from a summer 2018 Reuters/Ipsos poll. It asked a random sample of nearly 3,000 adults, ""Would you oppose or support a policy of Medicare for All?"" Overall, 70 percent said they would support it. About half of Republicans also had a positive take on the idea. But that survey is the high-water mark. A more recent survey in January from the long-running Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll found 56 percent of their random sample who said they strongly or somewhat favored the idea, which was presented to them as ""having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare for All, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan."" Notice the emphasis on ""all Americans"" in the question. When pollsters asked people how they felt about ""creating a national government administered health plan similar to Medicare that would be open to anyone, but would allow people to keep the coverage they have if they prefer,"" support jumped to 74 percent. That matters, because both the Senate and House bills proposing Medicare for All would eliminate virtually all private insurance. Retaining private options increased the polling results. Support rose a hair higher — to 77 percent — when the question was about allowing people between ages 50 and 64 to buy insurance through the Medicare program. Opening up Medicare to younger people falls under the category of expanded Medicare. But it isn’t the same as Medicare for All, because it wouldn’t cover everyone. The Kaiser survey tested how people reacted when they heard about some of the criticisms of Medicare for All. Asked what they thought if they heard that that Medicare for All would eliminate private insurance, support dropped to 37 percent. Ditto if they heard that it would require most Americans to pay more in taxes. If they thought it would threaten the current Medicare program, only 32 percent backed the program. So what drove their support for the concept in general? ""I think what they are giving a thumbs up to is the idea that everyone will have guaranteed coverage,"" said Liz Hamel, director of Kaiser’s public opinion research team. Labels matter. Hamel said Americans know and trust Medicare, and that has affected polling. In 2018, when the term Medicare for All replaced the term single-payer health care, she said support rose. We found one other poll from a team at Boston University and Harvard University that found only 36 percent in favor of Medicare for All. That study comes with less of a track record to assess its accuracy. Ocasio-Cortez’s press office told us they know that polling varies, but they think her statement was accurate based on recent results. The day after she appeared on MSNBC, CNN released a new poll. It asked if ""the government should provide a national health insurance program for all Americans, even if this would require higher taxes?"" And 54 percent said yes. Ocasio-Cortez said, ""70 percent of Americans believe in improved and expanded Medicare for All."" Judged against whether the public supports the idea of Medicare for All as a full replacement of other health insurance, only one poll shows support as high as Ocasio-Cortez said. A benchmark poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation put support at 56 percent, and support fell dramatically when pollsters raised potential downsides. Another survey, of less certain quality, had support at 36 percent. Enthusiasm for expanding Medicare to people over 50 reaches into the high 70s, but that approach wouldn’t fit the definition of Medicare for All.

Michael Moore wrongly describes Fox poll on US support for 70% tax on the rich
","Michael Moore so loves Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a politician that he wants the Constitution changed so the New York Democrat, who is the youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. House, can run for president. (Ocasio-Cortez is 29 and the minimum age to serve as president is 35.) Moore, the documentary filmmaker and liberal pundit, made the comment on The Last Word, an MSNBC talk show. In the same interview, while assessing potential Democratic candidates for president in 2020, he also made a claim we want to check about a controversial idea floated by Ocasio-Cortez — about a 70 percent tax rate. Suggesting the idea is loved by most Americans, Moore said: ""I’m talking about a Fox News Poll this week, where it said 70 percent of the American public agree with her on having the top marginal rate for the rich — their taxes — 70 percent rate, on the rich. And that’s a Fox News Poll saying that over two-thirds of the country support her."" There is widespread support among Americans to raise taxes on the rich. But do 70 percent support a 70 percent tax rate — as reported by the conservative TV outlet? First, a bit on the idea that Ocasio-Cortez floated on CBS’ 60 Minutes, which her office has told PolitiFact is more a discussion-starter than a proposal: The 70 percent income tax rate would affect dollars received above $10 million. That rate would be a big jump from the current top marginal tax rate of 37 percent, which kicks in for income above $510,300 for individuals and $612,350 for married couples. It’s estimated that about 16,000 would be affected by the 70 percent rate. Now, to that Fox News Poll. Moore’s claim is based on a Fox News Poll that was conducted Jan. 20-22, one of Moore’s producers told us. The producer also cited a Washington Post news story, which said that the poll found 70 percent support for raising taxes on income above $10 million. One thing to note is the poll was of a narrower group than Moore said — a random sample of registered voters, not all Americans. More importantly, despite Moore’s claim, the poll did not ask about a specific maximum tax rate. Here are the poll question and the results: Do you favor or oppose increasing tax rates only on families earning over $10 million a year?  Favor: 70 percent Oppose: 24 percent Don’t know: 5 percent So, that’s 70 percent support for increasing tax rates on families earning over $10 million. But the poll didn’t ask about raising the top rate on those families to 70 percent — or any particular rate at all. So, Moore is not accurately quoting the Fox News Poll. When we pointed that out to Moore’s producer, the producer sent us a statement in which Moore says: ""Public polling overwhelmingly shows that the American people are in favor (of) raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations, and we finally have more leaders in Washington who aren’t afraid to advocate for it."" So, there is support for Moore’s broader point. For example, a The Hill/HarrisX Daily Poll of registered voters, conducted about a week before the Fox News Poll, found 59 percent support a 70 percent top tax rate. The question and the results from that poll: Currently the top tax rate is 37 percent. Would you favor or oppose a tax proposal that would apply a 70 percent rate to the 10 millionth dollar and beyond for individuals making $10 million a year or more in reportable income?  Strongly favor: 29 percent Somewhat favor: 30 percent Somewhat oppose: 20 percent Strongly oppose: 21 percent Moore said, ""Seventy percent of the American public agree with"" Ocasio-Cortez ""on having the top marginal (tax) rate for the rich"" at 70 percent, and ""that's a Fox News Poll saying that."" A Fox News Poll found 70 percent of registered voters, not all Americans, support the general idea of raising income tax rates on families earning over $10 million. But we don’t know from the poll what percentage of Americans supports making the top tax rate 70 percent. So Moore got the details wrong, but there is some support for his broader point about U.S. sentiments toward taxing wealthier Americans. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2019/feb/06/michael-moore/70-americans-favor-70-tax-rich-according-fox-news-/

Del. Kathy Tran is wrong saying bill wouldn't change late-term abortion laws
","Freshman Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, sparked a national controversy last week after saying a bill she introduced would allow abortions in Virginia to nearly the time of birth. Tran made the comment during tough questioning from Republicans at a Jan. 28 hearing on her bill, which would have eased abortion restrictions in all phases of pregnancy. Video of her statement went viral, drawing criticism from President Donald Trump and partisan charges that Democrats were endorsing ""infanticide."" Democrats accused the GOP of launching a election-year stunt. A confusing radio interview by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam - an abortion rights defender - poured gasoline on the debate. Tran sought to calm things on Jan. 29 by posting an 87-second video on Twitter, saying she was ""surprised"" by the GOP reaction and that her bill would not have altered Virginia’s law on third-trimester abortions. Her video has received more than a million views.  ""I want to be very clear about what’s currently allowed in Virginia law,"" she said. ""Right now, women are able to access an abortion in the later stages of the pregnancy under certain conditions with approval of medical doctors. I’ve done nothing to change that."" We fact-checked whether her bill, which was killed, really would have done ""nothing to change"" Virginia’s late-term abortion laws. We found problems with Tran’s claim. Virginia allows third-trimester abortions in hospitals if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would ""likely"" kill the woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" impair her mental or physical health. Tran’s bill would have lowered the authorization from three physicians to one. That doctor would only have to certify that the pregnancy would damage a woman’s health. The ""substantial and irremediable"" threshold would have been repealed.  Opponents say the bill would have made third trimester abortions accessible to women who simply changed their mind about having a child.  Supporters of the measure say there’s no evidence that late-term abortions are sought by women who capriciously decide not to have their baby. Third trimester abortions, they say, occur in extraordinarily rare circumstances when the fetus has no chance to survive outside the womb. There have been no third-trimester abortions in Virginia during the last three years, according to data from the state’s Department of Health. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that since 2000, two third-trimester abortions have been reported to the department. Tran’s Response We asked Tran’s office for an explanation of her video statement. Rodrigo Velasquez, her senior legislative aide, sent us an email after conferring with the delegate. He wrote that Tran acknowledges her bill would have lowered, from three to one, the number of doctors needed to sign off on a third-trimester abortion. ""The intent of her statement was to explain that there would still need to be a medical reason to terminate the pregnancy as certified by a licensed medical doctor,"" Velasquez said. Addressing the harm threshold, he wrote, ""...the words ‘substantially and irremediably’ do not address specific conditions in medical terms. Therefore, the removal of this phrase likely would not change the practice of current law."" Our ruling Tran, in a videoed tweet viewed over 1 million times, said she’s ""done nothing to change"" Virginia’s law on late-term abortions. That’s wrong. She introduced an unsuccessful bill that would have eased Virginia's abortion restrictions for all pregnancy stages. In the final trimester, state law requires three physicians to certify that a continued pregnancy would either kill a woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" damage her mental or physical health. Tran’s bill would have lowered the requirements to one physician certifying that the pregnancy would damage the woman’s mental or physical health - the ""substantial and irremediable"" test would have been repealed. Third-trimester abortions are extremely rare; Virginia records show two have been performed since 2000. But that doesn’t clear Tran. The words in her bill make it clear; she did seek to change late-term laws. We rate her statement False.  ",/factchecks/2019/feb/06/kathy-tran/del-kathy-tran-wrong-saying-bill-wouldnt-change-la/

Walker misses mark on marginal tax rates
","Leaving the governor’s mansion hasn’t kept Scott Walker out of the spotlight. Walker drew national attention shortly after leaving office when he squared off with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, over marginal tax rates. Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, has captured attention for an array of outside-the-box ideas, including those on taxes. Their back-and-forth yielded plenty of headlines across the country and a series of claims from Walker about the impact of those tax rates. They included this Walker tweet on Jan. 16, 2019: ""During the 3 times the top marginal tax rates were lowered in the 20th century (Harding/Coolidge, JFK/LBJ & Reagan) revenues actually went up while the economy improved in America."" Has lowering the highest tax rates really been such an economic boost? Let’s sort out the facts from the hyperbole. Let’s learn about tax rates We’ll start with the basics — what the heck are marginal tax rates? Not all earnings are taxed the same. For 2019, singles pay a 10 percent federal income tax on the first $9,700 they earn, 12 percent on anything from there to $39,475 and so forth. The highest tax rate is 37 percent, which is for any earnings over $510,300. Those are called marginal tax rates — rates that apply only within a specific margin of income. Here’s the full list of tax brackets and income cutoffs for 2019, according to the Tax Foundation. This topic came to the fore when Ocasio-Cortez discussed raising the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent for earnings above $10 million in an appearance on CBS’ 60 Minutes. That would mean someone with $15 million in taxable earnings would pay the 70 percent rate on $5 million, and lower rates on the rest. Mark Mazur, director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact National about 16,000 Americans have earnings in that category. Their $244 billion in income above the threshold at a 70 percent rate would bring in an added $72 billion a year. That brings us to our statement, where Walker argues against raising the marginal tax rate by asserting lower rates previously boosted the economy. Asked for supporting evidence, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson pointed to increases in tax revenue that followed marginal tax cuts in the 1920s under Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, the 1960s under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. Dissecting tax policy admittedly gets deep into partisanship and competing economic theories, so we turned to a group of experts to assess whether Walker’s argument is reasonable. They consistently warned against drawing a line between particular policies and outcomes. ""Economies grow and decline for a complex set of reasons,"" said Andrew Reschovsky, professor emeritus of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin. ""One must be very careful in attributing any economic change to a specific policy."" William Gale, co-director of the centrist Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., said the 1960s cuts were a good example of that. ""There was a big boost in domestic spending and a big boost in defense spending … and there were tax cuts,"" he said. ""So it’s very difficult to say one of them mattered and none of the others did, or even that the effect of the tax cuts on revenue was positive, because there were so many other factors raising revenue."" Josh Bivens, director of research at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, said other factors were also in play for the 1986 tax cuts: they were designed to cut the top tax rates while enacting changes elsewhere to remain revenue neutral. In other words, changes were made to increase other revenue to balance out revenue lost by the tax rate reduction. Bivens also noted the 1960s and 1980s cuts were timed during an economic upswing. That’s why — according to Bivens and others — it’s critical to discuss the impact tax rates have on revenue using a scale that measures it relative to the economy. Typically this is done by looking at revenue as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product. Comparing the highest marginal tax rate to changes in income tax revenue as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s doesn’t show any clear connection between the two.  ""With respect to growth, it is hard to see a systematic relationship,"" said Menzie Chinn, a professor of public affairs and economics at UW. ""No serious econometric model (which is implicitly based on history because of the use of data) I know shows revenues going up in response to a tax cut except possibly in the very long run."" Even economists deeply involved in the Reagan tax cuts questioned their impact. Economist Martin Feldstein wrote in a 1989 paper that the 1983-84 economic recovery — coming after changes that included cuts to marginal tax rates — was not ""the result of a consumer boom financed by reductions in the personal income tax."" Feldstein was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and President Reagan's chief economic adviser from 1982 to 1984. He was later appointed to presidential advisory boards by President Bush in 2006 and President Obama in 2009. Bruce Bartlett, a domestic policy advisor to Ronald Reagan, condemned Walker’s argument. ""That claim is just nonsense,"" Bartlett said. ""He is basically saying that if ever at any point in the future nominal revenues get back to where they were, then the tax cut paid for itself. The honest way to look at it is revenues as a share of GDP."" Finally, linking marginal tax rates to revenue as Walker does would also presume the two have a consistent relationship in both directions. So increases in the marginal tax rate would presumably decrease revenues. But Reschovsky noted that in the 1990s, an increase in the top marginal rate was part of the Clinton tax bill that preceded a period of rising tax revenue. Walker claimed that during the three times the top marginal tax rates were lowered in the 20th century, ""revenues actually went up while the economy improved in America."" But that’s a largely meaningless statement, since raw revenues have always increased over time due to inflation — regardless of the current tax policy. Economists say the claimed connection between marginal tax rates and revenue doesn’t acknowledge the many other market factors at play. And the cherry-picked data Walker cites ignores the revenue increases that came after marginal tax rates rose. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

Civitas Institute mostly correct on school choice waitlists in North Carolina
","As North Carolina’s new lawmakers settle in to the General Assembly, debate over one of the state’s biggest issues — school choice — is heating back up. The Civitas Institute, a Raleigh-based conservative group, is pushing for expanded school choice, writing in a Jan. 28 tweet that ""there are almost 60,000 North Carolina children on waiting lists to access a school that works best for them."" The high number is ""because of the caps currently on #schoolchoice programs,"" the group said in a second tweet the next day. A corresponding blog post called the situation a ""crisis"" and said the waitlist total was larger than the number of students in all but three of the state’s school districts. This made us scratch our heads. Are there really that many students stuck on waitlists? Brooke Medina, communications director for the Civitas Institute, said her group estimated the number of students waiting to get into schools of choice  — which include private schools and charter schools — to be approximately 56,631. She said that number came from two sources: The students on waitlists for scholarships or state funds to help them afford private schools, and the students on waitlists to enroll in public charter schools. In the first category, Medina said Civitas Institute looked at the Opportunity Scholarship Program, the Disabilities Grant Program and the Education Savings Account. According to the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority, 7,593 of 8,113 eligible applicants got Opportunity Scholarships — which provide up to $4,200 per year and are commonly known as school vouchers — in 2018-19. Medina said Civitas Institute counted the 520 eligible applicants who did not get scholarships as being on a waitlist. But Kathryn Marker, director of grants, training and outreach for the NCSEAA, said these students were not actually placed on a physical waitlist. They were simply not awarded the money because the number of eligible kindergarten and first-grade students receiving scholarships had already reached the program's assigned cap. It would have been more accurate to say the students were ""unable to be awarded the scholarship because of the cap,"" she said. The same is true for the Disabilities Grant Program, which covers tuition, fees and some other expenses for students with disabilities. Only 833 of 1,164 eligible students received this grant, leaving 331 students out, according to the NCSEAA. The Education Savings Account, a program that awards state funds to parents of students with disabilities, gave out 347 grants, according to the NCSEAA. But the data did not say how many of the 1,430 total applicants were eligible. Medina said Civitas Institute assumed that a similar proportion of applicants would have been eligible for both the Education Savings Account and the Disabilities Grant Program, so the group estimated that approximately 780 students would have been rejected. Together, these three numbers total 1,631 students. The rest of the nearly 60,000 students on waitlists are those hoping to enroll in publicly-funded charter schools, Medina said. Charter schools operate outside school districts under the direction of independent governing boards. They were adopted into state law in 1996, and now 185 of them serve more than 100,000 students throughout North Carolina. According to a 2018 report from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, there were 55,165 students on charter school waitlists as of December 2017. But this figure comes with some caveats, which the report spells out. ""This figure reflects a point in time — waitlists could change daily — and cannot be verified as an unduplicated count of students — as a student could be on multiple school waitlists,"" the report said, adding that it was based on the ""best information available."" Medina acknowledged that duplicates could have skewed her group’s estimate, but suggested that the 55,165 figure could actually be an underestimate because only 134 of the 185 charter schools (173 at the time of the report) provided waitlist data. To be safe, however, she said her group rounded the number down to 55,000 students. ""We've presented this aggregate as an estimate,"" Medina said. ""Despite this, we believe it is a reasonable one."" So to recap, Civitas Institute counted about 55,000 students on charter school waitlists, plus another 1,631 students who missed out on scholarship money for private schools. That makes a total of 56,631 students, which is close enough to support the claim that ""almost 60,000"" students were on waitlists. But with so many caveats at play, the group should have been clearer that its number was an estimate. Civitas Institute said ""there are almost 60,000 North Carolina children on waiting lists to access a school that works best for them."" This number seems reasonable, but there are some caveats that should have prompted the group to note in its tweet that its figure was an estimate. We rate this statement Mostly True. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly said eligible students did not receive Opportunity Scholarships due to a cap on program funding. But the number of scholarships was actually limited by a separate cap that says no more than 40 percent of the program's funds can be used toward kindergarten and first-grade students. Our ruling remains the same. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Has unemployment not fallen under Gov. Jim Justice?
","Unemployment has fallen across the country in recent years. But the West Virginia Democratic Party said in a recent tweet that it hasn’t fallen on Republican Gov. Jim Justice’s watch. In a Jan. 9 tweet, the state party wrote, ""FACT: Unemployment rate has not decreased since @WVGovernor took office. #wvpol #WVSOTS19"" FACT: Unemployment rate has not decreased since @WVGovernor took office. #wvpol #WVSOTS19 Is that correct? We decided to check it out. (We reached out to a party representative but did not receive a response.) Justice, elected as a Democrat in 2016, took office on Jan. 16, 2017. That month, the unemployment rate in West Virginia was 5.3 percent. Justice became a Republican on Aug. 3, 2017. That month, the state unemployment rate stood at 5.2 percent. And today? In the most recent month available, December 2018, the unemployment rate in West Virginia was 5.1 percent. Is that a dramatic drop? No. But unlike what the tweet says, it is a decline. It’s worth noting a limitation in the data, said Brian Lego, a research assistant professor at West Virginia University. Because West Virginia’s population is small, he said, the margin of error for the survey used to track the unemployment rate is big enough to produce uncertainty about small changes in the data, like those seen during Justice’s tenure. ""The change is statistically insignificant,"" Lego said. He added that regular revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects the data, could produce small changes that affect the comparison. The West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted, ""FACT: Unemployment rate has not decreased since @WVGovernor took office."" The state unemployment rate did, in fact, decline from 5.3 percent to 5.1 percent on Justice’s watch. That said, it was an exceedingly narrow decline -- in fact, economists say that the margin of error for the survey in question leaves in doubt how big the decline was.

Shelley Moore Capito mostly right about recent GDP growth, unemployment
","In a recent op-ed, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., wrote that the economic environment in West Virginia -- and the United States as a whole -- is the healthiest it’s been in years. In the op-ed, published Jan. 3 in the Daily Mail WV, Capito wrote that ""the American economy had quite a year. In fact, our economy is growing at its fastest pace in nearly four years. Unemployment is at an all-time low."" Is this accurate? We reached out to Capito’s office but did not receive a response, so we turned to official federal economic data. We found that Capito’s comment is mostly -- but not completely -- on the mark. The typical statistic used to measure economic growth is the percent change in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product over the previous quarter. Here’s how that looks since the beginning of 2007, right before the onset of the Great Recession. In the most recent quarter for which data was available -- the third quarter of 2018 -- inflation-adjusted GDP grew by 3.4 percent. The quarter before that -- the second quarter of 2018 -- it grew at 4.2 percent. The last time the quarterly growth rate was higher than that was in the third quarter of 2014, when the rate stood at 4.9 percent. That’s about four years ago. So if you look at the two most recent periods, they are both higher than any other quarter going back about four years. On the unemployment rate, Capito is close but not exactly correct when she says it’s at an all-time low. Here’s a chart showing the most commonly cited unemployment statistic going back to 1948, when the calculation first took its current form. At the time the op-ed was published, the most recent unemployment rate, for December 2018, was 3.9 percent. And in the recent past -- from August to November 2018 -- the rate had hovered between 3.7 percent and 3.8 percent. That’s quite low by historical standards, but not the lowest ever. In 1968 and 1969, unemployment was below 3.7 percent for more than a year. And for most of 1951, 1952 and 1953, it was also under 3.7 percent. Capito said, ""Our economy is growing at its fastest pace in nearly four years. Unemployment is at an all-time low."" She’s right about the pace of economic growth, and she’s close on the unemployment rate, which has in recent months been at its lowest rate in about half a century, though not since the creation of the statistic.

John Boehner says more Americans are leaving the workforce than are finding jobs
","In a recent press conference, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, took time out from discussing the crisis in Syria to remind Americans about shortcomings in the job market. ""Last week yet another report showing our economy continues to struggle -- this new normal of slow growth, high unemployment, and stagnant wages,"" Boehner said on Sept. 12, 2013. ""We've got more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs."" We wondered if Boehner was correct that there are ""more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs."" Boehner is expressing a commonly shared concern. Most economists express worry about an ongoing decline in ""labor-force participation"" -- the percentage of Americans 16 or older who are working, or who are actively looking for a job. The percentage for August 2013 was the lowest it’s been since August 1978, and if fewer people are working, that’s a drag on the nation’s potential for rapid economic growth. But as we will see, determining how much of this decline in labor-force participation is due to the poor economy, as opposed to broader demographic trends, is tricky. When we asked Boehner’s office for the source of this statistic, a spokesman pointed us to news reports about the most recent employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau found that between July 2013 and August 2013, the economy created a net 169,000 additional jobs, while the size of the civilian labor force dropped by 312,000. (The civilian labor force refers to working-age people who are either employed or were unemployed but looking for work.) That supports Boehner’s comment that more Americans are leaving the workforce finding jobs. But economists say the statistic Boehner chose to illustrate the broader trend isn’t ideal. For starters, it combines numbers from two different surveys that don’t really produce apples-to-apples comparisons. And there are two more worrisome issues: • One-month comparisons are less reliable than longer-term comparisons. There’s a lot of statistical ""noise"" from month to month in this type of data -- ""noise"" that tends to balance out over a longer period of time. This is important because, while Boehner was correct about the most recent jobs report, the trends in the most recent month actually run counter to what’s been happening over the longer term. Since the start of the year, the civilian labor force has fallen by 168,000 people, but the number of people employed has risen by 848,000. And over the past year -- from August 2012 to August 2013 -- the civilian labor force has risen by 839,000 people, while the number of people employed has risen by a little more than 2 million. (The numbers are only slightly different if you take into account an annual adjustment for population growth that occurs in January.) Either way, the gain in employment was bigger than the gain (or loss) in people in the labor force. So by choosing to focus on the most recent month, Boehner is essentially cherry-picking the one period for which the trends don’t look very favorable. • Using the full labor force to gauge how many people are ""leaving the workforce"" isn’t perfect. Americans are aging -- the leading edge of the baby boomers is turning 67, so every month, large numbers of Americans are retiring. In addition, the statistic Boehner used captures Americans as young as age 16, and many Americans between that age and their early 20s aren’t part of the labor market because they are going to school. How much does this skew the numbers? It’s hard to say for sure, but in August 2013, just under 7 percent of those categorized as ""not in the labor force"" were also categorized as ""want a job now."" The bulk of the remaining 93 percent are likely school- and retirement-age Americans. So many of the non-workers Boehner’s referring to aren’t people actively engaged in the job market. We can make a more targeted estimate by focusing on those who ""want a job now."" This particular statistic is not offered in a seasonally adjusted version, so we can’t compare one month to the next. The only valid comparison we can do is between August 2012 and August 2013. What does that show? It turns out that the number of people not in the labor force but who wanted a job fell by 740,000 over that year-long period, while the number of people employed over the same period rose by more than 2.2 million. So, looking at it this way, Boehner’s claim misses the longer-term trend. Our ruling Boehner said that, according to the most recent jobs report, ""we've got more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs."" That is what the most recent one-month jobs report found. However, there’s less to this piece of data than meets the eye. Looking at the year-to-date and year-to-year figures show the opposite pattern, and Boehner’s calculation doesn’t account for the large numbers of baby boomers who are retiring because they no longer want to work. In all, Boehner has stated one fact correctly -- and put his finger on an issue of concern to economists -- but he’s ignored other pieces of that give a more nuanced impression.

Cuccinelli says he never backed legislation that limits contraception choices
","Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli is combating accusations that he’s tried to restrict the types of birth control Virginians could use. ""I’ve never supported legislation that invades people’s choices about contraception,"" Cuccinelli told reporters on Aug. 27 while campaigning in Northern Virginia. His comment was reported by The Washington Post and The Loudoun Times. Cuccinelli made a similar comment during a July 20 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe when he was asked by moderator Judy Woodruff, ""Would you again seek to make several forms of contraception illegal as you did several years ago?"" ""Well, I certainly didn’t do that several years ago,"" Cuccinelli replied. We examined Cuccinelli’s claim. At issue is his support of support of two ""personhood"" bills that sought to provide human embryos with legal rights. Both bills died in the General Assembly. Supporters say personhood laws provide a legal remedy to parents if an unborn child is killed by the negligent or criminal act of a third party. Opponents say the measures are a ruse to challenge abortion and contraception rights. In 2007, Cuccinelli as a state senator co-sponsored legislation that would have given pre-born humans the ""right to the enjoyment of life"" from the moment fertilization. Critics, including McAuliffe, say the bill would have outlawed birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. As attorney general, Cuccinelli last year spoke at a rally for a similar bill that would have extended to human embryos and fetuses, from the moment of conception, ""all the rights available to others living in Virginia."" Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli’s campaign, said her boss’s statements are accurate because the legislation he backed simply ""defined life and had no language or reference to any form of contraception or any access to contraception."" Nix added in a follow-up email that Cuccinelli ""does not believe the government should regulate contraception and supported this legislation because he is pro-life, and this bill would protect innocent life."" The debate on personhood’s effect on contraception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that condoms and other forms of birth control that merely prevent fertilization would unaffected by a measure to provide legal rights to preborn children. But various forms of FDA-approved contraception can also work to prevent the implantation of fertilized egg in the uterus. For example, although birth control pills mainly work to prevent fertilization by preventing the release of an egg, they can also make the lining of the uterus inhospitable to implantation after its fertilized, according to WebMD. Emergency contraceptives if taken soon after intercourse can prevent the release of an egg to prevent fertilization. But if taken later, they can prevent the implantation of an egg. Some abortion opponents believe life begins at the moment of fertilization and consider anything that prevents a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus as tantamount to producing an abortion. That’s sparked concerns from supporters of contraceptive access that conveying rights to human eggs from the moment of fertilization could open the door to limiting birth control products that can prevent affect implantation. Nix, in her statement, did not spell out exactly how Cuccinelli defines ""contraception."" We asked if he includes in his definition any method that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg, but didn’t get a clear response. ""The pharmaceutical structure for contraception is one that changes with ongoing medical research,"" Nix said. ""Ken Cuccinelli is not interested in legislating contraception."" We should note that as a state senator back in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a Democratic measure that would have specified contraception does not constitute abortion. The bill, which passed the Senate but died in the House, defined contraception as methods that block fertilization or prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists weighed in on that debate last year warning that personhood laws being considered around the nation saying it threatened certain forms of contraception. ""Although the individual wording in these proposed measures varies from state to state, they all attempt to give full legal rights to a fertilized egg by defining `personhood’ from the moment of fertilization before conception (ie. pregnancy/implantation) has occurred,"" ACOG wrote.    That would make condoms, spermicides and natural family planning ""the only legally allowed forms of birth control,"" the group said. In other words, the doctors said that only birth control devices that prevent sperm from joining an egg would remain legal. ""Thus, some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt ‘personhood’ measures,"" ACOG said. Three days after ACOG’s statement, the Virginia’s 2012 personhood bill was approved by the Republican-led House on an almost straight party line vote. Democrats unsuccessfully offered an amendment that specified the legislation ""shall not be interpreted as affecting lawful contraception."" Two days later -- on Feb. 15, 2012 -- Cuccinelli endorsed the bill at rally on the Capitol grounds, although news stories contain no mention addressing contraception in his speech. The bill, however, died in the Senate. Both the 2012 and the 2007 measures may not have survived legal challenge even if they had passed.  A.E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia constitutional law professor, pointed out to us that the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972 ruled that couples have a right of access to contraception. Our ruling Cuccinelli, in a carefully-worded statement, says he’s never supported legislation that ""invades people’s choices about contraception."" While he’s never cast a vote on legislation that explicitly restricted birth control options, Cuccinelli for a decade has been one of the strongest anti-abortion voices in Virginia. He’s supported personhood bills that recognized life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization and bestowed human embryos with legal rights. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says such legislation could outlaw birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. Cuccinelli’s wording also allows him to gloss over a vote he cast in 2003 against legislation that would have specified contraception does not constitute an abortion. So Cuccinelli’s claim has some accuracy, but omits his consistent support of bills that would have opened or protected legal avenues to challenge the use of certain contraceptives.

Facebook post recognizes little-known space fact
","Occasionally a claim comes across our desks here at PolitiFact Georgia that seems to touch all bases -- this one has God, politics and even men landing on the moon. The claim hinted at political ramifications and a possible government cover-up. And it was broadcast as a viral Facebook post. What more could a fact-checker ask for? So let’s go back a bit, to 1969 and man’s first landing on the moon, a feat that seemed almost magical to anyone watching and listening. ""Not many people know it but on July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin took communion on the moon. The very first meal ever taken on the moon was the blood and body of Christ!"" the Facebook post read. We had heard about astronauts partaking of freeze-dried food and dehydrated drinks. And we knew about the Apollo 8 crew on Christmas Eve 1968 reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon, an event heard by millions. But the Holy Communion claim was new to us. We decided to do some exploring of our own. The Facebook post about Aldrin led to a post on the JesusLovesYou.org website, a member of the Greater Good Network of websites. The sites promote numerous nonprofit organizations for contributions. That post references Aldrin’s comments on the experience: ""I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute [they] had requested that I not do this,"" Aldrin said. ""NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O’Hare (sic), the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon Christmas (Eve in 1968). I agreed reluctantly."" So, is that why we hadn’t heard about the moon service? Did NASA, under pressure from an atheist activist, try to keep the Christian observance a secret? Our research on this claim led to several sources about the holy meal, but we wanted to hear directly from Aldrin himself. Aldrin was part of the Apollo 11 space mission that put the first people on the moon on July 20, 1969. He was the second person to walk on the moon, following fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong. The moonwalker is currently on a tour promoting his newest book, ""Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration."" We tracked down his tour publicist at National Geographic Books, but unfortunately,we were unable to schedule an interview by press time. Aldrin is now consulting for the U.S. government about the future of the country's space program and how to make space more accessible to everyday people The Communion event was re-enacted during Episode Six of the HBO-television miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon."" The one-season, 12-episode miniseries ran in 1998. It was a dramatized portrayal of the Apollo manned space program’s expeditions to the moon. But in a Guideposts article after the 1969  mission, Aldrin confirmed that the religious meal took place inside the Eagle spacecraft once it landed on the moon. ""I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me.  In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup,"" Aldrin said. ""It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements."" He then recited a Bible verse, John 15:5. NASA history also mentions Aldrin’s Communion service. In his memoirs, Aldrin notes that Armstrong did not participate in the Communion service. Aldrin also expressed second thoughts about his religious observance. ""Neil watched respectfully but made no comment to me at the time,"" Aldrin wrote. ""Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind -- be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists."" Aldrin initially wanted his Communion service broadcast on the air with the rest of his comments and biblical reading. But NASA decided against that idea. It was conducted during ""radio silence,"" which means that only he and Armstrong witnessed it. There was no communication between the spacecraft and Mission Control in Houston during radio silence. Atheist activist Madalyn Murray O’Hair had already sued NASA over the 1968 Bible reading in space. O’Hair said the reading violated the legal separation of church and state. ""Although O’Hair’s ideas did not represent mainstream America at that time, her lawsuit was a nuisance and a distraction that NASA preferred to live without,"" Aldrin wrote. (The case was eventually rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.) So during radio silence, Aldrin read his Bible verse and took his Communion. Aldrin kept his on-air comments more general. He asked for a few moments of silence ""to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way."" To sum up, a Facebook post claimed that NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin took Communion on the moon.  Several sources, including NASA records and Aldrin’s memoirs, include accounts of the Communion service. PolitiFact also discovered that Aldrin’s church, outside of Houston, still celebrates the lunar Communion service each year on the Sunday closest to the July 20, 1969, moon landing.

Rebuffing Scott Walker, Minnesota lawmaker says his state is better than Wisconsin for business
","Minnesota state Rep. Joe Atkins got perturbed by what he said were Gov. Scott Walker’s attempts to lure companies across the border by portraying Wisconsin as the better place to do business. So Atkins, chairman of the Minnesota House of Representatives’ commerce committee, called a meeting of the panel on Aug. 29, 2013. The purpose was to hear testimony on whether the Badger State is really in a stronger position to attract businesses than the Gopher State. Afterward, Atkins, a Democratic­-Farmer­-Labor Party member from the Twin Cities area, declared: ""The objective data shows that, frankly, Minnesota is kicking butt relative to Wisconsin on everything from employment and job creation to school test scores, educated workforce and a host of other factors and rankings,"" he said, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. ""I understand the desire to promote one's state, but (Walker’s) full of baloney when it comes to saying that Wisconsin is a better place to put your business than Minnesota."" Baloney, we can’t (and don’t want) to test. ""Kicking butt,"" we can. We know, for example, that Wisconsin has kicked Minnesota’s butt in college football for more than a decade, including winning the last nine games in a row. So, let’s check the thrust of Atkins' claim -- that Minnesota’s business climate is clearly superior to Wisconsin’s based in particular on four measures Atkins singled out, but on other measures, as well. Employment To back the first part of his claim, Atkins cited the unemployment rate. The latest monthly figures, for July 2013, show Minnesota at 5.2 percent, nearly one-quarter lower than Wisconsin’s 6.8 percent. BLS data also show that Minnesota’s rate was at least 1.5 percentage points lower than Wisconsin’s in each month from January through June of 2013. In response, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson cited figures showing Wisconsin’s labor force participation exceeded Minnesota’s. But labor force participation measures not only people who are employed, but also people who are unemployed but actively looking for work. So, it’s not a strict measure of employment, per se. Job creation Atkins cited the latest month-to-month U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, which show the number of people employed in July 2013 vs. July 2012. They show that in Minnesota, an additional 55,000 people became employed, compared with 25,800 more in Wisconsin. We calculated that to be an increase of 2 percent for Minnesota, more than double Wisconsin’s growth of just under 1 percent. Atkins also cited reports by Congress’ Joint Economic Committee; Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is the committee’s co-chair. The latest report, released in July 2013, shows that since the recession, Minnesota job growth was 0.1 percent while Wisconsin lost 1.5 percent of its jobs. We also found June 2013 rankings by The Business Journal for private-sector employment growth. Both Walker and Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, took office in January 2011. Dayton was ranked 15th among governors, with a 2.01 percent growth rate during his tenure; Walker was ranked 40th at 1.07 percent.   School test scores Both Atkins and Evenson cited results of the ACT college entrance exam. We found that for the class of 2013, among states where more than half the students took the ACT, Minnesota ranked first and Wisconsin tied with Iowa for second. Minnesota’s average score of 23 and Wisconsin’s was 22.1. That's a pretty significant gap, given that the range of scores was small, from 18.7 to 23. Educated workforce To back this part of his claim, Atkins cited the percentage of residents age 25 and over who had a bachelor’s degree. His figures were dated, so we found the most recent figures, for 2011, which show Minnesota’s education attainment about one-fifth higher than Wisconsin’s. In Minnesota, 31.9 percent of residents had a four-year degree or higher. In Wisconsin, the rate was 26.2. OK. So, how did Atkins’ four measures score out? Minnesota kicked butt in the sense that it outperformed Wisconsin on all four measures, and by comfortable margins.   Other measures The rest of Atkins' claim was that Minnesota also beats Wisconsin on a host of other business climate-related measures. He and Evenson cited some, and we found some, as well. Compared to the measures Atkins cited, the results are more of a mixed bag. On some measures, Minnesota ranked better than Wisconsin. -- Business climate: The latest Forbes ranking of states for business, released in December 2012, listed Minnesota 20th and Wisconsin 44th overall. In terms of economic climate, Minnesota ranked 20th and Wisconsin 29th. The magazine considered costs, labor supply, regulatory environment, current economic climate, growth prospects and quality of life. And CNBC's ""top states for doing business"" ratings for 2013 ranked Minnesota 15th and Wisconsin 22nd. The business news TV network's index uses 51 measures of competitiveness. -- Competitiveness: The Beacon Hill Institute, a free-market think tank at Suffolk University in Boston, released its annual competitiveness index in April 2013. The index, which assesses government and fiscal policy, infrastructure, business incubation and other factors, ranked Minnesota third and Wisconsin 18th. -- Economic growth: A U.S. Commerce Department report released in June 2013 showed Minnesota’s gross domestic product increased 3.5 percent in 2012. That was more than double Wisconsin’s 1.5 percent. Wisconsin did better on other measures. -- Business climate: In November 2012, Site Selection magazine ranked Wisconsin 13th on its list of top 25 states for business climate. Minnesota didn’t make the list. The study was based in part on surveys of corporate site selectors. -- CEO survey: A national survey of 736 chief executive officers by Chief Executive magazine, published in March 2013, ranked Wisconsin the 17th best state for doing business, with Walker’s election cited as a key reason. Minnesota ranked 30th, with Gov. Dayton’s support of tax increases cited.   -- Private investment: A July 2013 report by the Private Equity Growth Capital Council rated the top 20 states by ""investment value and the number of investments."" Wisconsin ranked 14th at $9.1 billion; Minnesota didn’t make the list. On still other measures, the two states were about even. -- Business taxes: The Tax Foundation’s ""2013 state business tax climate index,"" which is based on how 100 tax variables affect competitiveness, rated both states as among the worst, with Wisconsin at 43rd and Minnesota at 45th. -- Entrepreneurial activity: Measuring entrepreneurial activity as being high, medium or low for 2012, the Kauffman Foundation put both states in the low category. -- Business climate: In an April 2013 report on small business (companies with fewer than 500 employees), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranked Wisconsin 39th in business climate and Minnesota 40th. Taxes, government regulation and other measures went into assessing business climate. For ""overall performance,"" the chamber put Minnesota 15th, with high ratings for ""talent"" and infrastructure; and Wisconsin 44th, with low ranks for short- and long-term job growth. We could go on, but we think the picture is pretty clear. Our rating Comparing the two states for business, Atkins said: ""Minnesota is kicking butt relative to Wisconsin on everything from employment and job creation to school test scores, educated workforce and a host of other factors and rankings."" Minnesota outperformed Wisconsin by comfortable margins on four measures Atkins singled out, and on several other rankings that used various economic indices. On other measures, Wisconsin led or was about even with Minnesota. For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Atkins a Half True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/16/joe-atkins/rebuffing-scott-walker-minnesota-lawmaker-says-his/

Cory Booker claims Newark represents a third of real-estate growth in New Jersey
","Editor’s Note: On March 14, 2013, PolitiFact New Jersey rated as Mostly True a statement by Newark Mayor Cory Booker that ""More than 30 percent of all commercial and multifamily development in the entire state is happening in Newark."" We based that ruling on building permit and square footage data provided by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, a real-estate development firm that compiled numbers for the Booker administration and experts in the real-estate development industry. Booker, now a candidate in an Oct. 16 special election for the late Frank Lautenberg’s U.S. Senate seat, made the claim again in a form e-mail campaign letter distributed last week. In reanalyzing the claim, we realized that our first ruling didn’t take fully into account how Newark compares statewide in terms of building permits and value of new construction. This fact-check adds that analysis and consequently changes the ruling to Half True. With about a month to go before a special election for a vacant U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Cory Booker is using a Newark statistic to bolster support for his campaign. Booker, Newark’s mayor, cited the Brick City’s real estate growth in a Senate campaign form e-mail received last week by PolitiFact.com. Newark is ""now home to one-third of all commercial and multi-family development,"" said Booker, whose challenger in the Oct. 16 special election is Republican Steve Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota. That’s quite a claim to make, considering New Jersey has 21 counties and 566 municipalities. But after analyzing this claim, it’s clear the statistic only holds up when measured a particular way. First, let’s explain how real estate growth is measured before we delve into Newark’s numbers. Generally speaking, experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey that the real estate industry standard is to measure residential growth in building permits issued and commercial development in square footage. Why? The barometer for growth in residential real estate is number of units, which is tracked by building permits. That shows demand for households, said Rosemary Scanlon, divisional dean at the New York University Schack Institute of Real Estate and a former chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But size matters more in commercial real estate because space can be made to fit the needs of firms moving in, and it’s also an economic indicator of business activity in the community, said Ken Danter, CEO of the Danter Company, a real estate research and consulting firm based in Columbus, Ohio. New Jersey’s Department of Community Affairs, however, tracks data by building permits because permits show ""the beginning of the process,"" said John Lago, the DCA’s housing research manager. ""If you’re mixing standards, it’s like mixing centigrade and fahrenheit,"" Lago said. There’s nothing technically wrong with using one measure for all real estate growth, but it’s not exactly conventional, Scanlon explained. Danter said he wouldn’t mix the two. So it’s clear that there are differing opinions about mixing building permits with square footage to measure growth. Now let’s look at Newark’s numbers. Booker’s city administration shared with us numbers crunched for the mayor by real estate development firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which used a database known as CoStar. Adam Zipkin, Booker’s deputy mayor for economic development, said those developments were measured in square footage. For 2012, New Jersey had projects under construction totaling 3,306,551 square feet. Of that, Newark was responsible for projects totaling 1,168,793 square feet – or 35.3 percent of the state real estate development total, according to the data. So based strictly on square footage, Booker is correct that Newark represents 30 percent of the real estate development going on statewide. But the number is significantly different if we look at building permits and the value of new construction for every municipality in the state. In that case, Newark ranked second for 2012, at $276,225,281, according to DCA data. Jersey City ranked first, at $391,016,932. The total value of new construction statewide in 2012, including state buildings, was $10,941,709,996. By that measure, Newark accounted for just 3 percent of the value of new construction statewide. Our ruling Booker said in a campaign e-mail, Newark is ""now home to one-third of all commercial and multi-family development."" Data from a real estate development firm compiling statistics for Booker showed that in terms of square footage, Newark accounted for 35 percent – or a bit more than a third -- of the residential and commercial real estate growth last year in New Jersey. So he’s right on that point. But in terms of building permits and value of new construction, Newark can claim just 3 percent of that total. Given that point, the ruling is Half True.

Interest payments on U.S. debt exceed U.S. tax revenue, Wisconsin state lawmaker says
","State Rep. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, has taken some bold positions since he won an open Wisconsin Assembly seat in 2010 as a political newcomer. In 2011, Kapenga said he believed several people were ""bought out"" by police and fire unions to stop those unions from being included in Act 10. The law advanced by Gov. Scott Walker dramatically curtailed collective bargaining rights for most public workers, but, over the objection of Kapenga  and others, it exempted police and firefighters. In 2012, Kapenga joined eight other GOP state lawmakers who pledged to back a bill to arrest any federal officials who try to implement President Barack Obama’s health reform law in Wisconsin. Then in an Aug. 23, 2013 newsletter to constituents, Kapenga, a certified public accountant, made a bold claim about the federal debt -- and dared his readers to check it. ""As we approach the $17 trillion debt level, I want to emphasize how dangerous this is for our nation,"" Kapenga wrote. ""An old proverb tells us that the borrower is slave to the lender, and as we continue to spend and build debt, think about who we are getting our money from. The answer is the printing press and China. He added: ""When the amount of interest you pay on your debt exceeds your total tax revenue (yes it does -- check it out!), common sense tells us that all other programs are at risk."" Whoa -- just the amount of interest we pay on the federal debt is more than all the tax revenue Uncle Sam takes in? Actually, not even close. When we contacted Kapenga, he admitted he had erred, saying a constituent already had pointed out that he was wrong. OK. So, how do interest payments on the debt and total tax revenue compare? Net interest payments totaled $220 billion in 2012, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Net interest payments are what most economists cite when talking about interest on the debt, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ Richard Kogan told us. That figure corresponds to the roughly $12 trillion in debt that we owe outside creditors, such as China. Total interest payments -- the $220 billion plus $140 billion in interest paid for intragovernmental borrowing, such as tapping surplus Social Security funds -- was about $360 billion in 2012. That corresponds with the total debt of roughly $17 trillion. Is there reason to worry, as Kapenga indicated in his newsletter? Well, CBO projects that by 2020, net interest payments -- on the debt owed to outside creditors -- will nearly triple from $220 billion per year to $644 billion per year. But even that’s a far cry from the total tax revenue the federal government takes in. Federal tax revenue in 2012 was $2.45 trillion. That’s 11 times higher than the $220 billion in net interest payments on the debt and about seven times higher than the $360 billion in total interest payments. Kapenga said he has drafted this correction for his next newsletter: ""Thank you to one of my constituents who noted an error in my Aug. 23 E-Update. In my article about the danger of our U.S. debt, it stated that ‘the interest you pay on your debt exceeds your total tax revenue’ when it should have said ‘total corporate tax revenue.’"" The amount of corporate tax revenue the federal government takes in is much closer to the net interest payments on the debt, but it's still higher than those payments, according to CBO. Corporate tax revenue in 2012 was $242 billion, exceeding the $220 billion in net interest payments. For 2013, the difference is projected to be even greater -- $291 billion versus $223 billion. Our rating Kapenga said ""the amount of interest"" paid on the federal debt exceeds the federal government’s ""total tax revenue."" In fact, tax revenue is a number of times higher than what the government pays in interest on the debt. We rate Kapenga’s statement False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/15/chris-kapanga/interest-payments-us-debt-exceeds-us-tax-revenue-w/
"['Rhode Island', 'City Budget', 'American LeadHERship PAC']","
American LeadHERship PAC says Providence’s credit rating sank close to ‘junk bond’ status under Mayor Angel Taveras
","In July, political consultant Kate Coyne-McCoy registered a new super PAC with a mission, among other things, to boost the potential candidacy of Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo for governor. It is called American LeadHERship PAC. A super PAC is a political action committee registered with the Federal Election Commission that is allowed to spend an unlimited sum in support of or in opposition to candidates for elective office. In contrast with a traditional political action committee, a super PAC may not contribute directly to a campaign or coordinate activity with a candidate. Raimondo is expected to seek the Democratic nomination in next year’s primary election, and a potential rival for the nomination is Providence Mayor Angel Taveras. Based on the assumption that he will run, Rhode Islander Coyne-McCoy posted on the website for American LeadHERship some disparaging information about Taveras. After Taveras took office as mayor in January 2011, Coyne-McCoy pointed out, Providence’s credit rating was downgraded to ""two steps above junk-bond status"" by Fitch Ratings. When a government or business with questionable credit borrows money by selling a bond, the certificate is called a ""junk bond."" Asked what she is implying by listing that as a bullet point on her website, Coyne-McCoy responded, ""I’m just repeating a fact. He was the leader of the city when the downgrade occurred."" And why bring it up? ""Because I don’t believe Angel Taveras is as good a leader as Gina Raimondo,"" she said. Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, two of the nation’s three major credit-rating agencies, announced in March 2011 sharp downgrades of Providence’s primary bond ratings, leaving the city two and three notches from junk-bond status, respectively. Fitch said it was concerned about whether the city could generate sufficient cash to pay its bills through the end of the 2010-11 fiscal year. The third agency, Moody’s Investors Service, was more gentle, knocking the city down to an A3 on Moody’s rating scale, higher than the other two agencies All three downgrades occurred about two months after Taveras took the oath of office -- and only after a committee of financial experts empaneled by Taveras found and disclosed that the city had a $110-million structural deficit. (A structural deficit is a built-in long-term gap between revenue and expenses.) The structural deficit, equal to one-sixth the size of the budget and aggravated by a depleted rainy day fund, was inherited from Taveras’ predecessor, David N. Cicilline. In his final months in office, as he was campaigning for his current seat in Congress, Cicilline declared that the city was in ""excellent financial condition"" -- an assessment that he apologized for after winning his new political office. The new mayor took office midway through a fiscal year in which the city had not yet adopted a budget. But few residents perceived a huge problem, in part because no more than six months earlier the city had been enjoying decent credit ratings of A1, A and AA- from Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, respectively. Anticipating a financial struggle, Taveras appointed the panel of experts eight days into his tenure, and it revealed the depth of the crisis. The new mayor declared the situation a ""Category 5 fiscal hurricane"" and took a series of steps that have virtually erased the $110-million structural deficit. Among them: he persuaded police and firefighter unions and public safety retirees to make wage and benefit concessions; tax-exempt universities and hospitals agreed to pay the city more money in lieu of taxes; and the city revamped the system of retirement and medical care benefits. In May 2012, Providence slipped another notch in Standard & Poor’s rankings, to two notches above junk bond status. So is Taveras to blame for the poor credit ratings, as Coyne-McCoy seems to imply? As the structural deficit was being eliminated, the agencies have had positive things to say about city management. For example, Fitch said in 2012 and 2013 that progress on the deficit was ""impressive"" and ""notable."" In December 2012, Moody’s declared Providence’s money-saving pension reform ""a precedent that other struggling Rhode Island cities and towns can follow."" On Wednesday, Sept. 11, 2013, Standard & Poor’s affirmed its BBB rating, two notches above junk bond status. But the agency also revised its outlook for Providence from ""negative"" to ""stable."" Our ruling American LeadHERship is accurate in noting that one of three bond-rating agencies, Fitch Ratings, downgraded Providence’s bond rating to two notches above junk-bond status in March 2011. Although not noted on the PAC’s website, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings also were lowered, but at that point were less negative than Fitch. Coyne-McCoy, well-schooled in Rhode Island politics, knows perfectly well that Taveras inherited the deficit from the previous mayor, who lied about the city’s financial condition. And she does not mention that the new mayor took immediate actions to improve Providence’s finances -- actions that have been praised, including by the bond-rating agencies. The judges realize that she may not consider Taveras as good a leader as Raimondo, but the statement she posted on American LeadHERship is reminiscent of Cicilline’s comments about the city’s financial condition. Because it leaves out important details and takes things out of context, the judges rule Half True.

Voter fraud occurs in Texas, though convictions and guilty pleas are rare
","Texas’ attorney general, Greg Abbott, has his facts wrong on the voting process, U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson said in an opinion column published Aug. 8, 2013, in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. For example, ""Abbott advocates the use of voter ID laws, allegedly to stop voter fraud,"" the Dallas Democrat wrote. ""Studies have shown that voter fraud is non-existent in Texas."" ""Non-existent"" is pretty strong; we don’t have to look any farther than our own reporting to know that statement isn’t entirely accurate. But how prevalent is voter fraud in Texas? Johnson spokesman Cameron Trimble told us by phone and email that the column should have said ""virtually"" non-existent. He sent us web links to research and news stories that described nationwide voter fraud as rare. None of the materials analyzed fraud in Texas specifically, and we found only one mention of a Texas case -- the 2006 conviction of a Pecos woman who filled out and mailed absentee ballots for others. Trimble’s sources mostly referred to voter fraud -- deception committed by individual voters, such as voting more than once, impersonating a voter or voting despite ineligibility -- rather than overall election fraud, which encompasses actions by others, such as election officials or campaign workers, who break election laws in ways that could include intimidating voters, publishing misinformation about polling places or possessing ballots not their own. We dipped into that distinction in an April 2012 fact-check that rated as Half True a claim from Abbott that he had secured 50 convictions for election fraud. Abbott’s basis was his office’s records on 2002-12 prosecutions for alleged election code violations. For this fact-check, we asked Abbott’s office for an updated list. County district attorneys and the Texas secretary of state’s elections division usually refer allegations of election code violations to the attorney general. We also called the secretary’s office and several district attorney offices around the state, but found no specific information about how many violations were reported or prosecuted. Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us records showing that from August 2002 through September 2012, the office received 616 allegations of election-code violations and recorded 78 election-code prosecutions. By our count, 46 of the prosecutions ended with a conviction, guilty plea, no-contest plea or guilty plea as part of deferred adjudication. Of those, 18 cases appeared to involve fraud committed by individual voters: 12 cases with ineligible voters, five cases of voter impersonation and one case of voting more than once. So, by our reading of the attorney general’s records, 18 instances of voter fraud have been confirmed in Texas since 2002.   In 2012, the News21 investigative project headquartered at Arizona State University’s journalism school compiled a database that showed 104 Texas cases of alleged election fraud among 2,068 nationwide since 2000. The News21 students, who published their results online Aug. 12, 2012, gathered allegations through public information requests, news accounts and court records. According to the project’s website, they included all cases ""that had reached some level of official action: That is, someone was charged, an investigation was opened, a specific accusation was made against a named person."" News21 determined that 37 of the 104 Texas allegations were made against voters. Most of the cases were still pending at the time the students published their project in 2012, but 15 had resulted in a guilty plea or conviction, according to the database. Our ruling Johnson said, ""Studies have shown that voter fraud is non-existent in Texas."" She did not provide, nor did we find, studies showing such fraud to be non-existent. To the contrary, Abbott’s records show 18 convictions, no-contest pleas or guilty pleas on voter fraud charges from 2002 through 2012. That’s not a lot of fraud, by any means, but it still evidently occurred. Johnson might have meant to say ""virtually non-existent,"" but the Truth-O-Meter holds individuals accountable for what they actually say. We rate this statement as False.

"['Alcohol', 'Oregon', 'Education', 'University of Oregon']","
Have Friday classes been shown 'very effective' in deterring Thursday night drinking?
","Drinking seems to be a perennial issue for college campuses. With school starting up again, and alcohol-related tragedies in the news, Oregon Public Broadcasting’s ""Think Out Loud"" decided it was time to see how campuses were dealing with student drinking. In discussing the issue, one of the guests, Jennifer Summers, the director of Substance Abuse Prevention and Student Success at the University of Oregon, said increasing the number of Friday classes is one tactic that has helped reduce student drinking. Specifically she said, ""Things like … having Friday classes have been shown to be very effective on college campuses."" We understood the logic: We don’t get too loose unless we know we can bury our heads in bed the next morning. But was this really a tactic universities were using successfully? The nice people running the ""Think Out Loud"" Twitter feed pointed us to a study out of the University of Missouri. Its three authors surveyed 3,341 first-time undergraduates and found that there was a distinct relationship between the amount that students drank on a given Thursday evening and whether they had an early morning Friday class. Here’s the juiciest part: ""Excessive drinking on Thursday, relative to other weekdays, was found and was moderated by Friday class schedule,"" the report said. ""(M)odels indicated that students with no Friday classes drank approximately twice as much on Thursdays as students with early Friday classes."" On average, a student with an early Friday class drank 1.24 drinks, while students without a Friday class drank 2.4 drinks. Obviously this brings up a few questions. Turns out that great minds really do think alike because the study’s authors answered most of them.   First, we were curious whether there was some other factor that might determine if a student chose to take a Friday class -- and if that same factor might be the reason he or she would drink less. Here’s how the study’s authors put it: ""Students who have early Friday classes may be representative of a different type of student than those who do not in terms of their general level of academic aptitude, academic major, academic persistence, or other student characteristics."" They checked into it, though, and found that there was no pattern and that the ""observed Friday class effect was more likely attributable to the actual timing of the class and that it was less likely attributable"" to other factors. Second, we thought students might be increasing their drinking on another night. If you can’t drink Thursday, you might be extra excited to hit the bottle the next night. But the authors found that if catch-up drinking were present -- and they didn’t find much evidence it was -- it was fairly limited. We chatted with one of the authors of the study, University of Missouri psychology professor Phillip K. Wood, to clear up a few other bits and pieces. One important factor is that there appears to be a diminishing return based on the time Friday class is held. The effect ""is largest for the 8 o'clock classes,"" Wood said. ""You can go out and drink and still drag yourself to class by 10."" His biggest caveat, however, was that while he was confident in the findings, a controlled experiment would be the only way to know with absolute certainty whether Friday classes were effective in reducing alcohol consumption. ""At the end of the day what you really need to do is a controlled experiment,"" he said. The study was convincing, but we couldn’t help but wonder whether any universities had made changes based on this study’s findings. Digging deeper, PolitiFact Oregon found that the University of Iowa did. In 2007, following the findings of the study we’ve been discussing, folks at Iowa decided to increase the number of early Friday morning classes. To encourage professors and departments to teach the classes, the university offered $20 for each student in a class that was changed to include lectures or discussions on Friday. The student newspaper, The Daily Iowan, reported in March 2010 that the university's emergency-room doctor Michael Takacs found fewer students were showing up at the emergency room during Thursday evenings and early Friday mornings. Takacs guessed the Friday classes had something to do with the drop, but added ""it’s hard to know for sure."" We spoke with Tom Rocklin, the University of Iowa’s vice president for student life, to see if the university had documented any discernable declines in drinking. He said it’s not clear whether the Friday class increase itself ""was successful because we did a number of other things at the same time which combined have led to reduced drinking among our students."" Given the strong study but muddled practical applications, we thought it was time to call Summers, the substance abuse specialist from the University of Oregon. She noted that the Friday class solution was included in a list of recommendations by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Specifically, it’s included in a category of suggestions by the group that it says have ""evidence of logical and theoretical promise, but require more comprehensive evaluation"" or that ""appear to be capable of reducing high-risk alcohol use."" The University of Oregon itself hasn’t gone this direction yet, Summers said, but it’s something that’s come up as a possibility. ""It's not something that you can just say, ‘Poof, let's go for it,’"" she said. ""Faculty play an active part in changing that."" So let’s get back to our statement. Summers said that ""things like …. having Friday classes have been shown to be very effective on college campuses."" It’s true that one study showed there was a strong connection between Friday morning classes and how much students drank on Thursday. That said, the study was not controlled, it concerned only one campus and the effect was seen only with particularly early classes. Moreover, we weren’t able to find a clear application that showed significant reductions when more early Friday classes were offered. Most important, Summers acknowledges that the list she used as a source cited only ""theoretical and logical promise."" We think she overstepped here. Saying that Friday classes have been ""shown to be very effective"" is an exaggeration. We rate this statement Half True -- the statement is partially accurate but leaves out a number of details.",/factchecks/2013/sep/13/university-oregon/have-friday-classes-been-shown-extremely-effective/

Defending Obama on Syria, Wasserman Schultz says Bush invaded Iraq ""alone""
","As the United States debates using force in Syria following its alleged use of chemical weapons on Aug. 21, 2013, many members of Congress have criticized President Barack Obama’s threat to dictator Bashar Assad as a bad diplomatic move. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., defended him when she spoke with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, comparing Obama’s international credibility favorably in comparison with that of his predecessor, George W. Bush. ""You know, President George W. Bush had significantly degraded our international influence around the world,"" she said. ""We stood alone in the war in Iraq. We were roundly criticized and rightfully so. And today, we have 35 nations that signed the statement in support of the U.S.'s commitment to strike. ... So President Obama's leadership has rebuilt our credibility around the world with leaders that was decimated in the previous administration."" Blitzer pushed back against her argument, noting that the British Parliament, ""our closest ally wouldn't even support potential U.S. military strikes in Syria."" Wasserman is right that some countries, such as France, have backed a potential strike this time around. But Britain and others are opposed. Here, we’ll focus on fact-checking her statement about Iraq, in which she claimed that the United States didn’t have the support of other nations. A reader emailed us, asking if Wasserman Schultz was right. Her office did not return requests for comment. We should start by noting that Bush received a lot of criticism for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 because he didn’t have backing from the United Nations. But the United States didn’t go in alone. In fact, Bush claimed the support of 35 countries for the action in his March 2003 address to the nation declaring war. ""More than 35 countries are giving crucial support, from the use of naval and air bases, to help with intelligence and logistics, to the deployment of combat units. Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense,"" he said. Later that month, the White House released a list of 49 nations that had ""already begun military operations to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, and enforce 17 (United Nations Security Council) resolutions."" We should also point out that support from British Prime Minister Tony Blair was particularly strong. ""Tell our allies that at the very moment of action, at the very moment when they need our determination that Britain faltered? I will not be party to such a course. This is not the time to falter,"" Blair said at the end of a long, passionate speech before the House of Commons in favor of invading. Great Britain had troops stationed in Iraq until 2009, while the United States pulled out in 2011. Our ruling When Blitzer asked about Obama's decision to strike Syria, Wasserman Schultz defended the president and argued that he has support, unlike when the United States ""stood alone"" against Iraq. Although Democrats often criticize Bush for invading Iraq without more global backing, including that of the United Nations, Bush did put together a coalition. Nearly 50 countries, most notably Britain, ultimately supported the invasion, with many sending troops of their own. That's roughly on par with the support network that Obama has put together for action against Syria, and possibly exceeds it. We rate her claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2013/sep/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-bush-invaded-iraq-alone-syria/

Secretary of State John Kerry says as a senator he ‘opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq’
","Secretary of State John Kerry’s recent comment on MSNBC that in 2003 he ""opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq"" has summoned old battles from his 2004 presidential campaign. Even then, political opponents accused him of trying to have it both ways on the war — voting in October 2002 to give President George W. Bush authorization to use force, then criticizing the March 2003 invasion from its beginning as a ""failure of diplomacy."" MSNBC host Chris Hayes suggested in a Sept. 5 interview that the United States might be committing itself to escalating involvement in Syria if it decided to strike and then Bashar Assad used chemical weapons again. Kerry responded, ""I disagree. And, first of all, let me make this clear. The president — and this is very important, because I think a lot of Americans, all of your listeners, a lot of people in the country are sitting there and saying oh, my gosh, this is going to be Iraq, this is going to be Afghanistan. Here we go again. ""I know this. I’ve heard it. And the answer is no, profoundly no. You know, Sen. Chuck Hagel, when he was senator, Sen. Chuck Hagel, now secretary of defense, and when I was a senator, we opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq, but we know full well how that evidence was used to persuade all of us that authority ought to be given."" Both Kerry and Hagel voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq. So what was Kerry talking about when he said he ""opposed the president’s decision""? We’ll start on Oct. 9, 2002, the day Kerry spoke on the Senate floor in support of authorizing Bush to use force in Iraq. He urged the president to work through the United Nations Security Council and said that if Bush walked away from that effort, he would ""vigorously oppose the president doing so."" He explained his expectation that the president would consider war ""the last option to address this threat, not the first,"" saying: ""In giving the president this authority, I expect him to fulfill the commitments he has made to the American people in recent days — to work with the United Nations Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough and immediate inspection requirements, and to act with our allies at our side if we have to disarm Saddam Hussein by force. If he fails to do so, I will be among the first to speak out."" In March 2003, with an invasion imminent, Kerry accused the president of failing to work effectively with American allies, as he had urged in October. The Boston Globe reported March 19 that Kerry blamed ""a failure of diplomacy of a massive order"" by the Bush administration. ""It's the way they have conducted the diplomacy that has compounded this problem, split the U.N., split the NATO, left the world wondering with questions, engaged in a more pre-emptive effort than was necessary,"" Kerry said. ""We could have moved from a position of strength, in my judgment, and I think it represents a failure of diplomacy of a massive order, and that is what war is: War is the failure of diplomacy."" The Boston Herald quoted him the same day saying, ""President Bush has clumsily and arrogantly squandered the post-9-11 support and goodwill of the entire civilized world in a manner that will make the jobs ahead of us — both the military defeat (of Saddam) and the rebuilding of Iraq — decidedly more expensive in every sense of the word."" Another Herald story March 19 noted the senator said ""he won't back off his criticism of Bush's handling of the war, despite the fact that troops probably will be in battle this week."" Strategists for Democratic presidential rival Howard Dean accused Kerry of ""trying to duck responsibility for his war authorization vote,"" the Herald reported. Kerry defended himself a few days later, saying after a speech that his position on Iraq ""has never varied,"" the Herald reported March 24. The Kerry-Dean sniping continued. On March 29, a Herald headline blared, ""Dean blasts Dem rival Kerry for 'wobbly' war stance."" ""To this day I don't know what John Kerry's position is,"" Dean said in Iowa, the Herald reported. ""If you agree with the war, then say so. If you don't agree with the war, then say so. But don't try to wobble around in between."" ABC News host George Stephanopoulos highlighted the dispute with his very first question at the Democratic presidential debate on May 3, 2003: ""Sen. Kerry, the first question goes to you. On March 19, President Bush ordered Gen.Tommy Franks to execute the invasion of Iraq. Was that the right decision at the right time?"" Kerry said, ""George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein. And when the president made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him."" In March 2004, the Washington Post noted that ""Kerry ended up voting for the 2002 resolution, but warned he would not support the war if Bush failed to win the support of the international community in the absence of an imminent threat. The argument has allowed Kerry to suggest he favored the war at the time of the vote — but also later become a critic of Bush's handling of the conflict."" In August 2004, the Post published a story headlined, ""In Hindsight, Kerry Says He'd Still Vote for War,"" which quoted him saying, ""I would have voted for the authority. I believe it was the right authority for a president to have."" Our ruling Kerry said recently that he ""opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq."" In 2002, he voted to give the president the authority to attack, with a stern warning that Bush ought to exhaust diplomatic channels first. In 2003, as the president invaded, Kerry accused him of a ""failure of diplomacy."" As a Democratic presidential primary unfolded in which the war was unpopular, Kerry kept up his criticism of Bush’s handling of the war. But he still said at a 2003 debate that he thought it was ""the right decision"" to disarm Hussein and that ""when the president made that decision, I supported him."" In 2004, he said he would vote to authorize force all over again. It’s clear Kerry opposed the president’s handling of the war, and perhaps the president’s decision to ""go into Iraq"" militarily at the time he did. He suggested diplomatic opportunities were squandered. But he did vote to authorize force, and he said later he supported the president’s decision to disarm Hussein. It was a nuanced position — one too nuanced to be summarized accurately by a claim as blunt as having ""opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq."" These are critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate Kerry’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/13/john-kerry/secretary-state-john-kerry-says-senator-he-opposed/
"['Georgia', 'Foreign Policy', 'Johnny Isakson']","
Did senator change course on Syria position?
","Did U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson support a military strike against Syria and then reverse course this week? Isakson, a Republican from Cobb County, issued a written statement Aug. 31 in which he stated, ""I support the use of military action in Syria."" But just over a week later, on Monday, Isakson issued this written statement: ""I have decided that I will vote against the resolution to authorize a U.S. military strike in Syria."" Did Isakson flip-flop his position in the rapidly evolving Syrian crisis? Or is something more politically nuanced going on here? PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig a little deeper. We invite you to visit our Facebook page and tell us what you think about our digging and whether you agree with our analysis. Isakson’s most recent statement was debated in the conservative blogosphere, with some saying he had completely changed his stance. We contacted Isakson’s office about his statements on Syria. His spokeswoman, Lauren Culbertson, said the senator had previously been undecided about his support for President Barack Obama’s resolution to use force against Syria. Culbertson said Isakson’s statement supporting military action came before the president unveiled his resolution. ""Senator Isakson could not support a mission that was so ill-defined,"" Culbertson told us. Indeed, for days afterward, Isakson seemed hesitant to support the resolution. The senator’s full statement on Monday, said: ""After carefully weighing this very important issue, I have decided that I will vote against the resolution to authorize a U.S. military strike in Syria. Over the past week, I have traveled my state and have talked personally to hundreds of Georgians. Thousands more constituents have contacted my office by phone and email. It is clear to me that Georgians overwhelmingly oppose our country getting involved militarily in Syria. The administration’s lack of a clear strategy is troubling, and the potential fallout following a military strike is also troubling."" Here’s what Isakson said Aug. 31. ""It is appropriate for the president to seek authorization from Congress, although I wish he would have called us back to vote on this immediately rather than waiting until Sept. 9. I support the use of military action in Syria. If we fail to take strong action against Syria for this horrendous attack, then we are sending a signal to Syria as well as to Iran and North Korea that they are accountable to no one."" The senator’s initial statement came the same day Obama announced he would seek congressional approval for military action against Syria. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the following day that Isakson and Georgia’s other U.S. senator, Saxby Chambliss, backed military intervention in Syria. Chambliss is undecided on whether he will vote for the congressional resolution. (At press time, Chambliss was the lone member of Georgia’s congressional delegation supporting some sort of intervention. U.S. Reps. John Barrow and Sanford Bishop had not clarified their positions.) Between those two statements, the AJC reported that Isakson wanted a clear strategy from the Obama administration. ""There's no question the Syrians crossed the red line the president drew, "" Isakson told the AJC in a Sept. 3 phone interview. ""And I think when you draw lines, when you don't enforce those lines you become a paper tiger. But I'm not going to blindly give this president a blank check given the commitment he's shown in the past two weeks and what appears to be a lack of a strategy. I want to be part of the debate."" During an interview Tuesday with Channel 2 Action News, Isakson reinforced his reluctance to vote for a resolution authorizing military action. When asked whether he stood by comments from Aug. 31 that he supported the use of military action in Syria, Isakson said: ""I support that if it was actionable and meaningful and if it sent the right signal to North Korea and Iran. … If in the total context, yes. This one, in my opinion, did not do that."" ""Is this a change of heart?"" Isakson was asked. ""No,"" he answered. ""Is this a change of mind?"" the interviewer asked. ""No,"" Isakson replied. Some bloggers had a different interpretation. Jason Pye, a prominent Georgia libertarian, believes the senator has changed course. ""In his press statement on August 31, Isakson said in no uncertain terms that he supported the use of military action in Syria, making the case that failure to respond would send a signal to the United States' enemies that they are accountable to no one,"" said Pye, who opposes the strikes. ""The lack of strategy from the Obama administration may now be a concern for the senator, but he didn't initially seem to have a problem with that."" ""If this isn’t a flip-flop, I don’t know what is,"" Pye said. Political science professor Kerwin Swint disagreed. ""Under the circumstances, I think it’s hard to blame him for waiting to see how it all plays out,"" said Swint, who teaches at Kennesaw State University in Isakson’s home county.  ""It’s a unique situation especially because so many legislators around the country are revising their positions on this in light of the changing circumstances. It’s just a weird kind of story."" Culbertson directed us to recent AJC articles and other comments the senator has made on the subject, including a CNN interview Monday in which Isakson said ""this is about the plan and the strategy that has been proposed to us."" We wondered whether Isakson still supports military action. Culberston told us via email that Isakson hopes for a diplomatic resolution, but if that fails, ""he will reassess at that time. This is a fast-moving situation that is changing every day."" So where does all of this leave us? Isakson’s position is that he initially supported the use of military action against Syria. But that was before Obama’s resolution outlined his administration’s plan for what that entailed. Isakson had reservations about the proposal, and he decided to oppose the White House resolution seeking congressional authorization for military strikes. Isakson has altered his initial hard-line position on a military strike against Syria, putting additional conditions on any such attack. He initially backed a strike without stating any reservations.

"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist says Florida ""put together a list of over 100,000 people that they thought were ineligible to vote. Came out there were less than 10.”
","Florida’s effort to search for noncitizens on the voter rolls launched a firestorm in the weeks leading up to the 2012 presidential election. Gov. Rick Scott’s initiative was lampooned on The Daily Show; the U.S. Department of Justice cried foul; and two South Florida congressmen held a presser to tout errors on the list, including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet flagged as potentially not being a citizen. But in the end, just how many noncitizen voters did Florida find among almost 12 million voters? Former Gov. Charlie Crist gave his answer in a speech to Louisiana Democrats on Aug. 17, 2013. He started by bashing the state’s recent announcement that it intends to scrutinize the voter rolls for noncitizens yet again. ""Our governor just announced last week he is going to start a purge of voters in Florida,"" Crist said. ""They tried it last year. The secretary of state put together a list of over 100,000 people that they thought were ineligible to vote. Came out there were less than 10. I mean, what a joke. It’s unconscionable what they will do to win these elections."" Crist, a former Republican turned independent turned Democrat, is considering a bid against Scott. If Crist runs in 2014, one way he will try to boost turnout among Democrats and minorities is by hammering Scott’s record on voting rights. So was he correct to say that the effort to get rid of noncitizen voters only led to ""less than 10"" being removed? 2012 efforts to purge voter rolls First, we’ll briefly recap the history of the search for noncitizen voters. Shortly after Scott took office in 2011 he asked his top election official at the time to look into removing noncitizens from the voter rolls. By 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizens based on driver’s license data. The state whittled the list down to about 2,600 names and sent them to county election supervisors in April 2012. Liberal groups criticized the list that they said disproportionately targeted Hispanics and other minorities. Supervisors found all sorts of errors and would later use words such as ""sloppy"" and ""embarrassing"" to describe the state initiative. One of the problems was that the driver’s license data doesn’t get updated when a legal resident later becomes a citizen. By September 2012, the Division of Elections said it had confirmed 207 noncitizens on the voter rolls and that the names would be provided to county elections supervisors to contact the voters. Any that matched federal homeland security data would be removed. Later that month the state produced a new list of 198 potentially ineligible voters. But by then, supervisors were fed up with the timing and process, and the effort appeared to fizzle out. A year later, in August 2013, news broke that the state was about to launch another round of searching for noncitizens on the voter rolls. So what was the total removed? PolitiFact Florida asked the division of elections for the total number of noncitizens removed, including a breakdown by county, during 2012. The best figures we could obtain from the state only included those removed as of Aug. 1, 2012. We counted 85 who were listed as being removed because they were ""not a U.S. citizen."" (A few additional voters on that list were removed for other reasons, such as being dead or moving out of state. One category for removal was ""request by voter,"" though it doesn’t explain why the voters requested it.) As a back-stop, we next checked in directly with some of the county supervisors of elections to see how many noncitizen voters they removed from the rolls. Their answers made it clear it was more than 10. Miami-Dade: 16 voters removed. Collier: 36 removed. Broward: Seven voters removed. Orange: Seven voters removed. Lee: Six voters removed. Hillsborough: Two voters removed. Pasco: Two voters removed. Pinellas: Six voters removed. We asked Crist to explain how he arrived at his figure of ""less than 10."" ""Just from news accounts, may have been around 40 or so actually,"" he responded in an email. ""And somewhat more purged."" He sent us a copy of an August 2013 New York Times article about the state’s renewed effort that stated: ""Ultimately, the list of possible noncitizen voters shrank to 198. Of those, fewer than 40 had voted illegally."" Our ruling Crist said that in 2012, ""the secretary of state put together a list of over 100,000 people that they thought were ineligible to vote. Came out there were less than 10."" If Crist’s point was that only a tiny fraction of noncitizens were found on the voter rolls, that’s certainly true. But he’s wrong that the number was less than 10. The best data we could nail down from the state was that there were about 85 noncitizens removed as of August 1, 2012.

Joe Lieberman says Obama ""had the legal authority"" to strike Syria without congressional approval
","For people who strongly favor U.S. action against Syria, one of the questions they’re asking is why President Barack Obama hasn’t acted already. Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., who supports intervention, faced that question on CNN’s Crossfire. Host S.E. Cupp asked, ""After two years and 100,000 people dead, two chemical attacks, (and) two million refugees, why is pausing yet again to dither on this conflict the smart or moral decision? ""Well, I wish we were not pausing,"" Lieberman said, adding, ""I was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress. He was right. He had the legal authority to do it himself. I wish he had done it."" We wondered whether Lieberman was right. (Lieberman was traveling and did not respond.) United States law The Constitution and the War Powers Resolution set the terms for military engagement. In Article II, Section 2, the Constitution says the president is commander in chief of the armed forces. Then, in Article I, Section 8, it assigns the right to declare war to Congress. The last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II, when Franklin Roosevelt was president. Since then, presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions. In 1973, Congress, frustrated with the Vietnam War, passed the War Powers Resolution, which was enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon. The resolution required that, in the absence of a declaration of war, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and must terminate the use of U.S. armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise. No president has ever conceded that Congress can limit the president’s power as commander in chief. Even as Obama announced that he would seek a congressional resolution, he affirmed that ""I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization."" Presidents have danced around the War Powers Resolution. They will report military engagement to Congress but specifically omit mention of the section of the law, Section 4(a)(1), that triggers the 60-day limit. Only one president, Gerald Ford, has ever referred to that clause in a report to Congress. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush never did. There is debate over the legal weight of the War Powers Resolution and what the Constitution allows. Sen. Rand Paul, R- Ky., who appeared on CNN’s Crossfire on Sept. 9, seemed to invoke both against presidential authority. Paul speculated on what Obama would do if Congress voted against the use of force in Syria. ""The real question is would he even abide by our verdict, would he abide by the congressional verdict,"" Paul said. ""Would he obey the Constitution and say, ‘I've been told I don't have authority; therefore, I can't do it?’"" But in a case involving Clinton and Kosovo, the courts have said members of Congress lack the standing to sue to get a president to comply with the War Powers Resolution. The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal, letting the decision stand. During the Libyan conflict, Walter Dellinger -- former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton -- wrote that by regulating the principle that the president ""may introduce troops into hostilities or potential hostilities without prior authorization by the Congress,"" the War Powers Resolution effectively confirms that the president can act unilaterally. Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said while the Constitution trumps all other laws, ""many legal scholars have concluded that the War Powers Resolution unconstitutionally restricts the president's authority."" Arend said the president has the authority for ""quick, limited uses of force."" Other experts we’ve asked have generally agreed with this line of argument. In short, even under the War Powers Resolution, the president can send in forces without approval from Congress. An unresolved legal issue is what happens if forces are kept in place for a longer period of time, but at this moment, no one is proposing that military option. Lieberman was discussing whether Obama had the legal authority to act without Congress within the framework of U.S. law. We should note that there's a separate question of whether the United States as a country would have legal authority to attack Syria; we addressed that question in a separate story. Here, we're only considering Obama's legal authority within the context of U.S. law.  Our ruling Lieberman said the president has the authority to use force on his own when it comes to limited military strikes. There is ample precedent under many presidents to support that view. The War Powers Resolution creates a process for a president to act first and ask for permission later. Lower courts have ruled in favor of the White House in the use of force, and the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal on that point. Until the court rules otherwise, presidential prerogative is the law of the land. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/12/joe-lieberman/joe-lieberman-says-obama-had-legal-authority-strik/

Van Jones says U.N. has conducted “172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations”
","With the U.S. and Russia locked in discussions over whether, and how, to exert control over Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles, the United Nations’ role in international arms control is of particular interest. During a discussion on CNN’s Crossfire, host Van Jones pointed to the United Nations’ long record of successful actions to keep the peace and protect civilians. When co-host S.E. Cupp asked, ""Do you trust the U.N.?"" Jones responded that the United Nations had overseen ""172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations."" After Cupp expressed skepticism, Jones continued, ""The world is a tough, nasty place, and we focus on the places the U.N. has not been able to change human nature. But we are in a much safer world because of the U.N. than we would be without it."" Is it really true that the United Nations, since its establishment after the end of World War II, has overseen ""172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations""? That would be between two and three new ones per year. When we checked with Jones, he pointed to a 2005 U.N. report. It stated that ""since 1945, the U.N. has assisted in negotiating more than 170 peace settlements that have ended regional conflicts. Examples include ending the Iran-Iraq war, facilitating the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and ending the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. The United Nations has used quiet diplomacy to avert imminent wars."" Because the document is eight years old -- and because ""170 peace settlements"" is not precisely the same thing as ""172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations"" -- we decided to check with the United Nations directly to see if there was an updated number. Counting the peacekeeping missions -- which are typically launched once a peace deal is in place -- is pretty straightforward: The running total since 1948 is 68 peacekeeping missions, of which 15 are ongoing. (The full list is in this U.N. document.) Counting ""negotiations"" is trickier. One obstacle to arriving at a solid number is that negotiations go on all the time, conducted by ""envoys, small offices, or officers"" even before a U.N. mission has been established, said Kieran Dwyer, the public affairs section chief in the U.N. departments of peacekeeping operations and field support. Another obstacle is that there’s overlap between peacekeeping operations and negotiations, so there’s a risk of double counting. ""In cases where there is an existing peacekeeping operation, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Mali, the mission is involved in supporting continuing political processes or negotiations,"" Dwyer said. ""This is a standard part of the mandate of many of the existing missions, supporting the completion of peace processes, often including negotiations of some sort."" Such complications have meant that the United Nations is no longer updating the number it cited in 2005. ""We are not currently keeping a running count of peace agreements reached with U.N. involvement,"" said Jared Kotler, senior officer for strategic communications and public affairs with the United Nations’ political affairs department. Our ruling Jones said the United Nations has conducted ""172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations."" His claim comes from a U.N. document, though one that is eight years old and that referred to a somewhat different metric. U.N. officials say there’s no way of knowing the correct number today, but the 2005 figure, combined with other data that is up to date, suggests that 172 is a reasonable approximation.

Legislator's claim overstates sought reduction in tests for elementary and middle school students
","Great news for students, state Rep. Jason Isaac said in a commentary describing education-related actions by the 2013 Texas Legislature. Mandated high school end-of-course exams were cut from 15 to five, Isaac wrote. We knew that. But the Dripping Springs Republican celebrated more reductions, writing: ""We also eliminated the overtesting of students in grades 3-8 by decreasing the number of tests from 17 to 8."" Isaac added that House Bill 866 eliminated ""some of the STAAR (State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness) testing requirements for students who meet certain performance thresholds."" Isaac then mentioned the approved measure also would give charter schools more testing discretion. ""However,"" he wrote, ""because of federal mandates, the state must seek and be granted a waiver from the federal government in order for these changes to take place."" A former Democratic state Senate candidate, Kathi Thomas, asked us to review the proclaimed 17-to-8 reduction. She said she saw Isaac's article in the Aug. 29, 2013, Dripping Springs News-Dispatch. Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email that House Bill 866, which was signed into law on June 14, 2013, ""would reduce some testing"" if the described waiver won federal approval. Another spokeswoman, DeEtta Culbertson, told us by email that the intended cut in tests--from 17 to 11, not 8--would apply only to students who performed well on such exams. Ratcliffe said a waiver was needed because the change in Texas law conflicted with federal requirements set in place by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, ""which requires us to test students in reading and math every year for grades 3-8, we have had to ask the U.S. Department of Education for a waiver. That waiver is still pending."" Her response came a few days before the TEA announced Sept. 9, 2013, that the federal department had turned thumbs down on granting the waiver. Previously, in a July 19, 2013, press release, the state education agencyhad announced that Michael Williams, the Texas education commissioner, had sought clarification from the U.S. Department of Education per its authority to waive reading and math tests of students in grades 3-8 as required under the federal law. The agency had said then that under HB 866, a federal ""waiver must be secured to reduce or eliminate assessment requirements for certain students at the elementary and middle school grade levels."" ""Should the federal government determine that relevant provisions of federal law may be waived and ultimately grant a waiver request,"" the press release said, ""potential changes would include assessments for math in grades 3, 5 and 8; and reading in grades 3, 5 and 8. Current federal law requires testing for math and reading for all students in grades 3 through 8."" Students who performed well on the tests would be freed ""to focus their time and energy on learning new material and not focusing every year on a test where there is a high likelihood that they would demonstrate success,"" Williams said in a letter to Arne Duncan, the U.S. education secretary. If the federal government were to grant the waiver, according to a May 1, 2013, analysis of the state law by the non-partisan House Research Organization, students in grades 3-8 who met certain performance thresholds would not be required to take some STAAR exams. The analysis said supporters of the measure predicted high-performing students could go from having 17 STAAR exams to facing as few as eight. Not quite, according to TEA’s Culbertson, who told us that if the waiver were granted, students in grades 3-8 would still be required to take 11 tests and students who did not score highly enough would face additional exams. Culbertson listed the 11 STAARs required of all students under the 2013 law as reading and math tests in grades 3, 5 and 8; writing in grades 4 and 7; science in grades 5 and 8; and social studies in grade 8. Culbertson said that students who either fail to score well enough on a test or who attend school in districts choosing to give the exams to every student could be subject to reading and math STAARs in grades 4, 6 and 7. Isaac’s chief of staff, Ellen Troxclair, pointed out by email that while Isaac’s column explicitly said lawmakers had cut required tests in grades 3-8 from 17 to 8, it also mentioned students needing to meet performance thresholds and that the need for a waiver. ""The fact remains that had the waiver been granted, the bill would have significantly reduced the number of tests for many students,"" she wrote. We noticed, finally, that Isaac’s commentary was published in the newspaper with the relevant test-cut sentences taking up two paragraphs, effectively distancing his declaration that mandated tests were cut from 17 to 8 from some of his caveats. Troxclair sent us the text of what she described as his original commentary as submitted and showing all the test-cut information in one paragraph. In contrast, Dale Roberson, publisher of the News-Dispatch, told us by phone that the Isaac commentary arrived at the paper as one giant block of copy. He said he broke the text into readable paragraphs before publication. Our ruling Isaac declared that lawmakers reduced state tests in grades 3-8 from 17 to 8, pending a federal waiver. Under the change in law, though, only well-performing Texas students would have faced fewer tests and even they would still have faced at least 11 exams, not 8. The approved measure left students not fulfilling performance expectations subject to 17 tests. In his commentary, Isaac waved at the need for the waiver and that students scoring well would be affected, but he mentioned these elements only after asserting that the tests were cut--period. Presenting the conditions up front would have made the claim more accurate. We rate this statement, which overstates the reduced number of tests and risks the misimpression that every student would see relief, as Half True. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Party relies on confidential lists to say 500 Republicans a day move to Texas
","Texas Republicans who have long dominated statewide politics enjoy another advantage, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas declared. ""We know there are 500 registered Republicans moving to the state every day,"" Steve Munisteri said on the Aug. 19, 2013, edition of YNN’s ""Capital Tonight"" program. We do? Texas is among at least 20 states whose residents are not asked to register party affiliations when they register to vote, according to registration laws summarized online by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. So identifying new Texans as partisan one way or another seems potentially ticklish. On YNN, Munisteri continued: ""There’s only about 1,000 to 1,300 total people moving to the state"" daily and that includes children and non-registered voters. In January 2010, we rated as Mostly True a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that 1,000 people a day moved here. IRS data tied to changes of address in 2007 and 2008 suggested that more than 1,300 people a day were relocating, on average. Munisteri told YNN: ""So we believe a majority of the people moving to the state of Texas are actually registered Republicans, 94,000 just... from January to June,"" though he later told us that he meant through June. ""So we expect by next fall, that between election cycles, we would have had over 400,000 Republicans that were registered Republicans in other states move to Texas"" and, he said, the party was intent on contacting and registering such newcomers. By email and telephone, Munisteri told us the Republican National Committee, the party’s national governing group, provides the Texas party with a regularly updated list of Republicans or likely Republicans who have moved into Texas counties from other states, though he said the list also folds in residents moving to a county from another Texas county. Broadly, Munisteri said, ""the RNC uses their data points and they have some sort of scoring system, such as whether people have voted in the Republican primary before, how many times, or other data points,"" such as magazine subscriptions or memberships in conservative groups, ""that indicate if the people are Republican, Democrat or Independent."" Munisteri said the RNC-provided list he relied on for his YNN comment encompassed individuals who moved in the first half of 2013. Separately, he said, the party has a list of 59,000 people who moved to Texas from January through July 2013 and who previously voted in a Democratic primary. The contrasting figures, he said, support his conclusion that new-to-Texas Republicans greatly outnumber such Democrats. Munisteri said he didn’t know how the RNC identified the people who had moved and couldn’t give us copies of the relevant lists. The RNC press secretary, Kirsten Kukowski, confirmed by email that the committee works with state parties to identify voters moving into states. Declining to elaborate, she wrote: ""We don’t discuss our methods and tactics with the media."" Watch out: Paragraphs of math ahead. Munisteri’s first equation: Take the 94,000 Republicans or Republican leaners and divide by the 181 days in the six months to get 519 Republicans a day moving to Texas counties. Equation 2: Compare the 94,000 figure for six months to the declared count of 59,000 Democrats moving into Texas over seven months and adjust for the Democratic figure’s additional month, Munisteri said. By his calculation, he said, this comparison supports the judgment that 65 percent of all voter-movers were Republican or Republican-leaning. Multiply the 65 percent by the widely bandied 1,300 people a day moving to Texas, Munisteri said, and take the resulting 845 and divide by two to remove children (who, of course, cannot vote) to estimate that 423 Republicans move to Texas every day, a total Munisteri called ""fairly consistent"" with his other result. Next, we sought perspective from other experts and advocates including Democratic attorney Michael Li of Dallas and the Battleground Texas group, which seeks to escalate Democratic registration and turnout, both of whom sounded skeptical of the 500-a-day figure. Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, and Brian W. Smith, a St. Edward’s University political scientist, each pointed out, that according to the American Community Survey overseen by the U.S. Census Bureau, about 1,400 people a day moved to the state from other states in 2011. That figure doesn’t account for some 1,100 estimated daily departures that year. Potter noted that between 2011 and 2012, Texas had 141,000 net domestic migrants, or about 386 a day, according to the census bureau’s population estimates and IRS data. Meanwhile, the American Community Survey estimated a 2011 net in-flow of 301 residents a day, Potter said. ""The population estimates don’t break it out by flows between states,"" Potter wrote. Still, he noted, both sets of estimates ""put the number of net domestic migrants well below 1,000-1,300."" Moreover, he said, a ""substantial significant proportion"" of the domestic migrants into Texas ""are probably not eligible to vote (i.e. less than 18 or non-citizens) and some of the domestic migrants might"" align with other political parties. Ultimately, Potter said in another email, it’s feasible that 500 Republicans a day move to Texas--or perhaps 500 Democrats, he said. But without factual information on residents’ partisan leans, he said, he wouldn’t embrace any such judgments. Smith, citing 2011 census estimates, agreed that when you subtract individuals leaving Texas from the greater amount of individuals moving into the state, it looks like the net increase totals about 300 people a day. ""No matter how"" Munisteri ""swings it,"" Smith wrote, ""they’re not adding 500 Republicans a day when you include who is leaving"" the state. Then again, Munisteri did not say there was that much of a net increase each day. Setting aside people who leave Texas, Smith said, the Census Bureau’s 2011 estimate was that 1,410 people a day moved to the state. To speculate that 500 of each day’s arrivals were Republicans, he said, one would need to assume that all the new residents were adult citizens eligible to vote--and that 35 percent were Republicans. That’s plausible, Smith said. Nationally, Smith noted, the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press in June 2012 found that 40 percent of Americans leaned Republican, with 48 percent leaning Democratic. This doesn’t take into consideration an age wrinkle, Smith said. If one assumes that about 24 percent of the movers into Texas were younger than 18, which would be in keeping with national estimates, he said, then some 46 percent of the remaining estimated 1,079 daily movers into Texas would need to be Republican or leaning that way for there to be 500 new Republicans a day. That’s less plausible, he said. If 46 percent of Americans were Republicans, Smith speculated, Mitt Romney would have won the presidency. Munisteri, alerted to the analyses of Potter and Smith, said by phone that his 500 figure might be overly high. Still, he said, it’s reasonable to say several hundred Republicans a day have been moving to Texas. Our ruling Munisteri said 500 Republicans a day move to Texas. The chairman laid out equations seemingly supporting this conclusion, though a complete analysis of Republican/Democratic ups and downs would take into account factors including Texas births, deaths and departures. Besides, as Census Bureau estimates indicate, even if one focuses only on individuals moving into the state, it’s a challenge to demonstrate that 500 Republicans move in daily. In the end, too, the party did not divulge its lists of movers to Texas, making it impossible to directly probe the accuracy of Munisteri's aired counts. These weaknesses signify vital missing details. We rate this claim as Half True. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
