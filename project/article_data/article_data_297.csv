Pompeo falsely claims Trump did not say he’d go after Iranian cultural sites
","Secretary of State Mike Pompeo falsely claimed on Fox News that President Donald Trump did not threaten to target Iranian cultural sites. Pompeo’s claim came when host Maria Bartiromo asked about a tweet in which Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Trump was advocating for a war crime. ""President Trump didn't say he'd go after a cultural site,"" Pompeo said. ""Read what he said very closely."" We read what Trump said closely. In a series of tweets, the president issued a warning to Iran, saying the United States has ""targeted 52 Iranian sites"" it could strike if Iran were to attack. Trump’s twitter thread came after the United States killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in an airstrike aimed at an airport in Baghdad, Iraq. ""Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader,"" Trump said.  ....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats! ""Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD,"" he continued.  Iran has 22 cultural sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Some pundits and politicians, such as Ocasio-Cortez, argued that strikes against them could be considered war crimes under international law.  The Geneva Conventions prohibit ""acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples."" And in March 2017, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning ""the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage."" Hours after Pompeo made his claim on Bartiromo’s show, Trump restated his willingness to go after Iran’s cultural sites while speaking to reporters. ""They’re allowed to kill our people,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. ""They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way."" The State Department did not respond to our requests for comment by deadline. Pompeo said, ""President Trump didn't say he'd go after a cultural site."" On Twitter, Trump said the United States has ""targeted 52 Iranian sites,"" including ""some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture,"" that he would consider blasting if Iran were to retaliate for the U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani in Iraq. He later repeated the threat while speaking to reporters.

The soldiers in this photo are traveling on a break from basic training — not deploying to Iran
","As Iran promised ""severe revenge"" after President Donald Trump announced that the United States had killed Iran’s top military commander in a drone strike on Jan. 3, the Pentagon said it would deploy 3,500 additional troops to the Middle East.   Since then, an image of a long line of soldiers at an airport has been shared online by users offering their prayers. But in some cases, the photograph has been mischaracterized.  The image in this Jan. 5 post, for example, includes this text: ""Off they go. Praying for each one and their families."" It features crying emojis and a broken heart emoji and this hashtag: #sadday.

Benning,"" Garrett said, ""where they will continue their training.""  Because the soldiers are lined up under a sign that says ""North Domestic Baggage Claim"" and ""Ground Transportation,"" they appear to be returning from holiday block leave.     Atlanta is the closest large airport, Garrett said, and soldiers depart a few days before Christmas and return through Atlanta a day or two after the New Year to complete their training.  Garrett said he was confident the soldiers were traveling on holiday block leave because drill sergeants can be seen greeting them and marshalling them along the guide ropes.  But that context isn’t always clear in the posts that have appeared on social media. One Facebook account, apparently frustrated with the misinformation, posted the image on Jan. 5 with this note: ""Stop sharing this photo saying soldiers leaving for Iran this is a photo of basic training soldiers returning from holiday leave. There is a drill sergeant directly in the middle.""  The Facebook post we’re checking here gives a different impression, and leads users to believe these soldiers are being deployed overseas.

Tlaib did not tweet about 'raping and pillaging' America after protests at U.S. embassy in Iraq
","A Facebook post attempting to portray U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib as anti-American has resurfaced as tensions between the United States and Iran escalate. The content of the post is fabricated.

How unpopular is Betsy DeVos?
","A congressional hearing about the Trump administration’s policy on student debt turned personal for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Most of the Dec. 12 hearing focused on DeVos’ actions related to a student debt relief rule. Democrats said DeVos made it harder for certain students to get debt relief, while Republicans defended her response to Obama-era rules. At the hearing, the main topic was how DeVos sought to make changes to the borrower defense to repayment rule. The provision was little used until the Obama administration established new rules to help students get their federal education loans cancelled if colleges misrepresented graduation rates, their ability to transfer credits or their job placement rates. The Obama administration finalized changes to the regulations in 2016 after Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain, closed its doors amid fraud allegations. DeVos sought to rewrite the rules, leading to extensive litigation, including a contempt of court finding against DeVos. DeVos blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of tens of thousands of cases and announced changes that include tiers of loan relief.  U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a former school board member and principal from South Florida, went after DeVos, saying she is trying to ""destroy public education.""  ""You are the most unpopular person in our government,"" said Wilson, a Democrat. ""Millions will register to vote in 2020. Many will vote to remove you more than to remove the president."" The ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, said Wilson’s comments were ""over the line."" DeVos’s confirmation in 2017 was a contentious one for the Trump administration and required a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. DeVos, a longtime wealthy Republican donor from Michigan, is an advocate for vouchers and charter schools.  As fact-checkers, we wanted to focus on the checkable aspect of what Wilson said: Is DeVos really the most unpopular person in the U.S. government? Wilson’s statement about ""in our government"" was overly broad, but what she was referring to was what poll respondents said about DeVos compared to other Trump Cabinet officials. We found polling that supports Wilson’s statement about DeVos’s popularity, but the polling is more than one year old. We found that YouGov and Morning Consult have conducted separate polls that compare the favorability of Trump’s Cabinet members. Wilson’s spokeswoman cited a 2017 article in the Huffington Post entitled, ""How Betsy DeVos Became The Most Hated Cabinet Secretary."" The article cited an October 2017 HuffPost/YouGov internet poll that found 35% had a strongly unfavorable view of DeVos, the highest among 13 officials. (Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions finished second.)  However, the poll also showed that many respondents were not familiar enough with the Cabinet members to give a favorability opinion. DeVos was among the most familiar officials, as 30% of respondents said they were unfamiliar with her.  YouGov has polled about DeVos’ favorability five times since she was appointed. The most recent poll, in April 2018, found DeVos had the highest ""very unfavorable"" rating (28%).  Politico/Morning Consult polled about the favorability of DeVos on four occasions since 2017, with the most recent one in the spring of 2018. That poll showed DeVos with a 31% very unfavorable rating, the highest among 15 Cabinet members.  Even though the polls are a little dated, Wilson’s statement is consistent with the evidence, said Washington University political scientist Steven S. Smith. Education Department spokeswoman Angela Morabito told PolitiFact that DeVos isn’t working to win a popularity contest. But she pointed to polling by an education research and policy journal showing growing public support for certain school choice programs. Related: By the numbers: Is college worth the cost? Wilson said DeVos is the ""most unpopular person in our government."" Two polling organizations asking about popularity for about a dozen Trump administration officials back up her statement, though they are a little outdated. We found no polling about the popularity for DeVos in 2019.

Facebook post's attack on Hillary Clinton over Benghazi and praise for Trump on Iraq mostly misses
","A Facebook post blasts Hillary Clinton and praises President Donald Trump in contrasting how Clinton responded to an attack on Americans in Libya in 2012 with how Trump responded to the storming of the U.S. embassy in Iraq. The claim, posted Jan. 1, the day after the Iraqi embassy was stormed, says: ""Hillary ignored multiple requests for security, didn’t respond for 13 hours, & let 4 Americans die in Benghazi. Trump rushed in reinforcements, threatened to destroy Iran, & made sure no lives were lost in Baghdad. That’s the difference between a traitor & a leader."" The post is wrong in its assertions about Clinton, who was secretary of state during the attack in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. The only element of truth in this comparison is that Trump did rush in military reinforcements. The Benghazi attacks killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.  It’s true that the State Department did not honor requests for more security prior to the attacks, but there was no evidence that Clinton was made aware of those requests.  As for Clinton’s response, none of the many congressional investigations about the attacks asserted (as Trump did) that she was inattentive throughout the hours in which the attacks occurred. Moreover, it was not Clinton’s responsibility to send troops to the scene — the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred.  Several investigations found that no action by Clinton, or anybody in the administration, could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths. The terrorist attacks were much more violent than the storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. As Time magazine reported, protesters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound shouting ""Death to America!"" and ""Death to Israel!"" and smashed through a main door, set a reception area on fire, and covered the embassy wall with militia flags and anti-U.S. graffiti.  The same day, Dec. 31, U.S. marines deployed to Iraq. The next day, Trump deployed more troops to the Middle East.  Trump blamed Iran for the attack and issued a threat. ""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,"" Trump tweeted on Dec. 31: ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy new year!"" A Facebook post attacked Clinton, claiming: ""Hillary ignored multiple requests for security, didn’t respond for 13 hours, & let 4 Americans die in Benghazi. Trump rushed in reinforcements, threatened to destroy Iran, & made sure no lives were lost in Baghdad."" There was no evidence that Clinton ignored requests for more security before the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in attacks in Benghazi in 2012. It was the military’s responsibility, not Clinton’s, to respond; and several investigations concluded that no one in the administration could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths. Meanwhile, in a much different situation, Trump did rush military reinforcements after the storming of the U.S. embassy in Iraq. He threatened to hold Iran responsible, but did not threaten its destruction.

The University of Sydney estimated Jan. 3 that 480 million animals have been killed in the New South Wales bushfires since September 2019. The tiger image, however, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the photo is several years old, was not taken in Australia and does not show animals killed in a fire.  The image is from 2012 and depicts a bonfire of confiscated taxidermy animals in Jakarta, Indonesia. (Several commenters on the multi-photo post also said that some of the other images are from other fires, as well). Trading in or being in possession of protected animals or their body parts is a criminal offense in Indonesia, and animal traffickers can face up to five years in jail and fines up to $10,000 USD. Jakarta officials seized 258 animal remains in the 2012 raid, according to an article by the Daily Mail, which included 15 tigers, 2 sun bears and 48 deer, before destroying them. The animals had all been killed by poachers before being stuffed and sold to be displayed in peoples homes.

Michelle Obama is listed as voluntarily inactive and was last registered in 1993. The website shows neither of the Obamas has any public record of discipline or pending proceedings. Steve Splitt, a spokesman for the commission, confirmed to PolitiFact that there is no record ""of any sort of disciplinary proceedings"" involving the Obamas.  It’s possible that the rumor spread because of the way Michelle Obama had to change her registration status. Prior to 1999, active lawyers were required to petition the court if they wanted to change their status, pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court rule 770. The online registration record previously listed Michelle Obama as being ""on court ordered inactive status."" ""It used to be that if an attorney wanted to move from active to inactive they would need to file a motion with the court,"" Splitt said. ""Now, if they’re thinking about moving to inactive or retired status, they will often do it at the beginning of the year during registration to pay a reduced fee, but it can also be done during the year."" Splitt told us Michelle Obama filed a motion to transfer to inactive status in 1994. Barack Obama elected to have his license placed on inactive status after he announced his candidacy for president in 2007 and changed it to retired after becoming president in early 2009.  Meanwhile, the Illinois State Bar Association continues to list the Obamas as honorary members of the organization.  There is no evidence that supports the claim that the Obamas were subjects of any disciplinary proceedings and were forced to give up their law licenses. Both changed their registration status voluntarily and remain in good standing with the Illinois Bar Association.

A deceptively edited video of Joe Biden falsely suggests he made racist comment
","An out-of-context clip of Joe Biden speaking in New Hampshire is deceptively edited in a way that suggests he made a racist comment. ""The culture, our culture, our culture is not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation, it is our English jurisprudential culture — our European culture,"" Biden said in the video, which was first published on Twitter on Jan. 1. When heard in isolation, the video makes it sound like Biden is making a racist statement promoting America’s European roots and dismissing minorities. But when we listened to his full statement, that wasn’t the point of the quote at all. The clip was posted by the Twitter user @mooncult and has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. The edited clip was one in a thread of similar videos posted by @mooncult, who has more than 12,000 followers and frequently posts anti-Biden content.  The 17-second clip comes from a 13-minute answer Biden gave to a woman who asked about his work on domestic assault and sexual violence. (Her question at the Dec. 30 campaign event starts around minute 39.) Biden’s lengthy answer started with him explaining lessons from his father who told him that ""the cardinal sin is a man raising his hand to a woman or a child.""  Biden then pivoted to talk about the phrase ""rule of thumb,"" which he said stemmed from a court ruling in England in the late 1300s that no man could beat a woman with a rod bigger than the circumference of his thumb. (There’s ample reason to doubt that the ruling is the origin of the phrase.) Biden recounted his work while in the U.S. Senate holding hearings about violence against women. As a U.S. senator from Delaware, Biden championed the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The measure increased funding and provided more legal tools for combating violent crimes against women. In his comments in New Hampshire, Biden said as vice president he also worked to try to persuade university presidents to take action to combat sexual violence.  About 11 minutes into his answer, Biden then said: ""Folks this is about changing the culture, our culture, our culture. It’s not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation. It’s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture that says it’s alright."" Listened to in context, it appears that Biden was saying that the roots of violence against women are rooted in European culture and that the United States must change the culture of violence against women. The edited video on Twitter omits Biden saying ""this is about changing…"" and just cuts right to  ""The culture, our culture, our culture is not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation, it is our English jurisprudential culture — our European culture."" In March, Biden made a similar statement when speaking about his role in the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas and his treatment of Anita Hill. Speaking about a culture that allows violence against women, he said: ""It’s an English jurisprudential culture, a white man’s culture. It’s got to change."" @mooncult’s bio says it is ""an exclusive 'weird twitter' posting collective operated by an anonymous rotating cast of your favorite online personalities & podcast hosts."" Weird Twitter is characterized by loose groups of users who experiment with spelling, punctuation and post format to create elaborate jokes or art. The Biden video is the latest example of how selective editing can cause misinformation on social media.  RELATED FACT-CHECK: Viral video of Nancy Pelosi slowed down her speech RELATED FACT-CHECK: Trump retweets false claim that Ilhan Omar partied on 9/11 anniversary A video posted on Twitter purports to show Joe Biden making a racist comment about America’s European roots. The clip selectively shortened something Biden said at a campaign event in New Hampshire. He was responding to a woman’s question about what he’s done to address domestic assault and sexual violence. In that response, Biden said, ""this is about changing the culture, our culture."" The tweeted clip does not include that context. More importantly, the video clip watched in isolation makes it falsely appear that Biden was making a racist comment dismissing minorities.

Child care costs can take a big bite of the family budget
","When it comes to family budgets, one of the biggest bites can be child-care costs. Just how big is that bite? ""Child care costs account for 24% of a WI family’s budget.This is well above the 10% affordability threshold established by the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human services. Paid Family Leave would allow parents the flexibility necessary 2 ensure they are able 2 put their family first,"" state Rep. David Crowley, D-Milwaukee, said Oct. 22, 2019 in a Twitter post. Crowley’s tweet came on the same day Assembly Democrats reintroduced the Wisconsin Family Medical Leave Insurance Act. Under the bill, Wisconsin workers without employer-funded family medical leave would be able to buy into a state-run insurance program. The proposal would expand the state’s current family medical leave law to allow individuals to take leave for more family members, including care of grandparents and siblings. According to a Legislative Reference Bureau analysis, a covered individual who is on family or medical leave would be eligible, beginning on Jan. 1, 2024, to receive up to 12 weeks of family or medical leave insurance benefits. This is the third time the measure has been introduced; it has not gained support from Republican lawmakers. Is Crowley, who has announced his candidacy for Milwaukee County executive, on target about the cost of child care for Wisconsin families? Let’s take a look. The evidence When asked for backup, Crowley’s staff pointed us to a 2018 United Way report. The report focused on a population group that has been given the acronym ALICE -- Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed. The ALICE Report was part of a collaboration between the United Way in Wisconsin and 16 other states. Indeed, the report itself includes a line that is nearly identical to Crowley’s tweet: ""In the Household Survival Budget, child care accounts for 24 percent of the Wisconsin family budget, well above the 10 percent affordability threshold established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."" But where did the numbers come from? Officials with the state Department of Children and Families told us they do not collect that data. They pointed us to a series of advocacy groups, as opposed to any government agency or repository. According to the United Way, the report’s child care budget is based on the average annual cost of care for one infant and one preschooler in registered family child care homes -- the least expensive childcare option. The most recent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports, dating from 2016 onward, recommend that child care be considered affordable if out-of-pocket costs are equivalent to 7% of total household income. In earlier years, dating back to at least 2015, the federal benchmark for child care affordability was reported as 10%, the figure referenced in the second part of Crowley’s tweet. Additional groups Other advocacy groups have done their own tallies -- though each measures a slightly different thing: Economic Policy Institute: A July 2019 report from the institute puts the average cost of infant child care in Wisconsin at $12,597 a year. The report states that care for one infant would take up 18.5% of a median family’s income in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is ranked 20th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for most expensive infant care. The group’s source list includes the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Child Care Aware: According to a 2017 report, the average cost of center-based infant care across all states tops 27% of the median income for single parents, an increase of 3 percentage points from findings in the group’s 2016 report, ""Parents and the High Cost of Care."" The group says it obtains data through surveys of state child-care referral agencies. For states that did not respond to the survey, child care capacity and price data was pulled from publicly accessible databases and market rate surveys. Center for American Progress: On average, a family making the state median income in the United States would have to spend 18% of its income to cover the cost of child care for an infant, according to a November 2018 report. The 18% number is based on the state median income for a family of four, which comes from 2018 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data. ""It’s also important to flag that the 18% number is the cost of child care for an infant in a center-based program. If you are focused on home-based child care as implied by one part of the statement we would note that the number for home-based family care is 11%,"" Steven Jessen-Howard, a Center for American Progress spokesman, said in an email. ""The high cost of child care is out of reach for most working families,"" said Simon Workman, co-author of the American Progress report in a statement. In short, each of the studies support Crowley’s central point that child care costs consume a far greater share of an average Wisconsin family’s budget than is recommended -- though the estimates vary, from 11% to 27%. Our ruling Crowley said ""child care costs account for 24% of a WI family’s budget."" Child care costs can vary, of course, based on age of the child, number of children receiving care and where the care is provided. But each of the available reports supports Crowley’s main point -- that the costs far exceed the recommended amount -- even if the numbers come up somewhat different in each analysis. At PolitiFact Wisconsin, a statement is Mostly True when ""it is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here. This fact-check has been updated to change an emailed quote mistakenly attributed to Julia Cusick of the Center for American Progress to Steven Jessen-Howard from the same organization.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280971AC780>],/factchecks/2020/jan/03/david-crowley/child-care-costs-can-take-big-bite-family-budget/

Obama: US spends more on military than next 8 nations combined
","President Barack Obama defended American might in the face of attacks from critics who say the United States has become a weak player on the national stage. ""I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker,"" Obama said in his last annual State of the Union address Jan. 12, 2016. ""Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. Period. It’s not even close. It’s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined."" We wondered if that last statement on military spending was accurate, so we decided to check it out. We found Obama’s claim is in the ballpark. One set of international military spending figures comes from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a think tank. The institute maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for more than 170 countries. By their calculation, the United States spends more than the next seven countries combined. In 2014, the most recent year available, the United States led the world in military spending at $610 billion, marking 34 percent of the world total, SIPRI found. U.S. expenditures were nearly three times higher than China, the second-highest nation with an estimated $216 billion in military spending. Russia was in third place at $84.5 billion. But counting together military spending from the eight countries after the United States comes out to $646.4 billion, surpassing the United States’ $610. Omitting No. 9 on the list, Japan, the calculation comes out to about $601 billion. This graph, put together by the fiscal policy-focused Peter G. Peterson Foundation, shows the United States’ spending in stark contrast to the next seven highest spenders:  Another data set matches Obama’s claim exactly. The United States does spend more than eight countries combined according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think tank that also tracks military spending. The United States spent $581 billion on the military in 2014, according to IISS, while the eight next-highest spenders combined spent about $531.9 billion. Calculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging, in part because there is no common definition of what constitutes military spending. Further, a country’s expenditures does not necessarily correlate perfectly with its military capabilities. While Obama has a point that U.S. defense spending is significantly larger than that of every other nation, spending has gone down under his presidency. Overall spending on national security includes the Pentagon budget, as well as spending by other agencies, like the Energy Department’s work on nuclear weapons. Spending increased in 2010 and 2011, but it has fallen every year for four years since then by a cumulative 15 percent. National security spending made up 20.1 percent of the federal budget in 2010, but in 2015 it was 15.9 percent. There are two main reasons for the spending drop. The first is the Obama administration’s decision to start removing U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. The second has to do with sequestration, the automatic, across-the-board cuts originally designed to force bipartisan negotiations in Congress. Our ruling Obama said, ""We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined."" Obama’s statement is accurate by one measure, while another measure says the United States spends more than the next seven countries combined. So depending on the data set you use, he’s either right or close. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974FC800>],/factchecks/2016/jan/13/barack-obama/obama-us-spends-more-military-next-8-nations-combi/

High school graduation rates are at 'new highs,' says Obama in State of the Union
","During his 2016 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama cited education as an area of bipartisan agreement. ""We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job,"" he said. ""The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, (and) boosted graduates in fields like engineering."" We wanted to see if high school graduation rates have never been higher. At first glance, he appears to be correct. In December, the U.S. Education Department reported that the rate had reached 82.3 percent, and the department billed it as a ""new record high."" But there's an important caveat. As the department acknowledged, the 82.3 percent rate was ""the highest level since states adopted a new uniform way of calculating graduation rates five years ago."" It's a key distinction because high school graduation rates can be a slippery topic and difficult to track. Different states and different school districts have used different measures over the years. For example, some states included private school students who received public funding. That's why a uniform system was adopted. The last time the rates were close to being this high was for the class that graduated in 1970, when the Education Department pegged the rate at 78.7 percent. Yet because the current method for calculating rates is only 5 years old, it's not clear that the 1970 rate, or even the subsequent ones, are comparable to current rates. Since the mid 1970s until around 2008, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, the annual rates consistently stayed at 75 percent or below. With the new system, begun with the 2010-11 school year, rates were calculated to be 79 percent once again and have since been rising, albeit slowly. It was 80 percent for 2011-12, 81.4 percent for 2012-13, and 82.3 percent for 2013-14, the most recent rate available. Even when we checked this statistic two years ago, there was a consensus in the education community that graduation rates were rising. But uncertainty persists about those old rates. If Obama had restricted his time frame to the past four years, the numbers would be on firmer ground. But he didn't. He gave the impression that these were the highest rates ever. Because Obama's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B6F8C0>],/factchecks/2016/jan/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-high-school-graduation-rates-are/

Economy is 'too weak to raise income levels,' says Nikki Haley in State of the Union response
","In her Republican response to the State of the Union address, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley expressed criticism of President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy. ""The president's record has often fallen far short of his soaring words,"" Haley said. ""As he enters his final year in office, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels."" We decided to check whether, six years into the economic recovery, income levels are still in the doldrums. Haley is basically correct if you look at Census Bureau data for median household income, adjusted for inflation. Here’s the trend line in recent years. Inflation-adjusted, median household income has fallen from $57,357 in 2009 to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent full year available.  That’s a decline of 6.4 percent over a five-year period once inflation is taken into account. Obama himself seemed to acknowledge this trend when he spoke about ""more and more wealth and income"" concentrated at the top and ""squeezed workers."" The only silver lining for Obama is that median income has increased a bit since the first full year of the recovery -- 2010 -- and saw a tangible bump between 2012 and 2013. Still, at best, median income is moving sideways, a result strongly at odds with the much better record of job creation and unemployment reduction under Obama. There are alternative ways to measure income, such as earnings from work, but these show growth that’s tepid at best. For instance, median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers rose from $776 in 2013 to $791 in 2014, which is less than a 2 percent increase, or roughly in line with inflation. Our ruling Haley said the economy is ""too weak to raise income levels."" While the economy under Obama has made significant strides in such areas as job creation, income has not been an area of significant improvement. Median income is lower now compared to 2009. It is, however, slightly up from its low point in 2012. Haley’s claim is generally accurate but somewhat depends on your time frame and what you would consider a rise in income levels.

Business has created jobs every month since Obamacare became law, Obama said in State of the Union
","President Barack Obama touted the success of Obamacare during his final State of the Union address. He said the Affordable Care Act has led to nearly 18 million more people gaining health insurance and has helped to slow health care cost inflation. He added that the law didn’t destroy the job market, despite pessimistic predictions from critics. ""Our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law,"" Obama said on Capitol Hill on Jan. 12, 2016. We hadn’t heard that particular Obamacare talking point before, so we decided to take a look. Because Obama referred specifically to ""our businesses,"" we looked at private-sector employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics starting in March 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. Of the 70 months since, Obama is correct that every single one has seen positive job growth. That’s a record for uninterrupted job growth, according to our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker. This graph from BLS shows monthly change in private-sector job growth (in thousands) since the start of 2010:  From early 2010 on, the data is above the zero line, showing positive job growth. The fact that the country has gained jobs despite the health care law also might not assuage critics’ argument that job growth, and other aspects of the economy, would have been stronger absent the law. For example, in a January 2015 fact-check, we found that the law might have caused many thousands of employees to have their hours cut from full-time to part-time. But independent studies haven’t backed up claims that the law would end up reducing employment. In 2011, we rated a claim from former Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., that Obamacare is ""job killing"" False. Former Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in 2014 that Obamacare is ""expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs."" We rated that claim Mostly False. Our ruling Obama said, ""Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law."" The private sector has seen job growth every single month since Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010.

We have cut 'our deficits by almost three-quarters,' Obama says in State of the Union
","A year ago, President Barack Obama said during his 2015 State of the Union address that the United States has seen ""our deficits cut by two-thirds"" during his tenure. We rated that claim Mostly True. During his 2016 State of the Union address, Obama raised the bar. After citing some of his administration’s economic accomplishments, he said, ""We’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters."" Has the deficit-reduction expanded during the past year? We took a closer look. Let’s start with an important reminder: The deficit is not the same as the debt. A country’s deficit is the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The national debt, by contrast, is the accumulation of all annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. When we checked Obama’s assertion a year ago, he compared his first budget year in office -- 2009 -- to 2014, using the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP. Economists consider this a valid way to measure the size of the deficit -- in fact, for most purposes, it’s the best way, since it factors in the economy’s change over time. Here’s the recent history of the deficit as a percentage of GDP. The years 2009 through 2014 come from historical data maintained by the Office of Management and Budget. The 2015 figure is the most recent estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, released in August 2015.   Fiscal year Deficit as a percentage of GDP 2009 9.8 2010 8.7 2011 8.5 2012 6.8 2013 4.1 2014 2.8 2015 2.4 According to this data, the deficit as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 76 percent -- almost exactly what Obama said. If you use dollars rather than percentage of GDP, the decline is a bit smaller but still pretty close -- 70 percent. That said, experts have told us that while Obama's math may be correct, it's missing some important caveats. First, it's important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy. This temporarily elevated level set the stage for the unusually precipitous decline. ""This is not to say that that the large deficit was his fault, but if one used the 2008 deficit as a frame of reference, the comparison would be quite different,"" Alan Auerbach, University of California Berkeley professor of economics and law, told us a year ago. Also, some economists we’ve consulted pointed out that the 2009 fiscal year was Obama’s first year in office, and so not necessarily a good starting point since he had little control over the spending in that year. There's another issue. Princeton University economics professor Harvey Rosen told us the more important question is whether Obama has put the government on a path that will keep deficits stable. ""And the answer is no,"" Rosen said, because entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, have not had substantial reform. The long-term forecast for the deficit illustrates this point. Absent substantial reform, the Congressional Budget Office expects a few more years of short-term deficit decreases followed by bigger shortfalls in 10 and 20 years. The most recent projections show deficits as a percentage of GDP remaining lower than today’s level through 2018, then beginning an upward curve. Between 2019 and 2022, the deficit is set to rise from 2.8 percent of GDP to 3.7 percent of GDP. It is not projected to fall below 3.4 percent through 2025. We should also note that the picture on the debt is not as rosy as it is for the deficit. When Obama took office, the debt held by the public stood at $6.3 trillion. Since then, it has more than doubled to $13.6 trillion. Finally, presidents don’t move the economy on their own (the economy can be affected for good or ill by global trends and technological change) and must cooperate with Congress when steering fiscal policy. Our ruling Obama said we have cut ""our deficits by almost three-quarters."" The numbers check out if you start with fiscal year 2009, his first year in office. But it’s worth remembering that 2009 had a historically high deficit, and that projections show the deficit increasing again in just a couple years. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D30C0>],/factchecks/2016/jan/13/barack-obama/we-have-cut-our-deficits-three-fourths-obama-state/
"['Economy', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says we 'completely' turned around Florida's economy
","Gov. Rick Scott kicked off the 2016 legislative session by touting Florida’s growth under his guidance, which he said was an about-face from the direction the state was headed before he took office. ""We have completely turned our economy around, and more families are thriving here today than five years ago,"" he said during his State of the State address in the Capitol on Jan. 12, 2016. The part about more thriving families (and there are more, with Florida last year officially becoming the country’s third-largest state) is too subjective to explore in detail. But what about the economy? We wanted to see if Scott was right about whether Florida’s economy had reversed direction from five years ago. Our look at the data shows the state has turned several economic corners, but the picture isn't so bright when you look at wages. Florida’s numbers In January 2011, Scott inherited an economy ravaged by the worst recession in decades, a housing market in the tank and a double-digit unemployment rate. There were signs the state was already climbing out of the doldrums before Scott took office (the national recession officially ended in mid 2009), but Florida’s recovery was good enough to win Scott a second term. When we asked Scott’s office for evidence, they sent us some selected statistics to support his statement, including reductions in state debt and environmental permitting times. We decided to compare some key indicators that economists said would best illustrate how the economy had changed in order to see where Florida is now. We compared from 2010, the year before Scott’s first term started, to the most recent numbers available. We learned the state has performed better under certain measures than others. Unemployment rate: In November 2015, the unemployment rate in Florida was 5 percent, the same as the national rate. That’s the lowest Florida’s rate has been since January 2008. November’s rate is still a preliminary figure, but it’s much lower than the 10.7 percent it was in December 2011. Payroll employment per month: It’s true the state has added jobs. The latest figures show that between December 2010 and November 2015, Florida added 1,011,800 private-sector jobs. But when you subtract the 27,300 government jobs that have been lost in that same span, the net change is 984,500 new jobs.  Per capita personal income: This statistic refers to how much income was earned per person in the state. The U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Economic Analysis, which measures income starting midyear, says that in 2009-10, income in Florida grew 2.2 percent. But then that growth slowed down each year. In the last fiscal year data available, 2012-13, that figure dropped by -0.1 percent. Per capita real GDP: This measures all of the inflation-adjusted economic activity per person in Florida. In 2009-10, per capita real GDP dropped by 1 percent. In 2013-14, the latest year available, it was growing by 1.2 percent. That amounts to $38,664 per person in 2014, about $300 more than it was in 2010. Last year Florida’s per capita real GDP lagged the national average by more than $10,000. Industrial production: The BLS maintains a national index that measures the value of manufacturing output, compared to a ""base"" rate of 100, but Moody’s Analytics maintains proprietary estimates for each state. In December 2010, this rate was 96.56 for Florida, and by November 2015 was 105.93, moving ahead but slightly behind the national average. The big takeaway: Florida’s employment picture has improved, but many of the newly created jobs aren’t necessarily paying very well. Can Scott take credit? There are other measures, of course, and they all can look at the picture from different angles. Florida’s poverty rate in 2010 was 16 percent, for example, but after dropping for two years, it was up to 16.7 percent in 2014, almost two points above the national average. The state’s median household income has been dropping over the years, and currently lags the national average by about $6,000. Economists told us that Florida is mirroring the United States in economic terms — the country is doing better, so Florida is doing better. The economy here also has a focus on service and hospitality jobs, which often are minimum wage and part time, so the quality of Florida’s figures can (and often do) lag behind national averages. On top of that, Scott’s claim doesn’t reflect that Florida still has a way to go to top the state’s previous historical growth. For example, the unemployment rate was as low as 3.1 percent in mid 2006. ""Floridians are just recovering back to where they were before,"" said Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed and economics professor at George Washington University. ""I don’t think that’s the American Dream, to struggle to get back to how things were."" Economists also noted there are issues with how to compare these indicators because of how they are calculated or the time frames they encompass. Furthermore, Scott is taking credit for things that are mostly out of his control. Experts reminded us states are often affected by factors like shifting demographics, national trends and the global economy more than the policies of any one official or the Legislature. ""Like the quarterback of a football team, he gets too much credit when the economy does well and too much blame when the economy does poorly,"" Moody’s economist Chris Lafakis said. ""Scott has benefitted from being governor at an advantageous time of the business cycle."" Our ruling Scott said, ""We have completely turned our economy around."" Economic indicators show that some factors, like job growth and unemployment, have reversed losses from previous years. But while there is more economic activity than before, incomes are down and remain below national averages. Experts agree Scott and lawmakers can’t take much credit for changes either way. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D3440>],/factchecks/2016/jan/12/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-completely-turned-around-florid/

Landes claim Medicaid expansion could cost Virginia $1 billion a year based on shaky assumption
","Del. Steve Landes says Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s long-sought initiative to expand Medicaid in Virginia is financial quicksand. ""Do you support or oppose Medicaid expansion in Virginia?"" Landes, R-Augusta, asked constituents in a recent survey about issues. ""While expansion would enroll up to 400,000 currently uninsured Virginians in Medicaid, it could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion per year, forcing cuts to other key services like education, mental health and public safety."" Landes is hardly the first Republican to sound the $1 billion-a-year alarm about the potential cost of expanding Medicaid. Others, including House Speaker Bill Howell, also have tossed around the number during the GOP’s successful three-year effort to block expansion. Democrats say the state has a moral obligation to make Medicaid available to all low-income Virginians who are qualified - particularly because the federal government has agreed to pay for the vast majority of the expansion. Republicans counter that Medicaid already is unwieldy and that Uncle Sam, deeply in debt, can’t be relied upon to pay his promised share. The issue is certain to re-emerge this winter when the General Assembly convenes for a 60-day session starting Jan. 13. So it’s a good time to look into the accuracy of the $1 billion-a-year claim. Let’s start with some background. The costs Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, states have the choice of extending their Medicaid programs to people who earn 138 percent of the U.S. poverty level. The federal government pays all of the expansion costs through this federal fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, and gradually will drop its future share to a standing 90 percent after 2019. To date, 31 states have decided to expand Medicaid. Virginia’s Medicaid program is run by the state Department of Medical Assistance Services which, in September, issued annual cost estimates for Medicaid expansion through 2022. They show the expansion would cost a total of $800 million in fiscal 2017, with the state shouldering $32 million of that amount. In 2022, the cost would be $3.1 billion, with the state responsible for $325 million. But these gross figures don’t take into account savings that DMAS says the state would realize by expanding Medicaid. For example, Virginia now covers all the costs of hospitalizing a state prisoner; under Medicaid expansion, the federal government would pay 90 percent of the bills. Virginia pays most of the costs for uninsured low-income residents who receive behavioral health treatment from community service boards; under Medicaid expansion, the federal government again would pay 90 percent of those bills. DMAS concluded that the savings would outweigh the costs of Medicaid expansion through 2020, when Virginia would see a $34 million net gain from joining the program. After that, there would be some - but not much - red ink. DMAS estimated that the bottom-line cost to expand would be $3 million in 2022. Landes’ figure So how does Landes reach his estimate of a potential $1 billion-a-year cost to Virginia taxpayers? His calculation rests on the premise that the federal government, already over-committed, will renege on its legal promise to never pay less than 90 percent of expansion costs. ""If the federal government cut the expansion match rate back to 50/50, it would cost Virginia over $1 billion per year in the out years,"" Landes wrote to us in an email. He pointed out that the bottom-line price of expansion - combining Washington’s share with the state’s net cost - is estimated to exceed $2 billion a year starting in 2018. If the federal government tosses half of the expense back to Virginia that year or later, the state would be shackled with annual bills of at least $1 billion. Craig Markva, a spokesman for DMAS, told us the state has every reason to believe that won’t happen. For one thing, legislation would be required to cut the federal contribution. Edwin Park, the vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, told us there’s no movement afoot in Congress to take such an action. In 2012, the Obama administration proposed a budget-cutting measure that would have changed the formula for how much it pays for Medicaid patients, boosting the federal match for current enrollees and lowering the match for people who became newly insured under the law. But after the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that expansion was an option, not a mandate, the White House dropped that proposal, because it wanted to assure states the match would stay at 90 percent, Park said. It also should be noted that the Obama administration notified states in December 2012 that if they enrolled in expansion, they could drop out of the program at any time. That assurance was repeated in a March 20, 2014 letter that Cindy Mann, then the White House’s top Medicaid official, wrote to Bill Hazel, Virginia’s secretary of health. McAuliffe, a Democrat who has been pushing to broaden Medicaid, has proposed a state law that would require Virginia’s withdrawal if Washington reduced support for expansion. Republicans have been skeptical the state could extricate itself from the expansion once it began. Our ruling Landes, in a constituent survey, said Medicaid expansion ""could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion per year."" That contradicts the latest estimates on expansion. Virginia’s gross cost in 2022 - the furthest out the projections go - would be $324 million. The net cost, after taking into account a variety of savings the expansion offers, would be $3.1 million. That’s light years away from Landes’ figure. Landes’ estimate rests on the eye-popping supposition that the federal government could decide in the future to cut nearly half of its commitment to pay 90 percent of the costs for expansion, leaving states holding the bag. But this is pure speculation of his part. There’s no effort in Congress now to cut the federal share at all, let alone by the proportion Landes suggests. There’s a burden on Landes to prove his statement with facts, and he comes up short. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972392C0>],/factchecks/2016/jan/11/steven-landes/landes-says-medicaid-expansion-could-cost-virginia/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe's claim of record school budget is dubious
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe says his two-year state budget proposal would bestow unprecedented riches on Virginia’s public schools. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are taking Virginia’s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth’s history,"" he said on Dec. 17 as he introduced his budget to the General Assembly’s money committees. ""We’re not only setting a record in total state spending on education; we’re also pushing up our per-pupil contribution to $5,446 in 2018,"" McAuliffe added. ""Again, this is the highest level of student support in our history."" We wondered whether the governor’s budget truly would be a record breaker for public schools, which suffered deep state cuts during the most recent recession and have struggled for years to regain those funds. Raw dollars Christina Nuckols, McAuliffe’s deputy press secretary, sent us a chart detailing total state aid for schools and per-pupil funding from 2001 through the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. The chart also carried forward those figures for each of the next two fiscal years in the governor’s biennial budget proposal. In raw dollars, McAuliffe’s overall school budget would exceed the record $6.45 billion being spent during the current school year. lt would raise education spending to $6.54 billion next school year and to $6.82 billion during the 2017-18 term. Many of those new dollars, if matched by local school systems, would fund about 2,500 new instructional jobs over the biennium and a 2 percent pay raise for teachers in July 2017.   In raw dollars, the governor’s spending plan also would break the state record of funding $5,248 per student - set during the 2008-09 school year in the last budget that was approved before the recession decimated revenues. McAuliffe’s budget would increase that level to $5,251 in 2016-17. The following school year, it would rise to $5,446. What about inflation? There’s a problem with comparing historic spending levels in terms of the raw money that was spent each year: A dollar spent today or in the future doesn’t buy as much as a buck spent in the past. So we took a more meaningful look at whether McAuliffe's plan, when adjusted for inflation, would remain the richest school budget in Virginia history. The governor’s claim failed this test. We adjusted each of the education budgets since 2001 to 2015 dollars, using inflation data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Under these measurements, the high-water mark came in the 2008-09 school year, when the state spent an adjusted $6.96 billion on public education. That figure exceeds the peak $6.83 billion expenditure - in raw dollars - in McAuliffe’s 2017-18 budget. And the governor’s outlay drops further in the rankings when it’s adjusted for inflation. Financial forecasters generally are predicting annual 2 percent inflation rates for the next few years. If that proves accurate, then the adjusted dollars in McAuliffe’s peak education budget in 2017-18 would fall below the inflation-revised level of three state budgets that were in effect from July 2006 through June 2009. We applied the same inflation adjustments to per-pupil spending, which is the gold standard in evaluating education budgets because it takes into account Virginia’s rising enrollments. The glory years for state spending per student once again occurred during the budgets that were in effect from July 2006 to June 2009. Virginia, in adjusted 2015 dollars, spent $5,524 to $5,825 per pupil during those school years. McAuliffe’s peak proposal of $5,446 per student doesn’t rise to that level in raw dollars and falls further when adjusted for inflation. Our ruling ""We are taking Virginia’s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth’s history,"" McAuliffe said last month. In raw dollars, the governor’s proposed budget would set state records for overall education spending and per-student outlays. But this is a misleading way of comparing spending levels, because raw dollars lose value over time. A meaningful comparison of historic spending levels requires that the figures be adjusted for inflation. When that’s done, the governor’s education budget does not rise to the levels reached one to three years before the most recent recession. So we rate the governor’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B3C1C0>],/factchecks/2016/jan/11/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffes-claim-record-school-budget-dubious/

Donald Trump mostly wrong that 'we get practically nothing' from South Korea for U.S. troop presence
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying it’s time for South Korea to pick up more of the costs of having United States military forces in South Korea. During an extended interview with NBC’s Meet the Press from Ottumwa, Iowa, Trump addressed the situation on the Korean peninsula, where North Korea re-emerged in the news in recent days with the purported test of a hydrogen bomb by the regime of Kim Jong Un. ""We have 28,000 soldiers on the line in South Korea between the madman and them,"" Trump said, referring to Kim. ""We get practically nothing compared to the cost of this.""  This is not the first time Trump has used this talking point. In 2011, we checked this claim about South Korea: ""We have 25,000 soldiers over there protecting them. They don't pay us. Why don't they pay us?"" We rated the claim that South Korea doesn't pay False, noting that South Korea had picked up the tab for nearly $700 million in the most recent year for personnel, logistics and construction costs. On Meet the Press, Trump made a slightly less absolute statement. Rather than saying, ""They don't pay us,"" he said, ""We get practically nothing compared to the cost."" So we took another look at this assertion.  The Joint Security Area at the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea in 2009, with South Korean soldiers in the foreground and a North Korean soldier in the distance. (Wikimedia Commons) We found that South Korea does still pay for the U.S. presence, which currently includes roughly 28,500 military personnel. (That’s far smaller than the roughly 500,000 South Korean service members on active duty, plus many more South Korean reserve troops.) In fact, South Korea pays quite a bit more than they did in 2011. In the most recent agreement, announced in early 2014, South Korea said it would pay $866.6 million that year to support the U.S. presence. That was 5.8 percent higher than the 2013 amount, and that could grow by as much as 4 percent annually through 2018. So is this ""practically nothing compared to the cost"" of a U.S. military presence, as Trump argues? Calculating the South Korean financial burden on a percentage basis is tricky, because it’s difficult to determine how much it ""costs"" the United States to station military personnel in South Korea. Do you include the annual salaries and benefits for the troops in question, or do you also include their equipment and past training? If you look at the most straightforward amount -- salary and benefits for 28,500 troops, which according to experts is roughly $100,000 a head -- then South Korea’s payments account for slightly more than 30 percent of U.S. costs in 2014. ""It's hard to argue that more than $800 million annually is ‘peanuts’ or ‘next to nothing,’ "" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Beyond that, several experts said Trump’s apparent premise -- that the United States is giving a growing, affluent country what amounts to a charitable gift -- is wrong. The United States itself benefits from the military investment in South Korea, they said. ""U.S. forces are no longer there strictly to defend South Korea,"" said William W. Stueck, historian at the University of Georgia. ""They are there to enhance regional stability as well. The point is that we have vital interests in East Asia and the Western Pacific, so why shouldn't we pay part of the bill for our force presence?"" Janda concurred: ""The traditional argument for keeping troops in South Korea is that it deters North Korea from attacking South Korea, stabilizes the region politically, socially, and economically, and gives the United States bases from which it can project military power throughout the western Pacific. In addition, he said, the military expense helps protect countries that buy U.S. products, he said. Allan R. Millett, a historian and director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, agreed. ""Alliances are not to be measured in dollars, but in their effectiveness at deterring conflict,"" he said. It’s also worth pointing out that South Korea’s willingness to share the costs means that it’s cheaper for U.S. military to support those 28,500 troops, compared to having them stationed elsewhere, even at bases in the United States. Reasonable people can disagree, Janda said, about whether South Korea is paying ""enough,"" and whether the United States might be better off protecting South Korea with air and naval power rather than a sizable ground presence. Janda added that it’s possible to argue that the U.S. military presence ""is partially destabilizing because it makes the Chinese and North Koreans nervous, and that we are too quick to see the world in purely military terms."" Still, he said, ""I don't hear Trump making nuanced arguments like that."" Our ruling Trump said, ""We get practically nothing compared to the cost of"" keeping U.S. military forces in South Korea. Currently, South Korea pays well over $800 million annually to support the United States’ troop presence, an amount that doesn’t qualify as ""practically nothing."" And while Trump makes it sound like the United States’ willingness to pay the rest of the freight amounts to a gift to South Korea, he overlooks that the United States actually benefits significantly on a strategic level from the arrangement.

Donald Trump repeats wrong claim that prisoners swapped for Bergdahl are 'back on the battlefield'
","President Barack Obama is one of the worst negotiators Donald Trump has ever seen, the real estate magnate and presidential candidate said. Take, for example, Obama’s controversial decision to exchange five Guantanamo detainees for Taliban prisoner Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May 2014, Trump said to NBC Meet The Press host Chuck Todd. ""You look at these deals,"" Trump said Jan. 10 in Ottumwa, Iowa. ""I always bring up Bergdahl. We get a traitor, they get five people that they've wanted for nine years, and they're back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including us. And we get a dirty, rotten traitor.""  Trump’s statement that the five former detainees -- who were senior Taliban operatives -- are now ""back on the battlefield"" is one we rated False in July 2015. We decided to revisit the claim to see if anything had changed in the past six months. We looked into whether there were any new developments around the detainees, sometimes called the Taliban Five. The new information shows they’re still where they were last -- in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar under government supervision. So Trump is still wrong. The five detainees were released to Qatar in 2014. Qatar is understood to be a neutral state, as opposed to a ""battlefield"" for insurgent activity. Under the agreement, the five released detainees are not allowed to leave the country. This travel ban was initially supposed to last one year, ending June 1, 2015, but it has been extended. Multiple administration officials told us the detainees haven’t left Qatar. We looked for any evidence to contradict that and found nothing. In fact, in December 2015, the Republican-controlled House Armed Services Committee produced a report in which it expressed concern that the Taliban Five pose a security risk. But the report noted that the security arrangements first made in 2015 had been extended so that the five would remain in Qatar. The State Department told us on Jan. 9, 2016, that the men were still in Qatar. ""None of the five individuals has returned to the battlefield,"" said State Department spokeswoman Liz Trudeau. ""All five men are subject to a travel ban, and none have left Qatar."" ""They’re still in Qatar,"" added Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the National Security Council. Another barrier to the ex-detainees’ return to the battlefield is an additional travel ban beyond the U.S.-Qatar agreement. Four of the five are restricted from leaving the country due to a travel ban imposed by a 1998 United Nations Security Council Resolution, said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean the former detainees aren’t trying to reconnect with the Taliban or other insurgent groups. At least one of the Taliban Five is suspected by the United States of having attempted to contact Taliban associates. And Afghan intelligence officers arrested two suspected insurgents who tried to visit former detainee Mohammad Nabi Omari in Qatar, according to the New York Times. It’s also possible that some or all of the Taliban Five have had more contact with the Taliban or other jihadist networks without the public (or even the government) knowing, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But mere communications, or even giving orders from a distance, is not the same thing as literally being ""back on the battlefield."" ""There are indications that they would like to return to the battlefield,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""There’s reason for concern, but there’s not evidence to support (Trump’s) particular claim."" Even if the Taliban Five has re-engaged in insurgent activities electronically -- a contention that, we reiterate, is not confirmed by any publicly available information -- it would be a stretch to conclude that this counts as returning to the battlefield. ""At least one of them called some of his relatives. I don't know what he said on the phone. If making a phone call now constitutes returning to the battlefield, we are in 1984 territory,"" Rubin said, referring to the George Orwell novel. Our ruling Trump said the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are ""back on the battlefield."" The Taliban Five are known to be in Qatar, where they have been since their release over a year ago. Qatar is considered neutral ground -- not a battlefield -- and they are not allowed to leave the country. At least one of the five has been in contact with suspected insurgents, but experts said there is not enough information available to know the extent of these communications. And even if they had communicated with insurgents from afar, that would not the same as literally going back to the battlefield and, as Trump said, ""trying to kill everybody."".

R.I. among states with strongest gun-control laws
","House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello is not among Rhode Island lawmakers eager to further restrict gun ownership following a rash of gun-related mass killings, including a rampage in San Bernardino, Cal.  ""Let’s start with the premise that Rhode Island already has one of the 10 strictest [gun laws] amongst all the states,"" the Cranston Democrat told The Journal. ""...An assault weapons ban? Tell me how that helps anybody."" Yes, let’s start with that premise. In fact, let’s focus on it. Is Rhode Island among 10 U.S. states with the most stringent controls on guns? We called Mattiello’s spokesman and asked him to find out where the speaker’s information came from. Meanwhile, we looked around on our own. It didn’t take long to find something known as the ""Gun Law State Scorecard."" Maintained by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the scorecard ranks Rhode Island No. 9 based on the strength of its gun laws. We found another ranking, also compiled in 2015, from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, another organization that supports stronger gun laws. The campaign is named, in part, after the late Jim Brady, a White House press secretary who was shot and disabled when a Texas man attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. One of the Brady Campaign’s web sites, CrimAdvisor.com, is a spoof on TripAdvisor. ""Plan your perfect getaway,"" it says, on a web page that identifies the 10 most attractive states for getting a gun. Rhode Island is listed among the 10 least gun-friendly states with a ranking of No. 8. The law center, which was Mattiello’s primary source, was established in San Francisco after a 1993 shooting that killed eight and wounded six. The shooting, which took place at a law firm, led Bay area lawyers to create an organization that campaigned for a federal ban on assault weapons. Later, it focused on supporting state and local gun regulation in California.  In 2015, the center worked on a variety of projects to support stronger gun laws across the country.   And each year, the center analyzes state gun laws and grades each state on the ""strength"" of its regulations. Strength isn’t always the same thing as strictness,  but it’s fair to say there are more gun restrictions in states that get the best grades. In 2015, Rhode Island’s grade of B+ gave it a ranking of No. 9 on the scorecard, just behind Illinois and just ahead of Delaware. A spokesman for the law center, Garrett McDonough, told us that he wouldn’t have used the word ""strictest,"" but the center’s data does support Mattiello’s statement. ""Our position would be that that statement is accurate,"" he said. ""We don’t like to use the word strict because it makes it sound like it’s a prohibition or a restriction of people’s rights,"" he said. Other studies show that Rhode Island competes well in other statistics valued by supporters of gun control. One of them, the per capita rate for gun deaths, is low.  Also, by a per capita measure, incidents of guns purchased in Rhode Island and then used in crimes out of state are low.  Rhode Island’s per capita rate in this category was the sixth lowest in the country, according to a Washington Post analysis of gun trace data provided by the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Our ruling The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence is an outspoken advocate for gun control laws. And its legal experts rate Rhode Island among states with the strongest gun-control laws. The statement is True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809697EF00>],/factchecks/2016/jan/10/nicholas-mattiello/ri-among-states-strongest-gun-control-laws/
"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Scot Ross']","
Activist claims Wisconsin ""moved from 16th to third in percentage of people with student loan debt.""
","The liberal group One Wisconsin Now thinks college students should be given more flexibility to deal with their student loans. The group’s executive director Scot Ross highlighted that issue during a Dec. 13, 2015 appearance on ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a public affairs show on WISN-TV. During a discussion about Gov. Scott Walker’s future, Ross criticized the governor’s performance on a number of fronts. Under Walker, he said, Wisconsin is ""last in the Midwest in job creation"" and ""we've moved from 16th to third in percentage of people with student loan debt."" The lagging-in-jobs claim isn’t new. Democratic challenger Mary Burke used versions of the claim in her unsuccessful campaign against Walker in 2014.  In March 2015, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, said the state ""is dead last in the Midwest for job creation."" We rated that Mostly True -- the state was tied for 9th place at the time. But what about Ross’ student-debt claim? Have Wisconsin college students leaped up the chart in how much they owe? And is it because of Walker, as Ross implied? When we asked Ross for backup, he wrote in an email: ""I misread a number from my written show prep notes. It's 10th not 16th."" He made a light-hearted suggestion at what rating he deserves, too: ""Mostly Old."" Alas, that’s not a category on the Truth-O-Meter. Ross said the data he cited came from the Institute for College Access & Success, an independent non-profit group. The group’s 2015 report said that state students owed an average of $28,810, a level that was No. 3 in the nation based on the percent of students. Some 70 percent of state students have college debt, the report said. The group’s report from 2012, reflecting data from 2011, the first year of Walker’s term, said state student debt averaged $26,238 and the state had a ranking of 10th in the nation. In 2011, 67 percent of state students had loans.   (The average amount of debt ranked 16th in the nation, which might have been the source of the confusion for Ross.) So, while Ross got the numbers wrong, debt has increased for state students in the years Walker has been governor. Who’s to blame? The part of Ross’s claim that suggests student debt increased due to action by Walker is more problematic. In August 2015, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush claimed student loan debt had doubled under President Barack Obama. That was rated Half True. Experts said the level of debt was rising before Obama took office in 2009, due to the recession and other factors beyond the president’s control. The economic downturn pushed states to cut higher education funding, and schools increased tuition to cover costs, Donald Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University, told PolitiFact. Since 1980, private college tuition has increased about 200 percent, while public school tuition has increased about 300 percent, with the by far the biggest jump happening since 2008, according to College Board data compiled by Heller. The Federal Reserve put student debt nationally at about $1.3 trillion as of September 2015. That compares with $844 billion in 2010 and $640 billion in 2008, shortly after the economy crashed. Our rating Ross said that in the time Walker has led Wisconsin, student debt increased to third in the country. He acknowledged he got the number wrong, making the jump seem bigger than it was, but was correct that more state students have college loans. He’s less accurate about the implication that the increase in debt is due to Walker. To be sure there have been cuts to education and the UW System under Walker, but Ross offered no evidence that those cuts drove state students debt higher. And student debt nationally has increased sharply in the years he has been in office. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809697ECC0>],/factchecks/2016/jan/08/scot-ross/activist-claims-wisconsin-moved-16th-third-percent/

Carly Fiorina says U.S. didn't address cybersecurity in economic dialogues with China
","Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina recently took President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to task on the issue of cybersecurity, via a column posted on Medium. She said Obama and Clinton have left the United States ""woefully uprepared for cyberterrorism."" Fiorina said cybersecurity is ""a critical piece of our strategy to defeat ISIS and restore American leadership in the world."" She made a number of assertions in that column; here we’ll look at one she made about the United States’ efforts to prevent cyber attacks from China. ""When we held recent economic dialogues with China,"" Fiorina wrote, ""we agreed on over 100 different things —  including wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity."" China has been implicated in past data breaches, including perhaps the most far-reaching hacking incident so far, which accessed a large cache of sensitive personal data held by the federal Office of Personnel Management. Campaign spokeswoman Anna Epstein told us that Fiorina was referring to a news release in which the White House summarized 127 areas of agreement reached in June 2015 at the Strategic & Economic Dialogue, a periodic summit between high-level representatives of the United States and China. Fiorina has a point that none of the 127 items on that list explicitly addressed cybersecurity. However, her argument is weaker if one looks beyond that list of 127 items: Fiorina ignored a subsequent agreement between the United States and China that dealt directly with cybersecurity. But let’s start with the summit. In their public addresses at the summit’s opening, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew each said that cybersecurity was an important issue for U.S.-China relations, and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang agreed in his speech. The cybersecurity discussion -- a thorny one -- apparently did not lead to an agreement by the end of the summit, though experts told PolitiFact it may have been covered within the 127-point list by point 4, which confirmed the existence of ""candid, constructive discussions between the two sides on strategic security issues."" The biggest problem with Fiorina’s claim, though, is that it fails to account for significant developments later in 2015. The most important of these is an agreement on cybersecurity between the United States and China announced in September. That came almost three months before Fiorina posted her column. On Sept. 24 and 25, Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China for a state visit. During that visit, the two leaders announced an agreement on cybersecurity. Here are some of the key elements the two countries agreed on: • Cooperation on investigating malicious cyber-activities coming from their territory; • A pledge not to conduct or knowingly support cyber-theft of confidential business information to aid companies or industries; • Efforts to promote international consensus on norms for state behavior in cyberspace; • Creation of a ""high-level joint dialogue"" on cybercrime with regular meetings, as well as a ""hotline"" to prevent the escalation of issues. ""This was important, because China accepted that states should not conduct cyber espionage against commercial entities to create competitive advantage,"" said Adam Segal, senior fellow for China studies and director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. And there have been notable developments since then, Segal has written: ""There was positive follow up in the first round of cyber talks between the Department of Homeland Security and Chinese Ministry of Public Security in December 2015"" when the two sides ""agreed on guidelines for requesting assistance on cybercrime or other malicious cyber activities, as well as to conduct ‘tabletop exercises’ in spring 2016 and to define procedures for use of the hotline."" In addition, since Xi’s visit, the White House has worked to advance cybersecurity policies with other countries. A similar agreement between the United Kingdom and China has been struck, and there are indications that Germany would sign a ""no cyber theft"" deal with Beijing in 2016, Segal wrote. Meanwhile, during the G-20 summit in November 2015, the White House announced that the leaders in attendance reached a notable consensus that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace, including pledges not to ""conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property."" It’s worth noting that experts acknowledge significant difficulties in enforcing cybersecurity agreements. ""Just three weeks after the agreement, cybersecurity companies reported new attacks on pharmaceutical companies,"" Segal wrote. Our ruling Fiorina said, ""When we held recent economic dialogues with China, we agreed on over 100 different things — including wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity."" One document listing agreements struck during a June 2015 U.S.-China summit supports Fiorina’s point, but citing that one document is a case of extreme cherry-picking. Three months later -- and three months before Fiorina published her article -- the United States and China struck a significant cybersecurity agreement, and since then, the countries have taken steps to implement the agreement and forge cybersecurity agreements with other nations. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F5D080>],/factchecks/2016/jan/07/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-us-didnt-address-cybersecurity-/

","With Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton's foreign policy decisions, the Clinton campaign has fired back by asserting that ""Marco Rubio Distorts Clinton’s Foreign Policy Record – And His Own."" The HillaryClinton.com webpage notes that Rubio ""claimed that Hillary Clinton 'stood by' while the conflict in Syria devolved into a humanitarian crisis. The truth is that Hillary Clinton was an early supporter for arming the moderate opposition against Assad in 2012."" ""And what’s even more amazing,"" according to the Clinton campaign, ""is that Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people."" We were curious if the ""even more amazing"" claim about Rubio was true, and he actually opposed Syrian airstrikes. PolitiFact has ventured into this area before, as a Clinton spokesman was quick to point out. In September 2013, Rubio was one of seven members on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (including two Democrats) to vote against authorizing U.S. military action against Syria. Three Republicans joined seven Democrats to approve the measure. The Senate resolution was debated on the floor but never came up for a vote because a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons issue surfaced and Obama asked Congress to put off action. At the time, as a former senator and secretary of state, and a budding 2016 presidential candidate, Clinton publicly supported airstrikes. Asked about his vote during the Sept. 16, 2015, CNN GOP presidential debate, Rubio said he opposed the action because President Obama ""said the attack that he was going to conduct was going to be a pinprick."" PolitiFact ruled that because Obama had repeatedly stated that pinprick attacks were not what he wanted to do, Rubio's statement was False. In the debate, Rubio added that, ""The United States military was not built to conduct pinprick attacks,"" and he wanted a strategy that would put ""men and women in a position where they can win."" Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon indicated that opposition to those airstrikes doesn't mean Rubio was opposed to the United States becoming involved in Syria, which Rubio made clear during the Foreign Relations Committee meeting where he explained his vote. He predicted that the airstrikes would not work and reiterated his longstanding call for Obama to give arms to the moderate opposition in Syria. On Sept. 18, 2014, when the president asked Congress for approval to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels as part of a larger plan to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Rubio voted in favor of the proposal, which was part of a larger spending package. Clinton has advocated arming Syrian rebels as well. The Clinton website tries to make Rubio look reluctant to take on Syria or make it look like the senator has flip-flopped, including a quote from Politico that ""Rubio was an early advocate of arming the Syrian rebels,"" and a Politico headline reporting that ""Rubio the hawk turned dovish on Syria in 2013."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people."" Rubio did vote against the specific resolution for an airstrike campaign, explaining he was ""unconvinced it will work."" But he supported a subsequent plan for the United States to help moderate Syrian rebels lead the fight, an idea he had been promoting for a while. The Clinton statement suggests a reluctance by Rubio to intervene in Syria when, in fact, it's the type of involvement that's at issue. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B2CE80>],/factchecks/2016/jan/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-syrian-air-strikes-claim-against-/

Donald Trump incorrectly says Ted Cruz has had a 'double passport'
","New Yorker Donald Trump told The Washington Post that uncertainty over whether Ted Cruz of Texas satisfies the citizenship requirement to be president puts Republicans in a precarious position. Hold on. Legal scholars concur that the Canadian-born but mostly Texas-reared Cruz, battling Trump and others for the Republican presidential nomination, likely fulfills the constitutional imperative that the president be a ""natural-born citizen."" But there’s a note of uncertainty because the Supreme Court has never directly ruled on the citizenship provision for presidential office holders. The question circulates because Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, on Dec. 22, 1970, to his Delaware-born mother Eleanor Darragh and Cuban-born father. If Darragh was an American, then under American law, Cruz was an American at birth. We were curious about Trump’s claim in a Jan. 5, 2016, interview with the Post -- offered by the candidate without documentary evidence -- that Cruz has had more than one passport, implying the Houston lawyer spent some time trying to pass as a citizen of either Canada or the U.S. Prior to a Trump rally in Lowell, Mass., the Post asked Trump about Cruz’s Canadian roots. Trump replied: ""Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question: ‘Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?’ That’d be a big problem. It’d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he’d be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision. You don’t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head."" Trump went on: ""I’d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it, and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport."" There’s no such thing, far as we could tell, as a ""double passport."" We suspect Trump was suggesting Cruz had obtained both one U.S. and a Canadian one--though our requests for factual backup drew no replies from Trump representatives. Meantime, when we asked Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler about Cruz ever having a ""double passport,"" Tyler replied that Cruz had ""never"" had a Canadian passport or, he said by email, applied for one. Whether he knew it or not, Cruz for much of his life had dual citizenship, meaning citizenship in Canada and the United States. A Canadian government website says: ""You do not apply for dual citizenship and there is no related certificate. Canadians are allowed to take foreign citizenship while keeping their Canadian citizenship."" In August 2013, when the Dallas Morning News reported Cruz’s dual status, Cruz said that it came as a surprise to him and his parents. ""Nothing against Canada,"" Cruz said, ""but I’m an American by birth and as a U.S. senator, I believe I should be only an American."" That News’ story said that unless Cruz ""formally renounces that citizenship, he will remain a citizen of both countries, legal experts say. That means he could assert the right to vote in Canada or even run for Parliament. On a lunch break from the U.S. Senate, he could head to the nearby embassy — the one flying a bright red maple leaf flag — pull out his Calgary, Alberta, birth certificate and obtain a passport."" (We checked a Canadian government web page; it says an adult in the United States seeking a new Canadian passport must apply by mail.) In 2013, Cruz reacted to the News’ story by vowing to shed his Canadian citizenship, which he successfully renounced as of May 14, 2014, the News reported in June 2014. Our ruling Trump said Cruz ""has had a double passport."" Trump didn’t provide and we didn’t find evidence that Cruz, who relinquished his dual citizenship in 2014, ever carried passports for the U.S. and Canada--nor, Cruz’s camp advises, did he ever apply for a Canada passport. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

Obama: Violent felons can buy guns online without background checks
","Under the current system, dangerous people are able to buy firearms far too often, President Barack Obama said in a speech announcing new executive action on gun policy. ""The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules,"" he said Jan. 5. ""A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked."" Quite a few readers flagged Obama’s claim that a violent felon can buy a gun online without a background check, so we decided to fact-check it. Some readers seemed to think Obama was suggesting such transactions were legal. We don’t see that in Obama’s comments. (The grammarians at PolitiFact would note that Obama said ""can,"" not ""may."") To be clear, such a transaction would be illegal. What Obama said is that such transactions are possible. That is accurate, but it’s also a little more complicated than Obama’s comment suggests. A big loophole Federal law prohibits felons from purchasing or receiving guns unless their rights have been formally restored. However, felons can get around this obstacle by buying guns from sellers who do not require criminal background checks. ""Violent felons aren't allowed to buy guns, period,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""But they can take advantage of the loophole in federal law that allows gun sales, including some gun sales over the Internet, to purchase from non-licensed sellers, who don't have to conduct a background check."" Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" has to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. If an individual buys a gun from someone who does not have or require a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check. So a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer’s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show. There are a couple of important limitations on these sorts of online private transactions. First, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person. Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers ""can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,"" said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis. Additionally, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales.  There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, according to a 2013 study by Third Way, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website Armslist.com, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, Third Way found 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically. In its own 2013 review of Armslist and similar sites, the New York Times found that these sites ""function as unregulated bazaars, where the essential anonymity of the Internet allows unlicensed sellers to advertise scores of weapons and people legally barred from gun ownership to buy them."" Their investigation identified several individuals with criminal backgrounds buying and selling firearms over the Internet. Still, only a small slice of gun purchases take place online. In a December Quinnipiac poll, just 3 percent of gun owners said they obtained a gun from an online seller. Obama’s statement ""rings true,"" said John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University. ""Since our goal is to keep guns from the hands of criminals, it doesn't make sense that if you go to a store to buy a gun you have to go through a background check,"" Donohue said, ""But if you buy the exact same gun on the Internet from a private seller, you don't have to go through a background check."" Winkler said Obama’s proposed executive action won’t do much to curb these kinds of transactions, though, ""because the loophole is baked into federal law."" Regarding background checks, Obama has directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to ""clarify"" that anyone ""engaged in the business of dealing in firearms"" needs a license — meaning self-described hobbyists who regularly sell guns, rather than just occasionally, might be violating the law by operating without a license. But this doesn’t directly stop felons from buying guns from private sellers who don’t have a license and don’t require purchasers to undergo background checks. Our ruling Obama said, ""A violent felon can buy (a gun) over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked."" The kind of transaction Obama described is possible, though illegal, and more complicated than his comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they can purchase guns from private sellers over the Internet without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. That seller would have to be in the same state as the buyer. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True. Editor's note: This fact-check has been updated to add details about how Internet-facilitated gun sales take place. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B3BE80>],/factchecks/2016/jan/05/barack-obama/obama-violent-felons-can-buy-guns-online-without-b/

Laura Ingraham wrongly says claim that 90% support for gun background checks has been debunked
","Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases. President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address. But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate. ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,"" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. ""Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C."" PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked. Go to the polls Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers. National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples: Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks""? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent. Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not. So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham’s producers and didn’t hear back. We couldn’t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey. This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control. The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict. ""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America. Our ruling Ingraham said, ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked."" Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings — such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation — there hasn’t been a definitive debunking of the statistic. We rate Ingraham’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BC8400>],/factchecks/2016/jan/05/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-say-claim-90-support-gun-background/
