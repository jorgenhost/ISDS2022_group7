Biden was describing misinformation about gun control legislation, not threatening to take away guns
","Less than six months after the December 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., left 28 people dead, then-Vice President Joe Biden stood before reporters to talk about proposed gun control legislation. Though Biden was describing what he called a campaign of disinformation by the National Rifle Association, social media users have since stripped his comments of context to make it seem like he is threatening to have the government seize people’s guns. A viral Facebook post shows a 26-second clip of Biden saying, ""No way that Uncle Sam can go find out whether you own a gun because we’re about to really take away all your rights and you’re not going to be able to defend yourself and we’re going to swoop down with Special Forces folks and gather up every gun in America.""

The video has a text overlay that suggests the statement was spoken as a threat: ""This is how I see this going if u try,"" it reads before cutting to a drill sergeant yelling in a clip from the movie ""Full Metal Jacket."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden did make that remark in April 2013, but the post does not include his comments before or after that statement, which make it clear he was describing what he believed to be misinformation about the gun control legislation, not proposed actions by the government.  About five minutes before the comment featured in the Facebook post, at the 27:15 mark in Biden’s full speech, Biden began explaining that the National Rifle Association was engaging in a campaign of disinformation, and he talked extensively about the false ideas the organization was spreading about proposed background checks for purchasing guns. At the time of his speech, the Manchin-Toomey gun proposal was under consideration by Congress and would have mandated criminal background checks on all sales between private parties with limited exceptions. The proposal was later defeated. Biden said the NRA was falsely claiming that the federal government wanted to create a federal registry of people who’ve purchased guns. Mocking the detractors, he says, ""Black helicopter crowd really is upset."" His comment about Special Forces came at the 32:04 mark in his full speech. Until then, he had been describing and debunking claims about the proposed gun control legislation. Then he said: ""No central registry for anything. No way that Uncle Sam can go find out whether you own a gun because we’re about to really take away all your rights and you’re not going to be able to defend yourself and we’re going to swoop down with Special Forces folks and gather up every gun in America. It’s bizarre. But that’s what’s being sold out there."" A conservative news outlet noted at the time that Biden was speaking mockingly. A Facebook post claims that President Joe Biden threatened to ""swoop down with Special Forces folks and gather up every gun in America."" The claim shows a seconds-long clip from a much longer speech that Biden delivered, when he described and debunked claims about proposed gun control legislation. His remark about the government gathering guns was intended to show what kind of misinformation was being spread. The entirety of his speech includes the context that makes that clear. We rate this claim False.

Voting machine malfunction in New Jersey isn’t evidence of fraud
","A viral video of a voter in New Jersey struggling with a touch screen voting machine has spread widely across social media with claims that the machine blocked the Republican gubernatorial candidate’s name from being chosen. ""Nothing to SEE here!!! Move along!"" one Facebook caption of the 56-second clip reads.  The conservative Gateway Pundit website wrote an article about the video with this headline: ""More fraud in New Jersey’s election uncovered – voting machines would not allow citizens to vote for Republican governor candidate."" In the video, a voter tries to cast her vote for Republican Jack Ciattarelli several times without success. But when she touches the name of Ciatarelli’s Democratic opponent, Gov. Phil Murphy, the machine appears to work. (It also appeared to work when she touched the name of a Republican candidate for state Senate listed below Ciattarelli). After she asks for help, a poll worker can be heard telling her to touch the center of the name and hold it. This also doesn’t seem to work. The video appears to be authentic. Nevertheless, touchscreen voting machines are known to malfunction on an isolated basis. That is not evidence of fraud, though, and we couldn’t find additional examples of similar malfunctions from this election.   The posts and stories were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video shows that the malfunction occurred in District 11 in Middletown Township, which is located in Monmouth County.  The county’s superintendent of elections, Mary DeSarno, told PolitiFact that her office is aware of the video and hasn’t heard from the voter or any of the poll workers. She said she encourages the voter to contact her office so they can look into the issue further. ""It is important to note that with the new voting machines, voters have the ability to double check their votes two times before casting their ballots, which is a safeguard to protect the integrity of the vote,"" DeSarno added.  The Gateway Pundit story shared another video that appeared to show a similar problem in Bergen County, the largest in the state. Debra M. Francica, Bergen’s superintendent of elections, acknowledged that a few voters in two locations had trouble pressing their selection on the county’s older voting machines for a particular candidate, but said technicians tested the machines and found no issues. Francica told PolitiFact that the technicians advised poll workers to tell voters to press harder with their thumb or a stylus to make their choices. ""Our office is not aware of any voter disenfranchisement,"" she said in an email. Ciattarelli defeated Murphy in Monmouth County by about 43,000 votes, garnering 58.9%. In Bergen, Murphy beat Ciattarelli by about 14,000 votes, winning 52.4%. The videos show two different types of voting machines, and we don’t know exactly what caused the problem. In the past, election officials have said that these types of errors often occur when the machine is out of calibration.  Particularly with older voting machines, like the ones used in Bergen County, if the touch screen and the digital display that lies just underneath it aren’t properly aligned, the machine is considered out of calibration. Anything from temperature changes, rough handling, or even just the passage of time can cause screens to lose calibration, election officials previously told us, and some machines need frequent, manual calibration in order to keep them working properly. Videos of voting machine malfunctions in New Jersey are being shared online with the claim that they are proof of election fraud. It does appear that there were issues with some of the touchscreen machines. But none of the videos prove that voters were denied the ability to cast a vote for the candidate of their choice, or that the machines didn’t end up working correctly at a different time.  The claim has an element of truth, because the video appears authentic. But it is not proof of fraud. We rate the claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A393480>],/factchecks/2021/nov/09/blog-posting/voting-machine-malfunction-new-jersey-isnt-evidenc/

New Jersey poll worker did not commit a crime when providing provisional ballot
","New Jersey’s gubernatorial election, already a hotbed of misinformation, has one more false claim to add to the list. A viral Instagram post claims a crime was committed when a New Jersey election worker allowed someone who said he was not a U.S. citizen to fill out a ballot. The claim came from Project Veritas, known for its history of undercover reporting using hidden cameras and selectively edited recordings. The Instagram post was a screenshot of a tweet by Donald Trump Jr., who was sharing the Project Veritas video. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is not illegal for an election worker to provide a ballot when there are questions about voting eligibility. The New Jersey state Division of Elections notes that provisional ballots are intended for voters ""whose eligibility to vote cannot be confirmed at the polls on Election Day."" The original 59-second Project Veritas video shows a man having a discussion with an election worker. The man says he is not registered to vote and is an Irish citizen, and a text overlay notes that non-citizens cannot vote or register to vote. But when the poll worker asks, ""Do you have some citizenship here?"" he answers, ""With the work visa, yeah."" The poll worker says she’ll let him complete a ballot, and says, ""They’ll figure that out."" The video then shows a text overlay that says, ""NJS 19:34-20, Poll workers may not provide a ballot to someone not entitled to vote."" That section of the law addresses the actions of people who cast a vote or aid someone with voting, knowing that the person is not eligible to vote. The poll worker in the video says she is unsure of the man’s eligibility but will provide a ballot so that his eligibility can be assessed later, as the law allows. At one point in the exchange, she tells the man, ""Whether or not it’s going to be — they’re going to count it, I don’t know."" That’s in keeping with how provisional ballots work in New Jersey. The Division of Elections reports, ""If, after the election, it is determined that the voter who cast the provisional ballot was eligible to vote, the ballot will be counted."" A county clerk in a different New Jersey county told a local radio station that the situation was handled exactly as it should have been. A viral Instagram post claims a crime was committed when a New Jersey election worker allowed someone who said he was not a U.S. citizen to fill out a ballot.

Merriam-Webster didn’t remove the immunity portion to its vaccine definition. It changed the wording
","First, people claimed that Merriam-Webster sneakily changed the definition of the word ""anti-vaxxer"" to include people who oppose laws that mandate vaccination. (It didn’t. It has always had the same definition.) Now, social media posts are making another gripe with the online dictionary with assertions that it changed the definition of the word ""vaccine."" ""Vaccine used to be defined as a substance that provides ‘immunity’ to a specific disease,"" a post shared on Facebook said. ""Now, Merriam Webster has literally changed the definition of ‘vaccine’ and removed the ‘immunity’ portion to possibly cover for the fact that Covid ‘vaccines’ don’t actually provide immunity from Covid."" This is misleading. Merriam-Webster has revised its entry for the word ""vaccine"" as part of its continual revision of entries, but it did not remove references to immunity. Rather, it changed the phrase ""increase immunity"" to say, ""stimulate the body’s immune response."" The current entry better captures how mRNA-based vaccines work compared with traditional vaccines. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) For years, the dictionary definition for the word ""vaccine"" had had the following wording:   ""A preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease."" On May 24, 2021, dictionary editors revised it to read, in part: ""A preparation that is administered (as by injection) to stimulate the body's immune response against a specific infectious agent or disease.  It then goes on to include 10 examples of the word in use; with some being typical uses and some being quotations that show how vaccine is used in context. (These examples appear in light blue text in the online dictionary.)  ""This definition has been revised to reflect both more scientifically accurate language and the fact that we have more space in the online dictionary,"" said Peter Sokolowski, editor at large of Merriam-Webster.com. ""We are now able to provide much more context and detail than previously possible in print dictionaries. The wording had originally been drafted in order to accommodate the space restrictions of our print editions, where definitions necessarily had to be as brief as possible.""  The dictionary further explains and links to related terms such as ""attenuated"" and ""adjuvant,"" as well as ""messenger RNA"" and ""immune response."" These explanations and links, Sokolowski said, serve to give broader coverage to the term being defined.  ""In particular, the definition for immune response provides a detailed description of how a vaccine actually works, and is therefore more specific, scientific, and complete than the more general term immunity,"" he added.  Here is the definition of ""immune response,"" which readers can find linked in the vaccine entry:  ""A bodily response to an antigen that occurs when lymphocytes identify the antigenic molecule as foreign and induce the formation of antibodies and lymphocytes capable of reacting with it and rendering it harmless — called also immune reaction."" A Facebook post claims that Merriam-Webster changed the definition of vaccine and removed the portion about immunity. This is misleading. The dictionary did recently revise its definition of vaccine to be more detailed. But it didn’t eliminate the portion about immunity. Rather, it changed the wording to say that vaccines stimulate the body’s immune response against a specific infectious agent or disease. The entry also references the definition of ""immune response,"" which is more detailed than before. This claim presents an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression.

Is West Virginia home to zero billionaires?
","In a recent tweet, David Gura, a broadcast journalist currently with NPR, tweeted Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., about a seeming irony of one his stances in the hard-fought battle over a key element of President Joe Biden’s agenda. After word emerged that Manchin had thrown cold water on a ""billionaire’s tax"" proposal by some of his Democratic colleagues, Gura said in an Oct. 27 tweet: ""FUN FACT: West Virginia is home to zero billionaires."" FUN FACT: West Virginia is home to zero billionaires. https://t.co/SAZIqvBKzb Is he right that West Virginia has no billionaires? The best available data suggests that it’s the case currently. The tweet’s roots come from the positions Manchin has taken in Democrats’ quest to enact their agenda, a process in which the senator has regularly irritated some of his colleagues. Biden has taken a two-track approach to his federal spending and tax agenda. On Nov. 5, the House joined the Senate in passing an infrastructure bill that would allocate more than $500 billion in new funding on roads, bridges, transit, rail, waterways, airports, the electric grid, and broadband. This measure secured bipartisan support in both chambers, and Manchin was a key figure in crafting it. The second portion of Biden’s agenda is a stand-alone proposal that includes a variety of safety-net measures and other progressive priorities. The president and congressional leaders split off the infrastructure bill from these proposals — such as an extended child tax credit, universal pre-kindergarten, Medicare coverage for hearing aids, and provisions to fight climate change — because they expected to win little if any support from Republicans for the latter.  If this second bill is to pass, Manchin’s support will be crucial, since Democrats will need each of their 50 members in the Senate to vote for it. This reality has produced a months-long back-and-forth between Manchin and more progressive members of his party in both chambers. Time and again, Manchin has signaled his opposition to certain progressive proposals, making him a major face of the debate. One of the ideas that Manchin expressed concerns about is a ""billionaire’s tax"" that would be used to balance out the new expenditures in the bill.  The 107-page proposal would have taxed the unrealized gains on the value of billionaires’ liquid assets, such as stocks, bonds and cash. It would affect an estimated 700 taxpayers. On Oct. 27, Manchin criticized the idea, telling reporters, ""I don’t like the connotation that we’re targeting different people,"" saying that billionaires ""create a lot of jobs and invest a lot of money and give a lot to philanthropic pursuits."" So the point of Gura’s tweet is that Manchin wasn’t even standing up for his constituents with that position, since West Virginia has no billionaires. (Manchin’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Gura did not respond to inquiries for this article, but he attached a Forbes article to his tweet as evidence for his claim.  The Forbes article, which was published in April 2021, said that ""seven states don't have any billionaire residents that Forbes could find: Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia."" The article went on to say that ""Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia, used to be a billionaire but was revealed in March 2021 to have borrowed $850 million from Greensill Capital, a U.K. based lender that has filed for insolvency."" (An earlier Forbes article provided more detail on how Justice lost his billionaire status.) Forbes is widely considered the main source for information on the holdings of wealthy Americans because such data is generally not public and requires journalistic digging and estimation. So it’s reasonable for Gura to point to sourcing in Forbes for this particular statistic. Justice’s family has long been involved in businesses ranging from coal to farming to timber, and he expanded them when he took over. Justice also purchased the Greenbrier resort in his home state in 2009. By the time he won the governorship in 2016 (as a Democrat, before switching parties in 2017), Justice was running some 100 different companies. But Justice’s coal business has faced financial challenges as coal has suffered from a combination of competition from natural gas and decisions by utilities to phase out coal generation over concerns about carbon emissions and their role in climate change. Justice has also grappled with a torrent of lawsuits and legal penalties. PolitiFact West Virginia has reported that Justice has been sued at least 600 times for not paying his bills. There were at least 32 specific lawsuits in which Justice’s companies have come to owe $500,000 (Justice’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) In its most recent wealth rankings, Forbes estimated Justice’s net worth at $503.4 million as of Nov. 9, so by their data, he has not regained his billionaire status. The financial holdings of the wealthy can change on a moment-to-moment basis due to volatility in stock valuations, so it’s conceivable that the value of Justice’s holdings could once again exceed the $1 billion mark. Gura said, ""FUN FACT: West Virginia is home to zero billionaires."" Forbes, the entity that most closely tracks the wealth of the richest Americans, wrote in April that Justice had recently fallen out of the billionaire’s club, and that the state has no other billionaires. And the most recent estimate by Forbes pegged Justice’s net worth at barely over half a billion. So Gura’s statement is correct. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C24CEC0>],/factchecks/2021/nov/09/david-gura/west-virginia-home-zero-billionaires/

But an unfounded conspiracy theory is spreading online that says the deaths that night were part of a satanic ritual.  ""The concert last night was a straight up satanic ritual and Scott didn’t even stop playing as people were dying and chaos broke out,"" one Facebook post claimed.   ""8 people were killed at Travis Scott Astroworld Satanic concert,"" another post said.   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The conspiracy theory has gained traction among some people on TikTok and believers of the QAnon movement, the Daily Beast reported. But it has no credible basis. The Chronicle reported that while much is still unknown, police and fire officials said a massive crowd started surging toward the stage around 9 p.m. leaving some panicked, struggling to breathe or underfoot, after they fell.  Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said ""a criminal investigation"" into the incident is underway. Live Nation, which produced the festival, has a history of safety violations, according to the Chronicle, and has previously been sued over injuries at previous events. Houston officials and concert organizers also anticipated that the crowd could be difficult to control, the New York Times reported. They added dozens more Houston police officers and private security hired by Live Nation.  Experts who have studied deaths caused by crowd surges found they often happen when too many people are in too small a space, according to the Associated Press. ""When a crowd surges, the force can be strong enough to bend steel,"" the AP said. ""It can also hit people from two directions: one from the rear of the crowd pushing forward and another from the front of the crowd trying to escape. If some people have fallen, causing a pileup, pressure can even come from above. Caught in the middle are people’s lungs""   Like the Houston Chronicle, the AP and the Times — or any other credible news organization — didn’t report on any evidence of a satanic ritual at Astroworld.

Kleefisch misses mark with claim that the FBI will be targeting parents on critical race theory
","School boards have increasingly found themselves at the center of controversy as national debates on pandemic protocols and teaching about the harms of systemic racism trickle down to the local level. In particular, critical race theory — a decades-old academic concept that argues racism is embedded into American systems and institutions, creating disadvantages for people of color — is in the spotlight. It’s a topic typically addressed at the college level, since it focuses on how laws are interpreted. Educational experts say the phrase is being used much more broadly in the current debate as a catch-all for any teaching about race, equity, diversity and history. But is the FBI targeting conservative parents who speak out against CRT? That was the claim from Rebecca Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor aiming to be Wisconsin’s Republican gubernatorial nominee in 2022, in an Oct. 23 , 2021 campaign email: ""It’s truly despicable that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ Department of ‘Justice’ would use the FBI to target parents who speak out against critical race theory,"" she wrote. But parents who are simply speaking out aren’t who the bureau seeks to hold accountable. Let’s take a closer look. The debates over CRT and masking have caught fire as much in Wisconsin as anywhere else. The state has logged more recall attempts of school board members than any state in the nation besides California. But in some places, protests have morphed into more dangerous situations. The National School Boards Association said in a Sept. 29 letter to President Joe Biden that school board members and school officials needed protection against threats and acts of violence that have cropped up amid arguments about critical race theory and mask mandates. They cited a variety of incidents, including a northern Virginia school board meeting where board members received death threats and a person was injured during the meeting’s chaotic public comment section. Meanwhile, an Illinois man who was arrested after striking a school official during a school board meeting there. Soon after the letter was sent, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered the FBI to help tamp down criminal conduct directed at school district personnel. An Oct. 4 memo from the Department of Justice states that the department will form a task force to examine how federal enforcement tools could be used to prosecute such crimes and how to assist local law enforcement if violent threats didn’t constitute federal crimes. The department also plans to create specialized training for school district administrators to recognize threats and report them, the memo says. Conservative politicians and commentators, including Kleefisch, seized on the directive as what they viewed as an infringement of parents’ free speech at school board meetings. When asked about Kleefisch’s claim, campaign manager Charles Nichols sent the letter from the school boards association and the Justice Department’s memo. ""When they talk of prosecuting individuals, they are referring to the parents who are protesting school boards — protests that, according to the NASB’s letter, were occurring because of anger over critical race theory,"" Nichols wrote. ""Obviously real criminal conduct and violence is never OK, but referring to parent protests at board meetings as ‘criminal conduct’ is more than just over the top, it’s insulting and wrong."" But the directive doesn’t say to specifically look for parents who are talking about critical race theory, nor was that the only root of the threats mentioned in the association’s letter. And nowhere has Garland or the FBI equated general protests with individuals who have made violent threats. In his original memo to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, Garland wrote that ""spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution,"" but ""that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views."" The actions of parents who show up to simply speak out against critical race theory, then, as Kleefisch mentioned, would seem to fall into the area of spirited debate, which is of course protected by the First Amendment. Parents who make threats of violence at meetings or elsewhere, however, would not be protected. In October, PolitiFact National rated False a claim by U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., after he similarly argued that Garland wanted the FBI to target parents who speak out ""to protect kids from radical curriculum like critical race theory."" One law professor interviewed for the story did say there was a risk Garland’s effort to weed out harassment and intimidation could be applied too broadly. Three others noted Garland specifically mentioned that spirited debate is protected and found nothing in the memo that signals he’ll seek overly broad enforcement. ""If the Justice Department tried to stretch intimidation to cover any hostile speech, they should lose, and almost certainly would lose"" in a court of law, law professor Douglas Laycock at the University of Virginia School of Law told PolitiFact National. Laycock voiced no opinion on Garland’s memo itself. In response to our request, Nichols also sent a second letter from the school boards association to its members, apologizing for its initial letter and voicing regret for ""some of the language"" included in that letter — though it did not say to which language it was referring. That apology reignited the issue among national Republican lawmakers, who viewed it as a retraction and questioned Garland about it Oct. 27, 2021. But the association did not retract its request for federal assistance in the face of threats, and the apology letter doesn’t affect the scope of what Garland told the FBI to look for. In a campaign email, Kleefisch claimed the Justice Department told the FBI to target parents who speak out against critical race theory. But the memo outlining what would take place indicated the bureau will aim to curb violent threats and criminal conduct, not anyone who publicly criticizes critical race theory. What’s more, the initial letter from the school boards association didn’t seek federal help only to protect against threats from critical race theory critics. The group sought protection for any threats, no matter what prompted them. We rate this claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097181E00>],/factchecks/2021/nov/09/rebecca-kleefisch/kleefisch-misses-mark-claim-fbi-parents-and-critic/

The measure, which includes more than $500 billion in new spending plus additional money from reallocated funds, has already passed the Senate and now heads to Biden’s desk for his signature. When the House voted, six progressive Democrats opposed it, which would have been enough to tank the bill had 13 Republicans not crossed party lines to vote with most Democrats. (In the earlier Senate vote, 19 Republicans joined all of the chamber’s Democrats in supporting the bill.) One Republican who voted against the infrastructure bill was freshman Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich. She took to Twitter on Nov. 6. to explain her vote: ""While you were sleeping, the Democrats passed their ‘infrastructure’ bill. I voted no because it is filled with pork & only 10% is actual infrastructure. Michigan’s roads and bridges need repairs, but the wasteful spending in this bill will harm America for generations to come."" While you were sleeping, the Democrats passed their “infrastructure” bill. I voted no because it is filled with pork & only 10% is actual infrastructure. Michigan’s roads and bridges need repairs, but the wasteful spending in this bill will harm America for generations to come. Saying that just 10% of the bill is ""actual infrastructure"" is ridiculously off-base. When Biden first proposed what would eventually become the infrastructure bill in April, we gave a Pants on Fire rating to Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., for saying ""something less than 6%"" of the proposal ""is actually focused on infrastructure.""  The figure Cheney cited applied to spending on roads, bridges and highways but excluded items in Biden’s proposal that are widely considered to be infrastructure, including public transit, rail, airports, ports, waterways, the electrical grid, drinking water systems and broadband. (Cheney voted against the infrastructure bill when it came up in the House.) McClain’s statement is, if anything, more inaccurate than Cheney’s, because several large elements of the original proposal that had the weakest claims to be considered ""infrastructure"" were stricken from the bill that passed both chambers. (McClain’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) This transformation of the bill happened because Biden and congressional leaders decided to seek bipartisan buy-in for a pure infrastructure bill and then vote separately on a set of safety-net measures that are more polarizing between the parties. For instance, when Cheney made her statement, Biden was seeking $400 billion for expanding access to long-term, home and community-based care under Medicaid. That never made it into the bill that passed both chambers.  Other elements of Biden’s original plan fell into a gray area, fitting under some definitions of infrastructure but not others. These included $590 billion for research and development and domestic manufacturing; $400 billion in clean energy tax credits; and $328 billion for capital investments in housing, schools, child care centers, veterans hospitals and other federal buildings. But these did not make it into the final infrastructure bill. Instead, the bill that passed the House and Senate consisted almost entirely of traditional infrastructure provisions.  Here’s one categorization by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent group that scrutinizes federal spending. • Roads, bridges and major projects: $110 billion
• Passenger and freight rail: $66 billion
• Public transit: $39 billion
• Airports: $25 billion
• Ports and waterways: $17 billion
• Electric vehicles: $15 billion
• Road safety: $11 billion
• Reconnecting communities: $1 billion
• Electricity infrastructure: $73 billion
• Broadband: $65 billion
• Water infrastructure, including lead pipe replacement: $55 billion
• Resiliency and Western water storage: $50 billion
• Environmental remediation: $21 billion Total: $548 billion A few of these categories might be called infrastructure-adjacent rather than pure infrastructure, such as road safety and environmental remediation. But even if you set those two categories aside, roughly 94% of the spending is allocated to categories that are pretty clearly infrastructure — not the 10% McClain said. The bill will provide McClain’s home state of Michigan $7.3 billion for highway repairs and more than $500 million for bridge work over the next five years, the Detroit Free Press reported.  Funding for airports, ports, waterways, broadband, the electric grid, and drinking water systems are ""not only infrastructure but critical infrastructure,"" Robert Greer, an associate professor in public service and administration at the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government and Public Service, told PolitiFact for our April article. Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, agreed. ""There is no reason to exclude traditional infrastructure categories — transportation, water resources, energy, and telecommunications — when assessing"" Biden’s agenda, Tomer told us in April. ""For decades, and in some cases centuries, the federal government has supported direct investment in these physical capital systems and related policies like workforce development and planning grants."" McClain said that in the infrastructure bill that just passed the House, ""only 10% is actual infrastructure."" This is a version of a Republican talking point that was inaccurate months ago and has been rendered even more inaccurate since then. Because Biden and congressional Democrats split their agenda into an infrastructure-only bill and a separate measure that dealt with social safety net spending, the bill that passed the House was almost entirely pure infrastructure spending.

Fox says live reporting of Va. governor election turnout tallies not manipulated
","Late on Nov. 2, as vote totals were tallied and reported in the tight governor’s race in Virginia, social media posts emerged claiming that the election results were being manipulated. One allegation was made in a since-deleted Instagram post that showed two still images from Fox News coverage. Arrows were added pointing to the percentages of how much of the vote had been counted in the race.  The top image, at 10:55 p.m. CT, showed 97% of the vote in; the bottom image, six minutes later, showed 94%. In both images, Republican Glenn Youngkin was shown leading Democrat Terry McAuliffe, 51.2% to 48.1%.  ""WTF IS THIS CRAP!?"" the poster wrote. Commenters alleged fraud and cheating. Similar claims were made on Twitter, citing Fox News and New York Times reports. Users questioned whether the results were being manipulated by election officials, or by Fox or the Times. ""Fox News went from 97% reporting to 94% in Virginia. The fraud is so blatant it's not funny anymore,"" a user tweeted. According to Fox News, the change was due simply to the way the network estimated turnout. About 12:20 a.m. on Nov. 3, Fox News anchor Bret Baier said on the air: ""I’m getting a lot of emails and messages about our screen there that went from 97% to 95%, and I asked those questions to the decision desk and ""basically, the answer is, the expected vote number is an estimate and the turnouts in some of these areas were greater than expected.""  Baier then turned to Fox anchor Bill Hemmer, who was standing in front of an interactive map in which some vote turnout percentages were labeled as estimates. Hemmer said the turnout estimates are ""based on the numbers for the governor’s race from four years ago. So, that’s factored in this equation, and when you do get a big turnout, it’s hard to know, who’s doing early vote by mail, it’s hard to know who showed up on election day. But that helps explain where the estimates are….We don’t know how much of a vote is out there."" Fox News uses its own estimates to predict turnout percentage, rather than using an older model that gives the percentage of precincts reporting in a given geographic area. Arnon Mishkin explained the model in an election forum prior to the 2020 election. (Factcheckers at Reuters recently highlighted the video of Mishkin explaining the model in their report on the same issue.)  The Associated Press declared Youngkin the winner at 10:37 p.m. CT on Nov. 2. Unofficial results the next morning from the Virginia Department of Elections showed Youngkin winning, 50.68% to 48.55%.

7 states ban atheists from public office, but Supreme Court ruling make those bans unenforceable
","It’s pretty rare to find an openly atheist politician in the United States. According to the Pew Research Center, there is only one current member of Congress, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was listed as unaffiliated with a religion. Atheists are certainly free to run for Congress, but a recent social media post said they ""are prohibited from holding office in 8 states."" The states highlighted in an accompanying U.S. map are Arkansas, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.S. Constitution states in Article 6 that ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" And yet seven of the states mentioned in the post have language in their constitutions explicitly prohibiting atheists from holding office. Mississippi’s constitution, for example, states that ""No person who denies the existence of a Supreme Being shall hold any office in this state."" In Pennsylvania, the eighth state noted in the post, the rule is not as clear cut. And the post leaves out some important context: The bans are unenforceable because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In 1961, the Supreme Court ruled in Torcaso v. Watkins that a person could not be denied the office of notary public for not being a believer because it ""unconstitutionally invades his freedom of belief and religion guaranteed by the First Amendment and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the States."" Since that ruling, those state bans have been rarely invoked, legal experts told The New York Times in 2014. The story cited cases in South Carolina and North Carolina, in which parties seeking to enforce the ban lost in court. The group American Atheists said in 2014 that the issue also came up in a Texas city council race. In Pennsylvania, there is no prohibition on atheists running for office in the state constitution, which says, ""No person who acknowledges the being of a God and a future state of rewards and punishments shall, on account of his religious sentiments, be disqualified to hold any office or place of trust or profit under this Commonwealth."" A Washington Post story counts the Keystone State as one of eight states with restrictions on atheists holding office. But it notes that Pennsylvania differs from the other seven states in that its rule is that believers can’t be disqualified from office but says nothing about atheists. While seven states still have clear language in their constitutions banning atheists from holding public office, Pennsylvania’s constitution isn’t as clear cut. Regardless, the bans are likely unenforceable and rarely attempted since a 1961 Supreme Court ruling on the matter. The statement in the Instagram post is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Rep. Sandra Williams says 99.97 percent of Cleveland public schoolchildren live in poverty
","
It is an unfortunate but well known fact that the city of Cleveland owns one of the highest poverty rates for any big city in the United States. At 34 percent, Cleveland is the third poorest for cities with a population of at least 200,000 people, behind Detroit and San Bernardino, Calif., according to 2010 U.S. Census data. And about 53 percent of all people under 18 in Cleveland live in poverty.

Still, a recent comment by state Rep. Sandra Williams, a Cleveland Democrat who represents one of the poorest areas of the city, was startling.

During a news conference at the Statehouse on March 21 to express support for legislation that would revamp how the Cleveland Metropolitan School District operates, Williams rattled off a list of disturbing traits for students studying in schools with subpar academic performance. She also noted poverty as a factor.

""So, the fact is, 31,000 kids in failing schools, 99.97 percent of the kids live in poverty that attend Cleveland public schools,"" Williams said. ""The district is majority African-American. And the 11th House district that includes most of the Cleveland public school system is the poorest district in the state of Ohio.""

PolitiFact Ohio thought that the claim that essentially every student who attends a Cleveland public school lives in poverty was worth a check.

The 31,000 figure is for students attending Cleveland schools that individually have been rated as academic watch or academic emergency buildings. But the district has roughly 42,000 students and if Williams’ figure is correct, all but about 13 of those students are poor. It seems to be a stretch, even for a city and school district racked with poverty.

Williams told Politifact Ohio that she got the figure from notes provided by Cleveland schools CEO Eric Gordon in preparation for the news conference. The school district said it doesn’t recall giving Williams such an exact percentage but that it believes the state lawmaker is close. The Ohio Department of Education, which also keeps similar statistics for every district in the state, says its numbers are similar to Williams’ but also not exact.

So what gives?

Because it has so many students who for so long have come from impoverished families, the district in 1999 began applying a federal provision allowing it to essentially claim its entire student population as eligible for free and reduced meals. The federal government agreed that it would be more cost efficient by saving on mountainous paperwork for the district to be able to claim 100 percent poverty.

The criteria for that provision requires the district to have at least 80 percent of its students qualifying for the free meals. To qualify for the free meals, students had to come from poor families based upon government income guidelines. The district continues to use the designation which is renewable every four years.
""When you have such a high degree of poverty, (you) are eligible to feed all the students under the free and reduced lunch program rather than to charge fees or reduced fees for the few,"" explained school district spokeswoman Roseann Canfora.

That would mean that the true number of students in poverty attending Cleveland schools is somewhere between 80 and 100 percent. Canfora said the district could not provide an exact percentage.

The state Education Department does its own calculations based on information it receives from the school district, said spokesman Patrick Gallaway. He said the state considered 89 percent of Cleveland students eligible for free and reduced meals for the 2010-11 school year, the most recent data available.

But Gallaway said the state also does a separate poverty calculation it calls the economically disadvantaged flag. By that calculation, Gallaway said the state considers 95 percent of Cleveland schools students living in poverty. The economically disadvantaged number includes students who might not have filed an application for free and reduced meals but are known to come from households that would qualify, perhaps because there is an application on file for a sibling.

""The economically disadvantaged flag is more broad and could capture students who may not be included in the free and reduced totals,"" Gallaway said. ""That is the recommended figure if someone is looking to show the percentage of economically disadvantaged in a district.""

So where does that leave us with Williams’ statement?

The district’s calculation used for determining eligibility for free and reduced-price meals puts the poverty figure somewhere between 80 and 100 percent and guesses the actual number could be in the high 90-percent range.

A separate calculation by the state puts the figure at 95 percent.

Williams is partially accurate. She clearly is correct that poverty is a significant problem in the Cleveland school district. But based on the figures supplied by the school district and the state, it appears Williams’ figure is overstated.

PolitiFact Ohio is not in the business of playing Gotcha! But the difference between Williams’ precise figure and the percentages the state came up with mean that there could be thousands fewer students living in poverty. That’s an important detail.

Her figure of 99.97 percent would mean all but roughly 13 students in the district live in poverty.
If the state’s 95 percent figure is correct, that would mean about 2,100 students are not living in poverty. If the poverty percentage is at 89 percent (the figure the state used  for students eligible for free and reduced meals for the 2010-11 school year), it would mean 4,600 students are not living in poverty.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Williams’ claim rates Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096951040>],/factchecks/2012/apr/10/sandra-williams/rep-sandra-williams-says-9997-percent-cleveland-pu/

Don't call it pink slime, Georgia official says
","
There’s a meaty political campaign going on across the nation with slimy accusations being hurled -- and it has nothing to do with the race for the White House.

It began in earnest April 2, when the governor and lieutenant governor of Iowa sent letters to their colleagues in other states to fight against what they said are media misperceptions about a form of ground beef maliciously maligned as ""pink slime.""

Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black quickly joined the effort to defend this form of beef, holding a news conference two days afterward.

""Lean, finely textured beef is the proper name, and it is a safe, widely used product,"" Black told reporters.

Officials in Kansas and Texas have begun their own public relations campaigns in support of the beef that is a cash cow, pardon the pun, in those states. So, too, has U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor. Proponents say beef prices would rise with less meat on the market.

Although the Department of Agriculture maintains the meat is safe, the federal agency announced in March that it would give schools more beef choices in the wake of public concerns about children eating ""pink slime."" McDonald’s and some major grocery stores have said they will no longer sell the meat. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver last year showed how the meat is made to horrify a studio audience.

""Everything about this process is about no respect for food or people or children,"" he said.

So is it really safe?

First, let’s explain how it is made. The meat is taken from slaughterhouse trimmings with high fat content that are more susceptible to contamination because the meat is often close to the hide, which is highly exposed to fecal matter. The trimmings are warmed to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit  in equipment that looks like a large, high-speed mixing bowl that spins these trimmings to separate meat from the fat that has been liquefied. Ammonium hydroxide is mixed in to destroy bacteria and E. coli that could make someone ill if a raw product is not cooked thoroughly. It is then mixed with regular ground beef. The federal government has approved the practice for slightly more than a decade.

The use of this meat gained national attention in recent months when a blogger who writes about kids’ food began an online petition to urge federal officials to remove it from school cafeterias.

It may sound disgusting to know that beef contains ammonia, but the companies that produce the beef and experts say ammonia hydroxide is used in other foods such as cheese and chocolate to reduce acidity and kill bacteria.

The beef is produced by a handful of companies nationwide. Federal officials inspect the process daily.

Because this type of beef is not mentioned in packaging, there’s been little discussion about it or its safety. The New York Times, however, reported in late 2009 that E. coli was detected three times and salmonella 48 times, including back-to-back incidents in August in which two 27,000-pound batches were found to be contaminated. The meat in question, produced by the nation’s largest distributor of the product, Beef Products Inc., was caught before reaching lunchroom trays. BPI told the Times it found E. coli in what was described as a low 0.06 percent of samples that year.

The Times also reported that from 2005 to 2009, BPI had a rate of 36 positive results for salmonella per 1,000 tests, compared with a rate of nine positive results per 1,000 tests for the other suppliers, according to statistics from the program. BPI said its testing regime was more likely to detect contamination.

Some federal officials were concerned that the beef hadn’t been studied enough before it was approved. The Times reported that one federal microbiologist, Gerald Zirnstein, called the processed beef ""pink slime"" in a 2002 email to colleagues.

A University of Arkansas student did a study of the beef last year. The student, Courtney Moon, found the beef held up better than regular ground beef.

""I was surprised,"" Jason Apple, a meat science professor at the school, said in a news release sent by the university. ""I just assumed the lean beef trim would negatively impact the quality of the burgers, but it actually made them better in this study.""

Researchers at other colleges have come forward in recent days offering similar conclusions.

We were curious whether this beef was sold in other parts of the globe. A Canadian government health spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the country does not allow ammonia to be used in ground beef during production nor does it allow such food to be sold there. Ammonium hydroxide would be considered a food additive and require a safety evaluation, the official said.

""Only if a safety evaluation identified no safety concerns would the requested use be considered for approval,"" Olivia Caron, a media relations official for Health Canada, said via email.

Interestingly, Caron used ""pink slime"" in the subject line of her email.

Several food safety experts we interviewed were well-versed on the beef treating process and didn’t have what one of them called ""the ick factor"" that many Americans are feeling about it. For the most part, they consider it safe to eat. The main problem, they said, was the lack of information about the beef provided by manufacturers and the federal government, particularly at a time when Americans want fewer chemicals and preservatives in their food.

""Right now, we’re in a situation where you don’t know, and that’s why people are so infuriated,"" said Michael Batz, executive director of the Food Safety Research Consortium. ""The lack of disclosure and the lack of transparency is very troubling.""

The USDA recently gave meat processors and supermarkets the option to put labels on ground beef packages identifying it as ""lean finely textured beef.""

So where does this leave us?

It is correct that the meat is called lean, finely textured beef and it has been widely used in fast-food restaurants and school cafeterias, and is sold in stores. But is it safe?

The federal government says it’s safe. So do some state officials. Some research has concluded it is safe. Still, there are reasons for concern, such as those listed in the 2009 New York Times report. We also find it interesting that our neighbor to the north, Canada, has not permitted the beef to be sold there.

With those caveats, we rate Black’s entire statement that the beef is safe as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970BFFC0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/10/gary-black/dont-call-it-pink-slime-georgia-official-says/

Vice President Joe Biden says, 'General Motors is the largest corporation in the world'
","
Vice President Joe Biden declared General Motors ""the largest corporation in the world"" in an April 1, 2012, interview on Face the Nation.

It was no April Fool’s joke.

We knew GM’s auto sales were back on top in 2011 — aided by its joint ventures in China and a tsunami-burdened Toyota — but the world’s largest corporation? We just had to check.

(Hat-tip to a reader who asked us whether he was right, emailing a a Fox News piece by Karl Rove that took Biden to task. Email, Twitter, Facebook — send claims our way!)

Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer had asked Biden to respond to comments by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney that President Barack Obama’s term had ""been a failure.""

Biden declared the former Massachusetts governor  ""a little out of touch.""
  
""Look, you know, everything that he said, the American people don't think the policies have worked. Romney argued about let — not an exact quote — but let Detroit go bankrupt. Wasn't very popular action the president took. Now they're hiring people. You know, hundreds of thousands of new people instead of losing 400,000 jobs. General Motors is the largest corporation in the world again."" 

Romney had argued for a managed bankruptcy instead of a government-aided turnaround. Detroit automakers are hiring again. But the claim that GM ""is the largest corporation in the world again""? It’s not.

Top companies lists

Fortune and Forbes both annually rank the world’s largest companies.

The Fortune Global 500 ranks them by total revenues. The Forbes Global 2000 ranks them by sales, profit, assets and market value.

GM didn’t make the top of either list last year.

Not even among automakers. Or among U.S. companies starting with the word, ""General."" Toyota and Volkswagen both beat out GM on the Fortune list. They were No. 8 and No. 13.

GM was No. 20. (That other American institution, General Electric? No. 16.)

On the broader-based Forbes list, Volkswagen weighed in at No. 24. Daimler (think Mercedes-Benz) hit No. 43. Ford and Toyota ranked No. 54 and No. 55.

General Motors trailed at No. 61. (General Electric? No. 3.)

When Forbes broke out its rankings by category, GM didn’t lead any of them. Rather, it was:

• No. 18 in sales
• No. 70 in profit
• No. 155 in assets
• No. 148 in market value

Our ruling

Biden may have been reaching for a different statistic — that GM’s sales led other automakers in 2011, subject to a few caveats. But he didn’t say that. He said, ""General Motors is the largest corporation in the world again."" Surely the vice president of the United States can pick his words more carefully.

25-year-old congressional candidate Weston Wamp says average age of a Congressman is 57
","
Age equals wisdom, or so the saying goes. So what do you do if you’re a young guy running for Congress?

Weston Wamp, a 25-year-old Republican candidate for the U.S. House in Tennessee’s 3rd Congressional District, is trying to convince voters that his youth will be an asset in a Congress where seniority rules.

Wamp is running for the House seat held for 16 years by his father, Zach Wamp, who retired from Congress in 2010 after an unsuccessful run for governor.

Weston Wamp’s campaign web site portrays him as a ""young entrepreneur"" and a member of the ""debt-paying generation"" who has a broad understanding of the world and business. He also says he knows a thing or two about politics, having grown up ""at the feet"" of many national leaders in politics and business during his father’s congressional career. One of his underlying campaign themes seems to be that there’s a serious need for some new blood in Washington.

""Of the 435 members of the House of Representatives, only two were born in the 1980s,"" noted a recent press release from his campaign.  ""The average age of members of the House of Representatives is 57 years old.""

We knew firsthand that both the House and the Senate are filled with gray-hairs, but we wondered if the average age in the House is really that high.

We contacted Wamp’s spokeswoman, Bonnie Brezina, and asked for the source of that information. She said she wasn’t sure, but she’d get back to us. She didn’t, so we did a little digging of our own.

Turns out, young Wamp is correct. The average age of U.S. House members is 57.44, according to Congressional Quarterly, a publication that provides news and analysis about Congress.

""That takes into account the current makeup of the House – not when it convened in January,"" said David Meyers, CQ’s managing editor of member information and research.

Three of the 435 House seats are currently vacant, so the average age could go up or down slightly once those three seats are filled.

The average age of the Senate’s 100 members as of January 2011 was 61.5, according to the Senate Historical Office.

Wamp also was right on another front: Only two House members – U.S. Reps. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., and Justin Amash, R-Mich. -- were born in 1980 or later. Schock is 30; Amash is 31.

Other publications have noted the advanced age of Congress. When President Barack Obama entered the White House in January 2009, USA Today reported that Obama – one of the nation’s youngest presidents – would be working with the nation’s oldest Congress.

When Obama took the oath of office, the average age was 57 in the House and 63 in the Senate, the paper said. In each case, it was the highest on record.

Our ruling

We won’t attempt to fact-check the argument that age equals wisdom. But on Wamp’s claim that the average age of House members is 57, the young Republican is correct and earns a True rating on the Truth-o-Meter.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D03E00>],/factchecks/2012/apr/09/weston-wamp/25-year-old-congressional-candidate-weston-wamp-sa/

Barack Obama ad says U.S. oil production is at eight-year high
","
President Barack Obama is firing back at criticism of his energy policies with a television campaign ad airing in Virginia and many other states.

""Under President Obama, domestic oil production is at an eight-year high,"" the announcer intones as charts appear on the screen. The commercial says ""Big Oil"" is against Obama because he wants to take away its tax breaks and supports development of alternative fuels. It says Mitt Romney, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, backs the oil companies’ positions.

The ad makes a number of claims, but here we’ll focus on the assertion that, under Obama, American oil production is at an eight-year high.

The PolitiFact national staff examined a similar statement in January, made in the president’s State of the Union address, and rated it Mostly True. We’ll update the assessment based on some new data.

We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said ""oil production,"" we looked at crude oil extracted from U.S. territory.

Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:

2003: 2,073,453,000
2004: 1,983,302,000
2005: 1,890,106,000
2006: 1,862,259,000
2007: 1,848,450,000
2008: 1,811,817,000
2009: 1,956,596,000
2010: 2,000,521,000
2011: 2,065,366,000

The data shows that domestic oil production is in fact at its highest level in eight years. Obama campaign claims. Only one month of statistics is available for 2012. They show that in January, the U.S. produced 188.9 million barrels of oil, the largest monthly output since August 1998.

Although the numbers are rising, production levels actually have remained pretty stable over the last nine years. Last year’s output was only 14 percent higher than the lowest year during that span.  So the increase the Obama campaign cites is not particularly dramatic. In addition, levels of production were typically higher from the 1950s to the 1990s.

Does Obama deserve credit for the recent increase?

Federal lands, which the president controls, produced 31.8 percent of domestic oil last year, slightly below the nine-year average of 33.4 percent, according to an EIA report. The increase in production last year came on state and privately-owned lands, which yielded almost 150 million barrels more than 2010. In contrast, 2011 production on federal lands dropped by 83 million from a nine-year high mark achieved in 2010.

Federal lands yielded 646 million barrels of oil in 2011, almost exactly the nine-year average. But production on federal land has remained steadily above the low-mark of 575 million barrels in 2008, the last year of the Bush administration.

Our ruling

Obama’s commercial is accurate in saying domestic oil production is at its highest level in eight years. The suggestion of the ad, however, overstates the administration’s role in achieving these results. Much of the increase in production during under Obama has come from state and private lands that the president does not control.

"['LGBTQ', 'Marriage', 'Florida', 'Vern Buchanan']","
Vern Buchanan says Obama will no longer ""enforce"" DOMA
","
The Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that fights for the rights of gays and lesbians, has targeted U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., for his statements on the Defense of Marriage Act.

In a mailer, Buchanan said that ""the Obama administration recently announced it will no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.""

The Human Rights Campaign said that was wrong.

""While President Obama announced last year that his administration believed the law to be unconstitutional and could not continue to defend it in court, he also made clear that the law would continue to be enforced unless struck down or repealed,"" said the HRC.

The act, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996, says states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, and that the federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage. Obama promised to repeal DOMA during his 2008 campaign.

The HRC sent a press release on March 14, 2012, claiming that a Buchanan mailer mischaracterized the status of DOMA. The HRC said they received the mailer recently, but staff at Buchanan’s office told us the mailer was a year old. They also said Buchanan, who represents the Sarasota area, stood by the statements.

Was Buchanan correct to state that the Obama administration recently announced it would no longer enforce DOMA, or was he wrong, as the HRC suggested?

DOMA status

In February 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying that the Obama administration would no longer defend the law -- in court.

Holder argued that the law, as applied to same-sex couples legally married under state law, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. While the letter stated that the Obama administration would not defend the law in two cases, it also stated that it will continue to be ""enforced"" by the executive branch until Congress repeals it, or the courts definitively strike it down.

The law will still be defended, though. A group of House leaders directed the House general counsel to defend DOMA -- the initial contract with a law firm was for $500,000 and later amended for up to $1.5 million.

In response to our questions, the U.S. Department of Justice sent us a letter Holder wrote to Boehner in February 2012 related to a case in which military personnel were seeking benefits for same-sex spouses. Holder wrote that though DOMA is unconstitutional, the executive branch will continue to enforce a federal law that pertains to the military that defines spouses as opposite sex.

According to the Service Members Legal Defense Network, which is working on the plaintiffs’ side, although DOJ is not defending the suit, the plaintiffs and other gay and lesbian military families are not getting the same benefits as their straight married peers.

In October 2011 the department announced some benefits where members may designate beneficiaries of their choosing, regardless of sexual orientation. But Department of Defense spokeswoman Eileen Lainez said that the eligibility for a number of benefits is restricted by several statutes including DOMA.

Obama has repeatedly said that his administration would no longer defend DOMA in the courts, but he distinguished between defending in the courts and enforcement during a Sept. 28, 2011, roundtable discussion with reporters.

""Administratively, we can't ignore the law. DOMA is still on the books,"" Obama said. ""What we have said is even as we enforce it, we don't support it, we think it's unconstitutional. The position that my administration has taken I think will have a significant influence on the court as it examines the constitutionality of this law.""

HRC gave us two examples of how DOMA remains enforced. The Internal Revenue Service will not allow legally married same-sex couples to file jointly, and the Social Security Administration will not provide survivors benefits to a surviving same-sex spouse. We confirmed this with the two agencies.

On the other hand, Buchanan spokesman Max Goodman cited examples of where the administration’s announcement -- or Holder’s direct action -- influenced courts to halt deportation of illegal immigrants, which he counted as a lack of enforcement.

• In March 2011, the deportation case of Monica Alcota was put on hold. Alcota overstayed her tourist visa from Argentina and married a woman in Connecticut. The couple’s attorney said the judge and government attorneys agreed to the action for several reasons, including Obama’s direction to not defend DOMA. A judge later dismissed her case.

• In May 2011, Holder vacated a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals in the case of Paul Wilson Dorman, a gay man from Ireland cleared for deportation after the judges ruled against the man on the basis of DOMA. Holder asked the board to determine whether the man, who had a civil union in New Jersey, could be considered a spouse under New Jersey law. The case remains pending.

•  An immigration judge in Newark suspended a deportation in the case of Henry Velandia in May 2011 citing the action that Holder took in the Dorman case. Velandia, from Venezuela, had married a man in Connecticut. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement later decided that it would no longer pursue deportation.

Buchanan’s office also pointed to comments made by constitutional scholars such as Ed Whelan, who worked for the U.S. Department of Justice from 2001 to 2004. Whelan testified about DOMA before the House in 2011 and is now the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank.

""The executive branch’s defense of a law in court is an essential part of enforcement, not something separate from enforcement,"" Whelan told PolitiFact in an email.

""Might it have been better if Rep. Buchanan’s statement had said: ‘The Obama administration recently announced that it would no longer enforce in court the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman’? Perhaps. But as this tweak illustrates, there is no problem with his use of the word ‘enforce’ (rather than ‘defend’).""

We decided to run the statement by a few other legal experts not involved in the cases

Even though the president takes an oath to support the Constitution, the president can take a position on whether a particular statute is unconstitutional, said Stephen Schnably, a constitutional law professor at University of Miami. If he finds that it is unconstitutional, there’s an argument that the president’s duty bars him from defending it in court.

DOMA raises the unanswered question of whether Obama and his administration have the legal right to choose which of Congress’ laws they defend and which ones they don’t -- a question before the U.S. Supreme Court in a separate case, said Bob Jarvis, a constitutional law professor at Nova Southeastern University.

""One could certainly say that any failure to compel obedience to DOMA is a failure to enforce it,"" Jarvis said via email. ""On the other hand, one could also say that a failure to defend a law in court is different from a failure to enforce it in everyday life.""

Peter Edelman, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown, said there’s a difference between deciding not to defend the constitutionality of a law and failing to enforce it.

""It is a significant step in and of itself, but it is not the same as not enforcing the law,"" he said.

Our ruling

Buchanan said in a mailer that the Obama administration  ""would no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)."" The Obama administration said in February 2011 it would no longer defend the law in the courts. But the HRC cites examples that enforcement continues -- for example, gay couples can’t file their taxes jointly. We found legal experts who made arguments on both sides about whether not defending DOMA in the courts equals not enforcing it.

If Buchanan had said that Obama would no longer ""defend"" DOMA he’d be on safe ground, but he chose ""enforce"" instead. The Obama administration is enforcing the law to some extent, such as forbidding joint tax returns or survivors’ benefits in Social Security for gay couples. Still, there’s clear evidence that the Obama administration is seeking to mitigate the law’s effects. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF4500>],/factchecks/2012/apr/09/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-says-obama-will-no-longer-enforce/
"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says Wisconsin gave every public employee the ability to choose whether they want to be in a union
","
As he prepares for a recall election, Republican Gov. Scott Walker is defending his record in various media appearances.

In a March 19, 2012 appearance on Fox News, Walker told talk host Greta Van Susteren that big out-of-state unions were behind the protests in Madison last spring -- and are leading the recall effort against him now.

""The national unions, for them, this is all about the money,"" Walker said.

""It’s not just about the budget or collective bargaining. We gave nearly every, well, we gave every public employee in the state the freedom to choose whether or not they want to be in a union or not and I think that’s really why this is a Waterloo for them.""

That caught our attention.

One of the most controversial aspects of Walker’s law stripping collective bargaining for public workers was who the bill did not cover: Police and firefighter union members.

The law limits the ability of public unions to bargain collectively for anything except raises controlled for inflation. It ended bargaining over benefits, overtime and work conditions. It also required annual union recertification votes and made payment of union dues optional.

The governor got the crux of the new law right -- that state workers could opt out of paying dues and each year the unions would face a recertification vote. Some unions chose to fold rather than be subjected to the annual effort.

But Walker said the new law applied to ""all"" state workers.

The law also mandated that local employees participating in the state pension and health systems contribute at least 12.6 percent of their health care premiums and at least 5.8 percent of their salary toward their pension. Again, this did not apply to police and firefighters.

At the time the law was passed, Walker said he did not include police and firefighters in the changes so there was no question that law enforcement would be available in the event of strikes or work stoppages.

We asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews about the governor’s characterization of the law.

She acknowledged Walker did not mention the police and firefighter exemptions and said the governor was speaking in generalities for a national audience and didn’t have time to be more specific.

""He was attempting to give the viewers outside of the state of Wisconsin an idea of how things shaped up here,"" Matthews said.

Matthews added that Walker might have given a shorthand answer because he felt rushed: ""I think from a contextural standpoint, Greta tends to be a quick interviewer.""

Walker was interviewed by Van Susteren in person in a Milwaukee studio. It lasted 16 minutes and included asking him respond to a previously recorded interview with Madison firefighters union president Mahlon Mitchell, who is running for lieutenant governor in the recall election.

What about Waterloo?

Walker’s statement also prompted us to dust off our history books. He’s not the first politician to refer to this 200-year-old European battle when it comes to an important election.

But does that match up to history?

The Battle of Waterloo took place June 18, 1815, at the border of France and Belgium and it was Napoleon’s final defeat by a coalition of British, German, Belgium, Dutch and Prussian forces, and the end of his role as Emperor of France. Napoleon attacked the combined forces but wound up losing.

""Waterloo decisively saw the end of 26 years of fighting between the European powers and France. The French star was eclipsed and the German began its ascendancy.  For Britain, Waterloo is not just a battle. It is an institution,"" according to Britishbattles.com.

So what does this bloody battle have to do with Wisconsin politics? Not much, according to Matthews.

Walker, she said, was trying to say that the election was an ""all or nothing"" proposition for the unions. The Waterloo details aren’t as important, she said.

Our conclusion

Walker appeared on national TV and discussed the state’s repeal of collective bargaining rights for most public employees. The governor knows the extent of the law, and that it does not cover police and firefighters. Indeed, he started his answer apparently with that in mind: ""We gave nearly every, well, we gave every public employee in the state the freedom to choose whether or not they want to be in a union or not,"" he said.

Walker almost got it right. But he then backed away. And in the course of doing so, he got it wrong. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F9100>],/factchecks/2012/apr/09/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-gave-every-public-/
"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'John Burzichelli']","
John Burzichelli claims Chris Christie relies on more one-time revenues in proposed budget than Jon Corzine's last budget
","
New Jersey has for years patched its budget holes with one-time fixes, mending deficits with temporary tax increases or the use of surplus funds.

Now, Gov. Chris Christie says he is weaning the state off such volatile resources, known as one-shots.

But a Democratic lawmaker tells a different story.

Assemblyman John Burzichelli, who represents parts of Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem counties and serves as deputy speaker, discussed the proposed fiscal year 2013 budget during a March 28 NJTV appearance. He said that ""the use of one-shot monies, which means monies found that are only going to be available one time, are exceeding $600 million dollars in this budget and last year they were $96 million.

""And that's a very dramatic change. So that tells you that the structural work that we're trying to do to keep the budget in balance is still struggling. And when you take advantage of income that is only coming one time the next year you have to find a way to replace that or you have to take other drastic steps,"" Burzichelli said, adding ""that the use of that, what is called one-shots, is a 500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget.""

New Jersey Treasury Department documents show the state used $3.82 billion in one-shots in fiscal year 2010, the last budget former Gov. Jon Corzine signed. Christie’s 2013 budget proposal includes $1.64 billion in such revenues.

That’s a decrease, not a 500 percent increase, as Burzichelli claims. So what gives?

Let’s say a family spent less on groceries this year than last year, but spent more on cereal over the same time frame. Overall, the family spent less, even though they spent more on a particular type of food.

That’s essentially how Burzichelli makes his claim. In total, Christie is using fewer one-shots than Corzine. But Christie’s reliance on a specific type of one-shots has increased.

Christie is proposing to use $642.3 million in a type of one-shots called revenue-related initiatives, which includes transfers from funds dedicated for specific purposes, such as clean energy.  That’s an increase of more than 490 percent from the $108.8 million used in fiscal 2010. In the current budget, Christie relied on $96.4 million in similar revenues.

Burzichelli cites some of those figures in the television interview, but he doesn’t explain what they represent.

A spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, Tom Hester, said Burzichelli was referring specifically to revenue-related initiatives. ""It’s that simple. You can read it any way you want, but doing [so] ignores the irresponsible impact of these budget raids,"" he said.

But by focusing only on some one-shots, Burzichelli ignores a larger context.

In total, Corzine’s last spending plan relied on $3.82 billion in one-time revenue resources. In Christie’s proposal, one-time revenue totals $1.64 billion.

Federal stimulus aid inflated the total use of one-time revenues in 2010. But John Sugden, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor’s who wrote a report in February critical of Christie’s proposed budget, said the federal aid is still a source of revenue that will have to be replaced the following fiscal year.

Sugden said in an e-mail that ""the use of non-recurring revenues (one-shots) to fund recurring expenditures, in our view, creates budgetary gaps or shortfalls in the following year regardless of what their source is.""

Our ruling

Burzichelli said the reliance on one-time revenues in the governor’s proposed budget is a ""500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget.""

That’s roughly correct for a particular type of one-shots that includes money diverted from dedicated funds.

But the assemblyman doesn’t make that clear and the state relies on hundreds of millions of dollars in other one-time revenue-generating measures. And, in total, Christie is using less one-time revenue than Corzine.  

Burzichelli’s claim has a hint of truth but cherry-picks statistics and ignores critical context. We rate it Mostly False.

"['Georgia', 'Drugs', 'Marijuana', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal: Fake marijuana use rising, connected to death, violence and ""bodily harm""
","Phony marijuana targeted by recent state legislation sounds worse than the real thing, if you believe Georgia’s governor.

Chase’s Law strengthens a ban on ""synthetic marijuana,"" ground-up plant material laced with chemicals that mimic marijuana. Chase Burnett, the bill’s namesake, was found dead in March in a hot tub at his Fayette County home, a packet of the drugs nearby. He was 16.  

The bill passed with overwhelming support. On March 27, Gov. Nathan Deal signed it into law.

A press release warned of synthetic marijuana’s dangers:

""As the usage has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it,"" it said.

We’ve heard that the drug is nasty stuff. But what’s this about violence, bodily harm and death?

A Deal spokeswoman sent PolitiFact Georgia news stories and poison control data to prove the governor’s point. We also talked to researchers and law enforcement officials and reviewed news stories and scientific studies.

The form of synthetic marijuana that’s sparking so much concern is sold at head shops and gas stations under brand names such as ""Spice"" and ""K2.""  

Georgia made it a felony to manufacture and sell it in 2010. Chase’s Law tries to keep underground chemists from tweaking their recipes to get around state restrictions.  

There’s little scholarly research on the drug, which appears to be new to the U.S.

Federal labs first detected these drugs in November 2008, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The earliest U.S. news story we found about its rising popularity appeared in a Hutchinson  Kan., newspaper in November 2009.

All signs suggest that synthetic marijuana use is increasing dramatically, but data is in short supply.

Workers at the American Association of Poison Control Centers began tracking synthetic marijuana calls in 2010 after they noticed more inquiries, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia.

In 2010, they received 2,906  calls; in 2011, there were 6,959.

About 11 percent of high school seniors reported using synthetic marijuana in the past year, according to 2011 results of an annual survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It was the first time researchers asked about the drug.

Existing data support Deal’s claim that reports of bodily harm have climbed. Georgia Poison Center call data show 10 users were admitted to a hospital’s critical care unit in 2010 after using the drug. Forty-five were admitted in 2011.

Rapid heartbeat, agitation, drowsiness, vomiting, hallucinations and nausea were among the drug’s most common effects, researchers have found.  

Media accounts report drug users injured in car crashes, falls and other accidents -- some fatal.

Whether synthetic marijuana is directly responsible for deaths -- and whether they’re increasing -- is a more complicated issue. We found no published studies on the drug’s lethality, but there have been ""scattered reports of deaths,"" said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan professor who conducted the National Institute on Drug Abuse survey.

A count of news stories suggests there are more deadly cases. But whether the drug is a direct cause or contributing factor is not clear in some instances.

Consider Burnett’s death. Toxicology tests are still in the works. Whether the official cause of death was drowning, the drug or something else is unsettled.

Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told PolitiFact Georgia of two other recent deaths:  We found other accounts of synthetic marijuana-related deaths. For example, a South Carolina coroner ruled that it was directly responsible for the October death of a college basketball player who collapsed during warm-up, according to multiple news accounts.

PolitiFact Georgia found less support for Deal’s claim about violence. We found no published studies on the subject. News stories, however, suggest there’s cause for concern.

For instance: 
To sum up:

Evidence supports Deal’s claim that use of the drug has ""dramatically increased,"" as has synthetic marijuana-related ""bodily harm."" Some evidence suggests that deaths have risen, too.

The link between the drug and violence is less clear. News accounts suggest there is an increase in both, but we found so few cases it’s hard to tell.

Deal’s statement could use clarification. Still, it earns a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FD9FC0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/09/nathan-deal/deal-fake-marijuana-use-rising-connected-death-vio/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Government Regulation', 'Eric Kearney']","
Eric Kearney says a repeal of voter reform legislation that is the target of a referendum would be a first for Ohio
","
A bill to reform Ohio election laws, House Bill 194, has been a consistent source of controversy since it was introduced last year.

The latest flap came on March 28 when the Ohio Senate passed a bill to repeal the law, which Democrats and others have called a ""voter suppression"" bill.

Although they oppose HB 194, largely because it restricts early voting opportunities, Democrats also spoke out against the bill’s repeal because there already is a referendum on HB 194 scheduled for this fall’s ballot.

Sen. Eric Kearney, who leads the Senate’s Democratic caucus, said voters have the right to decide the fate HB 194. He said Republicans were unconstitutionally taking away their right to referendum by repealing the law before the election on Nov. 6.

""This is the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum,"" Kearney, of Cincinnati, said during the floor debate March 28.

The GOP-controlled Senate passed the bill to repeal HB 194 on a party-line vote that day, sending the bill to the House of Representatives for consideration.

Anytime an elected official utters the words ""this is the first time in Ohio history,"" we at PolitiFact Ohio become instantly curious. So we decided to dig into Kearney’s claim.

First, it’s important to recognize that the legislation passed last month, Senate Bill 295, does not directly stop the referendum on HB 194. It essentially nullifies the referendum because it repeals the law, therefore there would be no law to put before voters.

Kearney’s larger point – that repealing HB 194 before the referendum vote is unconstitutional – is ripe for debate and, many lawmakers agree, likely will be decided in court if the House also passes SB 295 and the governor signs it.

An attempt to verify Kearney’s assertion that the repeal is unprecedented could help shed light on the situation. If the senator is wrong, a similar case could help answer the question of the repeal’s constitutionality.

We checked with several government and legal sources and could not find an identical situation in Ohio’s history.

The provision to allow Ohioans to challenge a law passed by the General Assembly was included in the Ohio Constitution in 1912, according to a history of ballot issues maintained by the Secretary of State’s office.

Mike Rowe, spokesman for the Senate Democratic caucus, said the caucus’ legal staff could not find a similar case despite research that looked at the Ohio Revised Code, legislative records and discussions with staff members.

Republicans in the Senate and House also came up empty.

Senate GOP spokeswoman Angela Meleca said the caucus’ legal staff, along with the Ohio Legislative Services Commission, looked back and could not find another case of the General Assembly repealing a bill that is up for a referendum.

""There was nothing that matched or fit this scenario,"" Meleca said.

Carrie Davis, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, testified before a Senate committee on March 21 that the Ohio Supreme Court had never addressed the question of repealing a bill up for a referendum.

""If we’re all hitting the same wall and not finding anything, I’m not sure it’s there,"" Davis said in an interview.

There was one case with similarities, but it fell short of exactly matching the repeal of HB 194.

Lawmakers passed a bill last year to establish new congressional districts. The legislation replaced districts established by an earlier bill, House Bill 319, that spurred a referendum effort backed by Democrats. But when the second bill, House Bill 369, passed with a new map, the referendum effort ceased because the new maps replaced the old ones involved in the referendum.

The partial repeal of HB 319 is different, though, because Democrats dropped their bid to collect the signatures needed to get a referendum on the ballot. In the case of HB 194, Secretary of State Jon Husted last year certified that petitioners met the requirements to place the referendum on the November ballot.

So Kearney appears to be on solid ground. But it is important to remember the bill to repeal HB 194 has not been passed in the House. So the repeal is not official yet, although Republican House Speaker William G. Batchelder supports it.

Nevertheless, the experts we talked to all agreed that Kearney’s point that the repeal would be a first in Ohio history is accurate.

On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B96600>],/factchecks/2012/apr/09/eric-kearney/eric-kearney-says-repeal-voter-reform-legislation-/
"['History', 'States', 'Virginia', 'Morgan Griffith']","
Rep. Morgan Griffith says Virginia did not hold the first colonial witch trial
","
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-9th, was among a handful of Virginia congressmen who voted against a resolution earlier this month that proclaimed Salem, Mass., as the birthplace of the National Guard.

Griffith insisted Virginia organized a militia in 1624 -- five years before Massachusetts. He noted Virginia was the first English settlement in North America and, in an interview with The Washington Times, good-naturedly accused Massachusetts of having ""first colony envy."" Then, in a TV interview, he rekindled a deadly flame in the history of Salem, Mass.

""On most things except witch trials, Virginia will always have been first,"" Griffith, told WSLS-TV10 in Roanoke on April 3.

We’re sorry to say that we can’t resolve which state is the birthplace of the National Guard. Florida also lays claim to that title, saying an organized militia was created a few years after St. Augustine was settled in 1565.

Some argue that settlers came as armed bands and could all be considered part of militias. Jamestown was established in 1607 and pilgrims landed in Plymouth, Mass. in 1620.

But we were able to get to the bottom of Griffith’s other claim -- that Virginia was not the first colony to hold a witchcraft trial.

Griffith’s press secretary, Maggie Seidel, said the congressman’s statement was ""tongue-in-cheek."" When asked if there is proof of Griffith’s witch trial claim, she sent us a news story containing some of her boss’s comments.

So we turned to Marc Carlson, Librarian of Special Collections and University Archives at the University of Tulsa, who has extensively chronicled witchcraft trials in Europe and North America. His research shows the first person legally accused of witchery in the colonies was Joan Wright of Surry County, Va., in either 1622 or 1626.  

Witnesses accused Wright, a left-handed midwife, of correctly predicting the death of four people, threatening to make a neighbor’s maid ""dance naked and stand before the Tree,"" and possibly casting a spell that led to the death of a sickly child born to a mother who had declined Wright’s nursing services.

Although Wright was arraigned, Carlson said she did not stand trial.

The first known accusation of witching in Massachusetts targeted Grace Dutch in 1628 or 1629, but there’s no evidence that she went to trial, either. Records show she died in 1694.

The first known witchcraft trial in the colonies occurred in Virginia in 1641, resulting in the acquittal of the wife of George Barker. The exact charges are not known. But her accuser -- Jane Rookens of Lower Norfolk -- was sorry for what she said, according to Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia. The accuser’s husband, George Rookens, was ordered to pay the Barkers’ expenses and court charges.

The next known trials occurred in Connecticut in 1647. Mary Johnson, a servant, confessed to ""uncleanness with men and Devils."" There are varying tales, but no documents, on how she was punished. Also that year, Alse Young of Connecticut became the first American to be hanged for witchcraft.

Massachusetts’ first trial came the next year and resulted the hanging of Margaret Jones, a medical practitioner who the court said had ""such a malignant touch, as many persons, men, women, and children, whom she stroked or touched with any affection or displeasure, or etc.  were taken with deafness, or vomiting, or other violent pains or sickness.""
  
Although Virginia held the first known witchcraft trial in colonies, it was not a hotbed of suspicion and water tests. Carlson lists 11 accusations of witchcraft and sorcery in the Old Dominion and the only execution appears to have been on a ship heading to Jamestown in 1654 when Kath Grady was hanged as a ""witch at sea.""

Massachusetts, on the other hand, embraced a puritanical understanding of evil and had 19 accusations excluding Salem’s inquisition in 1692. The witch hunts in that village swept up about 200 people, 19 of whom were hanged and one of whom was crushed by rocks in torture.

Our ruling

Massachusetts is well known for its attempts to root out sorcery, but evidence shows Virginia held the first witchcraft trial in the colonies.

Griffith deserves no toil or trouble for his jest. But his witticism, as much as we enjoyed it, is False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2AB980>],/factchecks/2012/apr/09/morgan-griffith/rep-morgan-griffith-says-virginia-did-not-hold-fir/
"['Health Care', 'Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Eric Hovde']","
Newcomer and Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Eric Hovde says ""Obamacare"" denies millions ""access to affordable insurance""
","
President Barack Obama’s health care reform law is supposed to give millions more Americans access to affordable health insurance, right?

Eric Hovde, a 2012 Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, claims it will have the opposite effect.

In a blog post published March 27, 2012, the Wisconsin businessman and political newcomer wrote about the law and a legal challenge to it that the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled decide in June 2012:

""You see, Obamacare doesn’t just further bankrupt our nation, raise taxes and deny millions of Americans access to affordable insurance — it flies directly in the face of our Constitution.""

Let’s check what seems like a counterintuitive claim: That the Affordable Care Act denies ""millions of Americans access to affordable insurance.""

Two preliminary points. 
-- If the 2010 law is upheld by the court, most of its changes won’t take effect until 2014. That includes a requirement that nearly all people buy health insurance and the creation of insurance ""exchanges"" where people can buy health insurance, in some cases with a federal subsidy. 
-- As PolitiFact National noted in a similar claim made by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, the law is expected to increase the number of people with health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projects the number of uninsured Americans will be 29 million to 31 million lower than it would otherwise be without the law. 
Asked to back the claim, Hovde campaign press secretary Sean Lansing cited Congressional Budget Office projections, as well as a news article about two national surveys of employers.

Congressional Budget Office

Lansing said the CBO projected in a March 2012 report that as many as 20 million Americans will lose their employer-provided coverage after the health reform law takes full effect.

But that’s the worst-case of a series of scenarios presented by the budget office; in another scenario, the number of people who get employer-provided health insurance actually increases by 3 million.

What’s important is the budget office’s baseline estimate, or best guess, which is that 3 million to 5 million fewer people in each year from 2019 through 2022 will get health insurance through an employer.

But, to be clear, that does not mean they won’t have access to insurance.

Employer surveys

Lansing provided an August 2011 Associated Press article that reported on two national surveys of employers. Both were conducted by benefits consultants.

A Towers Watson survey found that nearly 1 in 10 midsize or large employers expect to stop offering health coverage to workers once federal insurance exchanges start in 2014. And a Mercer survey of large and smaller employers found that 8 percent were either ""likely"" or ""very likely"" to end health benefits.

So, potentially millions of workers could lose their employer-provided health insurance as a result of the reform law. Lansing argues that means those workers would be denied access to affordable health insurance.

But that’s not the whole story.

Under the law, workers whose employers stop offering health insurance would have other options.

As our colleagues noted in the Priebus item, which was rated Half True:

""The people who lose insurance this way won’t, for the most part, be left without insurance options. They should have access to coverage on the exchanges, perhaps with subsidies. And depending on their income level, they may have access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan, which were expanded as part of the law.

""Indeed, health care experts say that a big reason why companies may drop coverage is specifically because their employees will be able to go onto the exchanges and get guaranteed, and in many cases, subsidized coverage.""

But there's an even more important point.

Hovde’s claim is that the law itself denies the access to affordable care. In the scenarios he cites, it is the employer who would be deciding to drop the employer-sponsored plan.  
   
Our rating

Hovde said Obama’s health care reform law denies ""millions of Americans access to affordable"" health insurance.

Once the law takes full effect, some employers are expected to stop providing health insurance to their employees. But that's not the same as the law denying people access to affordable health insurance, particularly since other options for obtaining such insurance will be available.

We rate Hovde’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3E6540>],/factchecks/2012/apr/08/eric-hovde/newcomer-and-wisconsin-gop-senate-candidate-eric-h/

Affordable Care Act withholds federal matching funds for new Medicaid enrollees in New Jersey, assemblywoman says
","
Before being required by the national health care reform, New Jersey expanded Medicaid coverage to certain low-income parents, but according to one assemblywoman, the state is not getting any federal matching funds in return.

Assemblywoman Amy Handlin (R-Monmouth) made that claim in an April 4 opinion piece published in the Times of Trenton, criticizing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010.

""The federal government is supposed to match what states spend on new enrollees,"" Handlin wrote. ""I have serious concerns about Washington’s ability to keep a promise, especially because it has already indicated New Jersey’s new enrollees aren’t entitled to federal funds.""

Handlin later continued: ""These new enrollees won’t qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014.""

The assemblywoman’s claim is largely inaccurate, because the state is still receiving federal matching funds for these parents. But when the reform’s expanded Medicaid eligibility takes effect in January 2014, New Jersey is slated to receive half of the matching rate awarded to some other states.

In response to our findings, Handlin said in a statement: ""The point is that we are taking a significant hit just for doing the right thing ahead of the federal mandate. The taxpayers in states that waited will get double the federal benefit.""

Here’s what PolitiFact New Jersey found:

On a voluntary basis, New Jersey began providing Medicaid coverage for certain low-income parents in 2000 through its NJ FamilyCare program. Under health care reform, covering that population will be a requirement for all states.

Starting in January 2014, states must provide coverage to adults under 65 years old with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. For instance, an individual with no children would qualify for Medicaid if the person earns less than $14,000 a year.

New Jersey currently receives a federal matching rate of 65 percent for that parent population, but since the state began covering this population before enactment of the reform law, the federal match will drop to 50 percent in January 2014, according to state officials.

States that did not previously cover parents will be eligible for a 100 percent match to support the expanded coverage -- double what New Jersey would be receiving, officials said.

""New Jersey has been in the forefront on expansion of parent coverage and we believe states that were early adopters are being penalized by the Affordable Care Act (ACA),"" according to an application submitted by the state in September to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Jennifer Velez, commissioner of the state Department of Human Services, told the Assembly Budget Committee last week that federal officials had denied the state’s request to immediately increase the match to 75 percent, and to 85 percent in 2014.

New Jersey officials are now awaiting an answer to their request for a 100 percent match starting in 2014, Velez said.

""Once they said no to the 75-85, right, our ask again was, ‘Will you consider our current parents -- at 65 percent match -- will you consider them ‘newly eligible’ in 2014,’ which would be matched at 100 percent, which is what other states will get who haven’t covered their parents,"" Velez told the committee members.

Federal officials said last month a final rule on matching funds ""will follow as technical work with States on (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage) methodologies and income conversion continues.""

Our ruling

In an opinion piece in the Times of Trenton, Handlin claimed that federal officials ""already indicated New Jersey’s new enrollees aren’t entitled to federal funds"" and that ""new enrollees won’t qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014.""

But the issue is not over whether matching funds will be granted, but how much. New Jersey currently receives a 65 percent match for certain low-income parents covered by the NJ FamilyCare program. That match is slated to drop to 50 percent, representing half of the rate to go to some other states.

Consultant says his efforts improved performance at all 10 low-performing schools in Palm Beach, Florida
","
In the quest to improve its struggling school system, Providence voted at the end of March to spend $5 million in federal money to hire consultant Jeffrey Hernandez to help reform three struggling high schools. His appointment in Providence was controversial because his stint in Palm Beach, Florida, sparked strong criticism from parents and teachers and he resigned after only a year on the job.

Hernandez bills himself as an agent for transforming low-performing schools. Part of his sales pitch to the Providence School Committee was a six-page letter, dated March 23, 2012, that talks about his experience as chief academic officer for the Palm Beach County school district.

""One of the goals I was charged with was to improve the student achievement at our 10 lowest performing high schools, which were in Corrective Action under Florida's Differentiated Accountability. After implementing rigorous and robust strategic reform initiatives, 100% of the high schools improved their performance as evidenced by all of them receiving a grade of 'C' or higher (mostly 'A' and 'B'),"" he wrote.

After seeing his claim summarized in a March 26 Journal story about the controversy surrounding his then-pending appointment, we decided to check his claim.

His letter includes a chart detailing improvements -- some substantial -- in the letter grade given to each school by the Florida Department of Education.

""The grade improvements above are one of the many transformations that NAEP Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey J. Hernandez was responsible for as a district administrator,"" the chart says. NAEP is National Academic Educational Partners Inc. During the 2009-2010 school year, Hernandez was Palm Beach County's chief academic officer.

We confirmed all the grades with the Florida Department of Education, although the dates given in the chart are misleading. (It suggests the results compare the two school years from 2009-2011; it's actually 2008-2010.)

Among the seven high schools that had a D rating in 2009, when Hernandez began his job at the district, two rose to a C in 2010, three increased to a B and two jumped to an A.

Among the three C-level schools, two rose to a B and one jumped to an A. (The 11th school started out with a ranking of B and jumped to an A.)

Overall, 54 percent of the schools showed a higher grade and none showed a lower ranking.

That's pretty impressive. But was Hernandez, who was employed by the district for just one year, responsible?

For comparison, we looked at the grades for high schools in Broward County, just to the south of Palm Beach County. It turns out that those schools had a great year as well -- without Hernandez's involvement. In the Broward County school system, 53 percent of the 34 high schools got a higher grade in the spring of 2010 while 3 percent (one school) showed a decline.

So we looked at all Florida high schools, excluding those in Palm Beach for that time period.

Just over half -- 51 percent -- saw their grades increase for 2010.

So not only were the Palm Beach high schools getting better grades when Hernandez was in charge of academics, schools throughout Florida were getting higher scores as well.

The reason: the state changed its grading system. For example, the formula used to determine a school's grade began including graduation rates and accelerated course work.

""I would expect to see a difference between '08-'09 and '09-'10 because the formula for high school grades changed in that time frame,"" said Jane Fletcher, director of accountability and policy research at the Florida Department of Education. ""It's not surprising at all.""

When we called Hernandez to ask about the grade inflation statewide, he said, ""I can't say what was happening in other districts. I can only say what happened in the district that I was working on.""

We did see one difference between Hernandez's district and the rest of Florida. Palm Beach high schools showed a greater propensity to improve more than one letter grade. While 16 percent of Florida's high schools showed a jump of two or more letter grades (such as from a D to a B), 27 percent of Palm Beach schools made that type of jump.

Our ruling

Jeffrey Hernandez said that after implementing his reform measures, ""100% of the [10 lowest performing high schools in Palm Beach] improved their performance as evidenced by all of them receiving a grade of 'C' or higher.""

He is correct that there was improvement -- those low-performing schools did pull better grades (two went from a D to an A). But that was part of a larger trend, prompted by a change in the grading system, that caused half of all high schools throughout the state to score better.

We think that's an key omission, one that Hernandez should be making clear when he talks about his record and one that Providence should have known about when the School Department decided to hire him.

We rate his statement Half True.

President Barack Obama says GOP budget cuts financial aid to college students
","
Welcome to the Budget Games.

The strategy: Offer a proposal with broad outlines and as little detail as possible. When opponents attack, declare, ""That’s not what our budget does!"" Meanwhile, fill in missing details in the other guy’s budget with the least flattering interpretation you can calculate.

Repeat.

President Barack Obama filled in some details of the GOP budget resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in a speech to a meeting of news executiveson April 3, 2012 — using his own assumptions.

""This new House Republican budget ... proposes massive new cuts in annual domestic spending — exactly the area where we’ve already cut the most. And I want to actually go through what it would mean for our country if these cuts were to be spread out evenly. So bear with me. I want to go through this — because I don’t think people fully appreciate the nature of this budget.  

""The year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each.""

He went on, listing nearly a dozen specific ways the plan from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan would cut programs — again, assuming cuts were evenly spread. Then he clarified that Republicans ""don’t specify exactly the cuts they would make.""

Still, he doubles down on his list: ""This is not conjecture. I am not exaggerating. These are facts. And these are just the cuts that would happen the year after next.""

We thought we would start by asking: Is that true? If cuts were spread evenly, would nearly 10 million college students see their aid cut by more than $1,000 each?

The Pell Grant program

We asked the White House to explain Obama’s math. We talked to the House Budget Committee, looked through the budget documents and reached out to other budget experts.

The House Budget Committee says such a claim about college aid cuts is simply false. More on that in a minute.

Obama’s claim relies on funding in the Ryan plan for federal Pell Grants. The program provides the largest source of grant funding for needy college students, with more than 9.7 million students expected to get grants worth up to $5,635 in 2013, according to the Education Department.

It goes without saying that’s the only way some students might afford to go to college. But the costs of the program have been soaring, with discretionary costs more than doubling since 2008, according to the Education Department — mostly because there are more eligible students.

House Republicans accompanied the budget with a report that spells out ways to rein in the Pell program. For example, keeping the Pell maximum grant award in 2013 at this year's level of $5,550. The House Budget Committee says it would stay at that level for the full 10 years of the budget, key to the argument that Obama’s claim is false, though that's not clear in the report.

But there’s disagreement between the House Budget Committee and the White House Office of Management and Budget over how seriously to take House recommendations that aren’t in the actual budget resolution.

In the absence of direction from the budget resolution, OMB says it’s justified in applying the Republican budget’s cuts to nondefense discretionary spending across the board, leading to Obama’s statement that ""if these cuts were to be spread out evenly … the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each.""

The Ryan plan

Let’s be clear about what a budget resolution actually is — merely a guidance document for policymakers.

""Even in places where it makes assumed cuts to get to its budget numbers, it doesn't actually have the ability to force them to happen,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense. House committees propose legislation to do that.

Still, the budget passed by the House on March 29, 2012, provides an outline. What does it say about Pell Grant funding?

Nothing.

But the accompanying House Budget Committee report on the budget resolution offers a series of ""illustrative options"" to achieve its savings, saying, ""The committees of jurisdiction will make final policy determinations.""

The suggestions include requiring that students attend school at least half-time and changing the maximum income limit to be eligible. (It doesn’t actually specify what that new limit might be. Jason Delisle, an education budget expert at the New America Foundation, has made some guesses.)

Among those suggestions: ""To get program costs back to a sustainable level, the budget recommends a maximum award of $5,550."" It says the award would be fully funded through discretionary, rather than mandatory, spending. (That means an even bigger funding crunch in a shrinking pool of discretionary dollars.)

Moira Mack, spokeswoman for the OMB, points out that recommendation isn’t included in the actual budget resolution passed by the House — which does include policy statements on big issues such as Medicare and Social Security. Meanwhile, she says, the report isn’t clear about whether the maximum applies just to the coming year or to the entire 10-year-window covered by the budget. (The language just before the ""illustrative options"" is specific to fiscal year 2013.)

So the OMB calculates that the Ryan budget keeps the maximum grant at $5,550 in 2013 only. In 2014, the budget’s 14.3 percent cut in nondefense discretionary spending from the year before — applied evenly to the Pell program — would push the maximum award amount down to to $4,595 and leave some students with nothing at all, with an average cut of more than $1,000 per student.

(The president’s budget doesn’t clarify how it cuts spending in order to increase the maximum award — but compared with Ryan’s plan, there’s more funding available for nondefense discretionary spending, such as Pell grants.)

Budget experts at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities made a calculation similar to Obama's.

""The $1,000 was in the range of what we estimate would happen if you eliminated the
mandatory funding and made a few other policy changes but did not significantly reduce the number of people who are eligible,"" said James Horney, vice president for federal fiscal policy.

It’s just as possible that lawmakers could reduce eligibility, rather than cut the maximum award — leading to a different sort of statistic. Say, ""Millions of students would lose access to the Pell Grant program.""

Or lawmakers could choose to protect both eligibility and the $5,550, leading to bigger cuts in other programs.

So is Obama’s math fair? 
Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, says it’s tricky to say. ""Averaging cuts isn't an accurate way to describe what a budget does,"" he said. ""That said, the budget is not that prescriptive, so saying it wouldn't lead to something being cut is hard to argue as well.""

But that’s precisely what the House Budget Office argues.

""Our budget ensures that we maintain the current maximum Pell award,"" said Gerrit Lansing, press secretary for the House Budget Committee, sustaining the 2012 award amount in the Ryan plan for 10 years. ""... Yet again, the president has made assumptions about our budget that can't be sourced to our budget. The president is arguing: 'While Ryan doesn't assume X, let's just say he does so that I can get my talking point to work.'""

William McBride, an economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, echoes that idea, saying, ""As far as I know, there is no clear basis for the president’s claim. There is nothing in the Ryan budget that would suggest that. The burden of proof is with the president.""

Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, says there simply isn’t enough detail in the Ryan plan to say how it might affect people when it’s all in place. And in that case, estimating cuts across the board is reasonable.

Delisle, the education funding expert at the New America Foundation, developed his own set of assumptions to evaluate the Ryan plan’s effect on Pell funding. 
""The Ryan budget doesn't truly reveal what it's doing … which gives the Obama administration a lot of latitude to assume something radical,"" he said.

Our ruling

Obama declared in his speech to news media that in the absence of information about cuts in the Ryan plan, he would extrapolate what might happen if those cuts were applied evenly across programs. He included such a detail about Pell Grants, saying ""the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each.""

To his credit, Obama clarified that Republicans didn’t specify those cuts themselves and that they might apply cuts in ways other than the president assumed. But he hurts himself when he engages in a detailed analysis based on his own assumptions and then declares, ""This is not conjecture.""

Budget experts tell us that applying cuts evenly in the absence of other information is fair, assuming he’s clear about what he’s doing. But Obama's figure was based on the assumption that savings would be achieved by, among other things, reducing the maximum grant level in 2013 and beyond. The problem is, House Republicans say that their report expresses a preference to maintain a maximum award of $5,550. But that preference isn’t in the budget resolution passed by the House.

The president's statement is accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignore a preference that House Republicans say was reflected in the report accompanying the Ryan budget — that Pell grant maximums not be reduced beyond 2013. And, if other means were used to reduce spending on Pell Grants, such as lowering income eligibility, the impact could be different. Those are important details to leave out, which leads us to a rating of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097181340>],/factchecks/2012/apr/06/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-gop-budget-cuts-financ/

Tennessee Senate candidate says putting ethanol in gas raises the price of food
","Whether or not it’s a good idea to add ethanol to gasoline is a debate that has been around for years. One of the key disputes has been the impact ethanol-infused gas has on food supplies and food prices.

Such highly charged topics often make great fodder for candidates looking to score a few political points, and U.S. Senate candidate James Durkan is one of the latest to thrust himself into the debate.

Durkan, of Chattanooga, had intended to be one of the Republicans challenging U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., in the state’s GOP primary, but was not successful in filing a qualifying petition (see note below).

On his campaign website, Durkan outlines his three-step plan for lowering gas prices. One of his suggestions is to take ethanol out of gas.

""Why put it in?"" he wrote. ""It raises food costs.""

We called Durkan and asked what sources he was using as the basis for his claim.

""It’s common knowledge that it raises the price of food,"" he said. ""Just say we got that information from various sources.""

Pressed further, Durkan refused to cite any sources for his statement. ""We know that we’ve heard it, and we know that it’s true,"" he said. Asked again for his sources, Durkan replied, ""I would rather just say radio and television and the newspaper.""

Saying something is ""common knowledge"" might be good enough for someone running for office, but not for PolitiFact Tennessee. So we decided to run Durkan’s claim through the Truth-o-Meter.

First, a little background, courtesy of our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin.

Most gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, a fuel made from corn. That’s part of federal legislation pushed by the corn growers, the ethanol industry and renewable fuels supporters that seeks to boost the amount of ethanol we burn in our cars. For decades, the industry was encouraged – and propped up – by a controversial package of tax credits, production mandates and tariffs. Last year, after a series of bitter political fights, Congress allowed the federal ethanol subsidies to expire.

One reason for the political battle was the argument that ethanol diverted too much corn from food to fuel and that it caused food prices to rise. It also is worth noting that the percentage of corn used for fuel could rise -- an ethanol blend known as E15 passed a key regulatory hurdle on Monday.

The Renewable Fuels Association, which lobbies for ethanol, has vigorously disputed that claim, arguing on its website that tremendous increases in the productivity of U.S. farmers have ensured ample supplies of grain are available for domestic and international use as food, feed and fuel.

The association concedes that using corn to produce ethanol could impact food prices, but argues that other factors, such as energy costs, play a much bigger role in driving up the price of food.

""No reasonable advocate for American ethanol will tell you that using corn to produce ethanol has no impact on food prices,"" the association wrote in a policy position on its web site. ""But to suggest that the driving factor behind the rise in food prices is our effort to develop a domestic renewable ethanol industry is disingenuous.""

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked into ethanol’s impact on food costs at the request of U.S. Reps. Ron Kind, D-Wis.; Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.; and James McGovern, D-Mass.

In its 2009 report, ""The Impact of Ethanol Use on Food Prices and Greenhouse-Gas Emissions,"" the agency estimated that the increased use of ethanol accounted for about 10 to 15 percent of the rise in food prices between April 2007 and April 2008. The report also said ethanol boosted federal spending on programs to feed the needy by an estimated $600 million to $900 million.

The reason: Nearly 3 billion bushels of corn were used to produce ethanol in the United States in 2008. That was an increase of nearly a billion bushels over the previous year. The demand for corn for ethanol production, along with other factors, exerted upward pressure on corn prices, which rose by more than 50 percent between April 2007 and April 2008.

Rising demand for corn also increased the demand for cropland and the price of animal feed.

Those effects in turn raised the price of many farm commodities, such as soybeans, meat, poultry and dairy products. That, in turn, raised the retail price of food. Pushed up in part by those effects and by surges in the price of energy, food prices rose by almost 2.5 percent in 2006, by 4 percent in 2007 and by 5.1 percent in 2008.

But the report also noted that other factors, including transportation and energy costs, also had an impact on food prices. In fact, the report found that higher energy prices were more responsible for driving up the cost of food than ethanol production was. The increase in energy prices accounted for nearly a quarter (22 percent) of the 5.1 percent jump in food prices between 2007 and 2008, the report said.

In 2011, Iowa State University economists Bruce A. Babcock and Jacinto F. Fabiosa reached a similar conclusion in their report, ""The Impact of Ethanol and Ethanol Subsidies on Corn Prices: Revisiting History.""

""It is disingenuous to argue that there is no link between ethanol production and corn prices,"" the report said. ""And there is a direct link between higher corn prices and food costs because higher corn prices translate directly into higher feed costs, which eventually translate into higher prices for meat, eggs and dairy products.""

However, ""the price of corn is not solely determined by ethanol,"" the report noted.

The expansion of corn ethanol from subsidies and market forces accounted for 36 percent of the average increase in corn prices from 2006 to 2009, the report concluded. But, ""all other market forces counted for 64 percent of the corn price increase,"" the report said.

Our ruling

Studies show increased ethanol production has driven up the price of corn and other food commodities, such as soybeans, meat, poultry and dairy products. That, in turn, has contributed to a higher retail price of food. Yet those same studies show that other factors, particularly energy prices, have an even bigger impact on the cost of food than ethanol production.

We rate the claim Mostly True. *The Tennessee Secretary of State's office now tells us that James Durkan did not file for U.S. Senate and is not a candidate. Durkan told us the day after the April 5 filing deadline that he had indeed filed and didn't understand why his name was not on the Secretary of State's list of candidates for the office. Durkan said he could not remember exactly when he filed his paperwork, but thought it was sometime in 2010. But Blake Fontenay, a spokesman for the Secretary of State's office, told us in an email on April 11 that candidates can start filing qualifying petitions up to 90 days before the filing deadline. Fontenay said Durkan missed the deadline to pick up a petition and file. Contacted again and asked for clarification, Durkan said simply: ""We have no comment, sir.""",[<zip object at 0x000002809678B300>],/factchecks/2012/apr/06/james-durkan/tennessee-senate-candidate-says-putting-ethanol-ga/

Romney says Obama failed to pass a budget
","
In a speech that looked beyond the primary to the general election, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, hit President Barack Obama over his handling of the recession.

""President Obama's answer to our economic crisis was more spending, more debt and larger government. And by the end of his term in office he will have added nearly as much public debt as all the prior presidents combined,"" Romney said in an April 4, 2012, speech to newspaper editors. ""No president has ever run a trillion-dollar deficit. The new normal the president would have us embrace is trillion-dollar deficits and 8 percent unemployment. Through all of this, President Obama has failed to even pass a budget.""

There are a lot of accusations packed in there, but that last one -- that Obama failed to pass a budget -- piqued our interest most.

How the budget happens

The federal budget doesn’t get enacted the way other laws do. The process starts with the president submitting his budget request to Congress early in the year. That voluminous document is partly a presidential wish list, but it also gives Congress a framework.

""The ‘PresBud,’ as it is called, forms the basis of the fiscal year budget that starts the following October,"" according to this post from the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense.

In Congress, the House and Senate have budget committees tasked with creating concurrent budget resolutions, using the president’s budget as a guide. As Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote, ""The legislation they draft is for Congressional use only: it doesn't go to the President, it isn't law, it just helps Congress keep its budgetary ducks in a row.""

So there is the first problem with Romney’s statement. The president doesn’t ""pass"" a budget. That’s Congress’ job.

In Obama’s case, he has submitted his budget request each year he has been in office.

Voting on his requests

Romney said in his speech that ""In February, (Obama) put forward a proposal that included the largest tax increase in history and still left our national debt spiraling out of control, and the House rejected it unanimously.""

He’s right about the rejection. After Obama submitted his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal on Feb. 13, 2012, House Republicans put it up for a floor vote.

The result: 414-0 against.

The same thing happened a year earlier in the Senate. That vote: 97-0 against. Democrats didn’t support the plan because it has been supplanted by another deficit-reduction plan Obama had later outlined. Republican leaders demanded a vote on Obama’s budget to show that Democrats don’t support any detailed budget blueprint, according to The Hill.

Such votes are taken ""just as a means of embarrassing the president and his party,"" said Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation.

""Usually it’s brought up by the opposition party because they generally anticipate that a president’s budget won’t get very much support especially if it has controversial elements to it,"" he said.

Other experts agree. Said Steve Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense: ""That was pure political theater and was done to score rhetorical points.""

And Norman Ornstein, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, ""it doesn’t mean a damn thing. It’s only a symbolic gesture.""

These votes are also what Romney’s campaign cited when we asked for documentation of his statement.

""Everyone understands that the president has a unique and important role in facilitating that process,"" said spokesman Ryan Williams in an email. ""President Obama has been an unprecedented failure in that respect. His FY 2012 budget went down 97-0 in the Senate and his FY 2013 budget went down 414-0 in the House.""

Speaking of precedent

We wondered what other budgetary scenarios have played out recently.

Knudsen pointed to 2009, when Democrats still held a majority in the House. They introduced a resolution that included the mechanism for the health care legislation championed by Obama in his budget. The resolution had many elements of the president’s budget, Knudsen said, though it wasn’t strictly speaking that document.

Ornstein referred us to the gridlock of 2011 that resulted from the debate over raising the debt ceiling. The budget control act, which was passed to avoid a default on our debt and signed by Obama wasn’t a traditional budget resolution, Ornstein said. But he noted: ""That was actually a budget adopted by a president.""

Ornstein also noted that during George W. Bush’s presidency, there were years that Democrats in Congress failed to pass joint resolutions.

""To suggest that was Bush not passing a budget would be a misstatement,"" Ornstein said. He called Romney’s rap on Obama ""at best a gross exaggeration.""

But in Knudsen’s view, Romney’s statement was ""technically accurate.""

""The president’s budgets have been brought to the floor twice and they have failed,"" Knudsen said. ""It’s not atypical that that should happen, but nevertheless the governor is correct.""

PolitiFact has examined similar accusations about a lack of budgeting when they’ve been leveled at Congress. In January 2012, Republican House member Paul Ryan charged that Senate Democrats ""have gone without any budget at all"" for more than 1,000 days. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that Mostly True, finding he was slightly off about the number of days but correct that the Democrat-controlled Senate had gone a long time with passing a budget resolution.

Former Louisiana Congressman and Gov. Buddy Roemer earned a Half True from us when he said in July 2011 that ""Obama has never submitted a budget, and Congress has worked for two years without passing one."" He was right about Congress but wrong about Obama.

Our ruling

In his speech, Romney faulted Obama for failing to pass a budget. He was correct that the two times Congress voted on the president’s budget requests, both times they were voted down. But the job of passing a budget resolution is not the president’s. That responsibility falls to Congress, and even then the president doesn’t sign it. As Ellis, our expert, put it: ""The president has no role in passing a budget. The president can cajole Congress about passing a budget and advocate for positions and funding levels, but in the end, Congress approves the budget resolution for their own purposes."" That’s the difference between this and other claims we’ve rated which blamed Congress for inaction on the budget.

Romney’s statement contains a grain of truth, in that two of Obama’s budget requests failed to pass. But citing those votes leaves a wrong impression -- namely that the votes were anything more than political theater. Romney omitted the more critical information that passing a federal budget is the job of Congress. Given all that, we rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1A1DC0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/06/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-failed-pass-budget/
