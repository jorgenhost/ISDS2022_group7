Not all Wisconsin manufacturing job loss can be blamed on China
","Is China to blame for all the manufacturing jobs Wisconsin lost in recent decades? That’s the claim from a Facebook video making the rounds in the runup to the November 2020 presidential election. President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden are ramping up their own campaign ads, but an avalanche of outside groups are trying to get their own messages across. A June 4, 2020 Facebook video from conservative SuperPAC America First Action attacks the former vice president for not understanding ""the threat"" China poses to the United States. The video features Biden and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a State Department luncheon on January 19, 2011, toasting Hu Jintao, who was president of China at the time.  The caption of the video reads: ""China Has Been Stealing Our Manufacturing, Costing Wisconsin Almost 90,000 Jobs! Joe Biden Doesn't Understand the Threat. To Stop China, You Have to Stop Joe Biden.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). We are going to focus on the first part of that caption. Has China really cost Wisconsin 90,000 jobs? When asked to back up the claim, America First Action spokesperson Kelly Sadler pointed to a January 30, 2020, report from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. The report argues the United States’ trade deficit with China has cost Americans millions of jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. It estimates 88,900 Wisconsin jobs were displaced due to the ""goods trade deficit with China"" from 2001 to 2018.  The report claims the growing trade deficit over the 17-year period ""was responsible for the loss of 3.7 million U.S. jobs,"" including 2.8 million manufacturing jobs. The deficit is substantial. In 2019 alone, the U.S. imported $345 billion more in goods from China than it exported. And the manufacturing climate has certainly changed in the last two decades. An analysis of Census data by PolitiFact found that the U.S. lost more than 60,000 factories from 2001 to 2017.  What’s more, Federal Reserve Economic data shows the number of employees in manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin decreased from about 584,400 in January 2001 to around 483,400 in January 2020.  So Wisconsin did lose about 100,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001, but is it reasonable to attribute that all to China? China has had a significant negative effect on Wisconsin’s manufacturing workforce, but that doesn’t mean it is the only factor in job loss. David Hummels, a professor of economics at Purdue University, said trade deficits do not ""cause"" job losses. Instead, he pointed to specialization, saying trade can cause particular sectors of the economy to expand or contract.  He noted people tend to buy things that have a lower cost and higher quality. Since production in certain industries tends to be cheaper in China, U.S.-based manufacturers are sometimes left out of the competition. Hummels also said that while some changes in unemployment can be attributed to China, technological changes also influence employment rates. Michael Hicks, a professor of economics at Ball State University, echoed this idea. Hicks noted Wisconsin’s factory employment rate rose after 2010, even as the U.S.’s trade deficit with China continued to increase.  Hicks led a 2017 study that found productivity increases had resulted in 88 percent of  job losses in manufacturing in the United States. The study estimated trade accounted for just 13.4% of losses between 2000 and 2010.  While Wisconsin’s factory employment shrank from 2001 to 2018, non-factory employment rose by more than 400,000, he noted in an email. ""If you are going to blame China for the lost factory jobs, you need to also credit them with the gain of 409,000 non-factory jobs,"" he said. Kurt Bauer, president of industry trade group Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, attributed the loss of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs to trade, as well as demographics, in a fall 2019 magazine column Bauer claimed that 81% of WMC members said they are having trouble finding workers ""because there are simply fewer people of working age in Wisconsin."" ""I would argue that demographics may be impacting job numbers just as much as economic factors,"" he wrote in the column. That’s not to say China had no role, of course. ""It is reasonable to say that trade with China, along with changes in mechanization and automation, led to a pretty sharp contraction in manufacturing employment in the U.S. since 2000,"" said Hummels, the professor from Purdue.  America First Action on Facebook said China has cost Wisconsin almost 90,000 jobs. The state has in fact lost around 90,000 manufacturing jobs since the early 2000s. While this shift in the number of jobs can be partially attributed to the trade deficit with China, experts say that is not the only factor. Our definition of Mostly False is ""the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2020/jul/02/facebook-posts/wisconsin-manufacturing-job-loss-blame-china/

No, sensor can’t track quickly changing oxygen levels in a mask
","A two-and-a-half minute video shared thousands of times on social media warns viewers that the protective face masks recommended to stop the spread of coronavirus are not safe for work. The man in the video uses an air-quality monitor to measure the oxygen saturation under his mask before determining that wearing a mask leads to dangerously low oxygen intake. This post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We took a closer look at this claim and found it lacks credibility. First, air quality monitors are not applicable for this kind of experiment. Second, scientists say that overall air quality is not generally adversely affected when healthy people wear most types of masks.  The video Referencing Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards, the man in the video explains that an environment must be at least 19.5% oxygen for it to be safe for someone to work in. To demonstrate, he puts the hose of the air-quality monitor next to his mouth without a mask on and then shows the camera the 20.6% oxygen reading on the monitor.  The man then puts on a protective face mask like those recommended to protect against the spread of the coronavirus and again tests the air quality, this time placing the hose underneath the mask. After a few seconds the monitor’s alarm begins to go off and the man explains that this means it is measuring a ""hazardous atmosphere."" After measuring the air for about 17 seconds, he pulls the hose out from under his mask and holds the monitor up to the camera again. The monitor reads 17.4% oxygen. It takes 10 seconds for the monitor’s alarm to stop as it climbs back up to a safe level of 19.5%. The man pulls off his mask and explains that if you are ""getting headaches and stuff like that, there’s why, because you’re not getting enough oxygen."" He goes on to explain that if ""you are exerted ... it’s only going to get worse from there."" A similar but longer video post by Pennsylvania state Senate candidate Jeff Neff arrives at a similar conclusion and has gotten thousands of shares.  Measuring oxygen in a mask is complicated The OSHA guidelines the man in the video references are correct. OSHA defines an atmosphere that is less than 19.5% oxygen as oxygen deficient. A Department of Labor spokesperson told PolitiFact that OSHA has not determined how face masks impact oxygen levels and caution employers to consider how they use masks in atypical work environments. OSHA promotes the use of personal protective equipment and other safety measures by employers. As long as the atmosphere outside of your mask is normal and not oxygen deficient, you should be fine. Ben Neuman, a Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist, explained in another fact-check that masks ""won't materially change the makeup of air that comes through the mask."" The oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in a mask are constantly changing as humans breathe frequently and quickly, about 12 to 25 breaths per minute when at rest. Breathing in a mask, you expel high levels of carbon dioxide before quickly sucking in oxygen from the outside atmosphere into your mask. Roy McKay, professor emeritus for environmental and public health sciences at University of Cincinnati, explained that sudden breathing changes within a mask can cause meters like the one in the video to display short ""peak"" values that are tracking a quick change in oxygen concentration.  Kirsten Koehler, associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, agreed that the sensor could have been having a response to a rapid change in oxygen levels. She said that it takes about 10 seconds for a sensor to respond to a change in oxygen concentrations, which can’t keep up with human breathing. In an article McKay is writing on the quick changes in carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations within N95 masks, he concludes that ""most healthy people are unaffected by these concentrations… however, some otherwise healthy people are more sensitive and find the concentrations uncomfortable and possibly cause headaches."" An N95 mask is designed to form a seal around the mouth and nose, so the only air entering the mask is through a filter. The CDC currently does not recommend the general public wears N95 masks. That research is specifically on N95 masks, and doesn’t apply to thin surgical masks and cloth masks, which McKay assumes will have better oxygen concentrations because of their relaxed fit. Our rating In a video on Facebook, a man uses an air-quality monitor to prove that people are ""not getting enough oxygen"" while wearing masks. While the sensor he used is probably showing a somewhat accurate reading, experts explained that this sensor can’t pick up on how the oxygen within the atmosphere of the mask changes with each breath. Unless you are using an N95 or sealed mask, you probably won’t experience dangerously low oxygen levels or get a headache from wearing a mask.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/02/facebook-posts/sensor-cant-track-quickly-changing-oxygen-levels-m/

Wisconsin senator wrong to attribute rising COVID cases to testing
","After an extended period of mostly positive trends, COVID-19 is making a resurgence in America. At least 21 states were pausing reopening plans or taking new steps to limit the virus as of June 30, USA TODAY reported. In Wisconsin, new cases rose noticeably the last two weeks of June after falling steadily in the first half of the month. The reversal has led to an increased push for mask usage and other measures to limit the spread. But one Wisconsin lawmaker said a step like mandating masks isn't needed, pointing in part to the number of tests being conducted. ""The cases are going up, but it's because the testing is going up,"" Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, said in an interview with WISN-TV on June 29, 2020. ""The hospitalization rate is still within the comfort zone of every single hospital."" We’ll focus on the first part of this phrase, since the interplay of testing and case trends is critical to understanding what the virus is doing in our state. Essentially, Kapenga is blaming the increase only on the volume of tests. Here’s why that’s wrong. Wisconsin isn’t seeing a surge as significant as some states in the South, but the cases are clearly rising. The seven-day average of new cases was around 270 in mid-June, but it rose to more than 400 by late June when Kapenga made his statement. The seven-day average is the best judge of general trends since it smooths out the daily stats, which can jump up and down for a variety of reasons. But Kapenga’s reasoning fails on two fronts. First, this ignores the more detailed stats that show what is actually driving the increase. Experts say people here are letting their guard down, particularly residents in their 20s who went from 20% of the state’s positive tests before June 22 to 40% after that date. They point to the increasing willingness — in that age group and others — to get together at bars, parties and other social events.  Contact tracing has confirmed these get-togethers as an increasingly common source of COVID-19 infections. The trend has spurred officials in Madison to order bars to close again. Second, his basic premise is flat wrong — testing isn’t going up. The seven-day average of daily tests in Wisconsin peaked at 12,000 on June 9 and has marched steadily downward since. The average was just over 9,000 on June 29 when Kapenga made his claim. Throughout May, new cases and testing volume both generally rose. But the trends separated after that. And in the last half of June new cases rose as testing dropped. The seven-day average of daily tests in Wisconsin peaked at 12,000 on June 9 and has marched steadily downward since. The average was just over 9,000 on June 29 when Kapenga made his claim. In a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Kapenga said his full comments to WISN focused on hospitalizations, which have continued to drop throughout June. ""The interview was largely about face mask mandates and not a detailed analysis of testing data and trends,"" Kapenga said. ""This statement was a generality and not intended to be a commentary on any new trend beginning at that time of the interview."" Addressing rising COVID-19 case counts in Wisconsin, Kapenga said measures like mandatory mask use aren’t necessary because cases are rising due to increased testing. That’s flat wrong. Experts say there are clear drivers to the recent uptick, like residents in their 20s largely ignoring social distancing. So Kapenga’s attempt to minimize the trend to a result of testing frequency is misguided. Most notably, Kapenga’s core premise is simply not accurate. Testing was dropping, not rising, in late June as cases rose. He defended his claim as a ""generality,"" but it’s a generality that hasn’t been true since May.

Dems exaggerate in slamming Trump farm bailouts as “handout for large agricultural companies”
","Shortly before President Donald Trump’s latest visit to Wisconsin, state Democrats leveled a series of attacks on his agriculture policies. A June 18, 2020, news release from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin asserted Trump’s ""failed COVID-19 response has crushed farmers in Wisconsin"" and criticized the president’s trade war with China. Then it turned to the recent federal bailout efforts. ""Trump has never seen farmers as more than a political pawn critical to his re-election chances,"" the release said. ""He used their pain to push through a multi-billion-dollar bailout program that was nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies."" It’s a key topic in Wisconsin, where 36 farmers filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2020 alone, compared to 57 in all of 2019.  Have Trump’s bailouts really helped only the largest farming operations? The government provides billions of dollars to farmers through an array of programs, including crop insurance and commodity programs to help farmers survive low yields or low prices, and various disaster aid. But the Wisconsin Democrats’ reference to ""bailouts"" narrows the focus to the two recent programs that provided additional aid to farmers. The Market Facilitation Program paid out more than $14 billion in 2018 and 2019 to mitigate impacts from trade wars, and the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program — announced in April — is intended to provide up to $19 billion for farmers affected by the pandemic. Farm involved in directly producing crops were eligible, including large industrial farm operations. Here’s what we know about who got that money. Payments from the Market Facilitation Program have skewed heavily to large farms, according to the Environmental Working Group, which describes itself as a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment. The group obtained detailed data through October 2019 via Freedom of Information Act requests. Through that point, 55% of payments went to the top (largest) 10% of farmers — an average of $128,000 per recipient. Just 25% of payments went to the lowest 80% of farmers — an average of $7,000. ""This money really does go to the largest farms, and the smallest farms are the ones that need it the most,"" said Anne Schechinger, senior economics analyst with the group. The overall average was $23,000 per recipient. Large farms could collect a higher share of the money in the market program because of a loophole in the maximum payment policy, Schechinger noted in a July 2019 Washington Post story. Payouts were capped at $250,000 per person, but many farms are set up as partnerships, so each partner could receive that amount — even if there were a dozen or more. The second bailout, addressing the coronavirus impact, limited the payouts to three shareholders, so $750,000 per farm. The coronavirus program also generally limits the aid to farms with average annual income of $900,000 or less from 2016 to 2018. The payments have changed somewhat as a result. As of June 15, 2020 — the latest available data at the time of the Wisconsin Democrats’ news release — the average payment under the coronavirus program was $13,000. That could mean fewer farms were getting massive payouts. (The average rose to about $15,000 in the June 29, 2020, update) But that’s the most detail we have on the coronavirus program, since the government hasn’t yet released a breakdown of individual payments. So there’s no way for the state Democratic Party to prove this element of their claim. The coronavirus program is ongoing, with applications accepted through Aug. 28, 2020. Producers are eligible if they have suffered a 5% or greater loss during the pandemic. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed in a news release that bailouts under Trump have been ""nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies."" The first of the two farm bailouts did indeed skew toward large farms, with 10% of recipients receiving 55% of the funding. We don’t yet have detailed data on the second bailout that would conclusively confirm or rebut this claim, so the state Democratic party can’t prove whether their assertion holds true for this program. But we do know the government changed the payment caps to limit how much the largest farms can receive. And the claim wasn’t simply that payments skewed toward large farms, it was that the bailouts were ""nothing more than a handout"" for large producers. That’s a significant exaggeration. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/02/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/dems-exaggerate-slamming-trump-farm-bailouts-hando/
"['Criminal Justice', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
When was the last ‘top-to-bottom’ review of criminal justice system?
","U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said the federal government has not convened a commission to review the country’s criminal justice system and recommend large-scale improvements in decades. During a call with Texas reporters on June 11, Cornyn touted a part of Senate Republicans’ police reform bill that would set guidelines for such a commission. ""We haven’t done this top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system at the national level since 1965,"" he told reporters. Democrats later blocked the JUSTICE Act bill, saying it didn’t go far enough. We wanted to know: Has it truly been more than half a century since the American criminal justice system has undergone a federal review? Trump’s commission Cornyn and other Republican lawmakers have pushed to create a commission to study ways to reduce crime and improve policing across the country, filing unsuccessful legislation to establish such a commission since at least 2010. But last year, President Donald Trump directed the formation of a commission through an executive order, sidestepping the need for legislative action. In January, U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced the creation of the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. The part of the wide-ranging bill Cornyn highlighted during his conversation with reporters had been lifted from a standalone bill that covered just the creation of the commission. That bill was introduced before Trump created the commission, but a spokesman for Cornyn said the senator would still like to see it advance because he believes his version is more holistic. While the President’s Commission is made up of law enforcement officials only, Cornyn’s would include community leaders, civil rights advocates, crime victims, social services providers and public health officials. Cornyn’s bill would also task the commission with a broader area for review, covering the criminal justice system as a whole and its effect on various areas of government from health care to education. The current commission is limited to law enforcement and crime control issues within the Department of Justice’s jurisdiction because of the way it is set up. Additionally, similar to the 9/11 Commission, the bill calls for a group that would be making recommendations directly to Congress. The current commission, in 18 months, will report its findings to the Attorney General, who will submit a final report to the President. Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, during his introductory remarks at the opening ceremony for the commission in January, echoed Cornyn’s statement and said ""it has been over 50 years since we have systematically studied ways"" to improve upon the criminal justice system. Earlier commissions Drew Brandewie, a spokesman for Cornyn, said Cornyn was referring to the Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice that President Lyndon B. Johnson created in 1965. The commission ended up coming up with more than 200 recommendations -- many of them now very well-known mainstays, such as the 911 emergency call system and research organizations like the Bureau of Justice Statistics. It, too, was established by way of executive order. Johnson signed the order July 23, 1965, according to The American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. In the 1965 commission’s final report, members wrote that Johnson had created the group ""recognizing the urgency of the Nation's crime problem and the depth of ignorance about it."" The report stated that Johnson wanted to address a key issue with the criminal justice system: a lack of data on police, courts and other justice agencies, which made it difficult to make basic assessments of crime on a national level. Prior to Johnson’s commission, the last effort that was similar in scope was established under President Herbert Hoover to examine the enforcement of alcohol prohibition and its impact on other criminal elements, according to a 1931 report produced by Hoover’s commission. Johnson’s commission came as race riots were breaking out in major U.S. cities over police brutality and other frustrations, including the well-known Los Angeles Watts Riots. ""The commission in 1965 really stemmed from the upheaval in the country at the time, and from everything I’ve read, Barry Goldwater, he made ‘law and order’ a big issue during the campaign,"" said Marc Levin, founder and chief of policy and innovation at the conservative criminal justice initiative Right on Crime. ""And when LBJ came in, he really felt that we needed to take a look at this."" Levin agreed that no such commission has been formed since Johnson’s. He said other groups have met and provided recommendations in the years since, but none were as robust as that of a national commission. In 2014, for example, Congress created the Charles Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections, which made recommendations on how to make the prison system more just and efficient. But that only looked at the Bureau of Prisons and not the entire criminal justice system from police to courts. ""I think (Cornyn’s) statement is very accurate,"" he said. Our ruling Cornyn said it had been 65 years since a national commission studied the American criminal justice system and produced recommendations. Experts and academic research show that a commission of that scale, with that broad an area of review, has not been convened since Johnson’s 1965 group.

Fact-checking claims about the St. Louis couple who pointed guns at protesters
","A conservative activist painted the St. Louis couple who pointed guns at protesters marching outside their home as liberals who are actually aligned with the protesters. The ""gun-toting couple,"" wrote Benny Johnson, support Black Lives Matter, are Democrats, and are representing a victim of police brutality. ""The media is going to have a hard time comprehending this since they spent all of last night and this morning smearing them,"" wrote Johnson, chief creative officer of Turning Point USA, a conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk.   Johnson made the claim about Mark and Patricia McCloskey in a tweet, an image of which was then shared in a Facebook post June 29. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Johnson deleted the tweet after he said he discovered a portion of it was inaccurate.  Protesters seeking the resignation of St. Louis’ mayor in a controversy over police reform marched toward the mayor’s house and past the McCloskeys’ home. The couple stood outside their home and brandished guns at the marchers, with Mark McCloskey saying his family feared for their lives because they said marchers had broken through a wrought iron gate that secured a private street in the neighborhood. The local prosecutor is investigating to see whether the couple should be charged. Now to the three parts of the claim. The McCloskeys expressed support for Black Lives Matter in a statement released by their attorney, Albert Watkins, the day after the June 28 incident. ""The peaceful protesters were not the subject of scorn or disdain by the McCloskeys. To the contrary, they were expecting and supportive of the message of the protesters,"" the statement said. The statement also quotes Watkins as saying:  ""The Black Lives Matters movement is here to stay, it is the right message, and it is about time. The McCloskeys want to make sure no one thinks less of BLM, its message and the means it is employing to get its message out because of the actions of a few white individuals who tarnished a peaceful protest."" The tweet from Johnson included what appears to be a screenshot of Federal Election Commission data showing the name of Mark McCloskey and ActBlue. No other data is shown, but presumably the screenshot purports to show McCloskey donated to the group. ActBlue is a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and other causes like Black Lives Matter. Johnson apparently realized he erred on this part of his claim. On June 30, Johnson tweeted an image of that tweet with this message: ""I deleted this tweet because the FEC screenshot that went viral online was from a different donor of the same name."" According to the FEC, Mark McCloskey of the viral video made 20 contributions between October 2016 and February 2017 to the Republican National Committee or Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Those are his most recent campaign contributions. McCloskey also made a few donations in 1996 to Republican politician Bill Phelps’ congressional campaign, a primary committee for the 1988 Bush-Quayle ticket, and the National Republican Congressional Committee. FEC records show that he has donated to Democrats in the past. Between 2004 and 2012, McCloskey donated to Democratic candidates, including Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. On June 29, it was reported that a Democrat running for a Missouri state Senate seat said his campaign won’t keep a $250 contribution he received from Mark McCloskey in 2019. We didn’t find any donations from Patricia McCloskey in the FEC database. So, based on the pattern of their recent campaign contributions, it’s wrong to say the couple are Democrats. In Missouri, voters do not register a party affiliation. Mark McCloskey represents Isaiah Forman, a man who is suing a police officer over injuries sustained during an arrest. According to a March 6 Associated Press news article: Forman is serving a seven-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to second-degree assault on a special victim for crashing into a St. Ann, Mo., police car during an April 2019 chase. David Maas, then a police officer in suburban Woodson Terrace, kicked and struck Forman while he was compliant and not posing a physical threat to anyone, causing ""bodily injury"" and depriving him of his right to be ""free from unreasonable force,"" according to an indictment filed against Maas. Maas has been charged by the U.S. attorney’s office in St. Louis with one count of deprivation of rights under color of law.  A lawyer for Maas denied the claims in the lawsuit and said Forman ""aggressively resisted arrest"" and ""struck a police vehicle, narrowly missing a police officer in the process."" A viral image shared on Facebook claimed that a lawyer-couple who pointed guns at protesters are Black Lives Matter backers, Democrats and represent a police brutality victim. There is some truth to it. The couple expressed support for Black Lives Matter after the incident, via a statement from their attorney. And Mark McCloskey represents a man who has filed a lawsuit alleging police brutality. But there’s a reason the tweet was taken down. It uses campaign donation data from the wrong Mark McCloskey. The Mark McCloskey in the video has donated to both Democratic and Republican candidates, including multiple donations to the Republican National Committee and President Donald Trump.

Social media image about mask efficacy right in sentiment, but percentages are ‘bonkers’
","A popular social media post that’s been circulating on Instagram and Facebook since April depicts the degree to which mask-wearing interferes with the transmission of the novel coronavirus. It gives its highest ""contagion probability"" — a very precise 70% — to a person who has COVID-19 but interacts with others without wearing a mask. A middle tier of 5% is if the person with COVID-19 wears a mask while others don't. The lowest probability, 1.5%, is when masks are worn by all.   The exact percentages assigned to each scenario had no attribution or mention of a source. So we wanted to know if there is any science backing up the message and the numbers -- especially as mayors, governors and members of Congress increasingly point to mask-wearing as a means to address the surges in coronavirus cases across the country.  As with so many things on social media, it’s not clear who made this graphic or where they got their information. Since we couldn’t start with the source, we reached out to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ask if the agency could point to research that would support the graphic’s ""contagion probability"" percentages.   ""We have not seen or compiled data that looks at probabilities like the ones represented in the visual you sent,"" Jason McDonald, a member of CDC’s media team, wrote in an email. ""Data are limited on the effectiveness of cloth face coverings in this respect and come primarily from laboratory studies."" McDonald added that studies are needed to measure how much face coverings reduce transmission of COVID-19, especially from those who have the disease but are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.  Other public health experts we consulted agreed: They were not aware of any science that confirmed the numbers in the image.  ""The data presented is bonkers and does not reflect actual human transmissions that occurred in real life with real people,"" Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California - San Francisco, wrote in an email. It also does not reflect anything simulated in a lab, he added.  Andrew Lover, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, agreed. He had seen a similar graphic on Facebook before we interviewed him and done some fact-checking on his own.   ""We simply don’t have data to say this,"" he wrote in an email. ""It would require transmission models in animals or very detailed movement tracking with documented mask use (in large populations).""   Because COVID-19 is a relatively new disease, there have been only limited observational studies on mask use, said Lover. The studies were conducted in China and Taiwan, he added, and mostly looked at self-reported mask use.  Research regarding other viral diseases, though, indicates masks are effective at reducing the number of viral particles a sick person releases. Inhaling viral particles is often how respiratory diseases are spread. One recent study found that people who had different coronaviruses (not COVID-19) and wore a surgical mask breathed fewer viral particles into their environment, meaning there was less risk of transmitting the disease. And a recent meta-analysis study funded by the World Health Organization found that, for the general public, the risk of infection is reduced if face masks are worn, even if the masks are disposable surgical masks or cotton masks.  Though the experts said it’s clear the percentages presented in this social media image don’t hold up to scrutiny, they agreed that the general idea is right.  ""We get the most protection if both parties wear masks,"" Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies viral air droplet transmission, wrote in an email. She was speaking about transmission of COVID-19 as well as other respiratory illnesses.  Chin-Hong went even further. ""Bottom line,"" he wrote in his email, ""everyone should wear a mask and stop debating who might have [the virus] and who doesn’t."" Marr also explained that cloth masks are better at outward protection — blocking droplets released by the wearer — than inward protection — blocking the wearer from breathing in others’ exhaled droplets.  ""The main reason that the masks do better in the outward direction is that the droplets/aerosols released from the wearer's nose and mouth haven't had a chance to undergo evaporation and shrinkage before they hit the mask,"" wrote Marr. ""It's easier for the fabric to block the droplets/aerosols when they're larger rather than after they have had a chance to shrink while they're traveling through the air.""  So, the image is also right when it implies there is less risk of transmission of the disease if a COVID-positive person wears a mask.  ""In terms of public health messaging, it’s giving the right message. It just might be overly exact in terms of the relative risk,"" said Lover. ""As a rule of thumb, the more people wearing masks, the better it is for population health.""   Public health experts urge widespread use of masks because those with COVID-19 can often be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic — meaning they may be unaware they have the disease, but could still spread it. Wearing a mask could interfere with that spread.  A viral social media image claims to show ""contagion probabilities"" in different scenarios depending on whether masks are worn.  Experts agreed the image does convey an idea that is right: Wearing a mask is likely to interfere with the spread of COVID-19.  But, although this message has a hint of accuracy, the image leaves out important details and context, namely the source for the contagion probabilities it seeks to illustrate. Experts said evidence for the specific probabilities doesn’t exist.      We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/01/viral-image/social-media-image-about-mask-efficacy-right-senti/

Scott’s misleading attack on Biden about Castro, Maduro
","When asked about President Donald Trump’s sagging poll numbers in Florida, Trump ally and Florida Sen. Rick Scott accused presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden of being an ally of Latin American dictators. ""Biden supported the Castro regime and meeting with Maduro,"" Scott told Greta Van Susteren on her news show ""Full Court Press"" on June 28. For voters of Cuban or Venezuelan descent in Florida, any suggestion that a politician supports repressive regimes that committed human rights abuses is a serious accusation. Cuban American voters in South Florida are an important voting bloc for Republicans, although Democrats point to generational differences with hopes of winning over younger voters.  Scott knows the power of his words about Latin American dictators. In 2018, Scott focused heavily on Hispanic voters and delivered an anti-socialism message when he successfully ousted Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson by a tiny margin. But is his statement accurate?  We found that Biden supports normalizing relations with Cuba as President Barack Obama did, but experts told us that doesn’t equal supporting the regime. Biden had a brief encounter with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in 2015, but that meeting alone doesn’t tell the full story about Biden’s position with respect to the socialist leader. Scott’s spokesperson pointed to Biden’s comments in April when he told CBS’ Jim DeFede that he would restore Obama’s policy of engagement with Cuba. ""In large part, I would go back,"" Biden said. ""I’d still insist they keep the commitments they said they would make when we, in fact, set the policy in place."" DeFede asked Biden if re-engagement would reward Cuba at a time when its leaders are propping Maduro in Venezuela. ""Well, they’re having great difficulty propping up Maduro,"" Biden said. ""Number one, Maduro is in real trouble. Number two, there’s no reason why we cannot still sanction them, but failing to recognize them at all is a different thing than sanctioning them."" While Biden supports engagement with Cuba, he has repeatedly criticized the regime’s record on human rights and political prisoners. ""I have no illusions about the situation in Cuba, and it’s deeply concerning that the Cuban government continues to assert strong political and economic control while failing to respect press freedom and the freedom of assembly,"" Biden told the Washington Post during the primary. ""But Cuba is not represented solely by its leadership. There are many different sectors that we can and should work with to support progress in Cuba — including entrepreneurs, religious groups, universities, young people and human rights defenders."" There are varying opinions about whether the U.S. should engage with Cuba, including among Cuban American residents in Miami-Dade County. Conservative Cuban Americans have argued that any U.S. engagement with Cuba ultimately helps the socialist regime. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., argued against any softening of policy toward Cuba. During the primary debate in March, Biden said that Obama was trying to ""change Cuban policies so the Cuban people would get out from under the thumb of Castro and his brother."" Experts told us that support for engaging Cuba is not the same as endorsing the regime.  Engagement policies are always with adversaries, said Bert Hoffmann, Latin America expert at the GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies. ""Trump met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and that was not ‘supporting the regime’ but trying engagement policies,"" Hoffmann told PolitiFact. ""In the case of Cuba, Obama was always very clear that his engagement policy toward Cuba was in no way support of the regime, but a strategy to help the Cuban people and to stimulate change in a context where the Cold War-type confrontation between Cuba and the U.S. had been effectively stabilizing the Cuban regime for decades."" William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University, said the charge that the Obama administration supported the Cuban regime amounts to ""partisan name-calling."" ""President Obama’s policy of opening a diplomatic dialogue with Cuba was based on the fact that the old policy of hostility and isolation was a failure,"" LeoGrande said. ""It hadn’t worked for 60 years."" Obama challenged the Cuban regime on human rights and encouraged it to move toward democracy, LeoGrande said. U.S. interests required dialogue with Cuba on issues such as narcotics interdiction and environmental protection. There is debate about whether Obama’s approach improved human rights for the Cuban people. Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said it’s clear Obama’s intention was to influence democratic change — not to support the regime. Scott’s spokeswoman pointed to a photo showing Biden and Maduro smiling at each other. It stems from their encounter in January 2015 during former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's swearing-in ceremony in Brazil. We did not find an official transcript of their conversation, so we can only rely on what Biden and others said about their encounter and media reports.  The AP at the time described it as a ""brief, impromptu meeting."" An unnamed U.S. administration official said Maduro told Biden that he wanted improved ties, but was concerned about sanctions. Biden said one step Venezuela could take would be to release political prisoners. Maduro described the meeting as ""cordial."" Speaking in Miami in September, Biden called ""it a coming to the Lord meeting with Maduro."" ""I told (Maduro), we’d talk with him if he did the following things, starting with setting up elections, making sure he’d release political prisoners, a whole range of things. That kind of ended our conversation,"" Biden said. So why was Biden laughing in the photo? We found a couple of different explanations. A Biden adviser, Juan S. Gonzalez, who identified himself in one of the photos, tweeted that Biden ""laughed when Maduro asked him to raise the price of oil (market didn't work that way) and that if he wanted to talk he first needed to release political prisoners and negotiate in earnest."" Hey @TrumpWarRoom - I’m the bald guy in that picture. He laughed when #Maduro asked him to raise the price of oil (market didn’t work that way) and that if he wanted to talk he first needed to release political prisoners and negotiate in earnest. https://t.co/Xe1Q58icyU The Brazilian publication Valor at the time wrote that Biden said to Maduro, ""If I had your hair, I'd be president of the United States."" (The Venezuelan government website in 2020 recounted a similar statement.) Other events point to rockier times. One month later, Maduro accused Biden of trying to organize an effort to overthrow him. Biden’s office denied the accusation but said Venezuela had violated freedom of speech, assembly and due process. Biden has ""been very clear that Maduro's government is illegitimate, and that Venezuela needs free and fair elections,"" LeoGrande said.  About a month after he met with Maduro, Biden met with Lilian Tintori, the wife of opposition leader and then-political prisoner Leopoldo Lopez.   During his campaign, Biden has repeatedly criticized Maduro. In February 2019, Biden called Maduro a ""tyrant"" and called on the international community to support Juan Guaidó as president. Trump, too, recognized Guaidó as the interim president.  Biden has also called for extending Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans who have fled for the United States. It is tough for Venezuelans to get asylum in the U.S. Democrats, including Biden, have criticized Trump’s comments about Maduro. In June, Trump told Axios that he was open to meeting with Maduro. In response to the backlash, Trump tweeted: ""I would only meet with Maduro to discuss one thing: a peaceful exit from power!"" John Bolton wrote in his book that Trump thought Guaido was ""weak"" as opposed to Maduro, whom he called ""strong."" Scott said, ""Joe Biden supported the Castro regime and meeting with Maduro."" Scott pointed to Biden’s statements in April that he would engage with Cuba, as Obama did. But Scott ignores that Biden has repeatedly criticized Cuba’s human rights record. Experts told us that Biden’s plan to engage Cuba doesn’t mean he supports the regime, although Cuba hardliners view it that way. Biden did have a brief encounter with Maduro in 2015 in Brazil, which was captured in photos. We don’t have an official transcript of what was said but the fact that the two men spoke to each other doesn’t mean they were in agreement. The AP reported that Biden suggested to Maduro that he should release political prisoners. Other reports say Biden made a joke about Maduro’s hair. Biden has frequently called Maduro a ""tyrant"" and supported Guaidó as his replacement. We rate this statement Mostly False.

One recent Facebook post shares an image containing inflammatory claims about a coronavirus vaccine that might one day be available to the public. ""The covid-19 vaccine will be mandatory in order to go back too school. They will contain RFID Chips,"" the image in the post reads. It continues: ""Many kids will die from the covid-19 vaccine. Just to remind you the 4 kids that took the vaccine, died immediately."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claims in the post are speculative and misleading in a number of ways, and have been debunked by another fact-checking organization. COVID-19 has killed more than half a million people worldwide, including nearly 130,000 in the U.S. Companies around the world are scrambling to develop a vaccine, and many potential vaccines are undergoing safety trials in humans.  Health officials are struggling to reassure some skeptics that a vaccine can be developed quickly without compromising safety. As of June 30, only one coronavirus vaccine had been approved for limited use. The Chinese government has approved it only for military personnel.  Currently there is no coronavirus vaccine that has been approved for the American public. And there is no evidence that children have died because they received one of the COVID-19 vaccines being developed. In April, PolitiFact investigated a claim that seven children in Senegal died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and discovered the Facebook post’s claim was false.  In May, Reuters also reported that social media posts were incorrect in claiming that a TV news report from 2019 showed the deadly results of a COVID-19 vaccination trial in Guinea.  PolitiFact found no evidence that anyone has died from complications related to a trial COVID-19 vaccination. PolitiFact has also debunked several false claims involving the coronavirus vaccine and microchips. The U.S. isn’t developing an ""antivirus"" for COVID-19 that will include an RFID chip, for example. There’s also no evidence that Democrats are pushing for mandatory vaccinations or microchip implants to fight the coronavirus. And there is no evidence yet of any requirement that students be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to school, though some states could require it if a vaccine becomes available.  State laws govern immunization requirements for schoolchildren, including those in private schools and daycare centers, but all states allow exemptions for medical reasons, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and some allow exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons. A viral image on Facebook claimed, ""Many kids will die from the covid-19 vaccine.

NFL player stood alone during national anthem, but says he did it by mistake
","With the National Football League softening its stance on peaceful protests during the national anthem, more players are expected to kneel rather than stand during the pregame ritual in the coming season to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement protesting police brutality. That’s likely to mean more criticism from people, including President Donald Trump, who see the gesture as unpatriotic.  On June 19, a Facebook user posted a viral image of Pittsburgh Steeler and West Point graduate Alejandro Villanueva, a two-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman and former U.S. Army captain.  The caption on the image says: ""If you want to make any football player really famous. Let it be this man. He came out and stood alone while his whole team stood in the locker room. He’s a veteran and did 3 tours in Iraq. Make him famous. His name is Alejandro Villanueva! A real American patriot!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Villanueva is a veteran who did three tours of duty in Iraq, earning a Bronze Star. But the image isn’t quite what its caption says it is. The image is from just prior to the Steelers’ road game against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field on Sept. 24, 2017. That day, some NFL players around the league kneeled, sat or locked arms during the anthem as a show of unity and a form of protest against comments by Trump, who had said protesting players should be fired.  For that game, the Steelers had decided in a team meeting that players would keep any protests off the field and stay in the stadium tunnel during the anthem. But Villanueva emerged from the tunnel and went on the field anyway. The entertainment TV show ""Inside Edition"" did a story with video clips from the anthem stating that Villanueva was ""breaking ranks"" with his teammates, and noting that Villanueva’s jersey had become the top seller in the league. But Villanueva insisted he was not being defiant. He just got caught in an awkward moment. Here’s part of what the former Army Ranger and captain told reporters the day after the game: ""Based on my unique circumstances and based on the fact that I've served in the Army and that pretty much everything that my life is lived through the military, I asked (quarterback Ben Roethlisberger) if there was a way to define the inside or where is it that we were going to stay and if I could watch the national anthem from the tunnel, and he agreed. He said the captains will be out there right behind me, so this plan sort of morphed to accommodate this tough, moral dilemma that I had in my hands to where the players could be behind me in the tunnel. ... ""I asked one of the security guards when the national anthem was going to start; he said 20 seconds. So I just walked out and I stopped as soon as I saw the flag, as soon as I had a vantage point. … And when I turned around to sort of signal everybody else to come in so they wouldn't leave me alone, then that's when (the song started and) they were essentially unable to exit. At that moment, it was the decision of, do you walk out of the national anthem and join your teammates? I know that would have looked extremely bad. Or as a team, do you start moving halfway through the national anthem?"" Villanueva said the impression that he chose to break ranks with his teammates was ""my fault only.""  A Facebook post suggested that Villanueva defiantly stood alone during a pregame national anthem as his teammates remained inside the stadium tunnel. Villanueva was the only Steelers player on the field during the anthem, just outside the tunnel, while the others were inside. But he later apologized, saying he ""unwillingly made a mistake"" by walking out ahead of his teammates.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information.

Painting of people around the world wearing masks is from 2020, not 1994
","Conspiracy theories that claim COVID-19 was planned as part of a world domination scheme by the ""elite"" have run amok on the internet. A miscaptioned mural of people wearing masks was recently tacked onto those rumors as more evidence of the plot. But it’s not. In late June 2020, Facebook users shared a photograph of a mural that showed people of the world wearing masks. The posts claim that the mural was created in 1994 for the Denver International Airport, and the mural proves that the virus was planned. ""The Denver airport mural painted in 1994. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?"" text along the bottom of the image reads. One user who shared the image wrote: ""And I’m the conspiracy ""theorist""?! Sorry, but no…"" Another said, ""PLANDEMIC 1994 Denver International airport. Illuminati artworks on display."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The mural itself is legitimate. But it’s not from 1994, it’s not in the airport, and it didn’t portend the coronavirus pandemic. There is some confusion over who created the piece, but we can confirm that it has never been displayed in the Denver International Airport and was made in 2020, not 1994. The earliest online appearance of the piece was when CJ Trinidad, an artist in the Philippines, shared it to his Facebook page in February 2020 with the caption ""MASKCOMMUNICATION.""  He posted multiple photographs of the artwork, including one of it in progress, and another of him posing with it. His signature appears at the bottom right corner of the piece, and apparel that features the artwork has also been shared on his Facebook account. But the same piece was credited to someone named Neha Kumari for a coronavirus-themed global art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Kumari entered it into the competition under a different title. The image of the mural on the website also shows Trinidad’s signature is cut off.  Authorship aside, the listed submission date of the artwork on the contest website is where people may have gotten the wrong idea about when it was created. The piece is listed on the site as being submitted on Dec. 28, 1995, but this appears to be an error. The competition’s submissions didn’t open until April 2020. We reached out to the organization for clarification but haven’t heard back. As for the Denver airport piece of the claim, that’s easy to disprove. Alex Renteria, an airport spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the piece is not from the airport’s collection. ""The only mural painted in 1994 for DEN featuring international children wearing traditional clothing and that also features flags is Leo Tanguma’s ‘Children of the World Dream of Peace,’ but none are wearing masks,"" Renteria said. The airport opened to the public in February 1995 and has been a hotbed for conspiracy theories for decades, particularly involving its bold, and sometimes unnerving, public art pieces. Facebook posts claim that a piece of artwork that shows citizens of the world wearing masks was created in 1994 and is displayed in the Denver International Airport.  While the original artist is still unclear, the image of the piece does not show a mural that was made in 1994 at the airport.

Was Caitlyn Jenner Released By A District Attorney After Killing Someone?
","On the night of this year's Academy Awards, Olympic gold medalist and former reality TV show star Caitlyn Jenner got into a social media tussle with Democratic Congress member Ted Lieu of California. The argument started on Twitter: As a way to win support for her candidacy in the likely recall election against Gov. Gavin Newsom, Jenner criticised the governor for allowing district attorneys to release ""dangerous criminals back on to our streets."" The Twitter war stole some of the spotlight from the Oscars and went viral. Alex Mohajer, a political commentator, retweeted Jenner’s criticism with the comment, ""This is your reminder that Caitlyn Jenner literally killed someone in the streets 6 years ago and was released by a District Attorney.""  Mohajer also posted the claim to their Facebook, where it was shared more than a thousand times.  Facebook flagged the post as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook and a previous PolitiFact fact-check of Caitlyn Jenner from 2017.) Facebook also flagged a similar post just days before.  We decided to look into it. What happened: In 2015, Jenner was driving an SUV, which was towing an ATV, on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. She rear-ended a Lexus, pushing it into oncoming traffic. Kim Howe, the driver of the Lexus, was then hit by a Hummer traveling in the opposite direction. Jenner proceeded forward and hit another vehicle, a Prius, whose driver suffered mild injuries. But Howe was killed on impact.  Jenner was apologetic for the event and called it a terrible accident. She settled with Howe’s family and Jessica Steindorff, the driver of the Prius, for an undisclosed amount, as well as the family in the Hummer for $800,000. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office issued an investigation into the accident and looked into the possibility of vehicular manslaughter. The investigation triggered controversy for Jenner at the time, because the misdemeanor charges would have potentially put her behind bars for at least a year, at which point she had just announced her gender transition. At the end of the investigation, the DA’s office did not proceed with charges due to a lack of evidence. In order to prove vehicular manslaughter, a person must have some level of ordinary negligence. In Jenner’s case, they came up empty. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department recommended that she be charged, however it wasn’t their final decision. In addition to a lack of evidence, the DA's report said Jenner let go of the gas pedal and engaged her brakes a couple of seconds too late before hitting Howe. The report says she did not break any traffic laws, except for driving below the speed limit. Therefore, they declined to charge her with vehicular manslaughter. Experts say charging someone for the crime isn’t easy. The burden of proof is entirely on the prosecution. California law says the prosecution must prove that the person who caused the death was driving with negligence and violating traffic laws. ""The negligence goes sort of hand-in-hand with the traffic offense,"" said John McCurley, criminal defense attorney and appellate law specialist. Anything that can impair your driving safely — like texting, putting on makeup, or staring out the window — is considered ordinary negligence. McCurley said these cases usually only involve single riders. ""The only person who really has the story is them and they don’t have to testify,"" McCurley said. ""I think that’s a big issue with proving these cases.""  And if the prosecutor can’t come up with evidence, then they can’t press charges. ""I can't say that it was her fault. So again, we have an absence of facts,"" McCurley said. When prosecutors do an investigation, they leave no shortage of expertise. ""They don’t skimp on resources,"" said Nabiel Ahmed, a criminal defense attorney in the Oakland Bay Area.  Ahmed represented a vehicular manslaughter case in which his client was intoxicated and driving over the speed limit. The driver did not engage their brakes and as a result smashed into a parked car. They were convicted. ""Caitlyn’s case differed [from] mine in that she did apply the brakes and she was driving below the speed limit, so these were two critical distinguishing factors,"" Ahmed said. The investigation also found Jenner was sober at the time of the accident. Our Ruling Did California recall election candidate Caitlyn Jenner kill someone in the streets and get released by a district attorney? It’s correct that the district attorney did not pursue charges against Jenner. The decision came about after an investigation, in which the DA’s office said there was a lack of evidence to charge her with vehicular manslaughter and of driving recklessly. The DA did not release Jenner. The posts on social media suggest that Jenner was released by a district attorney for killing someone. However, Jenner was never charged or convicted in the case. We rate this claim Mostly False.  MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2021/may/10/facebook-posts/was-caitlyn-jenner-released-district-attorney-afte/

No, The Death Rate For Vaccinated People Is Not Higher Than That Of Unvaccinated People
","An Instagram post claimed that ""the death rate for fully vaccinated people is significantly higher than non-vaccinated [people].""  The post featured a screenshot of a tweet by Chuck Callesto, a former candidate for Florida's 3rd congressional district. The tweet reads, ""Breaking report: according to the CDC 7,157 fully vaccinated Americans have contracted COVID-19, 88 have died."" It appears the post has since been deleted from Callesto’s Twitter.  We’ve fact-checked several other claims about the purported effects of the COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness before, and we found them to be false.  The numbers in the post come from actual figures provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, the CDC’s most recent data on breakthrough cases shows that, as of April 26, more than 9,000 COVID-19 breakthrough infections have been reported.  However, these breakthrough infections are not evidence that vaccines are dangerous and ineffective.

These infections are defined as ""vaccine breakthrough cases.""  Vaccine breakthrough cases only occur in a small percentage of vaccinated people. And public health officials say that these cases actually reinforce the effectiveness of the vaccines, unlike the post suggests.  As of May 4, more than 105 million people in the United States have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the CDC. During this same time, the CDC received 9,245 reports of vaccine breakthrough infections. That’s less than .01% of fully vaccinated Americans.  Vaccine breakthrough cases are expected. In the original clinical trials, none of the vaccines were 100% effective, nor have they ever claimed to be. No vaccine is 100% effective at preventing illness, according to public health experts and the CDC. So the vaccines are actually performing better in real-life situations than expected in some regards, according to the public health experts we interviewed.  The CDC has acknowledged that these cases actually represent an undercount of the actual number of breakthrough vaccine infections. Since the surveillance system relies on voluntary reporting and testing, the total number of breakthrough infections is likely higher.   ""Not all real-world breakthrough cases will be identified because of lack of testing,"" the CDC’s website reads. ""This is particularly true in instances of asymptomatic or mild illness."" That means that the CDC’s data on breakthrough cases is skewed towards more severe infections that result in hospitalization or death. But it’s worth acknowledging that more than a quarter of these cases were reported as asymptomatic, meaning that vaccinated individuals were ""infected with SARS-CoV-2 but never showed symptoms of the disease,"" according to the CDC.   Going forward, the CDC will be ""transitioning to reporting only patients with COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection that were hospitalized or died to help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance,"" according to their website. That change in reporting will begin on May 14.  Comparing Death Rates    Breakthrough infections have resulted in 835 hospitalizations and 132 deaths, according to the latest figures from CDC. The CDC’s website notes that 20 of the 132 fatal cases were ""reported as asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19."" That means that less than 1% of these breakthrough infections resulted in the patient dying because of COVID-19 related illness.  New data from the CDC found that fully vaccinated adults 65 or older are 94% less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than their non-vaccinated peers — and 64% less likely if they have only received one shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.  According to the latest figures from the CDC on May 10, there have been 32,543,257 reported cases of COVID in the U.S., of which 578,945 people have died. That’s a rate of 1.8% — a higher rate compared to the data we have on breakthrough infections.  However, the post claims that the death rate for vaccinated people is greater than the death rate for unvaccinated people, a number that experts say is difficult to quantify. Public health experts said that Smith likely miscalculated the death rate.  ""What they're saying is completely wrong,"" said Dr. Lee Riley, a professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at UC Berkeley. ""I think they're just miscalculating.""  Erin Mordecai, an assistant professor of biology at Stanford University, agreed with Riley about the miscalculation, and cautioned against the comparison.  She said it’s impossible to accurately calculate a death rate for each group — vaccinated versus vaccinated — because demographics skew the data.  ""Those breakthrough cases may not be an average subset of the population, they may be a more at risk group that's more likely to have severe disease anyway,"" Mordecai said. ""To better understand what's going on with the relative risk, you would need to know the demographics of the underlying health conditions of the people who experienced those breakthrough cases and deaths."" For example, throughout the country the people most at risk were prioritized in vaccination, including by age. That means that the vaccinated population skews much older than the unvaccinated population, with adults ages 65 and older making up more than 30% of the vaccinated population.  We already know that older adults are at a greater risk of requiring hospitalization or dying after being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, so it’s not surprising that most of these breakout deaths (45%) were among those ages 60 and older.  California and Vaccinations  According to the latest state data, more than 13 million Californians have been fully vaccinated — that’s 32% of eligible Californians over 16 years of age. Almost half of eligible Californians have had at least one dose of the vaccine.  ""The number of post vaccination cases remains small considering there are more than 12.9 million fully vaccinated individuals in California,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement. ""Currently, 3,084 post-vaccination cases have been identified between January 1, 2021 and April 28, 2021.""  To put that number in perspective, that’s about 1 in 4,200 or so vaccinated Californians. Both of the public health experts we spoke to encouraged Californians to continue to get their COVID vaccines and help the state reach ""herd immunity.""  Our Ruling  An Instagram post deceptively uses CDC data on vaccine breakthrough infections to claim that ""the death rate for fully vaccinated people is significantly higher than non-vaccinated [people].""  That’s not the case. Public health experts agree that this claim is false and that the author of the post likely miscalculated the death rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated people.  The experts we talked to also said that it’s misleading to use these figures to calculate a death rate and compare it to the unvaccinated population. The vaccinated population skews much older than the unvaccinated population and are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to vaccination roll-out restrictions.  The post also includes a screenshot of a Tweet to claim that ""the CDC has reported 7,157 fully vaccinated Americans have contracted COVID-19, 88 have died."" The figures on breakthrough infections are real — in fact, there are now more than 9,000 recorded cases, which have resulted in 132 deaths. But it is widely misleading to use these numbers as evidence that vaccines are dangerous and ineffective, and the post leaves out crucial facts about breakthrough infections.  We rate this statement as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2021/may/10/instagram-posts/no-death-rate-vaccinated-people-not-higher-unvacci/

Fact-checking Biden’s claim about hunger 'sharply' dropping
","President Joe Biden credits the American Rescue Plan for helping Americans recover from the pandemic and economic fallout, including those who have experienced hunger. ""The Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger,"" Biden said May 5. ""And hunger is already sharply down in the United States."" Biden signed the American Rescue Plan on March 11, so we wondered if the legislation had already caused hunger to decline ""sharply"" less than two months later.  We found that the plan’s stimulus checks and food programs have helped. But there are other factors that have eased hunger, including school reopenings, a rebounding economy and previous aid. The pandemic caused school closures and higher unemployment, driving up the numbers of people who needed help obtaining food. A Northwestern University study estimates that at one point during the pandemic, nearly 23% of households in the U.S. experienced food insecurity.  The White House cited a Washington Post article that cited data from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey. The Census designed the survey to collect data on how people’s lives have been impacted by the pandemic, initially collecting data every week and then every two weeks. One of the questions respondents are asked is whether they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat in the previous seven days. (Experts cautioned against using this survey to compare hunger from different surveys before the pandemic, but told us it is useful to compare the current survey’s data during different weeks.) Adult food insecurity in the U.S. declined 43% from December to the most recent data for April. The percentage who reported food security was 10.7% during the first two weeks in March and then fell to 8.8% later in March after the bill was signed into law. Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, a Northwestern University economist, said the latest round of stimulus checks were a major driver in the decline in hunger between the first and second half of March.  ""The economy is improving, and employment is increasing, which is also helping the numbers, but the big drop is most likely explained by the stimulus/relief payments,"" she said.  Starting in spring 2020, the federal government took action to expand food assistance as a result of the pandemic. Biden continued on that path, including the $12 billion in food assistance in the American Rescue Plan. Here’s a look at some of the major food assistance programs: The American Rescue Plan maintains a 15% increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits through September, which provides about $28 more per person, per month. This program is an extension of the increase from the Consolidated Appropriations Act signed by President Donald Trump in December. The USDA announced April 1 that it would provide $1 billion per month in additional assistance to the lowest income households on SNAP. The American Rescue Plan includes $900 million for the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program. Some of the funding includes temporarily increasing the voucher for fruits and vegetables. Many states opted into this program in March and April. Aid through a Pandemic-EBT program was established in March 2020 through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to provide money for low-income families for children missing meals due to school closures. The American Rescue Plan extends the program through the summer. Experts told us that it wasn’t just the recent American Rescue Plan that contributed to the decline in hunger.  ""The unemployment rate is the single biggest correlation to food insecurity in America,"" said Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America. Scott Winship, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said like the food insecurity data, the poverty data shows a big decline in March, so that’s consistent with a drop in hunger.  ""The decline in food insecurity and poverty both began before President Trump signed the $2.3 trillion December relief bill into law,"" Winship said. ""I think the American Rescue Plan could be responsible for the more recent decline though."" The economy has also been rebounding since pandemic rules have loosened, said Michael Tanner, an expert on poverty at the libertarian Cato Institute.  ""The number of people who are food insecure has declined, but we just passed this thing,"" Tanner said, referring to the American Rescue Plan. ""The idea that is what is having the impact seems to stretch credulity a bit."" Biden said after the American Rescue Plan’s food and nutrition assistance, ""hunger is already sharply down in the United States."" The number of adults who have told the Census that they sometimes or often don’t have enough food in the past week declined this spring. The decline coincided with the American Rescue Plan, signed into law in March, which included a new round of stimulus checks and food assistance programs. But there are a lot of moving parts that have contributed to the hunger decline, including previous legislation, schools reopening and the recovering economy. We rate this statement Mostly True.

Renewables weren't primary factor in Texas' mid-April power crunch
","In mid-April, the Texas power grid was faced with a dilemma that looked dangerously familiar to the conditions that led to the February blackouts during the deadly winter freeze: Electricity supply was struggling to keep up with demand.   The Electric Reliability Council of Texas assured Texans that the mid-April tightness in the energy market wouldn't lead to any widespread blackouts, but the situation produced more questions about the grid’s overall reliability. In a reprise of the blame casting that occurred in the aftermath of the February blackouts, many observers pointed fingers at the state’s renewable energy generators.   ""Conventional generators are very thin right now because Texas has gone to so many renewables,"" Institute for Energy Research CEO Robert Bradley told the Houston Republic, a website within the network of pay-for-play local news sites owned by Metric Media.   The Houston Republic article, published April 16, was one of many that began appearing on Metric Media websites targeting renewable energy. Another Metric Media article, based on comments from a renewable energy subsidy opposition group, ran the same day with the headline: ""Texas was once again at the mercy of wind generation — and it did not come through.""  Several of these articles were pushed to online audiences via paid promotion on Facebook. Investigations from The New York Times and Colombia Journalism Review have identified Metric Media as a network of sites masquerading as local news. Over 1,300 sites have been launched across the nation, including 74 in Texas. According to the investigations, the media company accepts payment from clients, most with a conservative viewpoint, in exchange for tailor-made news articles. ""The sites appear as ordinary local-news outlets, with names like Des Moines Sun, Ann Arbor Times and Empire State Today. They employ simple layouts and articles about local politics, community happenings and sometimes national issues, much like any local newspaper,"" the Times reported. ""But behind the scenes, many of the stories are directed by political groups and corporate P.R. firms to promote a Republican candidate or a company, or to smear their rivals.""  It’s unclear what money, if any, is behind the April 16 articles published in Texas. A spokesperson for the Institute for Energy Research said that the group’s leadership is unfamiliar with Metric Media, ""which probably means no payments have been made."" The article’s author, Juliette Fairley, declined an interview and forwarded questions to a Metric Media editor, who did not respond.   The institute declined to identify its donors, saying disclosure is against its policy. According to Republic Report, a site that tracks how money influences policy decisions, the Institute for Energy Research was founded in 1989 from the remains of the Institute for Humane Studies – Texas, a defunct non-profit for which Charles Koch served as a founding director. Koch, chairman and CEO of the refining and chemicals company Koch Industries and a benefactor of many conservative causes, is not on the institute's board.  Bradley’s comments, and those of other interest groups, appear at a time when Texas legislators are sorting through a variety of policy fixes — some large, some small. Ultimately, Bradley said he hopes to see policies that limit the proliferation of renewables in the Texas grid.   ""We need a lot less wind and a lot more natural gas and even coal,"" he told the Houston Republic. ""There have been coal retirements and some of those ought to probably come back for the summer. Texas has reached the limit of our renewable dependence. There certainly should not be any more wind or solar for the grid.""  But is it accurate to attribute Texas’ mid-April energy crunch to renewable sources? We found that there are two ways of answering this question, by looking at the direct and indirect causes.  Energy demand in Texas regularly peaks in the summer and winter months, but not during spring and fall when temperate weather slackens demand. This makes the fall and spring seasons prime time for generators to go offline for repairs and maintenance. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas requires all generators to complete these check-ups by May 15, before demand begins to ramp up in the hot summer months.   During an April 13 ERCOT board meeting, then-grid CEO Bill Magness explained that ""we have a number of units that are appropriately doing their maintenance so that they’re ready for the summer.""  About 32,000 megawatts of power from thermal energy sources — mostly natural gas power plants — were offline on April 13, according to forecasted outage data posted to ERCOT’s website. That’s about half of the grid’s full thermal fleet offline due to maintenance.   During the board meeting, Magness also explained another unexpected factor behind the grid’s plea for energy conservation that day: a weather front that stalled over the western part of the state.   As Magness explained: The weather system ""has been moving hesitantly through the ERCOT system for the past several days, which has impacts not only on raising or lowering temperature, but also on cloud cover that affects solar, changes in the weather that affects wind and what we can expect from wind (turbines). So those sorts of systems add a lot of volatility to forecasting the demand in the supply-side.""  The effect was an underperformance of the state’s renewable energy sources — the stalled weather front calmed the winds and blotted out the sun. Solar energy was about 3,100 megawatts below its expected output that day. Wind sources were between 2,000 and 4,000 megawatts short of expected output that day.   The thermal generator outages and underperforming renewable resources combined to prompt ERCOT to issue its conservation alert. Between 5,000 and 7,000 megawatts of outages were attributable to renewable energy sources, while up to 32,000 megawatts were attributable to thermal energy sources.  To Josh Rhodes, an energy researcher at the University of Texas, attributing the tight reserves on April 13 to renewable energy alone ignores other key factors.   ""It's easy to point to something like that and leave off the fact that half of our thermal fleet was down,"" Rhodes said.  Scott Bruins, a power analyst at the energy research firm Enverus, also attributed the slim reserve margin to more than just the cloudy skies and light wind.   ""The weather isn’t totally to blame for the power supply issues, of course,"" Bruins wrote. ""The large number of units that are offline for maintenance following the winter storm is also driving this shortage.""  Bradley, a fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in an email that he stands by his statement. The mid-April energy shortfall, he said, can be explained by the impact renewable energy proliferation has had on the economics of thermal energy generators. ""Unreliable generation has driven out reliable generation. We have much less baseload capacity because of renewables taking over a large part of the market,"" Bradley said.  Wind and solar generators in Texas certainly have enjoyed support from federal subsidies, in particular the production tax credit, which provides a tax credit of 1 cent to 2 cents per kilowatt-hour for renewable developers, and the investment tax credit, which reimburses developers up to 30% of their capital costs.   The market share these renewable generators have gained has proportionately reduced the share of traditional thermal generators. While wind, for instance, has increased from 3% of the state’s energy mix in 2007 to 23% in 2020, coal has dropped from 37% to 18% over the same time period, ERCOT data shows. Natural gas has remained steady, having increased slightly from 44.5% in 2007 to 46% in 2020.  These market gains, supported by renewable energy subsidies, have ""compromised"" the economics of thermal energy companies, Bradley argues, resulting in ""postponed or foregone investments"" in thermal generation facilities.   ""In the absence of renewables (in a free market), we would have a lot more reliable generation—some combination of capacity that would not have been retired and some new capacity. So even with scheduled maintenance (known to ERCOT) and the renewable drop-off (a surprise but not really), we would have had a thick market (as before renewables),"" he said.  The New York Times investigation reported that while Metric Media sites ""generally do not post information that is outright false, the operation is rooted in deception, eschewing hallmarks of news reporting like fairness and transparency.""   That modus operandi appears to be at play here too.   There’s a kernel of truth to Bradley’s statement — renewable energy did falter in April due to weather patterns, and renewable energy has had an indirect impact on thermal energy investments. But the Houston Republic article only focuses on these elements while ignoring the fact that nearly half of the state’s natural gas fleet was offline on April 13 for maintenance.  We rate this claim Mostly False.  Editor's note: This article was updated to correct Charles Koch’s role in the founding of the Institute for Energy Research.",/factchecks/2021/may/10/institute-energy-research/renewables-arent-primary-factor-texas-mid-april-po/

Fact-checking posts about the 2021 National Day of Prayer
","In 1952, President Harry S. Truman signed a joint resolution to establish the National Day of Prayer. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan approved an amendment that set the annual observance to take place on the first Thursday in May. Since then, each president has issued a proclamation to commemorate the day, and it’s been observed in prayer services in Washington, D.C, and around the country. This year, it fell on May 6. And President Joe Biden did the same. But it didn’t take long for social media posts to start circulating that claim lawmakers in Washington ignored the day. ""First time in 70 years the National Day Of Prayer was not observed in our nation’s capital! Are you awake yet!"" read one Facebook post.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There was no in-person service held at its usual location — the U.S. Capitol — in 2021. Rev. Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition sent us a live-streamed video of what appeared to be a small National Day of Prayer gathering outside the Capitol in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Trump administration that year hosted its own service outside of the White House. But it’s wrong to say there was no observance of the National Day of Prayer in the nation’s capital under Biden, who is a practicing Catholic.  First, Biden issued the traditional presidential proclamation designating the day: ""The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a ""National Day of Prayer,"" the proclamation reads. ""NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6, 2021, as a National Day of Prayer. I invite the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, for our many freedoms and blessings, and I join all people of faith in prayers for spiritual guidance, mercy, and protection."" Biden also joined Pray.com in a pre-recorded message for an online National Day of Prayer event. It was broadcast on Pray.com, SiriusXM channel 154, Direct TV, Audacy and multiple Facebook groups. Biden’s message can be viewed around the 2:08:00 mark in the video. ""I want to thank you all for praying for our nation,"" Biden says in the recording. ""I join you in these prayers today and every day. I know how much it matters because I've seen the power of prayer in my own life. Like so many of you, prayer has nourished my soul and delivers strength and hope and guidance when I needed it most."" The National Day of Prayer Task Force also hosted a virtual event.  While Trump held a service for the day in the White House Rose Garden in 2020, not every president opts to host an event. The Capitol building, where an annual prayer service for the day is typically held, has been closed to public tours amid the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to operate under increased security measures since the Jan. 6 riots.  Facebook posts claim that, for the first time in 70 years, the 2021 National Day of Prayer wasn’t observed at the capital. There was no public prayer service held at the U.S. Capitol, as there has been in some years, but the day was still observed. Biden issued the typical presidential proclamation designating the day and participated in a virtual event in which he spoke to the power of prayer in his life. The Capitol building is closed to public tours amid the COVID-19 pandemic and has been operating under increased security ever since pro-Trump activists breached security and attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6.

US Senate candidate right about North Carolina body cam vote
","A Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in North Carolina says he was among a small group of legislators who opposed the so-called ""body camera law"" that permits a judge to shield footage of Andrew Brown Jr.’s death from the public. Brown, 42, was killed on April 21 while Pasquotank County deputies served drug-related search and arrest warrants at his house in Elizabeth City. A private autopsy requested by Brown’s family shows he was shot five times and suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the back of the head. Brown’s family believes body camera footage will show that Brown never threatened police and was unjustly killed.  However, a Superior Court judge on April 28 refused to release the video to the public. A state law gives judges discretion over whether to make such footage public. Senate candidate Jeff Jackson recently tweeted about his record on the issue as a member of the state Senate. ""In 2016, then Gov. [Pat] McCrory signed HB 972 into law. It had passed the state Senate 48-2. I was one of the 2 who voted against it,"" he tweeted May 3. One of Jackson’s opponents in the Democratic primary, Erica Smith, also served in North Carolina’s state Senate at the time. McCrory is also running for the US Senate seat, on the Republican side. So, given the national attention on North Carolina’s body cam law amid the Senate race, we wondered: Is Jackson telling the truth? The answer is yes. In 2016, North Carolina lawmakers gave judges discretion over the release of body camera videos when they passed House Bill 972. Then Gov. Pat McCrory, who is now running for U.S. Senate on the Republican side, signed the bill into law. Prior to HB 972, UNC legal experts said the status of the recordings under the state’s public records laws had been unclear. An existing law ""meant that the public had no right of access to the recordings, but the law enforcement agency could release them in its discretion,"" UNC expert Frayda Bluestein wrote in 2016. In Brown’s case, his family says they were shown only 20 seconds of footage captured by body cameras on Pasquotank County deputies.  So they appealed to Superior Court, which HB 972 gives them the right to do. The judge ruled that Brown’s family can see more of the video, but he refused to release it to the media. While the ACLU called HB 927 a ""shameful"" attempt to hide facts from the public, the bill passed with bipartisan support in the legislature. For the final state House vote, 20 Democrats joined the Republican majority in supporting the bill — including current minority leader Rep. Robert Reives. In the state Senate, Jackson was the only Democrat to vote against the bill. The other opponent was Republican Chad Barefoot. Jackson explained his position when asked about the bill in an election debate that October. ""I voted against it because it enabled a situation where, if you were mistreated by the police, say, when you were stopped for a speeding ticket, it made it very difficult for you to see the video even if you yourself were pictured in that video. You have to go to court if the police say no. And then once you go to court, it’s really difficult to win because you have to prove that the police abused their discretion, which is the highest civil standard under the law."" PolitiFact North Carolina in 2016 checked a claim similar to the quote Jackson gave in the debate, finding it to be True. Smith, one of Jackson’s opponents in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate, also served in the state Senate at the time. She voted to pass it. In a Twitter message exchange with a PolitiFact reporter, Smith focused on the positives of the bill while saying reform is still needed. ""Along with almost the entire Democratic caucus, I voted for the bill to guarantee that officers' body cams and dash cams would remain on at all times, increasing accountability and ensuring that there would always be footage. I believed at the time, as I believe now, that the process to release that footage was made far too restrictive and support the ongoing efforts to reform that. Given the realities of the NCGA at the time, I wanted to ensure that we did what we could to increase accountability albeit a flawed piece of legislation that we had aspirations of returning to and improving."" Smith has been speaking to protestors in Elizabeth City about the need for more transparency in policing. Other candidates in North Carolina’s U.S. Senate race didn’t serve in the legislature. Jackson said he was ""one of the 2 (state Senators) who voted against"" North Carolina’s body camera law.

Kamala Harris said corruption costs as much as 5% of the world's GDP. That stat is questionable
","For more than a decade, an interesting statistic about the cost of corruption has been bouncing around the global-economics community, showing up in statements and reports from organizations like the United Nations and the World Economic Forum. Most recently, it came out of the mouth of Vice President Kamala Harris. ""Around the world, we know that corruption inhibits shared prosperity,"" Harris said May 4, at a conference on the Americas, where she touted the Biden administration’s plans to address the root causes of immigration. ""In fact, the global cost of corruption is as much as 5% of the world's GDP."" ""Five percent,"" she repeated for emphasis. How accurate is that number? When we went to check it, we couldn’t really tell. It turns out that while it’s an often-cited statistic, no one could tell us where the estimate ultimately comes from, or what data or research was used to come up with it. The White House told PolitiFact that Harris was citing data previously shared by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. In December 2018, to commemorate International Anti-Corruption Day, Guterres issued a statement that said, in part: ""The World Economic Forum estimates that the cost of corruption is at least $2.6 trillion — or 5% of global gross domestic product."" Guterres also mentioned the 5% in September 2018 during a meeting with the U.N. Security Council, according to U.N. meeting notes. Neither the statement nor the meeting notes link to a report on that 5% estimate or include footnotes about it. We reached out to the U.N. and to the World Economic Forum for details. The U.N. did not respond, and the World Economic Forum told us to contact the U.N. We also reached out to organizations that published a 2008 report titled, ""Clean Business is Good Business: The Business Case against Corruption."" That report had a ""Facts & Figures"" section that also included the 5% estimate. Gary Kalman, director of the U.S. office of Transparency International, an organization that co-authored the 2008 report, told us that his office has backed away from using the figure in recent years, because they are not exactly sure of its provenance or what methodology was used for the estimate. ""I don't know that it's wrong,"" Kalman said. ""I just can't prove that it's right."" Anecdotal evidence would suggest that the 5% estimate is not that far off the mark, Kalman said, ""but we don't have solid research to confirm that."" ""I think people have used that figure over the last 10 to 15 years because it came from credible sources,"" Kalman said. ""But the more people look into it, the more they back away from that figure."" The 2008 report cited the World Bank as the source of the facts and figures. Jim Anderson, a lead governance specialist at the World Bank, told PolitiFact that the statistic ""has been circulating for some time, but we are unaware of the specific source."" Anderson provided methodology details for another statistic in the report, which said that over $1 trillion is paid in bribes each year. The bribery figure was in a paper prepared by researchers at the World Bank Institute in 2005, he said. Matthew C. Stephenson, a professor at Harvard Law School, wrote a blog post in 2016 arguing that ""it’s time to abandon"" the popular line that corruption costs about $2.6 trillion, or about 5% of the global GDP. (Harris’ statement didn’t include the dollar figure.) Stephenson, whose expertise includes anti-corruption law, wrote that he had not been able to find a definitive source for the corruption-cost estimate but offered his best guess as to where it came from. He believed that someone had misread studies, including the 2005 World Bank paper, about the volume of money laundering, and then did their own calculations related to the global GDP cost. (Here’s Stephenson’s detailed explanation.) ""If something like that is indeed what happened, then the $2.6 trillion/5% of GDP figure is completely, totally, and utterly bogus — a made-up number based on a misreading, and possibly a mistranscription, of an estimate of something entirely different: the amount, not the cost, of worldwide money laundering, not worldwide corruption,"" Stephenson wrote. A paper published last month, co-authored by Stephenson, reviewed 10 of the most widely cited statements about corruption and included among them the claim: ""Corruption costs the global economy approximately US$2.6 trillion, or 5% of global GDP, each year."" The paper said that the claim’s source is ""obscure"" and its validity ""unfounded."" This statistic — cited by the U.N. and other reputable organizations — ""appears to have no basis whatsoever,"" the paper said. ""No organisation or advocate should cite this statistic under any circumstances."" Why does the 5% keep making its way to speeches? ""People want to include specific numbers in their speeches and publications,"" Stephenson told PolitiFact. ""Once a statistic is cited in a prominent source, it’s easy for others to find it and copy it, with the result that the statistic seems more credible because it’s cited so often — an echo chamber effect."" We informed the White House about the dubious origin of the figure Harris cited and were told by a spokesperson that we should reach out to the U.N. directly if we were ""taking issue with how they characterize something."" Although corruption is a very serious problem, coming up with cost estimates is very difficult, in great part because it’s a hidden activity, experts said. ""If bribes, even small ones, lead to evasion of building or environmental inspections, the costs could be catastrophic,"" Anderson said. ""What would be the cost of bribes associated with faulty equipment or medicines in a pandemic? A road of poor quality due to corruption is not only expensive, it can cause loss of life, property damage, and loss of goods in transit. For these reasons, the costs of corruption are much more than simple volumes of bribery."" A 2019 report from the International Monetary Fund said its research suggests that revenues are higher in countries that are perceived to be less corrupt. ""The least corrupt governments collect 4% of GDP more in taxes than those at the same level of economic development with the highest levels of corruption,"" the report said. The IMF said that in the past two decades, some countries had been able to tackle corruption, and if all countries were to reduce corruption in a similar way, they could gain $1 trillion in lost tax revenues, or 1.25% of global GDP. The precise number on the global cost of corruption is probably not that important, experts said. If the global cost of corruption was 3% or 7% of global GDP, instead of 5%, ""it would not have made much difference to the point that Vice President Harris, or others who use this figure, are trying to make,"" Stephenson said. ""It’s more like a decorative statistic,"" he said, ""which may be why nobody checks it."" Harris said, ""The global cost of corruption is as much as 5% of the world's GDP."" Harris cited a figure that’s been popularly used by reputable organizations for more than a decade. But the methodology for that assessment is unclear. Organizations that have used that figure did not provide details supporting the estimate. One expert said that the 5% estimate is plausible, but had no data to confirm it.

Would protecting 30% of the world’s land and waters hurt 300 million people?
","As part of his plan to put the brakes on climate change, President Joe Biden set a goal of conserving 30% of America’s land and waters by 2030. For land in particular, that’s a heavy lift — only about 12% of the nation’s land is now under some form of protection. Biden’s target is part of a larger international ambition to protect a third of the world’s land and waters by 2030. On a global scale, the protected regions would do a lot of work to pull carbon from the air and store it in the soil, coral reefs, sea grasses and other carbon sinks. The effort goes under name 30 by 30, or 30x30. But some advocates for indigenous peoples see a threat in the international push to protect land. One of those groups, Survival International, calls the global 30x30 plan ""the biggest land grab in history."" Survival International sees the 30x30 initiative as driving people off the land their communities may have occupied for hundreds of years, without giving them a fair voice in the process. ""Three hundred million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples,"" the group said in a message posted to its website on Earth Day, April 22. The 300 million figure, almost as much as the population of the U.S., is a very large number. We dug in to see where that figure comes from, and whether it represents a reasonable estimate of the likely harm due to the 30x30 plan. Backers of the 30x30 initiative question Survival International’s reasoning. They say that the plan is designed to strengthen the rights of indigenous people to stay on their land and maintain a traditional way of life — that conservation doesn’t necessarily mean eviction. Independent experts, meanwhile, see the 300 million figure as a reasonable estimate of how many people live in or near areas that are prime for conservation. But they don’t agree that the number accurately reflects how many could lose their land in the context of 30x30. A group of 51 countries, led by Costa Rica, France and the United Kingdom, are pressing to see the 30x30 goal adopted at a major international gathering on biodiversity taking place in China in October. The group includes nations from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania and the Americas. Protecting indigenous peoples ranks at the top of their priorities. ""Indigenous peoples and local communities are protectors of the most biodiverse sites in the world,"" the group wrote when they launched Jan. 11, 2021. ""To effectively and equitably meet this increased target, they should be engaged as partners in the design and management of these conserved areas."" Brian O’Donnell, director of Colorado-based Campaign for Nature, backs the 30x30 effort. He objects to the characterization by Survival International. ""They have redefined our policies and our intent,"" O’Donnell said. ""Our aim is to safeguard and secure more rights for indigenous people. Getting land tenure rights for indigenous people is the pathway to reach 30x30."" O’Donnell said there is no dispute that conservation efforts have displaced people and led to human rights abuses in the past. He also said the current draft of the biodiversity framework slated for a vote in October should change.  ""It’s a work in progress,"" he said. ""There are some safeguards in there now for indigenous people, but they need to be stronger."" Staff at Survival International said they derived their estimate of 300 million from a 2019 study that looked at a more ambitious goal of protecting half of the world’s land and waters from development.  A team led by a University of Cambridge researcher estimated that at that 50% level, at least 1 billion people live in areas that would fall under some form of protection. Survival International staff said that in a follow-up email to a partner group — the Rainforest Foundation UK — the Cambridge researcher said preservation of 30% of land and water would affect about 297 million people. Survival International added its own take on the study. Where the researchers warned of potential problems with that level of protection, Survival International expressed it more definitively: that the 30x30 plan ""will increase human suffering and the destruction of nature. It is a deadly distraction from what is urgently needed to secure human diversity and all biodiversity: the recognition of indigenous peoples’ rights to their land."" One clarification: Survival International said in its article that ""most"" of the 300 million people potentially affected would be indigenous or tribal people. But when pressed, the group's staff said it’s not clear that it would be a majority. They told us they should have said ""many."" There are countless examples in history of indigenous people being forced off their land in the name  of conservation. In Botswana, the government banned the San people  of the Kalahari desert from their traditional lands to boost tourism and mining. In Thailand, two national park officials were charged with the murder of an indigenous human rights defender in 2019. The government later sought to have the forest that the activist had fought over designated as a UNESCO world heritage site. In the U.S., Montana’s Glacier National Park was carved out of land used by the Blackfeet Nation. Initially, tribe members had negotiated to hold on to hunting and fishing rights. But when the park was created in 1910, they lost everything. The abuses continue today, and there’s no guarantee that they won’t happen under the 30x30 initiative. But protecting land doesn’t have to entail displacing people. It is a risk, not a certainty. And the extent of that risk depends on how the land is protected. Globally, policies in the category of conservation vary, from cutting off all human activity, to allowing traditional practices, to allowing other sustainable uses. Each nation can craft its own rules for each situation. In the U.S., the interplay of legislation, an open public process and executive decisions have produced places where many uses are allowed, and others where there are no roads and no permanent residences. Researcher Stephen Garnett at Charles Darwin University in Australia cautioned that Survival International’s 300 million estimate, when applied to 30x30, is shaky for two reasons. First, we can’t know for sure which lands would be conserved under the plan. Second, the 30x30 strategy doesn’t hinge on setting land aside in a way that would ban farming or other land uses. Garnett says Australia has approached this by designating ""Indigenous Protected Areas"" to make sure aboriginal residents can continue to live on and use the land as they always have. They make up nearly half of Australia’s conserved areas, he said. A quick look at Survival International’s own website shows the pitfalls of treating all types of conservation projects as a threat to indigenous people. One news brief focuses on a tribe in India protesting their eviction from traditional honey-gathering sites inside the Nagarhole National Park. With backing from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the land is now a refuge for tigers, and a source of tourism dollars. But another bulletin tells the story of an indigenous group in Peru that wants an international human rights commission to enforce protections for land that was supposed to be kept as a tribal reserve. The Peruvian government, the post said, had reactivated logging, oil and gas concessions in these areas. Both are examples of conservation efforts. But in the first case, conservation leads to the eviction of people. In the second, conservation is a tool to protect traditional uses of the land. Survival International campaign director Fiore Longo acknowledged in an email to PolitiFact that the terms can get confusing, and ""we have to see what a protected area means and which model is applied where."" But in the dire prediction on its website that 30x30 would put 300 million people at risk, Survival International doesn’t spell out those nuances. ""The main assumption to yield a number like that is that anyone in a future protected area would get kicked out,"" said University of Maryland ecology professor Erle Ellis. ""This is not the intention of anyone working on 30x30."" Survival International said under the 30x30 plan, ""300 million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples."" The 300 million figure is derived from a study on the impact of land conservation efforts, but not the 30x30 initiative specifically. While conservation efforts have led to forced evictions in the past, that’s not always the case, and the assumption that 30x30 would do so runs counter to the stated priorities of the nations pressing for the plan.  Survival International said it should have said ""many"" not ""most"" of the 300 million would be indigenous people. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Erpenbach overstates claim that there are 'no strings attached' to federal funds to expand Medicaid
","Republicans on the Wisconsin Legislature’s budget-writing committee dashed the hopes of their Democratic counterparts who were looking for the state to expand Medicaid, as Gov. Tony Evers proposed in his upcoming budget.  Wisconsin is one of a dozen states that has not adopted the Medicaid expansion, which would lean on federal funds to broaden eligibility for the program to people with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level instead of the current 100%.  Evers initially proposed the expansion in his first state budget, but the provision was quickly stripped out by Republican lawmakers.  He tried again this year, though Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, told reporters in March he would not agree to it. On April 30, 2021, the Republican co-chairs of the budget-writing committee announced that the proposal would be among 280 items they plan to remove from the governor’s budget.  It comes as a blow to Democratic lawmakers who have long pushed for the expansion, including state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-West Point.  In a March 21, 2021 appearance on Capitol City Sunday, Erpenbach said it was time for Republicans to ""do the right thing"" and adopt the expansion to make tens of thousands more Wisconsinites eligible for BadgerCare.  This time around, the expansion would come with more than $1 billion dollars in tax savings under a provision of the federal government’s pandemic relief legislation, meant to induce the 12 states that have not yet expanded health care coverage to do so.  ""There’s no strings attached to that money that we’d be getting as an incentive to expand Medicaid,"" Erpenbach said.  Is he correct? Let’s dig in.  By ""no strings attached,"" the senator meant Wisconsin does not have to do anything besides expanding Medicaid to obtain those additional dollars, a spokesperson for his office said.  The financial incentive to expand eligibility is a temporary 5% increase to the funding Wisconsin receives from the federal government to help pay for Medicaid, which is known as the federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP.  Currently, the state receives matching funds for about 60% of the costs of the program, according to a March 9, 2021, memo from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. States that expanded Medicaid were eligible for enhanced matching funds, and the 5% increase that would come on top of that for two years.  The fiscal bureau estimates that Wisconsin would receive incentive funding that amounts to a total savings of a little over $1 billion dollars in the next biennium. If Republicans keep their current stance, Wisconsin will have given up more than $3 billion in federal funds by 2023.  Whether Erpenbach is on target that there are no strings attached to that money, though, depends on your interpretation of strings. He’s correct that the state would not have to do anything besides expand the program to get the incentive money — though to be sure, the expansion would take time and effort to accomplish.  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that Wisconsin would ""likely see fiscal gain"" under expansion, even though it was the only state to partially expand the program without accepting federal help.  Republicans, on the other hand, see many strings attached to expanding Medicaid and thus receiving the bonus money.  State Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, a co-chair of the budget-writing committee, called the incentive money a ""federal bribe … to expand that welfare program"" and said private insurance gives people better health care coverage. (We rated False the claim about private insurance vs. Medicaid.)  Republicans also worry about the consequences of pushing more costs onto health care providers who receive lower reimbursements from Medicaid than they do from private insurance, and have argued that the federal government could backtrack on its financial support of the program at a later date, causing the state to pick up more of the cost.  And although the bonus money is estimated to offset states’ expansion costs for the first two years, once the FMAP returns to its regular rate, Wisconsin will be responsible for a portion of the program’s costs.  Erpenbach said there are ""no strings attached"" to the financial incentive Wisconsin could currently receive from the federal government to expand Medicaid.  He’s right that there are no hidden strings attached to the money — that all the state would have to do is accept the expansion to receive it.  Still, there are long-term responsibilities attached to that action, even if there are also long-term benefits.  Our definition of Half True is that ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here. ",/factchecks/2021/may/07/jon-erpenbach/erpenbach-overstates-claim-there-are-no-strings-at/

And posts on social media falsely suggest that the audit showed Trump was overtaking Biden.  A widely shared Instagram post claimed: ""Preliminary audit showed Trump ahead by 250,000.

He added that under the contract for the audit, no preliminary findings are to be released. A spokesperson for the audit did not reply to our email. Final official results of the November election showed Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, 1,040,774 votes to 995,665, or by about 2% of the vote.

Cyber Ninjas is headed by Doug Logan, who promoted ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.  The conservative One America News Network, which has aired falsehoods about the 2020 election, set up a nine-camera livestream for the audit, which is being conducted at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix.

No findings have been released from an ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Maricopa County, Ariz., that is being conducted by firms hired by Arizona Senate Republicans.

Tucker Carlson’s misleading claim about deaths after COVID-19 vaccine
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that thousands of Americans have died since December because of the COVID-19 vaccines, citing an unverified federal database that has become a breeding ground for anti-vaccine misinformation. The comments were the latest in a series of controversial remarks by Carlson raising doubts about the vaccines, which clinical trials and real-world studies have shown are both safe and effective.  ""Between late December of 2020 and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccine in the United States — 3,362,"" Carlson told millions of viewers during his primetime TV show May 5. ""That’s an average of roughly 30 people every day."" ""The actual number is almost certainly higher than that, perhaps vastly higher than that,"" he added. ""It’s clear that what is happening now, for whatever reason, is not even close to normal."" Carlson said he was citing numbers from the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, an open-source database often misused by anti-vaccine activists to make false claims about vaccine safety. Experts rejected Carlson’s claim as misleading. That’s because VAERS data is considered unreliable for drawing causal conclusions. And dying after a vaccine is not the same thing as dying because of the vaccine. ""It is exceptionally irresponsible for this man to claim that all these are causal associations. It’s wrong,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, the chair of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. ""He puts people’s lives at risk with bad information during a pandemic."" Unlike other official government sources, which flow through consistent reporting channels and get screened by statisticians and analysts before they are made available to the public, VAERS is an open-access system. The reports submitted are not verified before they become public. ""Anybody can report to it,"" Offit said. ""If I get a vaccine, or I give my child a vaccine, and I believe that they have turned into the ‘Incredible Hulk,’ then I can write up a one-page report online and submit it, and that then is included. And that’s been done."" A disclaimer on the VAERS website says the ""reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness,"" in part because they ""may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information."" People accessing the database must click an option that says that they’ve read and understand the disclaimer. Offit said VAERS works best as ""a hypothesis-generating mechanism"" that can tip scientists off to issues for further study, such as the rare cases of blood clots that prompted the agency to recommend a temporary pause on use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.  In this case, the CDC has analyzed all the reports of death among COVID-19 vaccine recipients that were submitted to VAERS between Dec. 14, 2020, and May 3.  ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" the agency concluded. To establish causation, scientists need to find proof that an adverse event is significantly more common among vaccinated people than unvaccinated people. VAERS doesn’t provide enough data to do that. As of May 5, nearly 150 million Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and many of the early shots went to older and more vulnerable people. ""When you’re giving a COVID-19 vaccine to elderly adults, there are going to be people who die shortly after vaccination because they would have died anyway,"" Dr. William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’s International Vaccine Access Center, previously told PolitiFact. An estimated 8,000 Americans die every day of all causes, according to the CDC. Offit cited the case of baseball legend Hank Aaron, who died of natural causes — likely a stroke — weeks after getting his shot. Social media posts falsely claimed the vaccine killed him. ""You can get the vaccine and still die from other reasons,"" Offit said. After his segment baselessly linking the COVID-19 vaccines to ""roughly 30"" deaths per day, Carlson interviewed Martin Kulldorff, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Kulldorff told Carlson that VAERS is ""not a very useful system,"" in part because it doesn’t take into account ""what is expected by chance"" in terms of adverse reactions. Carlson has questioned the vaccines and U.S. vaccination efforts on several occasions. In April, we rated Pants on Fire his claim that, ""Maybe it doesn’t work, and they’re simply not telling you that."" Fox News defended that statement by pointing to other instances where Carlson claimed to support vaccines, such as when he said he is ""pretty pro-vaccine."" Elsewhere in his May 5 segment, Carlson similarly said the ""vaccines aren’t dangerous"" based on ""the official numbers."" But his claim about thousands of deaths is wrong. On Facebook, a video of the claim was viewed more than 155,000 times, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.  The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The articles were based on a May 1 article by the National File website about a report made April 22 to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, or VAERS.  The federal database, used for reporting and monitoring adverse reactions after vaccines, is maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. The report says a 15-year-old male in Colorado received a dose of the Pfizer vaccine on April 18, was not hospitalized and died April 20 from what is listed as heart failure. Under the category of ""History/Allergies"" is listed: ""No,Nothing""; and for ""Current illness,"" the response is: ""No."" Jesscia Bralish, spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said the CDC ""has confirmed that they are investigating this report,"" but that she couldn’t provide more information. The CDC said in a statement that there are no circumstances under which a 15-year-old would have been eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, but that it investigates all reports in VAERS that are classified as serious, including death, life-threatening illness or hospitalization. ""If an unexpected adverse event is seen, experts quickly assess whether it is a true safety concern,"" the statement said. KDVR-TV, a Fox affiliate in Denver, did a news story on the VAERS report being made, noting that anyone can make a VAERS report. We didn’t find any other mainstream media news stories about the report. The CDC and the FDA warn that reports of adverse events — in other words, possible side effects — made to the VAERS database do not indicate whether an adverse event is linked to, or caused by a vaccine. The reports, which can be made by anyone and are not verified, are intended as an early warning system to detect possible safety problems. Incomplete VAERS data is often used in conjunction with false claims about vaccine safety. More than 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through May 3, 2021, and VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the CDC.  ""CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports,"" the CDC says on its website. ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" The vaccines are available to people age 16 and older. The Associated Press reported May 4 that the FDA was expected to authorize Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for youngsters ages 12 to 15 within the next week, according to a federal official and a person familiar with the process, setting up shots for many adolescents before the beginning of the next school year. National File calling the Pfizer vaccine ""experimental"" is apparently a reference to the fact that the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by the FDA, rather than having been given final FDA approval. The clinical trial results and other requirements for emergency use are little different from what is required for final approval. To qualify for emergency use, the new drugs must be fully tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. A widely circulated headline claimed: ""15-year-old boy passes away from heart attack two days after Pfizer COVID-19 experimental jab."" There has not been any confirmation that such a death occurred.  The headline comes from a report made to what is known as the federal VAERS database. Reports can be made by anyone and are not verified before being entered into the database, which is intended as an early warning system for possible side effects to vaccines. Authorities say they investigate all reports classified as serious, including deaths, and they have not commented on the investigation of the Colorado report. With no evidence that the statement is accurate, we rate it False.",/factchecks/2021/may/06/blog-posting/report-teen-died-2-days-after-covid-shot-was-unver/
"['Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie exaggerates about Joe Biden capital-gains tax proposal
","One of the most durable arguments made by Republicans is that they stand united against tax-hike proposals made by Democrats.  Recently, former New Jersey governor and 2016 presidential candidate Chris Christie took aim at one of President Joe Biden’s tax proposals. ""You’re going to see a lot more focus on the huge increase in the family business tax that Joe Biden is proposing — that any family who tries to pass a business or a farm down to their son or daughter or grandson or granddaughter are going to pay a huge new tax, and going to be forced to potentially sell their farm, sell their business to pay that tax,"" Christie said during a May 2 appearance on ABC’s ""This Week."" There’s something to what Christie says, but he’s exaggerated the scope of the impact. (Christie’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The tax increase Christie is referring to stems from Biden's proposed American Families Plan, which includes investments in free early childhood education and community college, as well as investments and tax cuts for families with children. To help pay for the new spending proposals, Biden would raise certain taxes that hit wealthier households. (The tax hikes appear to fit within Biden’s promise not to raise taxes on American households earning less than $400,000 a year.) First, Biden would increase the top marginal tax rate — the one levied on the last dollars earned by the wealthiest taxpayers — from its current 37% to 39.6%, which was the top rate until President Donald Trump signed a major tax law in 2017. For 2021, this top rate is set to kick in at $523,601 for individuals and $628,301 for married couples filing jointly. In addition, Biden proposes having households making over $1 million pay that 39.6% rate not only for ordinary income, but also for capital gains. Capital gains — which are the profits earned from the sale of an asset — are currently taxed at a maximum of 20%, plus an existing 3.8% tax called the net investment income tax. Finally, Biden proposes changing the rules about how to tax unrealized capital gains — the appreciation in value of an unsold asset — when the owner dies and passes the asset to heirs. Currently, wealthy families can pass an asset, such as stocks or art, to their heirs tax-free as long as their gains are unrealized — that is, if the items aren’t sold. The Biden administration argues that this allows wealth to accumulate untaxed for generations, increasing inequality. Biden would impose a tax when a family passes down assets with unrealized capital gains. The proposal would shield the first $1 million in unrealized gains, or $2.5 million per couple when combined with existing real estate exemptions. When you put all these proposals together, Biden wants to tax unrealized capital gains above $1 million on assets being passed to heirs, at a 39.6% rate. Under current law, those unrealized gains would not be taxed at all. (A footnote: None of these changes involve the estate tax, which is levied on large estates after death. Biden has not announced any changes to the estate tax.) So Biden’s proposals may entail some big tax bills for very large asset transfers. But how common would these be? Christie goes too far when he says that ""any family"" would get hit by these tax hikes when passing assets to heirs. For starters, in announcing its proposal, the White House said that ""the reform will be designed with protections so that family-owned businesses and farms will not have to pay taxes when given to heirs who continue to run the business."" The White House told PolitiFact that ""so long as the business stays in the family, there will be no tax due.""  If that policy makes it into law, then Christie’s assertion would be flat wrong.  Since no legislation has been drawn up yet, we’ll grant Christie a bit of space to speculate about how the policy could evolve. The more problematic side of Christie’s claim is that only a tiny number of extremely wealthy households would be affected in any given year — not ""any family,"" as he says. Federal Reserve data showed that in 2018, only 3% of households had more than $1 million in unrealized gains, according to calculations by Robert McClelland, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. If any of those households sold assets, and realized those capital gains, to fund their retirement, the share would be even smaller, he said. Other data backs up the idea that the number of businesses at risk would be small. About 92% of businesses have annual revenues less than $1 million, and some fraction of those above that threshold are publicly held and thus not subject to Biden’s tax changes. The connection between a particular business’s annual revenues and its value if it were sold varies widely by industry sector and other factors. But on average, businesses sell for 0.6 times annual revenue, according to BizBuySell, a national business marketplace. These numbers do suggest that the vast majority of American businesses are relatively small in value, and the smaller a business is, the more likely it is to escape any impact from Biden’s tax changes. Certainly, Biden’s proposals wouldn’t affect ""any family"" passing a business to the next generation. 
As for farms, McClelland said that when he was working for the Congressional Budget Office in 2005, his office published a report that identified only 1,659 estates of farmers in 2000 that had assets worth more than $1 million, out of some 2 million farms total at the time. That’s less than one-tenth of 1% of all farms. Even if the number of farm estates worth more than $1 million has mushroomed 100-fold in the 21 years since, that would still be just 8% of all farm estates. And given that taxes would be levied under Biden’s proposal only if the difference between the current value of the assets and the purchase price exceeded $1 million, and only when the asset changes hands, the number at risk of being taxed at any given time would likely be even smaller still. Christie said, ""Joe Biden is proposing that any family who tries to pass a business or a farm down to their son or daughter or grandson or granddaughter are going to pay a huge new tax."" Biden is proposing a series of new taxes that could hit large inheritances in a significant way. But Christie is wrong to frame these as hitting ""any family"" passing down a business within the family. The White House says it will explicitly rule out this possibility when the formal legislation is written. But even if such protections aren’t enacted, the increased taxation would target only a small number of very wealthy families, since few businesses and farms have unrealized capital gains of $1 million or more. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/may/06/chris-christie/chris-christie-exaggerates-about-joe-biden-tax-pro/

Washington Post is still fact-checking Joe Biden
","On April 28, political commentator Brandon Tatum posted an image to Facebook claiming that the Washington Post would no longer fact-check President Joe Biden. ""Washington Post ends fact-checking for Biden for the remainder of his presidency,"" it reads.  But Biden isn’t getting a free pass from the Post’s ""Pinocchios."" Just three hours after Tatum posted the image, the Washington Post published a fact-check of Biden’s 100-day speech that dinged him for a variety of false or misleading claims.  The Facebook post is wrong and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what really happened: During the Trump administration, the Washington Post’s Fact Checker maintained a database, or list of fact checks searchable by topic, source and date.  The Post maintained a similar database for Biden’s first 100 days. But on April 26, Glenn Kessler, editor and chief reporter for the Washington Post’s Fact Checker, announced on Twitter that he and his team would no longer maintain a database of Biden fact-checks because of the labor it required to do so.  In the announcement, Kessler explicitly wrote that he and his team would continue to fact-check Biden. ""We have fact-checked Biden rigorously and will continue to do so,"" he wrote.  Nevertheless, some people misinterpreted the announcement, writing that the Post would no longer fact-check Biden and citing it as evidence of media bias.  Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., tweeted, ""Imagine having the slogan ‘Democracy dies in darkness’ but then shutting down your ‘fact-checking’ division because the President is a Democrat."" (""Democracy dies in darkness"" is the official slogan of the paper.) Shani George, vice president of communications for the Washington Post, forwarded us a statement that echoed Kessler’s Twitter thread. ""We took on the task of maintaining a database during the previous presidency in response to unique circumstances,"" she wrote. ""That database started as a 100-day project, and we created a companion project for the current president so a comparison could be made. We are continuing our practice of rigorous, routine fact-checking, which has already identified dozens of false and misleading statements by Biden, and will continue to hold the president accountable for his words."" ""Washington Post ends fact-checking for Biden for the remainder of his presidency,"" reads a Facebook post.  The Washington Post announced that it will no longer update a database of Biden fact-checks but that it will continue to fact-check Biden. Since the announcement, the Washington Post has fact-checked Biden.  We rate this post False. ​",/factchecks/2021/may/06/facebook-posts/washington-post-still-fact-checking-joe-biden/
