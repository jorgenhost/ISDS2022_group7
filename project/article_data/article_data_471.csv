Robert Gibbs says U.S. has been in Afghanistan longer than any foreign war in history
","Liberal pundits are trying to defuse criticism of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy stemming from a new memoir by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. In the book, Gates writes that Obama ""eventually lost faith in the troop increase he ordered in Afghanistan, his doubts fed by top White House civilian advisers opposed to the strategy, who continually brought him negative news reports suggesting it was failing,"" according to the New York Times, which obtained an advance copy. Obama’s former press secretary Robert Gibbs argued on Meet the Press that Obama’s position is not surprising given his pledge to draw down the wars in his first presidential campaign. ""Look, Barack Obama was, and I assume continues to be, skeptical of our military ability to solve Afghanistan,"" Gibbs said. ""We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nation’s history."" For this fact-check, we relied primarily on previous PolitiFact examinations. The conflict in Afghanistan has been running for more than 12 years, since American troops entered the country in 2001. The U.S. began its anti-terror military operations Oct. 7, 2001, about one month after the Sept. 11 attacks. Obama had planned for all troops to be out of Afghanistan by Dec. 31, 2014 -- marking more than 13 years of military there -- though a draft accord leaves as many as 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. That’s longer than the major United States interventions in World War I and World War II. It’s also longer than the conflict in Korea, and both wars in Iraq. The second Iraq war lasted for more than eight years. It began with a U.S.-led military coalition entering the country on March 20, 2003, aimed at finding Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. Obama pulled out the last U.S. troops by the end of December 2011. The closest major conflict to Afghanistan in terms of length is Vietnam. The start date of the Vietnam war is somewhat fuzzy because it escalated slowly with the Eisenhower administration establishing a military presence in South Vietnam in the 1950s. However, most say the war started with the Tonkin Gulf resolution on Aug. 7, 1964, and ended either in 1973 or 1975 -- after about 10 ½ years. So while Gibbs is on solid ground, there are a couple of things worth noting. Gibbs’ measure excludes broader ""wars."" To reach the conclusion that Afghanistan is the longest foreign war in U.S. history, you need to exclude the 46-year-old Cold War and the presence of military forces in South Korea decades after the on-the-ground battle concluded. University of North Carolina historian Richard H. Kohn said in a 2010 interview that some might consider the conflict in Afghanistan part of the ""war on terror."" But by that logic, the wars in Korea and Vietnam also could be considered part of the Cold War. The ""Banana Wars"" in Latin America in the early 20th century lasted longer but didn’t always include active fighting. These wars were not declared wars but ""relatively quick-in-and-out interventions which kept happening over and over,"" said Max Boot, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations and author of The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power. The goal was to preserve U.S. economic, political and strategic interests in various Caribbean-area countries, including Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Panama, said Alan McPherson, a University of Oklahoma professor and author of The Invaded: How Latin Americans and Their Allies Fought and Ended U.S. Occupations. The longest consistent military occupation was in politically unstable Haiti from 1915 to 1934. That does not translate to 19 years of straight fighting, though there were two short periods of wars that were ""nowhere near the fighting we’ve had in Afghanistan,"" McPherson said. The U.S. military presence mainly ran the government. There were 2,000-3,000 marines in Haiti at the height of the U.S. occupation, McPherson said. There were other significant informal wars around this time, including an eight-year presence in the Dominican Republic that saw the U.S. military taking over the government and dissolving the country’s parliament, as well as fighting a six-year rebellion in Nicaragua led by August Cesar Sandino. Our ruling Gibbs said, ""We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nation’s history."" People can make different interpretations as to what constitutes a war. We take no issue with Gibbs’ interpretation but acknowledge that people might see the Banana Wars as the longest U.S. conflict on foreign soil. Gibbs is accurate, but his statement requires some additional context. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8DD7C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/12/robert-gibbs/robert-gibbs-says-us-has-been-afghanistan-longer-n/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Joseph Cryan']","
Joe Cryan claims four-year graduation rate of 7 universities below 50 percent
","New Jersey has a long history of spending heavily on education. The state for years has spent money on urban school districts and federally mandated programs to help youngsters in need. Now, says Assemblyman Joe Cryan, the time has come for public colleges and universities that accept state funding to be more accountable for its graduation rates. ""What do Rutgers University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey City University, Stockton College, Rowan University and William Paterson all have in common?"" Cryan (D-Union) asked during a Dec. 19 Assembly session in which he discussed a new state panel formed to study the affordability of higher education. ""They all graduate less than 50 percent of their students within four years."" That statistic seemed a bit startling to the Truth-O-Meter, but we found that Cryan is correct. Cryan’s statistic is based on data reported by the schools themselves, as required, to the state. That data then goes to the U.S. Department of Education, where it can be accessed on the website for the Institute of Education Sciences. The institute’s website shows data for students starting in fall 2004 and fall 2006. Cryan’s claim is based on 2004 data. Here’s a breakdown of the graduation rates for each of the schools Cryan mentioned, based on a first-year, full-time equivalent student graduating with a bachelor’s degree in four years. It’s worth noting, though, that the graduation rates increase if students take six years to complete their degree: FOUR-YEAR RATE, STARTING FALL 2004 SIX-YEAR RATE,  STARTING FALL 2004 Sources: Asm. Joe Cryan’s office; U.S. Department of Education website, Institute of Education Sciences College Navigator, Retention and Graduation Rates Cryan noted that he didn’t include some schools, such as the New Jersey Institute of Technology, because its curriculum requires five years to earn a bachelor’s degree. We reached out to each of the schools cited by Cryan. Not all responded but some that did said that there’s more to graduation rates than numbers. ""There’s a big difference between a kid going to Harvard and a kid going to New Jersey City University, a big difference between going to William Paterson and to Rutgers,"" said Joe Cardona, vice president of university relations for Rowan University in Glassboro. ""Their preparedness profile, their economic profile -- all of those really tie in to your ability to excel and to be able to achieve whatever the degree program is."" Comparing schools with different missions, populations and demographics is akin to comparing apples and oranges, Cardona added. Taking six years to complete a bachelor’s degree has become a more accepted timeframe, according to Cardona and Steve Manas, a spokesman at Rutgers New Brunswick. ""The current national standard for graduation rates is six years, and Rutgers' rate is 75 percent, comparable to AAU (Association of American Universities) peers,"" Manas said in an e-mail. ""The latest graduation rate for four years is 52 percent."" Maryjane Briant, a spokeswoman for Stockton College, confirmed Cryan’s graduation rate number for the Atlantic County school for students starting in 2004, but noted that the number has climbed significantly since. The four-year graduation rate for Stockton students starting school in fall 2009 was 53 percent, she said. To reiterate, Cryan’s numbers are accurate for students starting their degrees 10 years ago, but schools that spoke with us generally pointed to higher graduation rates from more recent timeframes. Cryan said many families that save money to send their children to college plan or expect it to be a four -year program, not six. And he re-emphasized his concern that institutions accepting state money for higher education need to be more accountable for on-time graduation rates. He also disagreed that it’s unfair to compare students attending schools that may have different missions and demographics. ""What demographic is allowed not to graduate on time?"" he said. ""What students do you favor over others as a result? Our ruling Cryan said, ""What do Rutgers University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey City University, Stockton College, Rowan University and William Paterson all have in common? They all graduate less than 50 percent of their students within four years."" Cryan cited statistics reported by the schools he names for first-time, full-time students starting a four-year program in 2004.  The graduation rates trend upward, though, for more recent years, and the rates jump substantially for students who took six years to earn their bachelor’s degree. Still, Cryan’s claim is technically accurate and we therefore rate his claim True.

"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Pensions', 'Retirement', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Do members of the military, unlike other federal employees, not make contributions to their pensions?
","House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has drawn some praise -- but also fire, especially from veterans -- for co-brokering a federal budget deal that includes smaller pension payments for younger military retirees. The two-year agreement reached by Ryan and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., became law in December 2013. To help reduce the deficit, pensions for those who retire from the military before age 62 won’t be as large. Those younger retirees will receive annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to their pensions that are 1 percent lower than the rate of inflation (full COLAs will continue to be given to  military retirees who are over 62). In defending the move, Ryan made a claim about military pensions that we want to check. ""Civilian public employees have a 401(k) with the match, a defined-benefit pension and health care. They don't have (pension) COLAs at all if they retire before the age of 62. And they do contribute some to their pensions, and now we're having (newly hired employees) contribute more,"" the Janesville Republican told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board Dec. 19, 2013. ""The military doesn't contribute toward their pension. They don't have a paycheck – payroll deduction -- toward their pensions. And they do have a COLA before they're 62."" With more public employees -- notably state and local government workers in Wisconsin -- contributing more toward the cost of their benefits, we wondered if Ryan was right. Do members of the military contribute nothing toward their pensions? Evolution of military pensions Military pensions have expanded in scope since the first national pension law was passed in 1776, in the early stages of the Revolutionary War. At that time, pensions were strictly for those ""losing a limb in any engagement, or being so disabled in the service of the United States as to render him incapable of earning a livelihood."" Over the next several decades, pensions were awarded to Revolutionary War veterans based on need and later they became full pay for life, regardless of need. In 1948, 20 years was established as the minimum requirement for voluntary retirement for the Army and Air Force, putting those services on par with the Navy. Since 1986, military pensions have been ""inflation protected,"" with annual cost-of-living adjustments tied to the Consumer Price Index. The military retirement system now provides some $52 billion per year in pension payments to more than 2 million military retirees and their survivors. (By the way, pensions for civilian federal employees were created in 1920. Social Security was created in 1935.) At the individual level, members of the military are guaranteed a specific monthly pension payment after 20 or more years of service. However, it is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition: Those who serve at least 20 years are fully vested, but those who leave the military earlier usually receive no retirement benefits. Only 17 percent of those who serve in the military end up getting a retirement benefit, according to the Defense Business Board and the House Budget Committee. But, as Ryan indicated in his comments, military retirees begin receiving their monthly pension payments immediately, regardless of age. So, many begin drawing military pensions in their early to mid-40s, often while working in another career. Other public-sector employees, and those in the private sector, typically do not begin receiving an annuity until age 55, 60, or 65. Pension contributions So, what about contributions toward pensions? In other words, where does the money for the military retirement checks come from? A Congressional Budget Office report and a Department of Defense report cited by Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert say members of the military make no contribution toward their pensions. So does a report we found from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. And, Andrew Biggs, a public employee retirement expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told us the same. That contrasts with all other federal employees (including civilian employees in the military). They contribute a portion of their pay toward pensions; the rates mainly depend on when they were hired. Here’s a breakdown of pension contributions, according to data we collected from the Congressional Research Service, the federal Office of Personnel Management and the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, which advocates for pay and benefits for federal employees. Type of federal employee Percentage of pay contributed by employee  Percentage of pay contributed by employer  Military personnel 0 41.8 Civilian, hired before 1984* 7 19** Civilian, hired 1984-2012 0.8 11.9 Civilian, hired in 2013 3.1 9.6 Civilian, hired in 2014 4.4 9.6 *Generally do not pay into or receive Social Security; employees hired after 1984 pay 6.2% toward Social Security. **An aggregate figure. For most federal employees, the government contributes 12.7%; the employer and employee percentages are higher for law enforcement officers and certain other types of federal employees. Our rating Ryan said members of the military don’t ""contribute toward their pension."" Civilian federal employees contribute a portion of their pay toward their pensions, but members of the military don’t. We rate Ryan’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7F8D00>],/factchecks/2014/jan/12/paul-ryan/do-members-military-unlike-other-federal-employees/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'David Jolly']","
David Jolly says he 'never lobbied for offshore oil drilling'
","Congressional hopeful David Jolly’s lobbyist past is a major target for his opponents. His response to an accusation that he lobbied for expanded offshore oil drilling is problematic for the Indian Shores Republican, however. Jolly was at a Tampa Bay Beaches Chamber of Commerce forum on Jan. 6 when he said he supported the current restriction preventing drilling within 230 miles of Florida’s coastline. An audience member said there was talk that Jolly lobbied on behalf of oil-drilling interests, which Jolly refuted. ""I have never lobbied for offshore oil drilling, and I'd be interested in what information you might be suggesting because that's never happened,"" Jolly said. ""I'm not suggesting you are fabricating this, but if that information is in the public domain, it's a complete fabrication."" So has Jolly lobbied for expanded oil exploration, despite saying he opposes drilling now? Time for PolitiFact Florida to go back to the well. Digging deep The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seized upon the incident at the forum. In a post on their website later that day, the group declared, ""In 2011 Jolly lobbied on behalf of Free Enterprise Nation for the Roadmap for America’s Energy Future."" It tied Jolly and his Three Bridges Advisors lobbying firm to Free Enterprise Nation, a pro-business, anti-regulation advocacy group. It also showed that Free Enterprise Nation supported the Roadmap for America’s Energy Future, an energy independence proposal introduced by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., as H.R. 909 on March 3, 2011. The DCCC quoted a Weekly Standard article saying the Roadmap ""would open the Outer Continental Shelf to offshore drilling."" They also cited then-Assistant Secretary of Energy David Sandalow as saying the bill would thwart ""safety and environmental reforms adopted in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill."" The Roadmap, meanwhile, was referred to the Energy and Commerce committee, which held a hearing on June 3, 2011 (the day Sandalow testified), but no further action was ever taken. Offshore drilling is not allowed off Florida shores, for the most part. Florida is protected by the 2006 Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, which prohibits drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle. The law expires in 2022. President Barack Obama banned drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico for seven years following the 2010 disaster. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced in December that 465,000 acres extending as far east as Pensacola would be leased for drilling in March. We found a lobbyist disclosure that showed Jolly did work with Free Enterprise Nation in the first quarter of 2011, and Jolly himself wrote an April 2011 blog post on the group’s website that noted Free Enterprise Nation was in favor of the Nunes bill. Jolly responded to the DCCC’s attack by once again saying the assertion wasn’t true, and that he remained ""unequivocal in that statement."" But he also said that ""a later review of public documents did reveal that a former client of mine endorsed a comprehensive energy independence blueprint that could have possibly expanded drilling in the Gulf, but I did not lobby on its behalf."" He added he did support offshore drilling outside the 230-mile moratorium area. Free Enterprise Nation founder and former CEO Jim MacDougald issued his own statement. ""While FEN did publicly support the Roadmap for America’s Energy Future, David Jolly was never employed to advocate on its behalf,"" MacDougald said. ""David represented FEN on issues related to transparency for public employee pension funds, right-to-work matters, and a reduction in corporate and individual taxes."" MacDougald is now Jolly’s campaign finance co-chairman. It’s not the first time Jolly’s platform and his past have come under scrutiny: Kathleen Peters, his rival in the Jan. 14 Republican primary, previously accused him of lobbying for the Affordable Care Act. We found that statement False, because he had a plausible explanation (not to mention the client backing up his claims) and Peters’ camp couldn’t prove its case. On the lobbyist disclosure form, Jolly lists the Nunes bill as a subject of his activity. He said he listed the proposal not because he lobbied for the bill, but because he had attended a meeting in which the legislation was discussed. He said he ""had a practice of always overcomplying."" Public Citizen Congress Watch Division director Lisa Gilbert said it would be extremely uncommon for any lobbyist to overreport what their work entailed. She added that the forms are designed in a way that a lobbyist has to individually report what they deal with. ""It would be very surprising to me if he wasn’t, in his mind, working on this legislation when he filled out the form,"" she said. Dan Auble, a lobbying researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, said that according to the guidelines of the Lobbying Disclosure Act, lobbyists are supposed to report any issue in which they played a specific action. This can include preparing information, communicating with government officials, participating in planning activities and other actions on behalf of the client. Auble warned that the filings are fairly vague, and that we can’t independently verify the kind of activity that led Jolly to list H.R. 909. But according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, even being in a meeting in which it was discussed was technically a form of lobbying. ""He was part of a communication about the bill,"" Auble said. ""Essentially, that’s why he put it on the form."" Our ruling Jolly said he never lobbied for offshore drilling. But a lobbyist disclosure statement contradicts that, and Jolly said later that he did attend a meeting in which the legislation was discussed even though he didn’t actively lobby for it. When we looked into the rules of lobbying, it seems that the situation as he describes it -- being at a meeting but not actively pushing the measure with elected officials -- technically counts as being part of a communication about the proposal. We’ll never know the specifics of the meeting in question, and given the vague nature of lobbying reporting, the events may very well have been as low-key as he describes. But when it comes to the letter of the law, the way Jolly describes the incident counts as lobbying, experts say. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC792900>],/factchecks/2014/jan/10/david-jolly/david-jolly-says-he-never-lobbied-offshore-oil-dri/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Kathleen Peters']","
Kathleen Peters says South Pasadena 'reduced the amount of taxes we collected' while she was mayor
","Heading into the home stretch for the Jan. 14 Republican primary for the late C.W. Bill Young’s House seat, Kathleen Peters is clarifying her platform and trumpeting her achievements. ""What can one mother and grandmother from Pinellas do to stop gridlock and fix Washington?"" asked Peters in a mailer we received on Jan. 8. Her answer: ""Lower taxes."" ""When I was Mayor of South Pasadena, we actually reduced the property taxes we collected,"" the flier read. It then added, ""In fact, my city had the third lowest property tax rate of the 24 cities in Pinellas."" Talking about reducing taxes is a surefire way for a candidate to get voters to pay attention, but the wording seemed curious to us. Can Peters take credit for South Pasadena’s lower tax collections? It’s time for an audit. A taxing campaign Peters served as mayor of South Pasadena from 2008 to 2012, when she left before the end of her term to become a state representative. Before that, she was on the South Pasadena Planning and Zoning Board for two years, serving on the Charter Review Committee. Property taxes are a subject Peters knows well. During her state House run, Democratic opponent Josh Shulman brought up the fact that she had a history of being late paying the taxes on her former St. Pete Beach business, Captain’s Convenience Mart. Records show she paid almost $900 in late fees and penalties between 2000 and 2007. She also was late paying the property taxes on her house in 2007 and 2012, drawing just more than $200 in fees and penalties. Her campaign has noted there was never a lien on the properties, however, and all taxes and fines were paid within the calendar year they were due. She’s arguing that her city of about 5,000 took in less than before she was mayor, though. A review of South Pasadena’s annual financial reports provided the amount of property taxes the city collected during Peters' tenure. Per year, collections totaled: 2009: $790,739 2010: $782,473 2011: $717,208 2012: $694,645 It’s interesting to note that these years coincided with the Great Recession and the subsequent recovery, which brought down property values across the state following the housing bust. Collections in 2009 actually went up slightly from the prior year, from $789,282 to $790,739, but the reason isn’t because property values increased. The City Commission in fiscal year 2009 actually raised South Pasadena’s millage rate (dollars per thousand) to 1.4886 from the previous year’s rate of 1.2749 mills. The financial report says 2009 taxable property values were almost $91 million lower than 2008, down from $639.4 million to $548.6 million. In 2010, the city’s millage rate went up again, to 1.6985 mills (that was the third-lowest rate in the county, behind North Redington Beach and Belleair Shore). Taxable property values fell another $73 million that fiscal year, to $475.6 million. The millage rate stayed at that level for 2011 and 2012, but taxable property values continued to fall, down to $437.2 million in 2011 and $424.2 million in 2012. By the end of her term as mayor, Peters had overseen a significant decrease in property tax collections, to the tune of just more than $96,000 per year. The City Commission had actually increased the millage rate during her time, however, and she was mayor during a time taxable property values fell more than $215 million from 2008 levels. Overall, taxes fell because property values fell, not because of any specific action Peters took. Our ruling Peters attempted to tout her record on property taxes, saying in her mailer that as mayor of South Pasadena ""we actually reduced the property taxes we collected."" As a campaign promise, that implies she had a part in lowering taxes in her city. When we looked at the city’s annual financial reports, we found she actually presided over an increase in the millage rate, and tax collections fell because of a drastic reduction in taxable property values. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB422C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/10/kathleen-peters/kathleen-peters-says-south-pasadena-reduced-amount/

CNN's Tapper: Obama has used Espionage Act more than all previous administrations
","The federal criminal charges filed against National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden make it seven times that the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act against government workers who shared information with the press. In at least two instances, the government’s investigations have delved into the practices of reporters and news organizations and put reporters in legal jeopardy. This has raised red flags among defenders of the media. In a vigorous exchange on CNN’s The Lead, host Jake Tapper asserted to Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post that ""the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leaked to journalists ... more than all previous administrations combined."" On one level, a simple tally would address Tapper’s claim and -- spoiler alert -- the raw numbers back him up. But a scrupulous vetting of the record uncovers important ambiguities in the entire business of talking about leaks in Washington. The basic numbers Most tallies, like the one by the investigative service ProPublica, begin with Daniel Ellsberg and the release of the Vietnam War era documents known as the Pentagon Papers. Including Ellsberg, the government has used the Espionage Act 10 times to prosecute government workers who shared classified information with journalists. If we push back to 1945, there is one more case. So of those 11, seven have taken place while Barack Obama has been president. Law professor David Pozen at Columbia University, has researched the culture of unauthorized disclosures in the nation’s capital and said generally, there has been an uptick in these prosecutions on Obama’s watch.. ""There’s not really any doubt,"" Pozen said.""The spirit of the assertion is correct."" The whistleblower label debate The Justice Department does not quibble about number of prosecutions but in a statement to PunditFact, the department said: ""It is definitely not the case that anyone who leaks classified information is a whistleblower. Very few of those prosecuted in recent years for unauthorized disclosures even sought to be considered that way."" To take a couple of examples, in 2010, State Department contractor Stephen Kim was indicted for providing information about North Korea to Fox News. Later that year, Jeffrey Sterling, a Central Intelligence Agency officer, was indicted for sharing information with a journalist James Risen about America’s work to counter Iran’s nuclear program. Both defendants have pled not guilty. There is little suggestion that whatever they might have revealed had to do with any government abuse or that the leakers wanted to raise broad policy concerns. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell School of Law defines a whistleblower as ""an employee who alleges wrongdoing by his or her employer of the sort that violates public law or tends to injure a considerable number of people."" No matter how broadly interpreted, Kim and Stirling don’t seem to fit that definition. In a statement given to ProPublica,  the Justice Department said it does not target whistleblowers who follow the rules, but ""we cannot sanction or condone federal employees who knowingly and willfully disclose classified information to the media or others not entitled to receive such information."" We raised this issue of who is and isn’t a whistleblower with Tapper and he said in the fast pace of a live interview, he might have wanted to use slightly different words to make his point. ""It would be better to say ‘leakers, many of whom are seen as whistleblowers,’ instead of just ‘whistleblowers’,"" Tapper said. ""If for no other reason that the focus would be on the administration’s aggressive use of the Espionage Act to clamp down on whistleblowing and journalism that holds the U.S. government accountable."" As for the claim, though, it does not matter much. If you pull out the Kim and Stirling cases, by the same standard, you’d likely drop one of the pre-Obama cases too and that would still leave the Obama administration using the Espionage Act five times compared to three times before he took office. The mechanics of prosecutions Other factors could muddy the tally. The Obama administration inherited two of the cases from President George W. Bush’s Department of Justice. The indictments took place under Obama but ""the wheels started turning before him,"" Pozen said. So potentially, someone could argue that these cases are not really his prosecutions. On the other hand, that doesn’t affect the technical accuracy of Tapper’s claim. In addition, administrations have a variety of ways to crack down on unauthorized disclosures. Tapper’s focus on the Espionage Act might be accurate, but it overlooks other tactics used by previous White House regimes, said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center at New York University School of Law. ""Instead of criminally prosecuting media leaks, the government has relied on administrative sanctions and penalties,"" Goitein said. These are extremely difficult to track because just about all of the details are protected by personal privacy laws. Goitein pointed to other laws that can and have been brought to bear, including Section 641 of Title 18 in the U.S. Code. It prohibits theft of government property. It was used in 2002 against a Drug Enforcement Agency official who gave sensitive, not classified, information to a London newspaper. While capital punishment isn’t an option, in other respects, a conviction under Section 641 can be just as harsh as a violation under the Espionage Act. But neither a charge of theft nor an administrative sanction change the accuracy of the specific details in Tapper’s claim. A look at the reasons behind the uptick under Obama lies outside the scope of this fact-check. For a complete discussion, we recommend Pozen’s recent article, ""The leaky leviathan:Why the government condemns and condones unauthorized disclosures of information."" Among other factors, digital technology both makes leakers easier to find and opens the door to disclosures on a grand scale as in the Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden cases. Our ruling Tapper said more than all previous administrations combined, the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leak to journalists. The number of cases involving that law support Tapper’s statement. There is reasonable debate over whether the whistleblower label applies to all cases and Tapper said he could have been more precise. However, the Justice Department does not challenge the basic figures and the experts we contacted affirmed the general accuracy of the claim. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAA3280>],/factchecks/2014/jan/10/jake-tapper/cnns-tapper-obama-has-used-espionage-act-more-all-/

Police Foundation on target
","Just in time for the Christmas holidays, people who give their time and money to help the Atlanta Police Department received good news in the mail. A flier from the nonprofit Atlanta Police Foundation arrived with this impressive headline: ""Crime in Atlanta is down 18 percent since 2009."" That is something to feel good about. But is it true? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look deeper into the foundation’s claim, especially given that, at several times during the year, residents have been rattled by -- and outspoken about -- high-profile neighborhood crimes. To make the claim of an 18 percent drop in crime, the foundation compared crime data in the first 45 weeks of 2009 against data for the same 45 weeks in 2013. The foundation focused on what are known as Part 1, or major, crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto thefts. The foundation pulled straight from records of the Atlanta Police Department, which show:                                             2009                     2013                   % difference Murders                                  72                        70                           -3 Rapes                                     95                        93                          -2 Robberies                           2209                     2020                         -9 Aggravated assaults             2302                   1970                       -14 Burglaries                              7654                    5010                      -35 Larcenies from auto               9447                  7988                         -15 Other larcenies                      7191                    6902                         -4 Auto thefts                              4898                    3867                         -21 All Part 1 offenses                 33,868                   27,920                   -18 The 18 percent decline was calculated by taking the Part 1 offenses for 2009, subtract the Part 1 offenses from 2013, then divide the difference by the Part 1 Offenses in 2009. Step 1) 33,868 - 27,920 = 5,948 Step 2) 5,948/ 33,868 = 0.1756 (rounded to .18 or 18%) Robert R. Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice and director of the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange at Georgia State University’s  Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said the calculations are ""legitimate."" This is ""one of several ways to calculate what’s happening with crime,"" he said. ""It relies on raw figures, Friedmann said. ""If you actually calculate rates, then the decline will be higher than 18 percent since the population has increased."" The claim by the foundation, which raised and spent more than $2 million in 2012 to support police department initiatives, was ""fair for the purpose it was done for,"" he said. ""I read PolitiFact, and I would rate it as a True,"" Friedmann said. ""I wouldn’t have an issue with it."" Jack Levin, the director of the Brudnick Center on Conflict and Violence at Northeastern University, said the Atlanta Police Foundation could have provided its supporters a ""clearer picture"" of crime in the city had it shown the crime trends from 2009 to 2013, rather than a 45-week-to-45-week comparison. ""But using a baseline of 2009, it doesn’t look like they were trying to put one over on the public,"" Levin said. Homicide rates were the lowest in decades in 2009, so someone wanting to make the city look better would likely have chosen another year to compare with 2013, he said. Had the foundation chosen to compare the 45 weeks of 2013 with the same weeks in 2010, 2011 or 2012, crime also would have been down, but not as much as compared with 2009. The Christmastime flier was sent to supporters ""as a reminder of the impact that their donations have had funding critical programs spearheaded by the APF,"" said Miguel Sepulveda, the foundation’s vice president for communications and director of Crime Stoppers of Greater Atlanta. Earlier this year, the foundation sent supporters a postcard, directing them to a more detailed crime report, Sepulveda said. The recent flier didn’t give the reader any specifics to support the foundation’s claim. ""Perhaps, we should do that,"" Sepulveda said in an email exchange. ""We used the first 45 weeks because those were the most current stats available for 2013 at the time the [flier] went to print,"" he said. Mayor Kasim Reed made crime fighting a topic of his second inaugural address this week. He rated the Police Department’s expansion to 2,000 workers as a first-term milestone and promised to ""double-down"" efforts to address crime in his second term. Crime has brought the city some unflattering headlines. For instance, Forbes magazine ranked Atlanta as the ninth ""most dangerous city"" in the nation for 2013, down from sixth in 2012. The magazine creates the annual list by using the FBI's Crime Statistics database screened for cities with populations of 200,000 and higher. Experts generally downplay these rankings, and the FBI specifically warns against using its statistics for city-against-city rankings. But there’s no evidence that the foundation’s flier claim was anything but accurate based on the available data. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAA3E40>],/factchecks/2014/jan/10/atlanta-police-foundation/police-foundation-target/

Marco Rubio says marriage 'decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent'
","On the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s announcement of the War on Poverty, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gave a speech at an event titled, ""Income Mobility and the American Dream,"" sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. During the speech, Rubio made a claim about the relationship between marriage and poverty. ""Until at least a few decades ago, our economy proved sufficiently dynamic and innovative to replace old jobs with new ones, but that hasn't been happening in recent years,"" Rubio said. ""Social factors also play a major role in denying equal opportunity. The truth is that the greatest tool to lift people, to lift children and families from poverty, is one that decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent. But it isn't a government program. It's called marriage."" He continued, ""Fifty years ago today, when the War on Poverty was launched, 93 percent of children born in the United States were born to married parents. By 2010, that number had plummeted to 60 percent. It shouldn't surprise us that 71 percent of poor families with children are families that are not headed by a married couple."" A reader asked us to investigate whether Rubio is correct that marriage ""decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent."" So we did. The claim appears to come from this article by Robert Rector of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Rector wrote, ""According to the U.S. Census, the poverty rate for single parents with children in the United States in 2009 was 37.1 percent. The rate for married couples with children was 6.8 percent. Being raised in a married family reduced a child’s probability of living in poverty by about 82 percent."" We concur that the Census Bureau data Rector cited -- from this table -- supports Rubio’s point. However, we have a couple of quibbles. First, there’s more recent census data, covering 2011. And second, there’s a bit of a mismatch between what Rubio said and what Rector wrote about. Rector was comparing female-headed single-parent households that include kids to married households that have kids. But Rubio didn’t specify that he was talking only about female-headed households that have kids. About one of every five single-parent households is headed by a man. If you use 2011 data and include single-parent households headed by either sex, the numbers come out a bit differently. The data show that 37.2 percent of single-parent households are in poverty, compared to 10.9 percent for married families with kids. That’s a 71 percent decrease in the likelihood of poverty, rather than 82 percent. In addition, these statistics are calculated by counting all the people, adult or child, living in households that include children, noted Michael Wiseman, a public policy professor at George Washington University. In other words, the numbers Rubio cited don’t speak directly to the likelihood of a child being in poverty, which was how he worded his claim. We should note that some critics have taken issue with the implications of the statistic Rubio cited. Philip N. Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, wrote on his blog, ""By the same logic, (Rubio) should have said, ‘The greatest tool for lifting children and families out of poverty is getting a job, which increases your income by $40,000 per year’ — because the median weekly earnings of full-time, year-round workers is $771 per week, which is $40,000 per year more than people with no jobs earn."" Meanwhile, the liberal group Think Progress pointed to a blog post from a few days earlier by the Council on Contemporary Families, a group of academics that study family policy, that said a ""nationally representative study of more than 7,000 women found that approximately 64 percent of the single mothers who married were divorced by the time they reached age 35-44. More importantly, single mothers who marry and later divorce are worse off economically than single mothers who never marry."" These may be valid points. However, in his comments, Rubio did not suggest that government pursue any specific government policies to directly promote marriage. He also said that being a two-parent family ""decreases the probability of child poverty,"" which sounds to us like a mathematical analysis of the existing data, rather than a suggestion that changing policies to encourage marriage will actually reduce poverty that already exists. For this reason, we are analyzing the mathematics that underlie his comment question, not the conclusions that can, or can’t, be drawn from the statistic. ""We take issue much less with the basic numbers than with the implication that marriage per se is what’s driving these differences in poverty,"" said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Our ruling Rubio said that marriage ""decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent."" Our research suggests that a more current and more accurate statistic to back up his claim would be a decrease of 71 percent. That’s lower, but not dramatically so. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD31080>],/factchecks/2014/jan/09/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-marriage-decreases-probability-ch/

Rachel Maddow claims Florida group that backs drug-testing welfare recipients is affiliated with Koch brothers
","PunditFact isn't always the first to weigh in on the tit-for-tat of cable news shows, in part because the nature of our work requires more than claims and counterclaims. And sometimes, a few extra days allows matters to become more settled. Such is the case in examining the back-and-forth recently between MSNBC host Rachel Maddow and representatives for Charles and David Koch. You probably have heard the story by now, but here's a quick catch-up. On Maddow's Jan. 2, 2014, show, Maddow accused the Koch brothers -- through ""affiliated state groups"" -- of pushing and promoting a Florida law that requires welfare recipients to first pass a drug test. Representatives for the Koch brothers pushed back against the allegation, saying they were not involved with the Florida law or the Florida group who supported the law, the Foundation for Government Accountability. Maddow is sticking by her story and refused to read a Koch-prepared on-air apology. In her original report, Maddow said that Koch brothers affiliated groups ""in Florida they, at least, have been promoting forced drug tests for people who are on welfare."" Later after Maddow read a description of the same group, the Foundation for Government Accountability, she said, ""That’s the Koch brothers group that has been promoting this idea, right, the same Koch brothers group that has been telling people not to get health insurance. They're the ones that came up with the idea that it’s a great use of state funds."" We're boiling down those comments to fact-check this statement: The Foundation for Government Accountability, which supported a Florida law requiring drug testing of welfare recipients, is a ""Koch brothers affiliated group."" The Koch brothers and their money The Koch brothers, Charles and David, inherited their father's Koch Industries, an oil refinery business that has since expanded into energy, textiles and manufacturing. Koch subsidiaries make Quilted Northern tissue paper, Dixie cups and Stainmaster carpet, among other products. Forbes estimates the brothers to have a combined wealth of $72 billion. And they spend it. An examination by the Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post found that the Kochs' political groups raised more than $400 million for political causes during the 2012 election. The Kochs are rich, shrewd and conservative, and they have helped create a labyrinth of political groups and funding sources with names like the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the Center to Protect Patient Rights, Public Notice, Americans for Prosperity, and Generation Opportunity. They fought the re-election of President Barack Obama and continue to fight the health care law. As a result, the Kochs have become a leading target of liberals and Maddow’s bête noire. Their tentacles are many places, to be sure, but how deeply do they reach into the Foundation for Government Accountability and a Florida law to require drug tests of welfare recipients? Florida's drug-testing law Let’s start with Florida’s drug-testing law. The law, which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge Dec. 31, 2013, required people applying for welfare benefits to first pass a drug screening. The idea, in Florida, started with Gov. Rick Scott. While campaigning in the Republican primary for governor in 2010, Scott unveiled a seven-step plan to create 700,000 private-sector jobs over seven years. As part of that umbrella promise, Scott also pledged to save the state $77 million in part by adding a drug-testing requirement for welfare. The idea was born when Scott was still an underdog to then-Attorney General Bill McCollum and did not come from the Kochs or the Foundation for Government Accountability, said Mary Anne Carter, a senior campaign adviser who helped craft Scott’s policy plan. The idea came from other states, Carter said. Arizona passed a law to drug test welfare recipients in 2009. Michigan passed the first such law in 1999, but a federal appellate court struck it down in 2003. And in 1996, amid federal welfare reform, St. Johns County in northeast Florida approved a policy to test applicants of county assistance for some medical services. The New York Times found at least 29 states debated the measures in 2013, though just a couple passed. ""This is an issue that has been around at least a decade,"" Carter told PunditFact. Scott and the Kochs do have some connections. In June 2011, Scott attended a retreat hosted by the Koch brothers near Vail, Colo., where he says he discussed the drug-testing plan. ""It was very interesting,"" Scott said of the meeting. ""They wanted basically to know what am I doing in Florida."" And in 2013, Scott gave a keynote address at an Americans for Prosperity Foundation summit in Orlando. The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is affiliated with Americans for Prosperity. Americans for Prosperity was founded by Koch. The Foundation for Government Accountability So that's the origin of the law in Florida, but what about the group Maddow says is Koch affiliated -- the Foundation for Government Accountability? The foundation is a conservative think tank that incorporated in Naples in late June 2011, one month after Scott signed the drug-testing law. It clearly supported the drug-testing law after it passed. One of its pamphlets was cited by the state in defense of the drug-testing requirement and the foundation promoted the law at a conference of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in December 2011. During her show, Maddow didn't explain how she determined that the Foundation for Government Accountability is a ""Koch brothers affiliated group."" Lauren Skowronski, an MSNBC spokeswoman, told us the crux of Maddow's argument relates not to the Foundation for Government Accountability but to another group called the State Policy Network. Maddow says the State Policy Network received money from Koch, and in turn the State Policy Network gave money to the Foundation for Government Accountability. Ergo Koch money went to the Foundation for Government Accountability. Ergo the Foundation for Government Accountability is a Koch affiliate. ""The Kochs have funded an umbrella organization which disbursed money for the start-up of (the Foundation for Government Accountability) in 2011. That umbrella organization is the State Policy Network,"" Skowronski said. For its part, the Foundation for Government Accountability notes the foundation did not exist until after the drug-testing law was passed, and its leaders did not communicate with Koch officials or their intermediaries about the law. (That fact significantly colors Maddow's assertion that, ""They're the ones that came up with the idea that it’s a great use of state funds."") ""We did not work with Koch on the Florida welfare drug-testing issue,"" foundation CEO Tarren Bragdon said. ""To the best of my knowledge, Koch wasn't involved at all. I have never heard anyone involved in the issue in any capacity mention Koch or reference their engagement or financial support."" As with Scott, however, there are some connections between Koch and the Foundation for Government Accountability. The Tampa Bay Times reported in 2012 that the foundation supported Scott’s drug-test law, and Bragdon had touted a similar drug-test policy in Maine. The Times wrote that Bragdon said the Kochs had not donated to his foundation, but that people with connections to Koch have, including Robert A. Levy and the Atlas Research Foundation. Levy is the chairman of the Cato Institute, which was co-founded by Charles Koch. But the more important tie is between the Foundation for Government Accountability and the State Policy Network. The State Policy Network gave the Foundation for Government Accountability $60,000 in 2011 ""for start-up, direct mail prospecting,"" and $108,150 in 2012 for ""general operating and health care policy research,"" tax filings show. The contributions equal about 28 percent of what the Foundation for Government Accountability received in 2011 and about 15 percent in 2012. So what’s the connection between Koch and the State Policy Network? Mark Holden, an attorney for Koch Industries, told PunditFact that various Koch foundations gave $40,000 to the State Policy Network between 2002 and 2012. But Holden says Koch foundations have no connections to the Foundation for Government Accountability, Other Koch money also could be at play. How much is hard to say. The Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal group, published a report about the State Policy Network in November. The report attempts to track the money of various corporations and entities -- including those connected to Koch -- using publicly available tax forms over several years, cross-referencing third-party reporting. Interestingly, the report also lists Comcast as a donor to the State Policy Network. Comcast is the parent company of Maddow's MSNBC. We read the Center for Media and Democracy analysis and then conducted our own. The result, like the reporting from the Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post, shows the complex network in which the Kochs' distribute their money. In 2008 and 2010, a not-for-profit called the Knowledge and Progress Fund donated $3.24 million to another not-for-profit called Donors Trust, tax forms show. Charles Koch is a director of the Knowledge and Progress Fund. In 2011, Donors Trust made various donations to the State Policy Network. The group also made a $500,000 contribution to another group called Donors Capital Fund, for a ""donor-advised fund,"" tax forms show. We don’t know what the money was for. The president of Donors Trust is a woman named Whitney L. Ball, who previously worked at the Cato Institute (a think tank founded by Charles Koch) and serves on the board of Donors Capital and the State Policy Network. It gets more interesting. Donors Capital Fund gave $1.97 million to State Policy Network in 2011 (2012 records were not immediately available), including $135,000 earmarked for the purpose of ""start-up activities in Florida."" That was the same year the foundation started. Donors Capital Fund also gave almost $300,000 in 2010 to Bragdon’s then-Maine Heritage Policy Center for various purposes. Does ""start-up activities in Florida"" mean the Foundation for Government Accountability? We don’t know for certain. If it does, could you directly link that money back to the Koch-controlled Knowledge and Progress Fund? We could not. Holden, the Koch Industries attorney, told us he didn’t know the purpose of the donations of either Donors Trust or Knowledge and Progress Fund. ""We've got a long long list of other groups David and Charles supported,"" Holden said, naming the Smithsonian, Johns Hopkins and the Salvation Army. ""Are they ‘Koch-connected?’ As far as the FGA group (Foundation for Government Accountability) we have no involvement. We did not give them any money. We are not connected with them. We have nothing to do with them."" A tenuous connection It's easy to find connections between people and groups; ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" taught us that. And certainly with people like Charles and David Koch, who have billions of dollars and spend it on a variety of conservative political causes, it’s even easier. But in the case of the Foundation for Government Accountability, the ties to Koch are dubious. Part of that may be the fault of the system, which allows donors to largely remain anonymous, and shuttle money through shadow groups. Maddow suggested as much in a follow-up segment detailing the Koch controversy. ""The Foundation for Government Accountability is part of a huge network of state-based conservative think-tanks that is frankly kind of designed to not look like a network. They all look vaguely indigenous. They all have what look to be locally specific names,"" Maddow said on Jan. 3. ""But their funding if you follow it comes in part from a central source of big money corporate donors. Including groups affiliated with the Koch brothers."" Yet Maddow drew a straight line linking Koch, the Foundation for Government Accountability and the Florida drug-testing law when reality is different. Yes, there are some ties among Scott, Koch and the Foundation for Government Accountability. And yes, there are some slightly stronger interactions between Koch and the State Policy Network. But it's not enough to declare the Foundation for Government Accountability a Koch affiliate. ""The Kochs have certainly supported the State Policy Network and some of its think-tank affiliates. But I haven’t seen evidence that they have directly funded the Foundation for Government Accountability or proactively pushed for the drug-testing law,"" Daniel Schulman, a journalist with Mother Jones who is writing a book about the Kochs, told the Washington Post. ""Do they want to rein in entitlements? Absolutely. But in the case of Florida, I think the connection is tenuous."" Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame law professor who focuses on nonprofit advocacy issues, told us the Kochs’ network of entities shows that ""they have gone to significant lengths and expense to hide their contributions and where those contributions are going,"" But, ""it does seem to be a stretch to say that all of the donors to the State Policy Network are somehow affiliated with Foundation for Government Accountability given the small size of the grant to the foundation compared to all the grants made by the network."" Maddow said the Foundation for Government Accountability, which supported a Florida law requiring drug testing of welfare recipients, is a ""Koch brothers affiliated group."" The evidence to prove that particular claim is thin. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA2DB80>],/factchecks/2014/jan/09/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-claims-florida-group-backs-drug-test/

Americans must answer U.S. Census Bureau survey by law, though agency hasn't prosecuted since 1970
","Bob Cole, who hosts Austin radio station KOKE-FM's weekday morning show, said on the air Jan. 7, 2014, that he couldn’t believe the U.S. Census Bureau told him he was legally required to participate in a government survey. ""In a few days you will receive an American Community Survey questionnaire in the mail,"" the bureau said in a letter to Cole, which he said he received in late 2013 or early in the new year.  The letter said: ""Because you are living in the United States, you are required by law to respond to this survey."" Cole gave us a copy of a bureau envelope with this nudge outside: ""Your response is required by law."" The ACS, sent annually in recent years to a sampling of more than 3 million U.S. households, collects detailed information on population and housing, helping to update the information gathered in every decennial census, the bureau says online. ""Estimates from the ACS contribute to providing an important picture of America, and an accurate response to the ACS questionnaire is important,"" the agency says. ""When used in conjunction with the most recently available decennial census counts, information from the ACS documents how we live as a nation, including our education, housing, jobs, and many other issues."" Cole asked us to verify that Americans are legally bound to fill out the survey. ""I can see the validity of some of the questions,"" he said, others less so. The material he received said the bureau estimates it takes 40 minutes to complete. (See the 2014 questionnaire, which has more than 50 questions for each person in a household, here.) Bureau cites statutes The materials received by Cole included an FAQ with this question: ""Do I have to answer the questions?"" ""Yes,"" the bureau's reply states. ""Your response to this survey is required by law (Title 13, U.S. Code, Sections 141 and 193). Title 13, as changed by Title 18, imposes a penalty for not responding. We estimate this survey will take about 40 minutes to complete."" That verbiage didn’t lead us to any mandate, but a bureau web page singles out Section 221 of Title 13, which says that any adult refusing to answer a bureau survey shall be fined. Specifically, the section refers to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, who oversees the bureau, and says: ""a) Whoever, being over eighteen years of age, refuses or willfully neglects, when requested by the secretary, or by any other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof acting under the instructions of the secretary or authorized officer, to answer, to the best of his knowledge, any of the questions on any schedule submitted to him in connection with any census or survey provided for by subchapters I, II, IV, and V of chapter 5 of this title, applying to himself or to the family to which he belongs or is related, or to the farm or farms of which he or his family is the occupant, shall be fined not more than $100."" That’s not entirely so; the fine for refusing to answer a bureau survey can be as much as $5,000, the bureau separately says online, citing Section 3571 of Title 18. Individuals willfully giving false answers to the government face a fine of up to $500, Section 121 says. But it states that ""no person shall be compelled to disclose information related to his religious beliefs or to membership in a religious body."" Unenforced mandate? Our search for more information yielded a Jan. 9, 2013, commentary by David Whiting of the Orange County (Calif.) Register quoting a bureau spokeswoman, Jennifer Smits, saying that nobody had been fined for failing to participate to date. By telephone, bureau spokeswoman Stacy Gimbel Vidal told us that remains so; no fines have been levied. The bureau, she said, is ""really not in the business of prosecuting people who don’t comply."" On July 18, 2012, Andrew Reamer, a research professor at George Washington University, told a U.S. Senate subcommittee that the bureau had not prosecuted someone for not responding to a survey since the 1960 census. Not quite: Bureau spokesman Brian Lavin told us by email that no one has been prosecuted for failing to respond to a survey since the 1970 census. In his testimony, Reamer also explained why the potential fine had escalated from the $100 set in law in 1929. He said that figure was superseded in the 1980s by a comprehensive law stipulating a fine of up to $5,000 for any criminal misdemeanor or infraction. In 2012, Vidal told us by email, less than 8,000 of the nation’s ACS recipients refused to respond; the survey had a 97 percent response rate and it has had a 97 percent to 98 percent response rate since being fully implemented in 2005, Vidal said by email. ""Because you care about your community, please fill out the form,"" Vidal said. ""It has so many positive ramifications"" related to spending and planning. Bureau's appeal for participation She elaborated in a follow-up email: ""Responding to the American Community Survey is about helping national, state and local officials make informed decisions with timely and accurate data. Just as people are required to respond to jury duty, get a driver’s license in order to drive, pay their taxes and report their income, they also have the obligation to respond to decennial census surveys. ""Most Americans asked to participate understand this responsibility and what’s at stake for their communities – quality, current statistics that drive decision-making on investments and services in their communities,"" Vidal said. ""Retailers, homebuilders, police departments, and town and city planners are among the many private- and public-sector decision-makers who count on these annual results to plan services and policies: from building roads and power plants to attracting jobs and planning emergency evacuations. These statistics also help determine how more than $400 billion of federal funding are spent on infrastructure and services, from highways to schools to hospitals."" Vidal wrote: ""The survey is the only source of local statistics for most of the 40 topics it covers, such as employment, language spoken at home, education and selected housing costs."" Study of voluntary compliance The idea of making responses voluntary has been explored. On May 20, 2012, the New York Times noted in a news analysis that the Republican-majority House had voted to kill the ACS, though the Democratic-led Senate wasn’t expected to agree. Separately, the story said that if the survey were made voluntary, according to experts, the census would have to spend significantly on follow-up phone calls and in-person visits to get enough households to answer. The story included a web link to a Sept. 27, 2011, bureau report stating that when the agency tested making the survey voluntary in 2002-03, the ""mail cooperation"" rate dropped by more than 20 percentage points. If the survey was made voluntary, maintaining its reliability would drive up costs by at least 38 percent, the report said. ""Perhaps of greatest concern, the use of voluntary collection methods had a negative impact on traditionally low response areas that will compromise our ability to produce reliable data for these areas and for small population groups such as Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians and Alaska Natives,"" the report said. Our ruling The bureau said federal law requires U.S. residents to answer the ACS. Federal law mandates as much, but the bureau also doesn't seek to penalize individuals who fail to participate. The reality appears to be that recipients can refuse to comply. We rate the bureau's warning, which lacks this additional information, as Mostly True.

Rand Paul says the longer people get unemployment insurance, it provides 'some disincentive' to work
","Just days before the U.S. Senate began consideration of a bill to renew expiring benefits for the long-term unemployed, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., raised questions about how effective such a policy would be. Appearing on the Jan. 5, 2014, edition of ABC’s This Week, Paul said he was concerned ""that the longer you have it, that it provides some disincentive to work, and that there are many studies that indicate this. So, what I've been saying all along, we have to figure out how to create jobs and keep people from becoming long-term unemployed."" Paul has taken some heat from critics for previous comments about extended unemployment benefits.  On Dec. 8, 2013, Paul said on Fox News, ""When you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks, you're causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy. And it really - while it seems good, it actually does a disservice to the people you're trying to help."" Here, we wanted to look at studies on unemployment insurance, and whether he’s correct that ""there are many studies that indicate"" that the longer people get unemployment insurance, ""it provides some disincentive to work."" Overall, we found that, in a literal sense, Paul’s recent comments are carefully crafted and largely correct: Such studies do indeed exist. However, there’s a fair amount of debate among economists about what that conclusion actually means for economic policymaking, particularly on the question of whether cutting off long-term benefits actually boosts employment. A look back at the research In a fact-check we published back in 2009, we noted some commonly cited papers that seemed to back up Paul’s statement, both co-authored in 1990 by Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist who once worked in the Clinton administration, and fellow economist Bruce D. Meyer. In one of these papers, published in the Journal of Public Economics, the authors looked at U.S. unemployment data from 1979 to 1983, and concluded that increasing unemployment insurance by six to 12 months could increase unemployment by four to five weeks, and a duration of 24 months could mean an increase of up to 16 weeks. When we checked with an ideologically diverse group of economists for this article, they cited a number of other, more recent papers that found longer unemployment benefits tended to increase the duration of unemployment. For instance: • In a May 2013 study, Henry Farber of Princeton and Robert Valletta of the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco concluded that extended benefits in the aftermath of the Great Recession raised the average duration of unemployment by 7 percent and caused the unemployment rate to increase by 0.4 percentage points. The effect, they found, was especially strong among those unemployed for at least six months. An article Valletta co-authored with his Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco colleague Katherine Kuang in 2010 concluded that even though a 0.4 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is modest, it still ""represents about 600,000 potential workers who could become virtually unemployable if their reliance on (unemployment insurance) benefits were to continue indefinitely."" • In an October 2013 study, four co-authors -- Marcus Hagedorn, Fatih Karahan, Iourii Manovskii, Kurt Mitman -- concluded that ""most of the persistent increase in unemployment during the Great Recession can be accounted for by the unprecedented extensions of unemployment benefit eligibility."" They didn’t think that longer benefit periods cut down on unemployed workers’ efforts to search for jobs, though. Rather, they said, extended benefits tended to raise prevailing wages in the wider labor market, which in turn made companies less likely to increase the number of jobs on their payroll. How to interpret these findings Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said Paul is on ""safe ground"" with his claim. ""It is fair to say that there have been ‘many studies’ of the impact of longer unemployment insurance durations on unemployment, re-employment, and labor force participation, and it is fair to say that a sizeable majority of studies shows an impact that links longer potential benefit durations with longer spells of unemployment,"" Burtless said. At the same time, Burtless emphasized that this ""truth"" is open to misinterpretation. We found at least three possible concerns: • Not every unemployed person gets an unemployment check. In fact, Burtless says, only about one of every three unemployed Americans gets a check -- so whatever incentives are affecting unemployment-insurance beneficiaries could be outweighed by what’s happening among the unemployed Americans who aren’t receiving a check. If, for instance, beneficiaries of unemployment checks are refraining from taking jobs longer than they otherwise would, open jobs may be snapped up by the unemployed workers who aren’t getting a check. If so, the effect of longer benefits on the unemployment rate could end up being a wash. • Ending unemployment benefits reduces spending by the unemployed, which can lead to jobs being lost in the wider economy. The extra benefits unemployed workers get ""represents extra income to some of the unemployed worker’s neighbors – the grocer, the dentist, the hardware store owner, a favorite restaurant and its servers,"" Burtless said. ""Without spending financed by the unemployed worker’s extended unemployment benefits, the incomes of these other people will be lower. One or two of them might be laid off."" • The end of extended benefits may push the unemployed out of the labor force, rather than into a job. Receiving an unemployment check is usually contingent on continuing to look for a job; once the checks stop and that requirement goes away, the incentive to keep looking declines. This poses a problem for tracking changes in the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate can drop for one of two reasons -- either unemployed people are moving into jobs, or unemployed people are moving out of the labor force (and thus moving out of the mathematical equation used to calculate the unemployment rate). A recent post by James Pethokoukis of the conservative American Enterprise Institute analyzed data from North Carolina, where the GOP-led legislature earlier this year cut unemployment benefits, both in amount and duration. ""If you listen to Republicans,"" he wrote, ""it’s worked out pretty well. The state’s unemployment rate has dropped to 8.0 percent in October from 8.8 percent in June."" But while the number of unemployed residents plunged by 44,558 between June 2013 and October 2013, he found, the number of employed people increased by only 1,902. In other words, 96 percent of the decrease in unemployed North Carolinians over that period simply left the labor market, and the unemployment rate plunged for the ""wrong"" reason. If North Carolinians had simply left the labor market at a more typical rate, Pethokoukis wrote, ""the state’s jobless rate would have increased to 9.1 percent rather than sharply declining."" Our ruling Paul said that ""there are many studies that indicate"" that the longer people get unemployment insurance, ""it provides some disincentive to work."" Paul is on solid ground about the existence of studies that support this point; there are quite a few. But if Paul means to suggest that ending benefits actually increases employment, the support for that proposition is more mixed. In particular, there’s evidence that unemployed people may drop out of the labor market rather than find a job when they stop getting benefit checks. So Paul's statement is accurate, but needs additional information. On balance, we rate Paul’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDA5740>],/factchecks/2014/jan/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-longer-people-get-unemployment-insu/
"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'National Right to Life Committee']","
Anti-abortion group attack Kathleen Peters' voting record
","State Rep. Kathleen Peters has had to articulate positions on a range of issues in the runup to her Jan. 14 Republican primary, but now she’s got a new component to clarify: Her voting record in the Florida Legislature. National Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, brought up Peters’ record on abortion in a Dec. 31 item on its website. In a short article written by political director Karen Cross about the special election’s candidates, the South Pasadena Republican was taken to task for votes in the 2013 legislative session. ""State Rep. Kathleen Peters has a 100 percent pro-abortion voting record – even voting against a ban on sex-selection abortions,"" the piece read. It also stated David Jolly is ""the only candidate in the GOP primary who has taken a pro-life stand."" The item added that fellow Republican Mark Bircher had not returned the group’s questionnaire and has refused to answer questions about the issue. First Jolly accused Peters of refusing to ‘take a stand’ to repeal Obamacare (we rated that Mostly False) and now a conservative group says she’s for abortions. It looks like we have to check into her stance on an issue once again. On the (voting) record Like the Obamacare accusation, it was initially difficult to pin down Peters’ stance on abortion. During her campaign, she didn’t give a clear response to questions about whether she supported further restrictions on abortions, or if Roe vs. Wade should be overturned. ""Honestly I think that's a private issue. I think too often we put social issues into government that don't belong,"" she told the Tampa Bay Times. She continued, ""I don't support government-funded abortions, but I don't support the government dictating to religious hospitals what they can and cannot do."" She gave a similar answer on a Dec. 22 episode of Bay News 9’s Political Connections. She was much more specific after the National Right to Life article came out. When asked about the issue at a Belleair Women's Republican Club meeting on Jan. 3, Peters said she was ""absolutely pro-life"" and had ""voted on good policy that protects the unborn children."" Her campaign said that she ""has always believed that life begins at conception and should only end through natural death."" The campaign has also said Peters may not have even received the group’s questionnaire. Abortion bills didn’t fare well in the 2013 Florida legislative session, with most not getting past the committee level. Peters, who was a freshman representative last year, only had the chance to cast a vote on three pieces of legislation involving abortion-related issues. National Right to Life confirmed they were the three taken into account for their claim about her voting record. HB 759, the Offenses Against Unborn Child Bill, sought to make the injury or death of an unborn child during the commission of a crime a separate offense with its own penalties. It passed the House along mostly party lines on April 18, 74-43. Peters and Ray Pilon, R-Sarasota, were the only Republicans to vote against the bill. The measure later failed. The only bill specifically mentioned by Cross in the claim, the Ban On Race or Sex-Selective Abortions Bill, HB 845, is the one that dealt directly with abortions. The legislation required making doctors sign an affidavit before the procedure affirming they were not knowingly performing an abortion based on the sex or race of the fetus. Again Peters and Pilon voted against the bill, along with Republicans Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, and Bill Hager, R-Delray Beach. It passed the House on April 18, 71-44, but also eventually failed. Peters’ campaign manager Mark Zubaly said the no vote was because although she opposed sex-selection abortions, Peters felt the legislation would have created unnecessary regulations for doctors without solving the problem. Finally, the entire Legislature voted in favor of HB 1129, the Care for Infants Born Alive After Botched Abortion Bill. The bill required immediate medical care for fetuses born alive following an attempted abortion. It unanimously passed the House on April 17, and the Senate on April 30. All three of those bills were listed under the Florida Family Policy Council’s list of ""Good Bills"" for the session, meaning legislation that furthered conservative, anti-abortion interests (""Bad Bills"" dealt primarily with promoting forms of gambling and gay rights). Since Peters voted against HB 759 and HB 845, that’s two strikes, as far as National Right to Life would be concerned. But then there’s HB 1129, which was supported by pro-life and pro-choice advocates. Cross said the vote counted against Peters because she ""did not co-sponsor"" the legislation. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, introduced the bill, with Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, added on as a sponsor. Eventually 25 co-sponsors, two of which were Democrats, were added to the bill. That sounds pretty nitpicky to us, since there were obviously plenty of other Republicans who didn’t co-sponsor the bill, but still voted for it. Either way, Peters’ yes vote is what the anti-abortion lobby wanted for HB 1129. When we asked Cross to clarify whether her vote was negated only because she wasn’t a co-sponsor, she referred us to the Florida chapter of the organization, which didn’t respond to our attempt to contact them. Our ruling National Right to Life said Peters ""has a 100 percent pro-abortion voting record – even voting against a ban on sex-selection abortions."" It’s true that she voted against a sex-selection abortion ban, no matter what reasoning she offered as an explanation. Whether all her votes were ""pro-abortion"" is another matter. Peters voted against two bills ostensibly designed to protect unborn children, but she voted for a third bill that aimed to save the life of children born after failed attempts at abortions. That doesn't make her voting record on the issue 100 percent ""pro-abortion."" We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDA5680>],/factchecks/2014/jan/09/national-right-life-committee/kathleen-peters-has-100-percent-pro-abortion-votin/
"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Tom Coburn']","
Is Cover Oregon spending $10 million advertising Obamacare with ads that don't even mention 'insurance'?
","Enrollment problems continue to dog Cover Oregon’s balky website, despite millions of dollars spent trying to get the system running. Despite the well-publicized woes, however, state officials say they are making progress toward getting people enrolled in time to avoid federal penalties. All of which makes Cover Oregon a prime target for critics who say the state’s new health-insurance marketplace is too expensive, too intrusive and too restrictive. U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., took a shot at Cover Oregon in his new ""Wastebook 2013"" -- a comic-book-style tome he puts out each year highlighting what he calls 100 examples of wasted taxpayer dollars. Chapter Nine, ""Millions Spent Building, Promoting an Insurance Plan Few Want and a Website that Doesn’t Work,"" said this: ""Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare with advertisements that don’t even mention the program or how to enroll in it."" He singles out two television ads, both produced for Cover Oregon by NORTH, a Portland advertising agency. One spot, Coburn said, ""does not mention the word ‘insurance,’ "" while another, he added, ""does not mention the word ‘insurance,’ but features what appears to be Gumby riding on the Beatles’ yellow submarine."" The implication is that the state spent a ton of money on ads that may have been clever but not direct or effective. Did Cover Oregon spend $10 million for television ads that didn’t mention the word ‘insurance’? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The many assertions in ""Wastebook 2013"" are heavily footnoted, so we checked there first to see which sources Coburn relied on. The first footnote for the Cover Oregon claim took us to a July 28, 2013, cbsnews.com story, which reported that Cover Oregon’s new ad campaign cost $10 million. The second footnote linked directly to one of the Cover Oregon ads, ""Fly With Your Own Wings,"" a 31-second animated ad that opens and closes with the words ""Cover Oregon."" The television ad included a pleasantly peppy song but never used the word ""insurance."" So on that score, at least, Coburn’s claim appears to be on the mark. Still, wondering about context, we called Mark Ray, the NORTH principal and creative director who produced the ads. The spots Coburn focuses on in his ""Wastebook,"" Ray said, were the very first ads produced to market Cover Oregon. They were intended to raise general awareness about the program rather than rain down nuts-and-bolts specifics, he said. Details on how and where to enroll were included in subsequent spots. This is a common strategy for rolling out brand-new programs. ""He’s cherry-picking something he doesn’t understand,"" Ray said of Coburn. In Ray’s view, the campaign has been a smashing success. The 7 percent public awareness of Cover Oregon in May, he said, had soared to 78 percent in September, based on follow-up polling. ""Those are the best results I’ve had in my career,"" he said. So we have disagreement on omission of the word ""insurance"" in Cover Oregon’s first advertisements. Coburn is correct that it’s not there. But Ray adds important context in noting that the ads were early and part of a campaign designed to morph from general to specific. Newer ads, available on Cover Oregon’s YouTube page, provide details of how and where to enroll, and nearly all use the word ""insurance."" That still leaves the $10 million figure cited in Coburn’s ""Wastebook."" Wanting to know exactly what the figure, in the senator’s view, represented, we contacted John Hart, Coburn’s communications manager. He spoke only of Cover Oregon’s initial television ads. In an email, he wrote, ""If the state of Oregon or local communities like Portland want to fund these ads we would applaud their effort to make their state a haven for indie rockers or lumberjacks without insurance, as the ad melodically suggests."" Neither he nor ""Wastebook 2013"" addressed any other elements of the marketing campaign. We then called Michael Cox, Cover Oregon’s communications director. He said the ads singled out in the ""Wastebook"" actually cost $3.5 million to produce and air. The $10 million figure, he said, came from a news report cited in the ""Wastebook"" footnotes that mistakenly conflated the total costs of the campaign’s first phase -- which included Spanish-language spots, information fliers and fact sheets -- with the costs of the TV ads Coburn spotlighted. Even then, he said, the total costs of the first phase were $8.3 million, not $10 million. We called Coburn’s office again and asked Hart about the figures provided by Cox. ""We didn’t claim they’ve spent $10 million,"" Hart said. ""That was the amount budgeted. If they’ve spent less, that’s terrific."" We glanced back at ""Wastebook 2013,"" which leads its Cover Oregon claim by saying, ""Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare…"" Cover Oregon has not spent $10 million on the ads Coburn singles out in his ""Wastebook 2013."" A budget passed along by Cox puts the figure at $3.5 million. A Coburn spokesman brushed aside the difference by saying his office never said that $10 million had been spent, only that it had been budgeted. The spokesman’s own words, however, are contradicted by the senator’s ""Wastebook 2013"" entry on Cover Oregon. On Coburn’s first claim, the Cover Oregon ads in question do not mention the word ""insurance."" But the context in this case is vital. These were not the campaign’s only ads, and later ads make details clear. We also find that the senator completely missed the mark on the amount of money spent. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC90D7C0>],/factchecks/2014/jan/08/tom-coburn/cover-oregon-spending-10-million-advertising-obama/
"['Legal Issues', 'Missouri', 'Ed Emery']","
Emery’s number on Missouri’s impeachments against judges is mostly right, but it needs more context
","Unlike the federal impeachment process, the power to try most impeachment cases lies with the Missouri Supreme Court rather than the Senate. For years, some Missouri lawmakers have sought to change that. Senate Bill 9, spearheaded by Sen. Ed Emery, R-Lamar, proposes a power shift from the Supreme Court back to the state Senate. During a committee hearing on Jan. 28, Emery, along with several other senators, expressed concern toward a lack of check and balance within the judiciary branch with impeachments against judges tried by one of their own. ""The reason I’m speaking specifically to judges right now is because 80 percent of impeachments in Missouri have been against judges,"" Emery said. We decided to take a closer look at the percentage of impeachment cases. Is it true judges are impeached at a much higher rate than elected state officials in Missouri? If so, why? Prior to 1945, all impeachments were launched by the House and tried by the Senate in Missouri, according to the Missouri Constitution written in 1875. Cases against the governor would be tried by the Senate and presided by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. A constitutional amendment in 1924 proposed to transfer the authority to try most impeachment cases to the Supreme Court. It was ratified in the 1945 Missouri Constitution. Impeachments against the governor or a Supreme Court member are now tried by a special commission of ""seven eminent jurists"" chosen by the Senate. Emery cited a list of 10 impeachment cases from 1825 to present, eight of which were against judges. The list includes all cases where the House voted to approve the articles of impeachment, regardless of the final outcome, Emery said. Most cases on Emery’s list are accurate. However, there’s more to it. According to House and Senate Journals kept by Missouri State Archives, the House passed articles of impeachment against a total of 11 judges or public officials in history. (Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens is not on the list, because he resigned before the House took any formal actions initiating an impeachment process.) They are: • Circuit Judge Richard S. Thomas, 1825. Accused of bribery in order to arrange for his son a clerk position. Impeached and removed. • Circuit Judge David Todd, 1828. Accused of misdemeanor in office. Tried by the Senate but outcome unknown. • Circuit Judge William C. Carr, 1832. Accused of being ""wholly unqualified for the judicial station."" Acquitted. • Circuit Judge Albert Jackson, 1859. Accused of oppression in office. Acquitted. • Circuit Judge Aaron Van Wormer, 1865. Accused of misdemeanor in office. • Circuit Judge Walter King, 1867. Accused on several accounts, including not finding any bills of indictment against Confederate soldiers and refusing to take the loyalty oath as required by the constitution. Impeached and removed. • Circuit Judge Philander Lucas, 1872. Charged with ""allowing indictments to create costs by granting mileage allowances to jurors."" Impeached but impeachment articles withdrawn later. • State Treasurer Larry Brunk, 1931. Impeached but acquitted. • Circuit Judge Virgil A. Poelker, 1963. Resigned before trial. • Circuit Judge John D. Hasler, 1968. Resigned before trial. • Secretary of State Judith Moriarty, 1994. Impeached and removed. Emery’s list was short of several cases and counted in Circuit Judges John Leland and James Moody as being impeached. There was no record of the House passing articles of impeachment against either of the judges, according to the journals. His broader point was accurate: About 80 percent of the cases (9 out of 11) were against judges. However, most cases took place prior to when the Missouri Plan came in place, whereas two public officials and two judges were impeached in the 20th century. At the national level, 19 federal officials were impeached throughout U.S. history, including 15 judges, two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and two other elected officials, according to the U.S. House of Representatives History, Art and Archives website. Michael A. Wolff, former Chief Justice on the Missouri Supreme Court, said most impeachment cases in Missouri occurred in the 19th century because judges were appointed rather than elected up until the 1840s. Dissatisfied by the number of impeachment cases against judges, lawmakers amended the Missouri Constitution in the 1840s to select judges by election, Wolff said. An anti-corruption effort was put forward in 1940 by several counties in Missouri to establish a nonpartisan court plan, which later became known as the Missouri Plan, Wolff said. Judges in those counties were since selected by a nonpartisan commission. The number of impeachments against judges since dropped, Wolff said. The Commission of Retirement, Removal and Discipline of Judges, which was established in 1972, now deals with removals of judges because of misdemeanors, he said. St. Louis attorney James Layton, who worked in the state Attorney General’s office for 22 years, said the changes in Missouri’s judicial selection methods likely reduced the likelihood of impeachment against judges. Mechanisms such as the retention election would also remove judges of poor quality, Layton said. Layton said giving the court power to try impeachment cases made the process ""less political"" and ""more professional."" ""They have a level of apolitical credibility that the Senate could never have,"" Layton said. ""In Missouri, where we have a nonpartisan selection, I think it gives you a level of credibility and professionalism that would be hard to do in a political body."" Emery said ""80 percent of impeachments in Missouri have been against judges."" Emery’s percentage calculation is accurate, but his overall statement does not reflect the relevant context of the current debate. The claim does not factor in shifts in Missouri’s judge selection methods prior to 1940 and miscounted some cases. It’s important to note that the number of impeachments against judges have dropped sharply since the Missouri Plan, and half of the impeachments in the 20th century have been against public officials.

No, members of Congress don't have automatic dual citizenship with Israel

A photo, posted Feb. 17 on the Facebook page ""SMALL PEOPLE"" AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT said, ""89 of our Senators and Congress hold dual citizenship citizenship (sic) with Israel."" Text accompanying the post says: ""Imagine if they were Russian citizens, or Iranian; all hell would break loose. But Israelis in our US Congress? That’s fine, right?"" The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post sourced a June 22, 2018, story from Prepare For Change, a conspiracy site that says a massive upheaval of society is imminent. The moderator of that website told us the story’s content was pulled from an article by the Governmental Services Corporation Watch and a post from Reddit’s conspiracy page. We noticed a discrepancy right away: The article’s headline reads ""89"" members of Congress hold dual citizenship. But the first sentence claims 89 percent of senators and congress hold dual citizenship. It’s unclear where the 89 or 89 percent figure comes in. But the list is problematic for several reasons. Before we get into specific flaws of the list, it's important to know that just because everyone on the list is Jewish does not mean they hold dual citizenship with Israel. The social media posts seem predicated on that.  None of the current members listed were born in Israel, so they wouldn’t be naturalized Israeli citizens. Sen. Michael Bennet was born in India. Everyone else? The United States. (We explained in a 2015 fact-check why American-born Jews, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, aren’t automatically granted dual citizenship, despite pervasive online lists.) Some people may think American-born Jews have automatic dual citizenship due to a misinterpretation of the Israeli Law of Return. This is an immigration visa that ""shall be granted to every Jew who has expressed his desire to settle in Israel,"" with some stipulations. This is a visa someone must request; it is not automatic. Also, none of these named politicians have settled in Israel. There are other reasons why the list is not credible. Only 62 officials from Congress and the executive branch — mostly Democratic or independent — were listed in this article, and 40 were called current members of the 112th U.S. Congress. Note that Congress is in its 116th session, with 34 Jewish representatives. One listed, Frank Lautenberg, has been dead almost six years. The list comes from a 2011 article published by the magazine Jewish Currents to highlight Jews in politics and point out Jewish liberalism. It did not say the politicians listed held dual citizenship. The order of the names in Jewish Currents matched Prepare For Change. Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said the list perpetuates the anti-Semitic trope of Jewish disloyalty. Prepare For Change’s article links to a page by the American Freedom Party, a white supremacist group. ""Jews have a long experience of being put on lists with very negative results,"" Tuchman said. ""The implication that you are promoting is that these people are not loyal citizens of the country."" Such lists aren’t confined to the questioning of politicians, either. Lists of Jews in positions of power in Hollywood, banking and academia surface in many cases, Tuchman said, to paint Jews as disloyal to the country and harboring an agenda. U.S. representatives must be U.S. citizens for seven years to qualify for office, and senators must be U.S. citizens for nine years, according to Article I of the Constitution.

Top reason for having fewer kids? Warren cites child care costs
","As Elizabeth Warren sees it, offering affordable child care and early learning are the trifecta of pro-family policy — good for the kids, easier on the parents and a boost for the economy. The Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate spelled out her plan for universal child care and early learning on Feb. 19. Warren said the challenge of paying for child care today is shaping the most personal of family decisions. ""The financial squeeze is so severe that it’s even deterring families from having kids at all,"" Warren said. ""The high cost of child care is the No. 1 reason people give for having fewer children than they’d like."" As it turns out, somebody did ask couples about that, and Warren hewed to the survey results. But while the process of making babies is fairly straightforward, the (hopefully) conscious decision to make them is complicated. Costs, including child care, rank high, but so do other factors. Behind Warren’s statement lies a New York Times/Morning Consult poll from 2018. They reached 1,858 men and women ages 20 to 45. Of that, less than a quarter said ""they had or expected to have fewer children than they considered ideal."" Among that group of about 340 people, 64 percent said the reason they would have fewer children was because ""child care is too expensive."" The second most common reason at 54 percent was ""want more time with the children I have."" The poll is a ""useful data point, but it does not provide extremely strong evidence that this is the No. 1 reason,""sociologist Caroline Hartnett at the University of South Carolina told us. Harnett said the sample size was small and limited research means, ""we can't cross-check against other polls with similar questions."" Put another way: One survey does not one social truth make. Warren’s statement ""was reasonable,"" said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. But Cohen spotted an issue with the way the survey asked people to compare what they were doing to some imagined perfect number of offspring. Cohen called that ""fraught,"" because it’s easy for people to say what they might ideally like, without having to think too hard about whether they really would like it. There’s no question that women in the United States are giving birth at record low rates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2017, the general fertility rate was 60.2 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, down 3 percent from the year before. There are three different ways to measure fertility, but two of them show the number is down, and researchers have been trying to figure out why. There are a variety of reasons. Cohen noted that women are waiting longer to start having children. ""The long-term trend is toward later births, which is generally going to mean fewer births,"" Cohen wrote in 2018. ""People who want later births,"" he wrote, ""tend to want fewer children, and some people run out of time."" Cohen told us that plenty of factors play a role. Economic uncertainty, the rising cost of raising children, career demands and family leave policies are all important, he said, ""but I don't have any research to prioritize or rank those things specifically."" In terms of people having fewer children than they might want, policy analyst Anqi Chen at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College pointed to a 2010 study that found that the demands of work stands out, especially for women as they get older. Career trade-offs become tougher as women rise in the workforce. And the research also shows there’s a fundamental challenge of finding someone to have a child with, Chen said. The age when women marry (and men too) has climbed steadily since 1960. Divorce is also more common. ""No one can deny that having a kid is expensive — both in terms of opportunity cost and explicit costs — but it seems that competition from careers and not being in an ideal partnership are also very important,"" Chen said. The New York Times/Morning Consult survey lent some support to this. The top two reasons childless adults gave for either waiting or not wanting to have children were ""want leisure time"" and ""haven’t found a partner."" The third was ""can’t afford child care."" One of the challenges of sorting out the driving forces is they play off of each other. Religion, ethnicity and education heavily influence people’s ""taste for children,"" as an article from the Boston College retirement research center put it, but those characteristics don’t live in a vacuum, separate from bread and butter concerns, such as the cost of child care. Warren said, ""The high cost of child care is the number one reason people give for having fewer children than they’d like."" That is what respondents said in a survey commissioned by the New York Times. The experts in fertility that we reached said the cost of raising children is certainly a factor, but that particular survey doesn’t prove that the cost of child care ranks above all others. Experts said research is limited, but what's been done suggests that a host of forces, including economic conditions, government policy, religion, ethnicity and education all play important roles.

Donald Trump wrong that Harry Reid was 'thrown out' of office
","President Donald Trump famously said, ""When someone attacks me, I always attack back … except 100x more."" Trump appears to have stuck to this approach with former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. In an interview with CNN, Reid said that George W. Bush, a Republican, was a much better president than Trump. ""There's no question in my mind that George Bush would be Babe Ruth in this league that he's in with Donald Trump,"" Reid said, adding, ""Donald Trump wouldn't make the team."" Trump fired back via Twitter on Feb. 25: ""Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!"" Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change! Trump is entitled to his opinion of Reid’s tenure, which included 12 years as Senate Democratic leader (eight of them as majority leader) and 30 years as a senator overall. But he’s wrong to say that Reid ""got thrown out."" (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Reid announced that he would not seek another term in March 2015, when he was 75. He released a farewell video in which he cited the after-effects of an exercise injury that nearly blinded him in one eye. Reid pledged to serve out his term in the Senate as well as his term as the Democratic leader, which at the time meant the minority leader. He fulfilled both promises, leaving the Senate in January 2017. This means that neither the voters of Nevada nor the members of his caucus forced him out of his seat or out of his leadership post. ""There is no way to characterize Reid’s departure as being ‘thrown out,’"" said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University of St. Louis. Jon Ralston, a longtime Nevada journalist, was one of many observers to call out Trump’s assertion about Reid. Ralston tweeted, ""Whatever you think of Prince Harry: 1. He did not get thrown out. 2. He may be the most influential senator in NV history. 3. Why not at least be creative and thank him for the nuclear option?"" The last point refers to Reid’s decision to eliminate filibusters for lower-court judicial appointments, which Republicans later expanded to Supreme Court nominations.

Why not at least be creative and thank him for the nuclear option? https://t.co/3Xb3Pq1Paq Trump said Reid ""got thrown out."" However, Reid declined on his own to run for another term, at a time when his health — in his mid-seventies — had become a concern.

Donald Trump leaves out part of the story with New Mexico border barrier
","President Donald Trump’s ongoing quest for border wall funding isn’t stopping him from celebrating projects already in the works. ""We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 – 47 days ahead of schedule! Many miles more now under construction! #FinishTheWall"" Trump tweeted Feb. 20. His tweet included a video showing construction over time. We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 – 47 days ahead of schedule! Many miles more now under construction! #FinishTheWall pic.twitter.com/TYkj3KRdOC He amplified the message by retweeting his own tweet a day later and adding, ""THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW!"" At Trump rallies, chants have gone from ""build the wall"" to ""finish the wall."" We’ve fact-checked Trump’s previous claims about border wall been under construction. We rated those statements Mostly False, because the projects included replacement fencing and others planned before Trump ran for office. With Trump’s newest declaration of a completed wall in New Mexico, we wanted to take a fresh look. Barriers have gone up in New Mexico. (Trump calls them walls.) But this section of the border isn’t getting a barrier for the first time; what was built replaced existing structures. Government documents suggest the project finished either on time or earlier than anticipated. The project in New Mexico consists of 20 miles of replacement barriers that officials say will be more durable and effective in stopping vehicles and pedestrians from illegally entering the United States. The barriers that were taken down were designed to stop vehicles from crossing into the United States. They were a mix of low posts and tall fencing that border authorities said would not stop people from walking across the border. The fence could be breached and climbed over, and the posts were low enough that people could also climb over them or go through some of their gaps. Customs and Border Protection used the terms post and rail, Normandy-style fence, and bollard fencing to describe the previous barriers. Here's what the previous fencing looked like: The new project is fencing consisting of ""new-type P-3 bollard wall,"" according to a March 2018 environmental stewardship plan prepared by consulting firms for U.S. Customs Border and Protection. It's designed to stop vehicles and also prevent people from climbing over it or going underneath it. ""The removal of vehicle fencing and replacement with pedestrian fencing will assist (U.S. Border Patrol) agents in reducing illegal cross-border violations by improving enforcement efficiency while providing a safer work environmental (sic) for agents,"" the plan said. The replacement fence was designed to withstand vehicle impact and resist cutting with hand tools or torches, the document said. The overall project also included the installation of border lights, detection cameras, and improvements to patrol and access roads, the report said. Crews started replacing the 20-mile vehicle barrier west of Santa Teresa, N.M., on April 9, 2018, Customs and Border Protection said in a news release that day. They called the new construction a ""bollard-style wall"" that would cost $73.3 million. Aaron A. Hull, the El Paso Sector chief patrol agent, said the barrier would be 18 to 30 feet high during a press conference. A reporter asked Hull if he was referring to the construction as a wall, instead of a fence, to match Trump’s terminology. Hull said he heard physical barriers ""referred to by a lot of terms"" during his time at the agency. ""The wall that we are putting in place is accurately described as a wall, because it’s a very serious structure,"" Hull said. ""You are talking, like I said, 18 feet, 5-foot anti-climbing plate, concrete filled with rebar, 6 feet into the ground, another 2 feet of concrete underneath that, sir, it’s very much a wall and we are going to use it to stop illegal entries."" Hull also said the replacement barriers were a result of an executive order from Trump calling for physical structures at the southwest border. ""Does that mean this is the president’s border wall?"" a reporter asked Hull. ""That is correct,"" Hull said. ""The president has started his project. ...This is the beginning in this sector of the president’s border wall."" Trump in 2017 ordered the construction of border wall prototypes. But Customs and Border Protection is not using any of the eight prototypes for new construction, because they did not meet agency requirements. The agency said the prototypes ""provided valuable data"" to help select design elements for future designs. Funding for the New Mexico project came from the fiscal year 2017 budget, the agency told us. Contract details name the Defense Department as the awarding agency for the project and ""U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Civil Program Financing Only"" as the funding sub-agency. (The video included in Trump’s tweet featured the Army Corps of Engineers’ logo.) According to a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, the Army Corps of Engineers ""helps the contract/acquisition process on behalf of Customs and Border Protection."" Customs and Border Protection has given varied estimates for the project’s completion. By one measure, it was 47 days early. By another, it was on time. Customs and Border Protection said in a press release that the project would take about 390 days to complete, ending as late as May 2019. Hull bumped it up two months to March 2019 in his April news conference. The contract with the Montana company doing the construction said the ""period of performance"" was Jan. 22, 2018, through March 18, 2019. However, the environmental stewardship plan said the project would take nine months to complete. Since it started in April, it should have ended in January. By that metric, actual construction wrapped along the expected timeline. Trump said, ""We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 — 47 days ahead of schedule!"" The construction that ended Jan. 30 replaced vehicle fencing; it did not cover new areas of the border for the first time. Officials say the new barrier can stop vehicle and pedestrian crossings. It has been described as both a fence and a bollard-style wall by Customs and Border Protection. Timelines for the project’s completion have varied. But they generally show that it either finished on time or ahead of schedule. Trump's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"['Abortion', 'New York', 'Michael Long']","
Abortion foe makes false claim about NY law
","New York State’s Reproductive Health Act, signed into law in late January by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has been the source of much disagreement between supporters and opponents of the law, and has caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who criticized it during his State of the Union address. Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party of New York State, criticized the new law during an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis, saying it had gone ""too far."" ""They’ve removed all the criminal penalties from it,"" Long said. ""A woman could give birth to a baby, and then, they have a discussion with the doctor, if the baby was born alive, they would just let the baby expire. It’s a very sad commentary."" We looked into Long’s claim that ""if the baby was born alive, they would just let the baby expire."" In an interview, Long said he was sure the law didn’t spell out that babies would be left to die. But he said because the law allows abortions later in pregnancy, he questions what will happen to babies who are born alive.   Long referred us to Kathleen Gallagher, director of pro-life activities at the New York State Catholic Conference, for specifics. Gallagher said the new law repeals part of the state’s Public Health Law. The repealed part states than in abortions after 20 weeks, a second doctor must be present to ""take control of and provide immediate medical care for any live birth that is the result of the abortion."" The repealed part also states: ""Such child should be afforded immediate legal protection under the laws of the state of New York, including but not limited to applicable provisions of the social services law, article five of the civil rights law and the penal law."" A representative of National Right to Life, an organization that lobbies against abortion, also took note of the repealed sections of the Public Health Law. Jennifer Popik, director of federal legislation for the organization, wrote in an email that because New York’s law allows licensed medical professionals other than doctors to perform abortions, it’s possible that a person qualified to care for a baby would not be present if a baby was born alive.   Popik also referred us to data from the Centers for Disease Control from 2003-14. This data from selected states showed that there were 143 babies born alive after ""induced terminations."" That number could be underestimated, according to the CDC. The data does not reflect the full circumstances of their deaths, but researchers noted that in 97 of those cases, there were maternal health complications or one or more congenital anomalies. We asked one of the new law’s sponsors, State Sen. Liz Krueger, if babies born alive during an abortion procedure would be left to ""expire,"" as Long said. Krueger’s spokesman, Justin Flagg, wrote in an email that ""the RHA does not change standards of medical practice. Any baby born alive in New York State would be treated like any other live birth, and given appropriate medical care. This was the case before the RHA, and it remains the case now."" ""A provider that inappropriately abandons or neglects a patient would violate professional misconduct laws and be subject to significant sanctions which include losing his/her medical license, fines, as well as potential civil and criminal liability,"" said Hazel Crampton-Hays, a spokeswoman for Cuomo. ""The Reproductive Health Act does nothing to change that."" Federal law also protects infants in this situation. The Born Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 states that any person born alive under any circumstance has full rights as any other person. Dr. Vanessa Barnabei, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo, said that she understands how the law could lead some people to believe that babies who are born alive would be left to die, but said that’s not what happens in practice. Pregnancies are sometimes terminated in order to save the life of the mother, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the baby won’t survive, Barnabei said. In her experience, the typical standard of care is to resuscitate infants born after 24 weeks, when they are considered viable, she said. Abortions later in the second trimester or third trimester are complex and require highly trained practitioners. Because of this, they are typically done in hospitals, which employ other providers able to care for any baby born alive, she said. Babies who are delivered with severe problems would not be resuscitated, if that was the parents’ wishes, she said. That standard of care for babies born alive when a pregnancy is terminated existed before the law was enacted, according to the bill’s sponsor. Planned Parenthood of New York City put us in touch with one of its board members, Dr. Stephen Chasen, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College.  Chasen said Long’s statement misrepresents what the RHA does and characterizes a situation that isn’t abortion. ""It’s about a model of hospice care that patients and their doctor have determined is the best course of action, using the best medicine available, and not pursuing something that’s futile,"" he said.  ""It’s not infanticide. It’s not indifference. And, it has nothing to do with abortion. It is hospice care, and hospice care can apply to a range of situations,"" he said. Our ruling Long, chairman of the state Conservative Party, said that under the new law, babies born alive would be able to be left to ""expire."" The state law repealed some protections for babies in these circumstances, but that part of the law was redundant, and under federal and state law, infants born alive are due the same medical care and protections as anyone else. In cases where a hospice approach is taken to babies delivered very early in pregnancy or those with lethal malformations, this approach predates the new law, and it is an accepted standard of care. We rate Long’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC615600>],/factchecks/2019/feb/22/michael-long/abortion-foe-makes-exaggerated-claim-about-ny-law/

Are border crossings at “historically low levels,” as Rep. David Price says?
","President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency over the U.S. border with Mexico has sent congressional Democrats scrambling to poke holes in his case for building a wall. ""Not only is there no national emergency at the border: crossings remain at historically low levels,"" said Rep. David Price, D-N.C., in a Feb. 14 tweet. Price, who represents North Carolina’s 4th Congressional District, which includes Orange County and parts of Wake and Durham Counties, is not the first to make this point. But we wondered if the number of border patrol apprehensions — the statistic experts generally use to measure illegal border crossings — has changed much since the last time we checked it out, so we decided to give Price’s statement a fresh look. Katelynn Vogt, Price’s communications director, pointed to a January 2019 FAQ from the Congressional Research Service, an article from USA Today, and related fact-checks from The New York Times and NPR as evidence in support of the claim. ""Since peaking in the year 2000, there has been a distinct downward trend in apprehensions at the southern border,"" she said. ""While the specific number has fluctuated year-to-year, including a slight uptick for 2018, it remains at historically low levels.""  The CRS report and data from U.S. Border Patrol indicate that apprehensions at the southwest border began a steady increase in 1960 and peaked at about 1.64 million in 2000. They then sank to a 45-year low of 303,916 in 2017. (There were 263,991 apprehensions in 1971 and only 21,022 in 1960.) But as Vogt noted, those arrests bounced back up somewhat in 2018 to 396,579. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank in Washington, D.C., noted that apprehensions were actually at their lowest during the 1960s, even though they have been ""on a significant decline"" since 2006 — the last time there were more than 1 million in a year. She said the dip in 2017 occurred largely because Trump’s election and his administration’s tough immigration stance caused ""a temporary slowdown in apprehensions"" for a few months before ""those numbers then reverted largely to their regular seasonal patterns."" But if you limit the scope of the time period, the claim is more accurate. When PolitiFact California fact-checked Gov. Gavin Newsom’s State of the State address earlier this month, Ev Meade, director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego, said Newsom’s claim that ""we are currently experiencing the lowest number of border crossings since 1971"" was ""basically true"" given the long-term trend. ""It’s been up and down,"" Meade said. ""There’s been some variation. But the long downward trend continues."" Price’s statement was less precise than Newsom’s, and also less precise than a similar statement that earned former California Gov. Jerry Brown a True last year. While both governors gave specific timeframes as benchmarks for their comparisons, Price said crossings ""remain at historically low levels,"" which the average reader could assume means at or close to the lowest levels ever. Price said ""crossings (at the border) remain at historically low levels."" The number of border patrol apprehensions in 2017 was the lowest in 45 years, and the number in 2018 is slightly higher but still low, especially relative to the peak in 2000. Illegal crossings have been trending down since 2006, with some year-to-year fluctuations. But apprehension totals were far lower in the 1960s, so a more accurate statement would have said crossings in 2017 were the lowest they had been since 1971. We rate the statement Mostly True.

20% of health costs are prescription drugs? Presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar's claim is close
","At a CNN town hall in New Hampshire, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of the Democratic candidates for president in 2020, was asked by a member of the audience: ""Why can’t we have Medicare for All?"" That proposal would create a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone. Without committing specifically to Medicare for All, Klobuchar, who is seen as running to the political center, said, ""I believe we have to get to universal health care in this country."" And a few minutes later, she made a statistical claim we want to check. ""But the other part of the equation is doing something about prescription drugs,"" Klobuchar said. ""They are nearly 20 percent of our health care costs now when you include hospital prescription drugs."" We wanted to know if her estimate for the share of prescription drugs on health spending is accurate. Klobuchar’s campaign pointed us to a recent estimate from the federal government, which uses personal health expenditures, and from a research center, which uses total health expenditures. There are differences in the data. (Personal spending, for example, does not account for spending on administration or construction). But both measures roughly work out in her favor. • 16.7 percent: This estimate by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was for how much of spending on personal health expenditures went for prescription drugs in 2015. (The estimate for 2018 is 16.8 percent.) By the way, almost three-quarters of the estimated $457 billion spent on prescription drugs was at retail outlets such as store pharmacies. The rest was for non-retail drugs — those dispensed by medical providers, such as in a hospital or doctor’s office. We found that same 16.7 percent figure matches a current estimate on how much is spent on retail and non-retail drugs as a percentage of personal health expenditures. That estimate comes from a May 2018 report by Altarum, a non-profit research group based in Ann Arbor, Mich. (The report itself says prescription drugs amount to 14.2 percent of total health expenditures, but Altarum told us the figure is 16.7 percent when considering only personal health expenditures.) • 15 percent: This estimate, for total 2016 health care spending, was done by the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. It was published in July 2018. Like the federal estimate, this estimate counted spending on retail and non-retail drugs; but it is different in that it counted revenues that accrued not only to drug manufacturers, but also to intermediaries such as distributors. Economist Gail Wilensky, a senior fellow at the Project Hope health foundation, cautioned us that estimates on how much is spent on hospital prescription drugs are more difficult to produce than what is spent on retail prescription drugs. But Klobuchar did specifically include hospital prescription drug spending in her claim. And two other health care experts — the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Cynthia Cox and Katherine Baicker, dean of the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago — told us the estimates that include hospital drugs are reliable, and that measuring prescription drug spending against personal health expenditures is solid. Klobuchar says prescription drugs ""are nearly 20 percent of our health care costs now when you include hospital prescription drugs."" The best estimates we’ve found put the figure for spending on prescription drugs between 15 percent, when considering total health care spending, and 17 percent, when considering only personal health care spending.

How much have domestic violence rates fallen since the Violence Against Women Act passed?
","Joe Biden championed the Violence Against Women Act as a Democratic senator from Delaware in 1994. Two and a half decades and two terms as vice president later, he’s still touting the law and its impact as he considers whether to run for president in 2020. The law increased funding and provided additional legal tools for combating violent crimes committed against women. The law has been reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013, and it expired in the recent government shutdown. It must now be reauthorized, which Biden urged lawmakers to do quickly. ""Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%,"" Biden tweeted Feb. 15. ""The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now."" Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%. The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now. We have previously looked at a similar assertion. In 2013, Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., cited a drop of 67 percent since passage. We found official Justice Department data from 2010 showing that it had fallen 63 percent by then, so we rated the statement Mostly True. But that was more than six years ago. What does the current data say? Biden appears to be in the ballpark, though when we discussed the data with domestic violence experts, they offered a few caveats. As it happens, the data hasn’t advanced very much. There hasn’t been any equivalent data published for the years beyond 2012. In 2012, the domestic violence rate was slightly higher than it was in 2010, so the drop between 1994 and 2012 was about 60 percent. This was the report that Biden’s office pointed as evidence to when we contacted them. More recent data — related, but distinct — suggests that at least one subset of domestic violence, intimate partner homicide, may actually be experiencing a modest upswing. According to a paper now being finalized by Northeastern University criminologists Emma E. Fridel and James Alan Fox, homicides by intimate partners have risen modestly since about 2014, both for men and women as victims. Here’s a chart from the forthcoming paper:  Source: Courtesy James Alan Fox, Northeastern University While the frequency of intimate partner homicide is well below where it was in the early 1990s, Fox said, ""there has been a recent uptick, particularly with guns."" The second caveat concerns cause and effect. It would stand to reason that the law did help bring down the domestic violence rate. But it may not have been the only factor. Biden’s statement ""implies causation, when all we have is correlation,"" said Leigh Goodmark, a law professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law, where she launched the Gender Violence Clinic. Goodmark noted that the decline in domestic violence has paralleled a similarly steep decline in overall violent crime. This makes it hard to determine how much of the decline in domestic violence is due to the law and how much is due to broader societal trends. Here’s a chart from the Justice Department showing the trend lines for all violent crime and for all intimate partner violence between 1993 and 2010:  Source: U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics Goodmark added a related point: Most of the decline occurred prior to 2000. Between 2000 and 2010, by contrast, the domestic violence rate essentially stagnated. ""At the same time that, through the Violence Against Women Act, we’re putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the criminal legal response to domestic violence, the rate of domestic violence fell less than the overall crime rate fell,"" she said. ""What’s remarkable is that domestic violence is stubbornly resistant to falling even when the overall crime rate is still falling significantly."" Biden said, ""Since the passage of (the Violence Against Women Act), annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%."" He’s close on the percentage, which was 60 percent between 1994 and 2012. However, this data should be treated cautiously because it is six years old, and it’s unclear whether the decline is due to the law itself or to the broad, societal decline in all types of violent crime since the early 1990s. And after 2000, as violent crime continued to fall, the domestic violence rate remained about the same.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Marijuana', 'Wisconsin', 'Tony Evers']","
Evers claims drug crimes account for 75 percent or more of state prison population. Not even close.
","Gov. Tony Evers’ announcement that he would push to decriminalize marijuana in Wisconsin was one of the biggest splashes of his young tenure. It drew media coverage from across the country and sparked a war of news releases on the homefront. Evers said Feb. 18, 2019, that his first budget would include proposals to legalize medical marijuana; allow possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use; and expand the ability to expunge certain drug possession convictions. A news release announcing the move touted the medicinal benefits of marijuana, then pivoted to making a social justice case for change. ""Reforming Wisconsin’s marijuana laws to align with the people’s support for medical marijuana is an important part of the governor’s plan,"" the release said. ""But so, too, is addressing the social and racial justice aspect of marijuana use. Wisconsin has the highest incarceration rate in the country for Black men, and drug-related crimes account for as many as 75-85 percent of all inmates in our prisons."" Evers touted the same 75-85 percent statistic in a since-deleted tweet that day making the case for decriminalizing marijuana. It was repeated in the text of the NBC News story on Evers’ announcement. That’s a really high number. Given all the possible actions that could land a person in prison, do drug crimes really account for three-quarters or more of all inmates? The Wisconsin Department of Corrections uses a number of measures to track how inmates landed behind bars. But none of them are anywhere close to Evers’ number. A February 2017 analysis examining the point of prison admission showed 27 percent of inmates were sent to prison for a drug crime in 2016. That included opioids, cocaine, amphetamines and marijuana. Marijuana crimes accounted for 6.4 percent of prison admissions. Meanwhile, a point-in-time analysis done by the department showed 22 percent of Wisconsin inmates had an active drug offense in 2017 — meaning that was among the offenses for which they were serving time. The numbers are even lower when examining only the most serious offense for each inmate — in other words the one most likely responsible for the length of their prison stay. Only 11 percent of inmates in 2017 had a drug offense as their most serious charge. By comparison, a violent crime was the most serious charge for 66 percent of offenders, and a property crime for 14 percent. So where did Evers get his number? When we asked Evers’ office for the evidence behind the drug offenses claim, Deputy Chief of Staff Melissa Baldauff said they made a mistake. Evers’ staff has since removed the statistic from the online version of the news release announcing Evers’ marijuana proposal. Related: U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin strikes out on marijuana research claim Related: U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin's claim that VA doctors 'are censored' from talking about pot misses plot A staff member pulled the number from a 2013 WUWM radio story that attributed the number to retired Lutheran pastor Joe Ellwanger, Baldauff said. WUWM is Milwaukee’s National Public Radio affiliate. Ellwanger used the stat in the context of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study that found Wisconsin had the highest rates of incarceration in the nation for black residents. But he was wrong. ""Upon further investigation, the claim as reported in the WUWM article above did not appear to have sufficient substantiation, and it should have been removed from our document,"" Baldauff said in an email. ""So, the honest answer is that staff made a mistake. We have since updated our press release online to remove that statistic and note the error."" Evers’ tweet citing the statistic as proof of the need to decriminalize marijuana garnered more than 500 retweets before it was deleted several days later. Evers claimed in a news release and a tweet that drug-related crimes account for as 75 to 85 percent of the Wisconsin inmate population. That statistic was pulled from an incorrect article published six years ago. Current DOC data shows the actual number of prison inmates sentenced for drug offenses is a fraction of that number — about one-quarter of the prison population. Indeed the numbers are so far off, and the sourcing — a six-year-old article based on a radio interview that focused on a different topic — is so remote, it’s ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB960B00>],/factchecks/2019/feb/22/tony-evers/evers-claims-drug-crimes-prison-inmates/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders overplays Canada's out-of-pocket health care costs
","Medicare for All is a pillar of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. In his kick-off interview with CBS News, the Vermont senator was asked if his plan was too big for the country to handle. Sanders shot back that making sure everyone has health care didn’t seem beyond the reach of other developed nations. He pointed to America’s northern neighbor. ""Somehow or another in Canada, for a number of decades, they have provided quality care to all people without out-of-pocket expenses,"" Sanders said Feb. 19. ""You go in for cancer therapy, you don't take out your wallet. And they do it for about 50 percent per capita of the cost that we spend."" Let’s focus on those out-of-pocket costs. In Canada, if you actually go into a hospital and get treated there, it is free. Across the country, hospital visits and care at the doctor's office are covered 100 percent. But prescription drugs and some outpatient care are a different matter entirely. Out-of-pocket costs exist in Canada, and while they are lower than in the United States, they can be substantial. Anyone who has lived legally in Canada long enough, whether a citizen or not, qualifies for coverage. For the most part, Canada’s provinces and territories are in charge. The national program they call Medicare came together about 60 years ago and basically established today’s rules under which the federal government helps cover the costs and sets a floor for the core services the provinces and territories must cover. The history is important. Six decades ago, health care largely meant going to the hospital and seeing a doctor. Outpatient prescription drugs were not a big part of the health care people received. The architects made sure hospital and physician care were free, but today, prescription drugs — plus dental, vision, rehabilitation and other services — fall outside of the core package. For those other services, with the provinces and territories in the driver’s seat, what’s covered and what’s not varies from place to place. Medicare for All: What it is, what it isn't While a large chunk of health care spending comes through the government, a significant portion remains private. The public sector covers about 70 percent of the total, and private sources, including private insurance, account for the remaining 30 percent. Some of the latter is out-of-pocket. The Canadian government reported that in 2018, about 36 billion Canadian dollars, or 15 percent, of all health care spending was out-of-pocket. Sanders’ campaign said he was talking about covered care, not necessarily all care, and his proposal is different from the Canadian system. On Sanders’ specific example of getting treatment for cancer, the variation from place to place makes things unpredictable. Diagnoses and operations are clearly covered, and chemotherapy would be as well, so long as it takes place inside a hospital. Some drug regimens might take place as inpatient care at one hospital. But others could be handled outside the hospital in another jurisdiction, said Raisa Deber, public health professor at the University of Toronto. If that happens, the patient might rely either on a separate insurance policy if they had one, or pay themselves. A 2011 study in three provinces found that for the most common cancers — breast, colon, lung and prostate — the typical patient had about $200 in monthly out-of-pocket costs. The range however was large. For example, some breast cancer patients reported zero costs and others more than $5,200. Cancer drugs, along with all other prescription drugs, are a point of contention in Canada today. Canadians debate what to do about prescription drug coverage about as much as we do in the United States. ""Some people say it’s really dumb not to pay for prescription drugs,"" Deber said. ""Others agree, but argue we shouldn't do things that aren’t medically necessary. There’s tension between helping people pay their bills and giving a windfall to the drug companies."" Hard data on the pressures people face is limited. A recent survey found that 2.5 percent, an estimated 731,000 Canadians, said they had to borrow money to cover their drug costs. One challenge in coming up with a full picture is that each province and territory sets its own rules for coverage. ""In Quebec and Ontario, the cost to people is nearly zero"" for prescription drugs, said Ted Marmor, a professor of public policy and management at Yale University. ""But other provinces, such as Manitoba and Saskatchewan, focus on certain groups, mainly the poor and the elderly."" In 2017, spending on drugs far outpaced any change in hospital and physician costs as a share of total health care spending. Although many Canadians get supplemental insurance through their jobs, plenty do not. Some people fall through the cracks. ""The working poor have been left out of the fold,"" family physician and associate professor at the University of Toronto Andrew Boozary said. ""It looks like 10 to 20 percent of Canadians are without drug coverage."" Canada has had some success using price controls to limit the rise in drug costs. Overall, Deber said, ""it’s not likely to bankrupt you, particularly since physicians retain the option to admit patients to hospital, where their drugs would be fully covered."" For health care generally, Canadians have lower out-of-pocket costs than Americans. In an apples-to-apples comparison for 2016, the per capita cost in Canada was $690, while in the United States, it was $1,103. Sanders said, ""In Canada, for a number of decades they have provided quality care to all people without out-of-pocket expenses. You go in for cancer therapy, you don't take out your wallet."" So long as the care comes from a doctor or at a hospital, the Canadian system covers the full cost. But the country’s public insurance doesn’t automatically pay for all services, most significantly, prescription drugs, including drugs needed to fight cancer. Out-of-pocket spending is about 15 percent of all Canadian health care expenditures, and researchers said prescription drugs likely represented the largest share of that. The financial burden on people is not nearly as widespread or as severe as in the United States, but Sanders made it sound as though out-of-pocket costs were a non-issue in Canada.

Nygren: GOP tax plan “is better for working, middle-class families” making under $100K
","An early skirmish between Wisconsin’s Republican-led Legislature and Democratic governor revolves around competing tax cut plans. With both parties maneuvering to frame their plan as best for the Average Joe, state Rep. John Nygren offered some numbers to support his case. Nygren, R-Marinette, is co-chair of the powerful Joint Finance Committee. ""Our plan is better for working, middle-class families; 88% of the tax relief goes to those making $100,000 or less,"" Nygren tweeted Feb. 12, 2019. ""(Gov. Tony Evers’) plan benefits higher income earners. Only 75% of the tax relief goes to those making $100,000 or less."" Evers vetoed the GOP tax plan on Feb. 20, 2019, saying he didn’t want to address a major fiscal policy item outside the budget. But with the tax cut showdown likely to continue in some form, we’ll still dive into the numbers. Do they support Nygren’s claim about how they impact the middle class? Nygren’s staff pointed us to a pair of memos from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau that estimate the impact the two plans would have on Wisconsin income taxes in 2020. The bureau’s analysis shows the Republican plan would send 87.9 percent of tax savings to taxpayers with a federal adjusted gross income of less than $100,000. And the proposal from Evers and the Democrats would direct 74.5 percent of savings to that group. But there is a big catch. The Democratic tax cuts are bigger overall — totaling $441 million compared to $338 million for the Republican plan. So while a larger share of the GOP tax cuts would go to those making less than $100,000, the actual amount of tax savings for that group is lower. The Democrats’ plan would save a total of $328 million for taxpayers making less than $100,000. The Republicans’ plan would save that group $297 million. This chart shows the total projected tax savings for various income levels under the two plans: (To add a quick asterisk to this asterisk, Fiscal Analyst Rick Olin from the state fiscal bureau noted the Democrats’ tax plan includes limits on manufacturing and agricultural tax credits that the Republicans plan does not. The bureau analysis accounts for those credits that would be claimed by individual income filers, but not those who would get the credits through corporate tax returns. So the Democratic plan would increase the tax burden for those filers, but it’s not connected to the individual income tax process.) Nygren says the Republican tax cut plan is ""better for working, middle-class families,"" citing as support the percentage of tax cuts going to Wisconsin residents with incomes under $100,000. The numbers are accurate, so far as they go. The problem is they show only part of the picture. The Democrats are proposing a larger overall tax cut that would result in more tax savings for those under $100,000 in earnings — even if that accounts for a lower percentage of the overall tax cut package. So the statement is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True.

Did opioid overdose deaths in West Virginia fall by 8.5%?
","Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., offered a note of optimism about her state’s struggle with opioid addiction in a Jan. 22 tweet. Capito tweeted, ""Thanks to successful federal, state, and local efforts, preliminary statistics show opioid overdose deaths are down 8.5% in West Virginia. Awesome news!"" Thanks to successful federal, state, and local efforts, preliminary statistics show opioid overdose deaths are down 8.5% in West Virginia. Awesome news! https://t.co/uICcVlU7vZ Is this statistic correct? Capito’s office did not respond to several inquiries, but we were able to find data that addresses the question. Her tweet links to a USA Today article about newly released data on opioids published the same day as the tweet. Accompanying that article is a link to a related article that summarizes the state-by-state data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the breakdown, West Virginia’s predicted 12-month number for overdose deaths from all drugs fell from 1,047 in 2017 to 958 in 2018. That’s a decrease of 8.5 percent, as Capito said. However, we should note a couple caveats. First, a different cut of the CDC data actually shows even stronger declines in West Virginia. Preliminary, 12-month statewide data for overdose deaths shows an 18.7 percent decline for reported deaths between July 2017 and July 2018, and a 32 percent decline for predicted deaths over the same period. Second, the 8.5 percent decline refers to overdose deaths from all drugs, not ""opioid overdose deaths,"" as Capito said. The report doesn’t break down the data for opioid deaths by state. However, other data shows patterns for different drugs, and those serve to complicate Capito’s optimism. A CDC report detailing annual figures for 2016 and 2017 found that in West Virginia, there was a decrease in prescription opioid overdose deaths by almost 13 percent between those two years. However, during the same time period, the deaths from all opioids, including heroin and methadone, rose more than 14 percent, and the death rates from synthetic opioids other than methadone increased by more than 42 percent. In other words, a reduction in the deaths from prescription opioids masked how fast deaths from all opioids and synthetic opioids rose over that period. ""The opioid overdose epidemic continues to worsen and evolve because of the continuing increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids,"" the CDC reported, according to a Dec. 28, 2018 article in the Register Herald of Beckley, W.Va. Capito tweeted, ""Thanks to successful federal, state, and local efforts, preliminary statistics show opioid overdose deaths are down 8.5% in West Virginia."" This number appears in a USA Today article that summarized CDC data, and other CDC data shows even sharper declines. That’s the good news. However, Capito misidentified the figure as opioid overdose deaths specifically, rather than overdose deaths from all drugs. In addition, a more detailed analysis shows that while prescription opioid overdose deaths are down, overdose deaths from synthetic opioids are up. This suggests a more complicated outlook for the state’s overall overdose problem.

Fact-checking the myth that the word picnic is racist
","A south Florida politician said that the word picnic shouldn’t be used to describe an annual gathering of city employees. Fort Lauderdale City Commissioner Robert McKinzie said the word has racist origins, referring to hangings of African Americans. ""It is a very racially insensitive word if you look at it,"" he said during a Feb. 19 commission meeting. McKinzie elaborated: ""You can Google it. I don’t want it to be printed in the paper, but it’s racially insensitive. It is a tradition that was used to celebrate the hanging of black folks back in the days, so just, we need to change it to ‘family outing, cookout, barbecue,’ but I would never use that word."" (Hat-tip to South Florida Sun Sentinel reporter Brittany Wallman who tweeted McKinzie’s statement.) We wanted to know if McKinzie’s point was accurate, so we interviewed professors of language and African-American history. They said it does not refer to lynchings. Instead, picnic has French roots and refers to a social gathering where people eat. (Snopes long ago debunked a similar claim.) McKinzie, a Democrat and owner of a general contracting firm, was appointed by the commission to fill a vacancy in 2014 and has since won election twice. He represents a district that includes most of the city’s historically black neighborhoods. We asked McKinzie and his assistant to provide evidence to support his claim and did not get a response by our deadline. Claims have circulated for at least two decades that the word ""picnic"" has racist connotations. In 2002, Yohuru R. Williams, then an associate professor of history at Delaware State University, wrote an article for the Black History Bulletin, ""Anatomy of an untruth: the controversy over 'picnic’ and the true cause of lynching."" Williams wrote the article a couple years after he heard a presentation by Ron Wallace, president of Dularon Entertainment. Wallace said the word picnic was short for ""pick a n-----' to lynch."" We found the same statement by Wallace in the Oakland Post in 1997. But Williams, who is now a dean at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul told us that ""picnic"" is not a racially insensitive term. However, McKinzie would have been on more solid ground if he had said that many lynchings had a picnic-like atmosphere. The term historians use is ""spectacle lynchings,"" Williams said. These were large public gatherings where people took photographs and looked for souvenirs, he said. Other writers and experts have also debunked the idea that the word picnic has racist origins, including David Pilgrim, founder and curator of the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University in Michigan. Pilgrim told us in an interview that it’s possible someone used the word picnic to refer to lynchings, but ""what we know for a fact is that’s not where the word picnic came from."" Other historians have also documented the picnic-like atmosphere of lynchings. Philip Dray, who wrote a book, At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America, wrote that crowds consumed food or drink. ""Lynching was an undeniable part of daily life, as distinctly American as baseball games and church suppers,"" he wrote. ""Men brought their wives and children to the events, posed for commemorative photographs, and purchased souvenirs of the occasion as if they had been at a company picnic."" University of North Carolina history professor W. Fitzhugh Brundage told us that the term ""negro barbecue"" was used to describe instances in which whites burned their victims. ""Such extreme mutilation happened in fewer than a quarter of the lynchings, but of course the horror of the events and the publicity surrounding them meant that they left a lasting impression,"" Brundage said. ""So if someone has a problem with words associated with lynching, it should arguably be barbecue and not picnic."" Joseph T. Acquisto, professor of French who chairs the department of romance languages and linguistics at the University of Vermont, said the word picnic has French origins. It is a composite of two French words: the verb piquer and the noun nique (pronounced: pea-kay and neek). Acquisto said the term dates back to 1694, according to the Trésor de la langue française, an extensive dictionary of 19th and 20th century French. ""It notes that the original meaning was a meal where everyone paid their share or brought their own food, and then later became an outdoor meal,"" he said. Kevin Rottet, an associate professor of French linguistics at Indiana University, told us that the first appearance of the word picnic in English was in 1748. ""From a linguistic point of view, the accusation of racial insensitivity does not at all accord with the facts in the history of this word,"" Rottet said. ""I would categorically reject the claim of racist connotations here."" McKinzie said that the word picnic is a ""racially insensitive word."" There is no evidence that the origin of the word traces back to lynchings of African-Americans. The word has French origins and refers to a gathering with food. During lynchings, the settings were sometimes social occasions where white people ate food. While that was a picnic-like atmosphere, it doesn’t mean that the word ""picnic"" is a racist word.
