No, the new coronavirus vaccines are not more dangerous than COVID-19
","A lengthy and popular Facebook post attributed to an alternative medical doctor makes several misleading claims about the new coronavirus vaccines.  Among them: that the new mRNA vaccines can alter human DNA (that’s Pants on Fire); that we don’t need a vaccine because we’ve reached significant herd immunity (we haven’t); and that anyone who has had COVID-19 would not benefit from the vaccine (not true).  The post also erroneously claims that the vaccine contains toxic ingredients like aluminum, mercury ""and possibly formaldehyde,"" and then concludes that, ultimately, receiving the shot is more harmful than contracting the disease itself. ""Here’s my bottom line: I would much rather get a COVID infection than get a COVID vaccine,"" reads the post, which accompanies an image of a man wearing a white physician’s coat. ""That would be safer and more effective."" Two problems: The list of ingredients cited in the post appears to be pulled from thin air. And a mountain of evidence shows that getting infected with the virus is far more dangerous than the vaccines. The vaccines have been studied for months and have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people. COVID-19, by contrast, has killed over 1.6 million people around the world. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  When the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 11, its ingredient list was published online in a fact sheet for recipients and caregivers. The list includes mRNA, lipids, salts, sugar and saline solution.  None of the supposedly toxic ingredients listed in the Facebook post appears in the list.  The mRNA used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines represent a new vaccine technology, but the research behind it has been underway for some time.   ""It's not a novel strategy,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. ""This particular notion of using messenger RNA in a vaccine has been around for 20 years. This is just the first product to get above the water to become a commercial project."" Traditional vaccines introduce an inactivated or weakened version of a virus for the body to fight against. By contrast, Pfizer and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines use messenger RNA, which is a fragment of the virus’ genetic material.  It works by giving the body instructions to produce copies of the protein present on the surface of the coronavirus, without causing sickness from the disease. The immune system then learns to recognize the protein and produce antibodies against it. As for the rest of the ingredients, the lipids are nanoparticles used to encase the RNA, the salts help keep the pH, or acidity, of the vaccine close to that of a person’s body; and the sugar safeguards the nanoparticles when they’re frozen and stops them from sticking together, according to MIT’s Technology Review, which spoke with experts to help decode the contents.  Before injection, the vaccine is mixed with the saline solution, just as many intravenously delivered medicines are, the report said. Moderna also released a similar list of ingredients through the FDA, with a slight difference that may explain the different storage needs for each. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius, while the Moderna vaccine can be shipped at minus 20 degrees Celsius and can be stored in a refrigerator for up to 30 days after that. K. ""Vish"" Viswanath, a professor of health communication at Harvard’s School of Public Health, told PolitiFact that the post uses common anti-vaccine tactics, such as using what he calls ""scientistic"" language, as he calls it, and claiming it comes from someone credible.  ""This kind of tactic to list ingredients that may or may not be there is not new. Anti-vaccine groups have always used a list of ingredients even after ingredients have been eliminated from vaccines,"" Viswanath said. ""They misinterpret and distort scientific data to advance their agenda."" Some people who get vaccinated may develop mild or moderate symptoms as their immune system responds, including headache, soreness or fever, but these side effects are short-lived and not considered serious or life-threatening.  Some skeptics of the vaccine have pointed to the high survival rates for some groups of people who contract COVID-19. But the vaccine isn’t intended just to prevent deaths, health experts note. It’s also about preventing the spread of the virus and infections that could lead to significant long-term health issues.  While the vaccines were developed in record time, they went through rigorous review processes before they were deemed suitable for public use.  For example, the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech has been studied in clinical trials involving about 44,000 people, with half receiving the vaccine, and the other half receiving a placebo. To receive emergency use authorization from the FDA, the manufacturers had to follow at least half of the participants for at least two months after their vaccinations, and the vaccine had to be proven safe and effective in that population. An FDA analysis of that vaccine’s data found ""no specific safety concerns"" that would rule out using it for people aged 16 and older.  For Moderna, 30,000 participants have been studied in its trial, with half receiving the vaccine and half receiving a placebo. An interim review of the data found that the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated, with an efficacy rate of 94.5%. Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, called the post irresponsible. ""Where is the data? How can they claim that the vaccines are contaminated with these agents?"" Iwasaki wrote in an email. ""Getting the vaccine is absolutely not more dangerous than contracting the disease. ""The safety of both Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines have been rigorously tested with no serious concerns. COVID-19 has (a) case fatality rate of 2.3%. Vaccine, zero."" The U.S. has not reached herd immunity that would significantly hinder the spread of the disease, as the post suggests. In a recent interview with NPR, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, predicted the country could begin to achieve early stages of herd immunity by late spring or summer if people get vaccinated. ""I would say 50% would have to get vaccinated before you start to see an impact,"" Fauci told the outlet. ""But I would say 75% to 85% would have to get vaccinated if you want to have that blanket of herd immunity."" People not needing to get vaccinated because they already had COVID-19, also doesn’t wash. There isn’t enough information yet to say if or for how long someone is protected after they recover from the disease. Some early evidence suggests that natural immunity may not last very long, but more studies are still needed. The vaccine is expected to provide stronger and likely longer-lasting immunity. In its recently released vaccine recommendations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that vaccination should be offered regardless of whether a person has had a prior infection.   A Facebook post that makes several unsubstantiated claims about the new coronavirus vaccines says the shots contain toxic ingredients and are more dangerous than getting COVID-19. This is bogus. The ingredient lists for the vaccines do not include any of the ""toxic"" contents listed in the post, and the leading vaccines — which have been tested for several months in thousands of people — are not more dangerous than the virus, which has killed over 300,000 Americans and more than 1.6 million people worldwide.

Video shared on Facebook inflates risk of Moderna vaccine 40-fold
","Social media posts are spreading an inaccurate claim about the safety of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine. With the headline, ""Do not take the vaccine,"" a video post published Dec. 6 features James Lyons-Weiler giving this dire assessment of the Moderna vaccine trial data. ""21% of people are having serious adverse events from this vaccine,"" Lyons-Weiler says in the video. The clip is originally from Oct. 20, when Lyons-Weiler,  head of the private group Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, spoke at a PA Medical Freedom press conference. Lyons-Weiler’s number is more than 40 times too high. The video has been shared widely on Facebook in the last two weeks and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The data Moderna submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports that out of 15,184 who received the vaccine, 82 had a serious adverse event (see page 32). That is a tiny percentage. ""Serious adverse effects possibly related to the vaccine were equally rare in both groups — vaccine and placebo — at about 0.5%,"" said Shiv Pillai, Harvard University’s Immunology Program director. ""There was no difference between the vaccine and placebo groups."" The FDA briefing paper on the vaccine said it found no patterns to indicate that the vaccine caused these adverse outcomes. We reached out to Lyons-Weiler and had not heard back by the time we published. We did find reference to 21% in a preliminary safety assessment of the Moderna vaccine in November that included a higher dose (250 micrograms) than is used today (100 micrograms). Only 14 people received two doses at the higher level, and three of them — 21% — had a systemic reaction that was judged to be serious. Systemic reactions include fever, headaches and muscle pains. In this study, they were not life-threatening. No one who got the 100 microgram dose had a serious reaction. That preliminary study said that ""no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified."" An FDA panel recommended the vaccine for emergency use authorization. A video shared on social media says that 21% of people getting the Moderna vaccine had a serious adverse reaction. The actual number is .5%. That was the same level for the placebo group. There is no indication the vaccine caused any of these serious events.

"['Science', 'Texas', 'Coronavirus', 'Ted Cruz']","
Mask guidance for vaccinated people is based in science
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Twitter Tuesday to challenge the latest coronavirus guidance as vaccines were being distributed around the country. Cruz responded specifically to Dr. Vin Gupta, a lung and intensive care unit doctor who appeared on MSNBC to caution vaccine recipients against abandoning the kinds of preventative measures public health experts have been emphasizing all year.   ""This is one of the misperceptions here: just because you get vaccinated with a second dose, it does not mean you should be participating in things like traveling in the middle of an out-of-control pandemic or that you’re liberated from masks,"" Gupta told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd. ""Everything still applies until all of us get the two-dose regimen, and we don’t think that’s going to happen until June or July.""  Many unknowns surround the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. For instance, it’s unclear if vaccinations strictly protect infected people from serious illness, or if they also prevent people from getting infected, Gupta said. ""Don’t let your guard down just because you got vaccinated,"" he said. ""You might be able to get infected by the virus and pass it on to others."" The comment was enough to peeve Cruz, who has previously criticized guidance to wear masks and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. ""This is a bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult,"" Cruz said in a tweet responsive to Gupta’s mask-wearing advice. ""It’s not about vaccines or protecting people’s lives — it is instead profoundly anti-science, and is only focused on absolute govt control of every aspect of our lives."" In July, Cruz faced criticism after he was photographed maskless on an American Airlines flight one month after the airline required passengers to wear face masks while onboard planes. Cruz stirred controversy again when he called Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, ""a complete ass"" for asking a fellow senator to wear a mask while speaking. And in November, as Texas public health officials urged people to avoid large holiday gatherings as daily case numbers reached record highs, Cruz tweeted a graphic with the words ""Come and take it"" beneath a Thanksgiving turkey. So is the latest round of COVID-19 guidance — urging continued mask-wearing and discouraging travel — ""profoundly anti-science"" as Cruz claims? ""I think [Cruz] is talking beyond his knowledge,"" said Dr. Jaquelin Dudley, professor of molecular biosciences and associate director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas. ""This whole thing about mask-wearing, taking a vaccine and social distancing has somehow become a political football instead of, let's just talk about what we know and what we don't know,"" she said. Cruz’s office did not respond to a request for clarification on precisely what the senator meant by ""anti-science."" And a spokesperson for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the organization for which Gupta works, declined to address Cruz’s comments in an effort to remain apolitical. (""With the issue at hand — responding to comments by a U.S. senator stating that protective measures against COVID-19 constitute ""bizarre, lunatic, totalitarian cult"" — it would be impossible to make this apolitical,"" a spokesperson said.) But the guidance highlighted by Gupta is the same messaging that has come from the very top level of the U.S. coronavirus response apparatus. On Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Donald Trump’s top adviser on the coronavirus crisis, spoke before an online audience and gave the same cautionary advice. ""It’s not going to be like turning a light switch on and off. It’s not going to be overnight. It’s going to be gradual. ... I don’t believe we’re going to be able to throw the masks away and forget about physical separation and congregant settings for a while, probably likely until we get into the late fall and early next winter, but I think we can do it,"" he said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advises that there is not enough information ""to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others,"" suggesting that more time is needed for experts to understand how the virus will respond to vaccinated persons. According to Dr. Jonathan Temte of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, the clinical trials of the vaccine have only looked at how the vaccine prevents illness. Those trials didn’t provide any information on transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could still carry and spread the virus. It takes repeat exposures for the immune system to learn how to best fight off a virus, which is why COVID-19 vaccinations require two doses about three weeks apart, according to the CDC. Clinical trials through the National Institutes of Health tell us that the immune system begins to create a beta version of antibodies after a person receives the first dose of the vaccine. These are the body’s least optimal version of these antibodies. Phase III trials — which test for vaccine efficacy — indicate these initial antibodies are capable of fighting off severe illness caused by the virus, but may be less capable of preventing the virus’ spread.  A second dose of the vaccine helps the body create a new version of antibodies more honed in on fighting COVID-19. A person’s immune system is most capable of fighting off COVID-19 about one month after the initial dose of vaccine.  ""Your body learns. You can’t assume that on day one after the vaccine you’re going to be protected and you’re not going to be able to spread the infection,"" Dudley said. ""We don’t have that data yet. There’s been so many things to learn,"" she said. This is one of the primary sources of uncertainty surrounding the vaccine: whether vaccinated people can be contagious. If vaccinations protect only against illness and not transmissions, achieving herd immunity through vaccination becomes more difficult, according to the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet. ""Pfizer and Moderna together project that there will be enough vaccines for 35 million individuals in 2020, and perhaps up to 1 billion in 2021,"" The Lancet wrote. ""As a result, many millions of people at high risk of disease will not be immunized any time soon, necessitating the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions."" Furthermore, it’s also unknown how long immunity will last in a vaccinated person, or how effective vaccination will be in older people or those with underlying comorbidities. The guidance issued by the CDC that urges vaccinated people to continue wearing masks and avoid travel was described by Cruz as ""profoundly anti-science."" The emerging vaccines each were placed through months of clinical trials that tested for their efficacy in preventing illness. Their efficacy in preventing transmission was not part of the trials and is not yet known. The guidance issued by the public health community is borne out of science’s blind spots in regard to transmission and the gradual pace of vaccine distribution. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972B4D00>],/factchecks/2020/dec/18/ted-cruz/mask-guidance-vaccinated-people-based-science/

No, a 2018 executive order doesn't allow Trump to unilaterally impose martial law
","Social media users are voicing a theory that President Donald Trump planned to invoke a 2018 executive order to impose martial law by Friday, Dec. 18.  ""Martial law or something very similar is going to happen, likely before this Friday, that’s what the experts are saying,"" says conservative television host Zach Drew in a Facebook video. ""I’m talking about John Ratcliffe, the Director of National Intelligence, invoking a 2018 Executive Order."" As he speaks, text from the ""Executive Order on Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a U.S. Election"" flashes on screen. These claims echo extreme calls by Trump supporters for the president to impose martial law in light of unproven allegations that voter fraud swung the election to Joe Biden.  There are varying definitions of martial law, and many of the purveyors of this particular theory don’t specify what form they expect it to take. However, their descriptions seem to reflect martial law at its most extreme: the suspension of civil authority and military control of civilian functions such as the courts.  PolitiFact spoke to six scholars of constitutional law and presidential power and asked them whether the executive order allows Trump to declare martial law.  They were unanimous: It doesn’t. ""There is literally nothing in the executive order that allows for any kind of use of military force where it isn’t already authorized by statute,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law and a leading expert in martial law.  ""The statutory authorities that the executive order invokes would not extend to declaring martial law,"" said Bernadette Meyler, a Stanford Law School professor.  ""It’s painful to hear about this theory, both because it’s not based in fact and because it’s dangerous to be thinking this way,"" said Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University. The 2018 executive order at the center of the claim allows the president to impose sanctions on foreign entities or individuals who have interfered in a U.S. election. It was signed amid reports that the Russian government had attempted to disrupt the 2016 U.S. election and help Trump’s electoral efforts.  ""Basically, what (the executive order) does is allow people in the executive branch to impose economic sanctions on foreign actors interfering in the election,"" said Edelson. ""How you get from there to imposing martial law, I don’t know. It doesn’t make any sense."" Any executive order that gave the president the authority to unilaterally invoke martial law would be unconstitutional, the scholars we spoke with said.  ""The president has no ability to unilaterally authorize himself to impose martial law, just as he could not issue an executive order allowing himself to decide judicial cases or controversies,"" said Daniel Kobil, a law professor at Capital University Law School.  Under Article II of the Constitution, the president has no inherent authority to declare martial law except under the extreme circumstances of a rebellion or foreign invasion, said Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School.  ""Losing an election doesn’t count as a basis for invoking this power,"" Feldman added.  In 1866, the Supreme Court ruled in the case Ex parte Milligan that martial law cannot be imposed where civil courts are open and functioning. As a result, one should think of martial law as a state of affairs arising from a total breakdown of civil order, Vladeck said.  ""The president has a handful of statutory authorities to use the military for domestic law enforcement, but none of those authorities allow for the ‘imposition’ of martial law, versus using the military to restore order in situations in which civilian authorities are unable or unwilling to do so."" The last time the federal government imposed martial law was in Hawaii in 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Even if such conditions existed in a part of the U.S., the president would have to get congressional approval to use the military, said Joseph Nunn, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and author of an exhaustive study on martial law in America.  ""If the president and Congress disagree, Congress wins, unless the Constitution gives the president ‘conclusive and preclusive’ authority over the issue. And in the case of martial law, it’s the opposite of conclusive and preclusive,"" Nunn said. And if a president attempted to unilaterally impose martial law to secure a second term for himself in the absence of an invasion or rebellion? ""We have a technical term for that,"" said Feldman. ""It’s called a coup d’etat. It would be criminal."" Social media posts say that a 2018 executive order gives Trump the power to impose martial law.  Six scholars of constitutional law and presidential power told us that the executive order doesn’t give the president the power to impose martial law.  Under the Constitution, the president does not have the power to unilaterally impose martial law.  We rate this Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D92D40>],/factchecks/2020/dec/18/facebook-posts/president-united-states-cant-unilaterally-impose-m/

","President Donald Trump hasn’t made a concession speech or explained what he will do during Joe Biden’s inauguration, but a Facebook post announcing that Trump will hold his own inauguration at his private club Mar-a-Lago is a fake. The Facebook post, which contains a Trump-Pence campaign logo, shows an announcement purportedly signed by Bill Stepien, Trump’s campaign manager. The Dec. 16 post says that Trump is the winner of the 2020 election and that he and his administration ""look forward to the January 20th Inauguration of their continuation of power and Second Term! This celebration of our president will take place at the President’s residence at Mar-A-Lago, or the winter White House."" The post also states that ""any attempt to remove the Trump administration will require force."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post is fake, a Trump campaign spokesman confirmed. We looked at the events tab on the Trump campaign website, and it makes no mention of a Jan. 20 event — the only events are appearances by Vice President Mike Pence in Georgia. Stepien’s Twitter account showed his last tweet was Nov. 5. Trump never officially conceded the election, but told reporters on Thanksgiving  that he would leave the White House if the Electoral College chose Biden, even as he pressed his baseless claims of election fraud. ""Certainly I will, and you know that,"" he said. ""But I think that there will be a lot of things happening between now and the 20th of January, a lot of things. Massive fraud has been found."" Massive fraud has not been found, according to officials in Trump’s own administration, and the Electoral College did vote for Biden. Judges nationwide have tossed out dozens of Trump lawsuits  challenging the results of the Nov. 3 election. It’s unclear whether Trump will attend Biden’s inauguration. News reports based on anonymous sources said Trump is considering holding a campaign event for himself Jan. 20.  White House spokesperson Judd Deere told PolitiFact: ""Anonymous sources who claim to know what the President is or is not considering have no idea. When President Trump has an announcement about his plans for Jan. 20, he will let you know."" President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama pose with President-elect Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, at the White House in Washington, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017.

Trump plans to move to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Fla., following his presidency, but those plans are being challenged. The Washington Post reported that a lawyer for neighbors wrote to Palm Beach officials asserting that Trump can’t live there under the terms of his 1993 agreement with the town. Mar-a-Lago club members can’t spend more than 21 days in the guest suites or more than seven consecutive days in a year. The Post said Trump spent at least 130 days at Mar-a-Lago during his presidency. It’s unclear if town officials will take any action. A Facebook post purporting to be from the Trump campaign said Trump will hold his inauguration for a second term at Mar-a-Lago. The Trump campaign confirmed the post is a fake.

No, Roy Cooper did not get a DUI in Stanly County
","A social media rumor claims North Carolina’s governor has gotten himself into legal trouble while driving. Multiple Facebook users have claimed that Gov.

Cooper’s arrest, incarceration, and charges of aggravated DUI on Friday night in Stanly County, NC?"" When another Facebook user said he hadn’t seen any news about the alleged arrest, the woman posted a video of herself talking to her Amazon Echo Dot. An Echo Dot is a voice-controlled speaker that can play music, control smart home devices, make calls and even search the internet for answers to questions.

The director told me that there isn't any radio traffic with any of our agencies in Stanly County stopping Governor Cooper. We have also contacted the Line Sergeant, with the Highway Patrol and he stated that none of his Troopers stopped the Governor. Mr. Specht, I feel that we have exhausted all means trying to locate any truth to the rumor. At this point it is in fact just a rumor unless someone can come forward and provide some real evidence.

In GA race, Kelly Loeffler distorts Raphael Warnock’s stances on prisons, bail
","As part of painting the Rev. Raphael Warnock as a radical Democrat, GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler claimed in a Dec. 9 Fox News interview that Warnock ""said we need to open up the prisons, he said we need to eliminate cash bail.""  It’s an attack she has made repeatedly.  Warnock for years has advocated for ending mass incarceration. But rather than simply freeing inmates from prison, he has called for reducing prison populations through measures such as decriminalizing marijuanaa. On cash bail, Warnock would keep the requirement that people charged with serious crimes be required to post cash bail in order to be released from jail while their cases are pending in court. But he would end that requirement for people charged with nonviolent misdemeanor crimes or municipal offenses. Who wins the Warnock-Loeffler race, along with who wins another Georgia runoff on Jan. 5 between GOP Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff, will determine whether Republicans keep control of the Senate. Cash bail has been an issue in the 2020 campaign. President-elect Joe Biden proposes leading a national effort to end cash bail, saying it ""incarcerates people who are presumed innocent."" But bail is more a state and local matter than a federal one.  As for Warnock, the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Fox News on Nov. 24 reported on comments he made in 2018 in support of an Atlanta ordinance. Loeffler’s campaign did not respond to our request for information for this fact-check, but did issue a news release about the Fox News article. The Atlanta ordinance did not entirely end cash bail; it eliminated the bail requirement for people accused of nonviolent misdemeanor charges, or city ordinance violations, to post cash bail in order to be released from jail while their cases are pending. Before the ordinance was passed, according to the article, Warnock said: ""In the United States of America, at least on paper, you are innocent until proven guilty... . The ability to pay your bond may only mean that you have a thriving drug business ... . We ought to stop separating people from their families just because they're poor."" Some seven months after the ordinance took effect, when there was a marked increase in accused offenders not showing up for court, Warnock said: ""We've made poverty a crime. We ought to call cash bail what (it) is: Wealth-based detention. Atlanta ought to be leading the way. Leave the ordinance in place."" During the Senate campaign, Warnock has stated support for eliminating cash bail requirements for nonviolent offenses, saying: ""People facing nonviolent misdemeanor charges who have not been convicted of a crime should not remain in jail simply because they can’t afford bail.""  On at least one occasion, in a tweet, Warnock didn’t qualify his position, stating: ""No one should be stuck in jail just because they can’t afford cash bail. Poverty is not a crime, we must end cash bail."" His campaign reiterated to us that Warnock backs ending cash bail only for nonviolent offenses. The second part of Loeffler’s claim uses a Warnock remark without context. He commented about opening jail doors (not prison doors) not generally, but in commenting about legalizing marijuana. On Nov. 17, the conservative news website Breitbart posted an article with the headline: ""Raphael Warnock: ‘Open Up the Jail Cells’; Called for Creation of ‘Militant Church.’"" The article reported on comments Warnock made at a June 2019 conference at his church on ending mass incarceration. The article includes a video clip that was posted on YouTube by Loeffler’s campaign.  In the clip, Warnock says: ""Marijuana is seen as an illegal substance. It’s a terrible irony, and we feel it, that right now in America, there are some folk who are becoming billionaires for selling the same stuff that’s got our children locked up all across America. Where is the justice? It’s not enough to decriminalize marijuana. Somebody’s got to open up the jails and let our children go."" It’s the same clip that Loeffler’s campaign uses on the ""Emptying the Prisons"" section of its RadicalRaphael.com website. Loeffler has also used the Warnock remark, without context in  shorter clips, in an ad. The ad opens with Warnock saying, ""Somebody’s got to open up the jails and let our children go""; and closes with him saying, ""Open up the jails and let our children go.""  Warnock has campaigned for ending mass incarceration, saying the rate of incarceration in the United States is a ""scandal.""

How safe are schools with COVID-19 mitigation strategies?
","On Nov. 12, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson issued modified guidelines that redefined the need for student quarantines: A student doesn’t have to quarantine if the student comes into contact with someone who has COVID-19 but is wearing a mask. It’s part of Parson’s continuing push to keep children in schools rather than doing learning remotely. This guidance contradicted CDC guidelines, which recommend quarantine for anyone who has spent at least 15 minutes within 6 feet of an infected person.  In unveiling the guidelines, Parson said: ""Schools that are consistently implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies remain among the safest places for our students.""  Which made us wonder: What are these strategies, and do they do enough to assume that those schools are safe? The CDC says schools may consider implementing several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19. CDC suggests that all school reopening plans address adherence to behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19. When used consistently and correctly, along with important mitigation strategies, masks are important to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Other important guidelines noted by the CDC are social distancing, washing hands, and regular cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in schools and buses. Dr. Rachel Orscheln, associate professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Washington University and St. Louis Children’s Hospital, joined Parson in announcing the policy. ""We also know that some of these children will likely, at some point in their illness, be at school,"" she said. ""However, we have learned that in schools where students and staff are always wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, this virus does not spread as easily as it does in other places where these strategies are not always used."" Parson’s team also directed us to CDC Director Robert Redfield. At a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Nov. 20, he said:  ""The truth is, for kids K-12, one of the safest places they can be, from our perspective, is to remain in school.""  Data from the CDC determined children under the age of 18 make up only 10% of cases in the U.S., even though they represent 22% of the total population. Also, an international research study out of Spain has found that school reopenings are not the cause of community coronavirus surges.  According to the Missouri Department of Senior Health Services and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the minimum protocols schools should follow involve screening, physical distancing, and mask wearing. These techniques are proven to reduce the spread of the virus if implemented. A Syracuse University study found that careful use of surgical masks along with good ventilation reduced the estimated infection rate to 2%. Missouri’s protocols are in close alignment with the CDC’s recommendations on how to safely operate schools during COVID-19. Missouri has no mandate to ensure that these recommendations are followed; there is no statewide mask mandate in schools.  Additional data has found that children are less likely to contract and spread COVID-19 at school. Brown University economist Emily Oster studied in-school infection data from 47 states during the end of the September. Among more than 200,000 students and 63,000 staff who had returned to school, Oster determined an infection rate of 0.13% among students and 0.24% among staff compared to a national average of 4.8%.  But, in a research study from the American Association for Medical College (AAMC), associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University School of Medicine Benjamin Linas said, ""You can only open your school safely if you have COVID under control in your community."" For example, the Missouri communities with the two highest COVID-19 rates are St. Louis County and St. Charles County. Their schools have mitigation strategies in place but there is still evidence students contract COVID-19 in their communities and bring it to the classroom. About 3,066 of the coronavirus cases in St. Charles County were linked to exposures in schools. The St. Louis Department of Health noted that ""schools in St. Louis County have seen significant transmissions of COVID-19 among teachers and students."" There is a clear correlation between the safety of a community’s school and the number of cases in that community. ""You can have the best laid plans in classrooms, but if kids are not following social distancing and mask usage outside of school, they’re going to bring COVID into the school with them,"" the AAMC study says.  Parson said, ""Schools that are consistently implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies remain among the safest places for our students.""  Parson is correct to affirm the data and statement from the CDC Director Robert Redfield regarding COVID-19 and children in schools, but Parson’s statement does not reflect the risk of opening a school with mitigation strategies in areas where there are high COVID-19 rates in the community. We rate this claim Mostly True. CORRECTION, Dec. 18: This story has been updated to include more recent data from the CDC for the percentage of children with COVID-19 and the correct link to an international research study from Spain.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B05180>],/factchecks/2020/dec/17/mike-parson/how-safe-are-schools-covid-19-mitigation-strategie/

Fred Hubbell donated big to Iowa Dems, but Mike Bloomberg didn’t
","Post-election hand-wringing is well underway among Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats asking themselves why their performance in this year’s general election in Iowa was so disappointing when they commanded a significant fundraising advantage over Republicans. Iowa’s Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate Theresa Greenfield, for example, raised more than twice the amount of her opponent, Republican incumbent Joni Ernst. Yet Greenfield lost by almost 7 percentage points. That trend proved true in Iowa’s state and local races as well. Iowa Republicans flipped seven Iowa House seats and maintained control of all their Senate seats, even though the Iowa Democratic Party outraised the Republican Party of Iowa by almost $3 million. Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann made note of that when he tweeted on Nov. 27 that ""Sir Frederick Hubbell literally blew 100s of thousands of dollars on #ialegis races where there were plenty of reasons to believe the GOP would win, but he had an ax to grind with the family or candidate."" Sir Frederick Hubbell literally blew 100s of thousands of dollars on #ialegis races where there were plenty of reasons to believe the GOP would win, but he had an ax to grind with the family or candidate. Hubbell's rather infantile anger certainly got in the way of common sense. It was a reference to Fred Hubbell, a wealthy Des Moines businessman who is a significant Democratic Party donor and the party’s 2018 candidate for Iowa governor. In a subsequent tweet on Nov. 28, Kaufmann wrote: ""Millions of Hubbell and Bloomberg dollars wasn’t enough to overcome the Iowa House Republican avalanche of success. Sir Frederick and Little Mike have the political skills of President Millard Fillmore."" Millions of Hubbell and Bloomberg dollars wasn't enough to overcome the Iowa House Republican avalanche of success. Sir Frederick and Little Mike have the political skills of President Millard Fillmore. #ialegis #iapolitics The White House biography of Millard Fillmore describes the nation’s 13th president as an ""uninspiring man."" We looked at whether Hubbell and Bloomberg really spent millions so ineffectually during the general election. Bloomberg, the billionaire former Mayor of New York who ran for president unsuccessfully this year, is known as a Democratic fundraising giant and has donated to Iowa campaigns in the past. He donated $250,000 to Hubbell’s 2018 gubernatorial campaign and another $250,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party that same year, campaign reports show. This year, however, Bloomberg did not donate money to Iowa’s state legislative candidates or the party, according to data from the Iowa Elections and Campaign Disclosure Board, so spending by him could not have been thwarted by Republican House success in the election.  Hubbell is a different story. The former gubernatorial candidate who lost to Republican Kim Reynolds in 2018, Hubbell continued to be a regular Democratic Party donor in 2020. Hubbell has donated $156,450 to Iowa Democratic candidates for the Legislature and Democratic organizations since Jan. 1, financial disclosure reports examined at the beginning of December showed. Hubbell’s wife, Charlotte Hubbell, donated $5,350, and combined, the two have donated $164,300. While individual contributions to campaigns are important, political action committees (PACs) are another aspect of campaign finance. Because PACs are not as tightly regulated as campaign committees, it’s difficult sometimes to know where that money comes from or what is done with it. But, we know that the Better Democracy PAC, which Fred and Charlotte Hubbell founded in 2019 with the goal of flipping the Iowa House, donated $1,150,864 to Iowa House candidates, the Democratic Party and party funds such as ActBlue and Path to Victory.  It’s fair to say that Fred Hubbell spent thousands of dollars in this election cycle. Judging whether or not that money was put to good use is a subjective call. Neither Hubbell nor the Better Democracy PAC could be reached for comment when PolitiFact tried to contact them. Of the 23 Democratic state legislative candidates whom the Hubbells and the Better Democracy PAC donated to directly, eight won and 15 lost. Of those who won, two won by more than 10 percentage points and two ran unchallenged. Of those who lost, six lost by more than 10 percentage points and two lost by almost 30 percentage points. Other races were more tightly contested, though, with some being decided by just a few hundred votes. We tried to reach Kaufmann for comment for this story several times but did not hear back from him. The claim that Michael Bloomberg spent substantially in this year’s Iowa legislative races is false. He did not donate directly to any legislative candidates in 2020. He donated to political organizations that, in turn, donated to other political organizations that sent money to Iowa candidates, but others also contributed to those organizations to support Democrats in several states. Saying Bloomberg donated to the organizations to pump thousands of his dollars to Iowa would distort how that funding is distributed. Hubbell, on the other hand, donated to Iowa legislative candidates, both personally and through the Better Democracy PAC. While the motivation behind Hubbell’s spending is unclear, it’s true that several of the candidates Hubbell supported were defeated handily by Republicans, a point Kaufmann can make in his argument about Hubbell. However, other Democratic legislative candidates Hubbell supported financially won or lost by just a few hundred votes, indicating some of those races were competitive. We’re splitting the difference here with the claims about Bloomberg’s spending false and Hubbell’s spending true, for a rating for the tweet of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4A23C0>],/factchecks/2020/dec/17/iowa-republican-party/fred-hubbell-donated-big-iowa-dems-mike-bloomberg-/

No, COVID-19 is not a simulation
","PolitiFact recently named its Lie of the Year, a dishonor that in 2020 was awarded to the downplay and denial of the coronavirus. We’ve debunked dozens and dozens of inaccurate claims about COVID-19 since the first case was reported in China in December 2019. That misinformation has included social media posts about how the coronavirus was man-made, engineered in a lab, or just a hoax.  Another allegation that is also wrong: that the pandemic is a simulation.  ""This whole COVID thing?"" one Facebook post said. ""It’s a SIMULATION. In September 2019 - the WHO put out a paper that all countries AGREED to do. That’s how they got the ENTIRE world to lock down at the SAME TIME. We’re now in the 2nd testing ‘deliberately released airborne AGENT.’ You’ll notice they didn’t say BIOLOGICAL. It’s the SECOND SIMULATION all nations agreed to in September 2019 in the WHO report.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post links to two documents: ""A World at Risk: Annual report on global preparedness for health emergencies"" by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, which is co-convened by the World Health Organization and the World Bank, and Food and Drug Administration instructions on how to use a ""real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel"" — a COVID-19 test — from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The post highlights pages from both documents. Let’s take them one by one. From the ""World at Risk"" report: ""The United Nations (including WHO) conducts at least two system-wide training and simulation exercises, including one for covering the deliberate release of a lethal respiratory pathogen.""  This is not a nefarious secret tucked away deep in a bureaucratic report.  The World Health Organization helps organize simulation exercises of public health emergencies to test how prepared communities and systems are to handle such crises.  In 2018, for example, WHO’s Global Emergency Operations Center and a global network of health emergency operation centers coordinated a simulation for a global pandemic response that involved participants from more than 40 countries. It was the first global pandemic response training exercise and the third in a series of simulations that year, according to WHO.  The scenario revolved around an influenza outbreak with the potential to turn into a pandemic in a made-up country called Mizzou off the coast of North America.  But there was no actual virus; the simulation exercise took place online and within the offices of WHO emergency operation centers. The point of the exercise was to test plans and procedures, and identify problems that could occur in an actual pandemic — like the one we’re experiencing now. WHO has also developed a simulation exercise for COVID-19 ""to support countries’ preparedness effort"" during the outbreak, according to the organization. It’s tabletop exercise that includes PowerPoint presentations and guides to help countries ""develop and update their national deployment and vaccination plan"" and ""conceptualize and manage ongoing (local) COVID-19 outbreaks in the country."" Now, let’s look at the FDA instructions on how to use a COVID-19 test. The post includes an image of a highlighted section from a highly technical portion of the FDA document and concludes that the passage proves the tests were faked. ""On Dec 1st 2020,"" the posts says, ""the CDC released a report, and part of it includes how THE VIRUS WAS NOT ISOLATED - meaning the tests were completely faked. They were all spiked with ‘positive’ virus samples to show a positive - straight from the laboratory samples, in order to produce something tangible for the simulation."" We reached out to the CDC about the claim.  Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson with the agency, told us that the FDA instructions featured in the Facebook post reflect a COVID-19 test that was developed before the CDC had a live virus. The instructions are not evidence that the pandemic is a simulation.   CDC developed the test using genomic sequencing information because it didn’t yet have a live virus or samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients, Nordlund said. By Jan. 18 it was using this test on samples from people with suspected cases of COVID-19.  A few days later, the CDC used a sample from the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States to start growing the virus. By Jan. 31, there were six confirmed cases in the United States and the CDC asked the FDA for emergency use authorization to distribute its test to other public health laboratories. The FDA granted that request on Feb. 4. For many, news that COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in the United States and elsewhere in the world came as a relief. As of Dec. 17, more than 74.5 million cases had been confirmed globally, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 1.6 million people have died.  In the United States, where some cities are seeing cases skyrocket, more than 17 million people have gotten sick from the coronavirus and more than 308,000 have died.  We rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280971A4980>],/factchecks/2020/dec/17/facebook-posts/no-covid-19-not-simulation/

US bridges need fixing, but Joe Biden overstates the immediate threat
","Democrats have argued for decades that jobs, economic growth and progress on climate change all meet at the Transportation Department. As he announced his transportation secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg, President-elect Joe Biden hit each of those points, plus the simple need for safety. ""Tens and tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair, some on the verge of collapse, presenting a clear and present danger to people’s lives,"" Biden said Dec. 16. Bipartisan efforts to deal with the nation’s aging infrastructure are a fairly regular occurrence, and for good reason. Over 40% of bridges are at least 50 years old. State and local governments repair them regularly, but Biden’s words focused on the work that remains. Based on government numbers, Biden described the challenge fairly accurately, although experts told us his words about the immediate risk are overblown. Bridges are generally closed before they reach the stage where a collapse is imminent. A construction trade group, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, reported that over 46,000 bridges meet the definition of ""structurally deficient."" In layman’s terms, that means key parts of those bridges, perhaps steel struts or concrete supports, are rusting, cracked or otherwise in poor shape. Such bridges must be inspected every year, and engineers know that they need significant work, if not total replacement. There are different ways to calculate the number of structurally deficient bridges. The Congressional Research Service said there were 56,000 in 2016, representing about 9% of the total. The transportation builders use a lower number, with data current through 2019. That group estimates about 7.5% of the nation’s total fall into the worst category. The danger of crumbling bridges is real, and it’s not limited to the most deteriorated ones. A chunk of concrete from a bridge in Michigan injured a woman in February 2020 as she drove under it. The bridge was rated as being in ""fair"" condition, a notch below ""good"", and a notch above ""poor."" A state official told the local newspaper it was ""not the worst bridge out there."" If Biden’s comment about the number of bridges in the worst shape is on the money, his warning about bridges ""on the verge of collapse"" is overly dire. ""There are no bridges in the U.S. that are open that are in danger of imminent collapse,"" said the American Society of Civil Engineers’ Maria Lehman.  The operative word is ""open."" While hidden design flaws, such as the one behind a 2007 fatal bridge collapse in Minneapolis, might be out there, inspection data does not show that motorists are driving over bridges that could crumble beneath them. Under federal guidelines, state inspectors rate bridges on a 0 to 9 scale, with zero being ""failed condition"" and 9 being ""excellent condition."" ""At a 3 (serious condition), generally bridges are closed,"" Lehman said. Chung C. Fu, director of the University of Maryland’s Bridge Engineering Software and Technology Center, amplified that point. ""If the rating drops to 2 or less, the bridge is long since closed,"" Fu said. Bridges vary greatly. The Congressional Research Service noted that about 80% of structurally deficient bridges are in rural areas. ""These bridges tend to be small and relatively lightly traveled,"" they wrote. The transportation builders group estimates it would cost $164 billion to bring every bridge up to snuff. As a fraction of each state’s inventory, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Iowa have the greatest need, with about one out of five bridges deemed structurally deficient. There is some good news. Over the years, the fraction of bridges in poor shape has gone down, from nearly 11% in 2004 to just over 7% in 2019. Federal spending to repair them was as high as $9 billion in 2009 under the Great Recession recovery package. Since then, it has hovered around $6 billion. Biden said there are ""tens and tens of thousands"" of bridges in disrepair, and some are on the verge of collapse. At least 46,000 bridges are rated to be in the worst shape. Most are in rural areas and are lightly used. Contrary to Biden’s dire description, engineering experts told us that no one is driving over bridges that could come down at any moment. Random events and human error aside, transportation officials close bridges before they reach that point. The accuracy of Biden’s words is mixed.

Clay Aiken said despite Orlando tragedy, gays in Florida can be fired for being gay
","As the motive behind the deadly June 12 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando was still being debated, singer Clay Aiken took to Twitter to characterize it as a hate crime and report that gays can be summarily fired in Florida simply because of their sexual orientation. ""A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay,"" Aiken tweeted. For this fact check, we will look at whether Florida really offers no job protection to gays and lesbians. The short answer: Aiken is mostly correct when it comes to Florida as a whole, but he's wrong to suggest that there is no protection anywhere in the state. Federal law does not protect the employment rights of the LGBT community, nor does the state of Florida. However, thanks to city and county law, members of the LGBT community do have employment protection in some areas of Florida. Currently, 10 counties and 19 cities, including Tampa, St. Petersburg, Miami, Miami Beach, St. Augustine, Sarasota and Orlando, have passed protections for gay workers, according to Frank Penela, communications director for the Florida Commission on Human Relations. Penela also reported that although state law doesn't specifically reference LGBT status in employment, ""the Commission will accept some cases under sex-based discrimination.  Allegations of gender identity/transgender discrimination, for example, can be viewed as sex discrimination."" Aiken spokesman Josh Pultz noted that bills designed to add protection for gender identity and sexual orientation died in Florida's House and Senate in 2016. ""Regardless of existing employment anti discrimination ordinances protecting LGBT in at least 31 municipalities, covering as many as 15 counties in the state, the state does not provide such protections — leaving LGBT workers in as many as 52 of the 67 counties without any protection from being terminated because of their orientation,"" Pultz said in an email. ""Clay's comment stated nothing more than that a gay man in Florida can still be fired for being gay. It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate,"" he wrote. According to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Florida one of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination. Our ruling Aiken tweeted, ""A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay."" That is generally true across the state, because gays and lesbians lack protection from employment discrimination under state law and under federal law. However, 19 Florida cities often offer protection to gay workers, including the city of Orlando. Another 10 counties also offer protections.

Barack Obama, in Austin, says U.S. only 'advanced democracy' that makes voting harder
","President Barack Obama, kicking off Austin’s 2016 South by Southwest Interactive conference, drew a laugh after saying: ""We’re the only advanced democracy in the world that makes it harder for people to vote."" ""No, I hear laughing,"" Obama said, ""but it’s sad. We take enormous pride in the fact that we are the world’s oldest continuous democracy, and yet we systematically put up barriers and make it as hard as possible for our citizens to vote."" Obama wasn’t asked to clarify. But the Democratic leader wasn’t saying his own party erects barriers. Later in his appearance, Obama called it important to study ways of redesigning ""our systems"" to step up voter turnout and then he said ""the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren’t interested in having more people participate."" He was almost certainly referring to the Texas mandate carried into law by ruling Republicans that requires voters to present one of several types of government-issued photo identification before voting at the polls. In 2014, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi held the 2011 law unconstitutional, in part citing expert testimony that 608,470 registered voters didn’t already have any of the IDs the state was newly requiring at the polls. Ramos’ ruling, appealed by the state, lately awaits review by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Under the Texas law, a voter must present one of these kinds of identification at the polls: a Texas driver’s license; a personal ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety; an election certificate, which is a form of state photo identification created by the law; a U.S. military ID card; a U.S. passport; or a Texas license to carry a handgun. Readers asked us to check Obama’s claim that the U.S.--alone among ""advanced democracies""--makes it harder for people to vote. The term ""advanced democracies"" refers to countries with institutionalized democracies and a high degree of economic development. To isolate those nations, we consulted Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist, who guided us to a World Bank list of 32 high-income countries (including the U.S.) in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ranging from Luxembourg to the United Kingdom and Canada. Separately, we verified, each country drew a high 2016 freedom rating from Freedom House, a U.S.-based group that says it champions freedom. Obama cites 2009 article Obama, though, was referring to a different breakdown. Asked the basis of Obama’s statement, White House spokesman Eric Schultz pointed out research on voter ID restrictions in ""peer"" democracies. Specifically, a July 2012 news blog post in The Washington Post drew on an article in the summer 2009 edition of the Harvard Law & Policy Review placing Indiana’s voter ID law, which came to be before the Texas law, in ""international perspective."" At the time, according to the longer article, 24 U.S. states required voters to present IDs--though only three states stipulated photo IDs--at the polls. The authors categorized U.S. ""peer democracies abroad"" as either requiring no identification to vote at the polls; requiring identification only when the identity of a voter is in doubt; allowing multiple forms of non-photo identification; or requiring a single or few types of photo ID but making it easy for voters to obtain that identification--in other words concluding that no country was as stringent as Indiana. Upshot: ""Not all democracies require voter identification, and among those countries that do, there is a great variation in approach,"" the article says  Voter Identification Laws in 15 ‘Peer Democracies’ to U.S. TYPE OF ID LAW PEER COUNTRIES No ID required Australia, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland) ID required only when identity in doubt Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden Multiple non-photo IDs accepted India, Canada Photo ID required, but easy to obtain Spain, France, Malta, Belgium, Mexico SOURCE: Article, ""Is  Everyone  Else  Doing  It? Indiana’s  Voter  Identification  Law  in International  Perspective,"" Frederic Charles Schaffer, Tova Andrea Wang, Harvard Law & Policy Review, summer 2009 Notably, the article says too, the countries requiring a photo ID at the polls make those IDs easy to get: ""Countries such as Spain, Greece, France, Malta, Belgium, and Italy provide national identity documents to their citizens to use for many purposes, including travel, banking, and healthcare access as well as voting. In Spain, Greece, Malta, Belgium, and Italy, possession of such documents is compulsory. By contrast, the United States has never required or provided a national identity document."" Mexico, Canada The article notes that the U.S.’s neighboring democracies, Mexico and Canada, each expects voters to present IDs at the polls. Then again, Mexico strives to ensure that every voter has its national photo ID and Canada offers leeway on the types of ID accepted at the polls. In 2015, we confirmed that to vote in Mexico, every eligible citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram though at the time Kenneth Greene, a University of Texas expert, told us it would be a mistake to compare Mexico’s history of fraud with the few credible incidents of U.S. voter fraud that could have been headed off with photo ID from 2000 through 2014. According to a Canadian government website, Canada offers voters an array of ways to self-identify at the polls, extending to, say, a label on a prescription container plus a library card. Author says claim ‘by-and-large correct’ Mindful of Obama’s claim, we reached out to the article’s lead author, Frederic Schaffer, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Schaffer said by email that while there hasn’t been a lot of research into voting barriers in other countries, Obama’s statement was ""by-and-large correct."" ""The only clarification I would make is to point out that voter identification laws in the United States vary state by state,"" Schaffer wrote. As of 2016, according to the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures, lawmakers in 34 states had enacted measures requiring voters to present some form of identification at the polls; the group classed Texas and Indiana among nine states with strict photo ID mandates. ""Proponents see increasing requirements for identification as a way to prevent in-person voter impersonation and increase public confidence in the election process,"" NCSL said. ""Opponents say there is little fraud of this kind, and the burden on voters unduly restricts the right to vote and imposes unnecessary costs and administrative burdens on elections administrators,"" the group said. In his reply to us, Schaffer continued: ""The laws in some states are far more restrictive than in others. There has, however, been a move — largely in states in which Republicans control the state legislature and governorship — to make in-person voting more difficult. ""The Indiana law we discussed in the article you mention was indeed a bellwether in this regard,"" Schaffer wrote. ""The ostensible justification for these stricter laws is to combat vote fraud. There is scant evidence, however, that the types of vote fraud which these laws prevent are a real problem."" Other research Online scouting for other research turned up a May 2014 ""rough guide"" to global voter restrictions by the Washington, D.C.-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. ""The acceptance of multiple forms of ID to make voting more inclusive is common in Africa, where accepted identification includes affidavits by tribal elders in countries such as Liberia, Malawi and The Gambia,"" the consortium wrote, referring to several countries not classified as advanced democracies. ""Most European countries required standard government-issued IDs, which are widely necessary for accessing public services, in order to vote. In the Americas, many countries including the United States require specific types of government ID that voters must apply to obtain."" Our ruling Obama said in Austin: ""We’re the only advanced democracy in the world that makes it harder for people to vote."" This statement leaves out important details--such as that only nine U.S. states have strict photo-ID requirements at the polls and 16 states haven’t imposed any such hurdle. So, the practices Obama is singling out aren't uniform. Also, a very few advanced democracies -- Spain, France and Belgium -- require photo IDs at the polls though it's worth noting that those nations also make it easy for each citizen to have the accepted ID. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Question after Orlando: Are assault rifles banned? No, only fully automatic are basically prohibited
","The day after a man with a semiautomatic rifle killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at a gay nightclub, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton renewed her call for a federal ban on assault weapons. On the same day, June 13, 2016, Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson responded to an interviewer’s question about the Orlando incident by stating: ""Assault rifles already are banned."" So, are they prohibited in the United States, or not? It depends on what assault means. But Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is off-target in suggesting there is a blanket ban on assault rifles. Johnson’s claim Johnson was interviewed by Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, who asked: ""Should we be more concerned with the possible violation of Omar Mateen's Second Amendment rights, as opposed to the constitutional rights of the 50 people who are now dead?"" Mateen, who was shot dead in the club by police after the rampage, had been armed with a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle and a 9mm handgun. (Orlando police officials initially said Mateen used an ""AR-15-type assault rifle."" Both an AR-15 and the Sig MCX can fire the same type of ammunition at roughly the same speeds, are aesthetically similar and equally lethal, according to the Washington Post. The manufacturer describes the Sig MCX as ""the first true mission-adaptable weapon system."") Johnson answered Sykes’ question by saying: ""That's that delicate balance, Charlie. And that's what we need to have an honest and legitimate conversation about, as opposed to leaping to conclusions. ""To say things like we've got to ban assault rifles. Well, assault rifles already are banned. OK? So, we need to actually have an honest discussion about these issues and understand that this is very difficult, very complex."" One thing to understand up front is the difference between automatic and semiautomatic weapons. Automatic weapons -- banned Automatic weapons -- sometimes known as fully automatic, or machine guns -- fire continuously when the trigger is held down. Two federal laws have essentially banned them in the United States. One law in 1935 all but banned automatic weapons like the Tommy gun. And another in 1986 prohibited fully automatic weapons, except for pre-existing weapons that were grandfathered in. Semiautomatic weapons -- not banned Semiautomatic weapons, like the rifle Mateen carried, reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed. They are not banned by federal law. From 1994 to 2004, there was a federal law that banned the sale of certain types of new semiautomatic weapons, including some types of AR-15 rifles. A limit on high-capacity magazines also was set. The law, which was adopted to last for 10 years, was not renewed by Congress when it expired. The takeaway Johnson takes the position that only automatic weapons qualify as assault weapons. It’s worth noting that in at least one other interview the same day — with conservative Green Bay radio talk show host Jerry Bader — he spelled that out, saying ""an assault weapon is a fully automatic.""  His office made the same argument to us, citing technical military definitions. However, that’s not a generally accepted line of separation. The federal law that became defunct in 2004 was called the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and at the time the Department of Justice defined some semiautomatic guns as assault weapons. A number of state laws still have that wording on their books. And law enforcement agencies consider certain semiautomatic weapons, including the one used by Mateen, as assault weapons — or at minimum, assault-style weapons. Indeed, the weapons used in the mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. -- all of which were semiautomatic -- were all described by police as assault rifles. Our rating In the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, in which the killer used a semiautomatic rifle was used, Johnson stated: ""Assault rifles already are banned."" Some, including Johnson, contend that only weapons that are automatic — firing continuously when the trigger is held down are assault weapons — are assault weapons. Those are essentially prohibited by federal laws. But that definition is narrow, and Johnson’s claim gives a misleading impression of a comprehensive ban. Lawmakers, law enforcement officials and others widely refer to many semiautomatic weapons like the rifle used in Orlando and other mass shootings — which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed — as assault weapons. Those are not banned by federal law. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097123F80>],/factchecks/2016/jun/20/ron-johnson/aftermath-orlando-gop-sen-ron-johnson-says-assault/

Trump misleadingly puts black youth unemployment rate at 59 percent
","Donald Trump recently told Richmonders that he was amending his campaign theme, ""Make America Great Again,"" to strike an inclusive note. ""I’ve added a couple of things,"" he said during a June 11 rally at the Richmond Coliseum. ""I’m adding ‘Make America Great Again,’ and I’m adding ‘For Everyone,’ because it’s really going to be for everyone. It’s not going to be for a group of people; it’s going to be for everyone. ""If you look at what’s going on in this country, African-American youth is an example: 59 percent unemployment rate; 59 percent,"" Trump said. ""If you look at what’s going on with Latinos, Hispanics - tremendous unemployment rates. You look at what’s going on with so many groups. We’re going to make it great for everyone. We’re going to bring jobs back to our country."" The 59 percent unemployment rate for black youths caught our attention. We wondered if Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is right.  The latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged the unemployment rate for blacks, ages 16 to 19, at 27.1 percent in May.  So where did Trump come up with the eye-popping 59 percent? We can’t say with certainty, because Trump’s campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our question. But Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, offered a clue. Sinclair told us Trump’s percentage probably comes from a Bureau of Labor Statistics statistic called the ""employment-population ratio."" This is a figure that gauges employed people, age 16 and older, as a percentage of the entire population of adults. In May, the bureau said the employment-population ratio for blacks ages 16 to 24 was 41.5 percent. Flipped over, that would mean that the unemployment ratio - although such a statistic is not published by the bureau - would be 58.5 percent. That’s pretty close to the 59 percent figure Trump cited, Sinclair noted. But there are differences between the ratio and the widely used unemployment rate, which Trump used in citing the percentage.  The unemployment rate reflects the number of jobless people who are actively seeking work as a percentage of the available workforce - defined as those who have jobs or trying to find one.  The May unemployment rate for blacks ages 16 to 24 was 18.7 percent. The rate for whites in the same age group was 9.1 percent. The employment-population ratio is a far broader measure that counts all civilians in its equation - even those who don’t work and aren’t looking for a job. In the 16- to 24-year-old category, it includes high school and college students who are not employed or seeking jobs.   As we said, 58.5 percent of blacks in this age group weren’t working in May. That compares with 48.3 percent of whites. The percentages decrease as people get older. In other words, someone is far more likely to be working at 24 than he is at 16 or 17. A historic chart of the ratio shows that the percentage of blacks ages 16 to 24 who weren’t working from 2003 to 2007 hovered at 60 percent, roughly the same as today. In between, the percentage rose to nearly 70 percent in late 2010, during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and then slowly subsided. Roughly 40 percent of whites in the age group had jobs from 2003 to 2008. That dropped to about 50 percent in 2009 and has hovered around that point since. Our ruling Trump says the unemployment rate for black youths is 59 percent. The unemployment rate is a widely used term with a specific definition: It refers to the percentage of jobless people in the workforce who are actively seeking employment. In May, the unemployment rate for blacks ages 16 to 24 was 18.7 percent, or less than one-third of Trump’s claim. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to our question about where the candidate got his 59 percent figure. But it appears likely it comes from a computation of all 16- to 24-year-old blacks who aren’t working and may not even want a job, including high school and college students. Clearly, black youths have a harder time finding work than whites. But Trump exaggerates the issue through his misleading use of statistics. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DBFF40>],/factchecks/2016/jun/20/donald-trump/trump-misleadingly-puts-black-youth-unemployment-r/

Super PAC ad says Trump likes war, even nuclear, but that needs context
","Donald Trump would be ""too dangerous for America,"" says a new ad from Priorities USA Action, a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton. The 30-second ad, which will air in eight battleground states, features several of Trump’s own comments about foreign policy. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd played a portion of the ad on the June 19 show as an example of the kind of ads Trump can expect to face in the general election. It starts with MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski asking Trump, ""Who are you consulting with consistently so that you are ready on day one?"" ""I’m speaking with myself, number one,"" he responds. Then the ad cuts to four more of Trump’s comments: ""This is the Trump theory on war… I’m really good at war.  I love war in a certain way."" ""Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes."" ""I want to be unpredictable, I’m not going to tell you right now what I’m gonna do."" ""I know more about ISIS than the generals. Believe me."" The ""nukes"" comment in particular caught our attention. It’s clear that it’s separate from the preceding comment — ""I love war in a certain way"" — but the implication seems to be that Trump is a warmonger who isn’t afraid to use nuclear weapons. We decided to check out the context of both of those comments and see if the ad is fairly representing Trump's position. We also looked at Trump’s overall views on nuclear policy. ‘I love war in a certain way.’ This comment comes from a 90-minute speech in Iowa on Nov. 12, 2015. In the speech, Trump theorized that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein feigned having weapons of mass destruction to scare neighboring Iran, before briefly sidetracking into his feelings on war generally. ""This is the Trump theory on war,"" he said. ""But I'm good at war. I've had a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war. I love war in a certain way. But only when we win."" He then moved on to talking about veterans. Earlier in his speech, he railed against the decision to invade Iraq. ‘Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.’ Trump made his comments about ""nukes"" in an April 3 interview with Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace. Wallace was asking Trump about his suggestion that Japan might be better off with nuclear weapons. Wallace: ""You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?"" Trump: ""In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes."" Wallace: ""Understood."" Trump: ""It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.""   Wallace: ""With nukes?"" Trump: ""Maybe they would be better off — including with nukes, yes, including with nukes."" So Trump was saying Japan might do well to defend itself with its own nuclear weapons, rather than talking about what he would do as president with the United States’ own nuclear arsenal. The way the ad splices Trump's comments together, a reasonable person would think Trump ""loves war,"" including ""with nukes."" Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky told us that the fact Trump is open to more countries having nuclear weapons supports the ad’s overarching argument — that Trump would be too dangerous. Other comments Trump has offered somewhat conflicting views on using nuclear weapons throughout the campaign. He has said he ""wouldn’t rule out"" using tactical nuclear weapons against ISIS, but adding in the same interview: ""Definitely nuclear weapons are a last resort."" Nor would he rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe, if a conflict ever were to arise. ""You don’t want to, say, take everything off the table,"" he said. He also told the New York Times, ""It’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation."" Our ruling An ad by Priorities USA says Trump says he loves war, ""including with nukes."" Trump did say the phrase ""I love war in a certain way."" And Trump has said he wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons. But that doesn’t mean he is enthusiastic about them. He says they would be the weapon of last resort and that he believes nuclear proliferation to be the ""biggest problem, to me, in the world."" It's worth noting that the Trump comment used in the ad wasn’t about the United States using nuclear weapons, but about his belief that Japan might be better off if it had nuclear weapons.   Readers can decide for themselves if Trump’s positions are dangerous. But Priorities USA’s ad is missing a bit of context, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF0B80>],/factchecks/2016/jun/19/priorities-usa-action/super-pac-ad-says-trump-likes-war-even-nuclear-lac/

Donald Trump said it's illegal for delegates to change the rules on him, but it's not
","Donald Trump has made a string of comments lately that have given Republicans heartburn. His racially charged attack on a federal judge of Mexican descent, rambling speech following the Orlando shooting and conspiratorial suggestions of President Obama’s terrorist sympathies all have his fellow party members talking about organizing against him at this summer’s Republican National Convention. But given his clear win in the primary and nabbing the majority of delegates, such a move would violate party rules and election law, Trump said on NBC’s Meet the Press when asked about whether delegates at the convention could stop him. ""I don’t believe that. I think that’s the press. No. 1, they can’t do it legally. No. 2, I worked for one year, and we won all those delegates,"" Trump said. ""So I win 37 states and somebody else won none, and they’re going to be the nominee? I don’t think so."" Trump has a point that this would be against the current rules, but those rules won’t necessarily govern this year’s Republican National Convention. If the delegates decide to change the rules in July and thwart his nomination, it may seem anti-democratic. But it’s within their authority to do so. At the heart of the matter are the 112 members of the rules committee — a man and a woman from each state and the District of Columbia. They determine convention guidelines and have the power to change the rules when they convene in Cleveland. The committee has the power to make various moves, such as passing a ""conscience clause,"" imposing a supermajority rather than a majority threshold, or releasing all the delegates to support whomever they want rather than the candidate who won their state’s primary or caucus. The Trump campaign actually seemed aware of this in March 2016. ""They can throw out the chairman. You can throw out the RNC members. You can do anything,"" Barry Bennett, Trump’s convention strategist, said in March. So should the rules committee adopt the wishes of the ""Anybody but Trump"" movement, then the nomination ""is still up to the delegates,"" said Joshua Putnam, a government professor at the University of Georgia. In fact, National Review staff writer David French pointed out the only time the delegates were truly bound, according to the rules, was in the party’s only contested convention in 1976. Still, having the delegates vote how they wish from the start of the convention would be controversial. Putnam noted that Trump could certainly sue if the conscience clause is adopted. Trump did, after all, secure the majority of delegates and some state party rules and state laws do commit their delegates. But Putnam and others say it’s unlikely the courts will decide in Trump’s favor, given how they’ve ruled in the past. Here’s how Eric O’Keefe of the Wisconsin Club for Growth and David Rivkin Jr., a constitutional litigator who served in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, put it in a Wall Street Journal op-ed: ""State laws that purport to bind delegates can’t be enforced without violating the First Amendment. A political party is a private association whose members join together to further their shared beliefs through electoral politics, and they have a right to choose their representatives. The government has no business telling parties how to select their candidates or leaders: That would be a serious infringement of the rights to free association and speech."" O’Keefe and Rivkin pointed to two Supreme Court cases — Cousins vs. Wigoda (1975) and Democratic Party vs. Wisconsin ex rel. LaFollette (1980) — that both held states don’t have the authority to override a party’s nominating process. In other words, the parties are in control of themselves. In Trump’s case, that means the rules committee’s decision to release the delegates would effectively override a state’s law binding its delegates. ""Any time the issue of intraparty politics come up, the court sides with the party,"" said Putnam. Our ruling Trump said delegates seeking to change the convention rules to prevent his nomination ""can’t do it legally."" Under current rules, the delegates are bound to vote for whomever won their state’s primary or caucus (in most cases, Trump). But if this year’s rules committee votes to change the rules to thwart Trump, it’s well within its authority to do so. And intervention by the courts would be unlikely. Because political parties are private organizations, courts have said they can set their own rules.

Donald Trump wrong that 'there's no real assimilation' by U.S. Muslims
","After the mass shooting in Orlando by a man who pledged allegiance to the Islamic terrorist group ISIS, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his call for a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the United States. During an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Trump elaborated on one of the problems he sees with the Muslim community in America. Hannity said that Muslims have different religious and cultural practices than many Americans. He asked Trump, ""If you grow up (as a Muslim overseas) and you want to come to America, how do we vet somebody's heart and ascertain if they're coming here for freedom or if they want to proselytize, indoctrinate and bring their theocracy with them?"" Trump responded, ""Assimilation has been very hard. It's almost — I won't say nonexistent, but it gets to be pretty close. And I'm talking about second and third generation. They come — they don't — for some reason, there's no real assimilation."" We were intrigued by the question of whether ""there's no real assimilation"" among ""second and third generation"" Muslims in the United States. So we looked at the social-science data and sought expert opinion. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) We concluded that the implication of what Trump said — that Muslims want to isolate themselves from the mainstream American culture — is flat wrong. However, we also learned that the question involves some important nuance. In particular, the task of ""assimilation"" facing post-1960s immigrants to America is more complicated than, and thus distinct from, what it was for white, Christian, European immigrants who came to the United States in prior generations. By and large, Muslims want to embrace an American identity Several academic studies in the past decade have demonstrated that Muslims do indeed want to become integrated with mainstream American life. One of the major surveys is from 2011, when the Pew Research Center conducted telephone interviews with 1,033 Muslims in the United States, in English, Arabic, Farsi and Urdu. The researchers concluded that ""Muslim Americans appear to be highly assimilated into American society."" Specifically, 56 percent of Muslim Americans said that most Muslims coming to the United States today want to adopt American customs and ways of life. Only 20 percent said most Muslims coming to the U.S. want to be distinct from the larger American society, Pew found, while 16 percent said Muslim immigrants want to do both. (Incidentally, this is far different than the views of Americans at large; just 33 percent of Americans of all backgrounds told Pew that most Muslim immigrants want to adopt American ways, while 51 percent said Muslim immigrants want to remain distinct from the larger culture.) Notably, Pew found some striking similarities between the views of American Christians and American Muslims. For instance, about half of Muslims said they thought of themselves first as a Muslim, rather than as American. A different Pew survey found a nearly identical fraction of Christians in the United States, 46 percent, saying they thought of themselves first as Christian, rather than as American. And near-identical percentages of Muslims and Christians said there was no conflict with being devout in their own religion and part of a modern society. (Sentiments about identity were similar among native-born and foreign-born Muslims, though those born after 1990 had a somewhat larger preference for a Muslim identity.) Jen’nan Ghazal Read, an associate professor of sociology and global health at Duke University, pointed to data from Pew and other sources showing similar rates of religious practice and beliefs among Muslims and Christians in the United States:  Other evidence lines up with what Pew found. Selcuk R. Sirin, an associate professor of applied psychology at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, found that even though 84 percent of 12-to-18-year-old Muslim Americans he studied had faced at least one act of discrimination in the previous year, most were comfortable with their ""hyphenated identities"" as both Muslims and Americans. ""They seem to be pretty happy sitting on the hyphen,"" has said. ""They don't feel the need to pick one over the other."" Akbar S. Ahmed, a professor of Islamic studies at American University, found similar sentiments when he did fieldwork for the book Journey into America, which spanned 75 cities and 100 mosques. ""Muslims again and again told us that America is the best place in the world to be a Muslim,"" Ahmed said. ""There are countless examples of Muslims who are assimilated and are completely American in every sense."" He said that out of the roughly 2,000 personal interviews that comprised in his fieldwork, virtually all Muslims said that Muslims could be American. ""So it is dangerous, irresponsible and incorrect for Trump to make statements like this and demonize the entire community,"" Ahmed said. Some experts have said that, if anything, that the trend is moving even more strongly towards becoming American. ""In the 1970s and 1980s, Muslim leaders explicitly urged their people to avoid assimilating into the American mainstream and to withdraw into Islamic community centers, schools, and colleges,"" Boston College political science Peter Skerry wrote in 2013. ""Since 9/11, Muslim leaders have shown a remarkable​ — ​and largely unnoted, or disbelieved ​— ​willingness to adapt to America. Indeed, these leaders have been busily reconstructing an anodyne version of Islam that conforms to the American civil religion."" In other words, Skerry wrote, Muslim Americans today ""are being reassured that it is permissible​—​even desirable​—​to have non-Muslim friends. And that it is okay to attend business lunches where non-Muslim colleagues drink alcohol. And that it is definitely a good idea to vote and get involved in civic and political affairs."" Integration is a bigger challenge for Muslims So there’s clear evidence that, contrary to what Trump suggests, Muslims are embracing American identity and values. At the same time, Muslim Americans by and large do not want to eradicate all traces of their religious and cultural heritage. This is similar to patterns seen in many immigrant groups that came to the United States beginning in the 1960s, when the nation’s immigration system was oriented away from its previous focus on European immigrants and toward other parts of the world. Prior to the 1960s, most immigrants to the United States were white and Christian. They may have had national identities and cultural practices from their native country, but in most cases, they shared a religion and a race with the majority American culture. That meant it was easier for them to ""assimilate,"" as Trump said, in the larger culture. But more recent waves of immigrants from Asia, India and the Middle East often have not shared the same race or religion as the American majority. So ""assimilation"" in the traditional sense has been a more complicated process. Assimilating to the mainstream American culture to the same degree as someone like Trump’s ancestors did (his grandfather emigrated from Germany) would require a Muslim to renounce their religion and become Christian. (And, obviously, they could not change their skin color or other physical features.)   This has led scholars to shift away from the term ""assimilation"" and toward the term ""integration."" Sarah Lyons-Padilla, a research scientist at Stanford University, and Michele Gelfand, a professor at the University of Maryland, describe ""assimilation"" as part of an older ""melting pot"" model, while ""integration"" is more like a ""mosaic."" ""We should not confuse integration with assimilation,"" Lyons-Padilla and Gelfand have written. ""Integration means encouraging immigrants to call themselves American, German or French and to take pride in their own cultural and religious heritage."" Research by Lyons-Padilla and Gelfand found that Muslim-Americans’ support for ""assimilation"" — essentially, the melting-pot model — is low, statistically, at 1.76 on a 6-point scale. But they found support for the integration model to be quite high, at 4.96 out of 6. ""This tells you that Muslim Americans don't want to assimilate into American culture at the expense of giving up their own cultural identity, but they are very interested in embracing both,"" Lyons-Padilla told PolitiFact. She added that psychologists generally see the integration model as a more practical one to aspire to. ""Decades' worth of research shows that people fare best when they can have a foot in both worlds,"" Lyons-Padilla said. Our ruling Trump said that even among ""second and third generation"" Muslims in the United States, ""there's no real assimilation."" The data and the experts agree that Trump is wrong. Substantial evidence confirms that Muslim Americans want to have an American identity and think that doing so is achievable. In fact, their preferences for self-identification mirror those of Christian Americans. The data show that American Muslims want to be both American and Muslim. That’s different than the widely recognized ""melting pot"" model where immigrants of generations past blended in fully in their new country based on a shared religion and culture. But the reality is that for most Muslim Americans, religion and race would have made it impossible for them to follow that course in the first place. We rate Trump’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ccf1be4b-8a88-4196-947c-b78eff07ae33",[<zip object at 0x00000280977087C0>],/factchecks/2016/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-theres-no-real-assimilation-us-/

David Beckham says Swaziland has the world's highest rate of HIV
","British soccer star (or footballer if you prefer) David Beckham is a long-time goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. For a decade, he has lent his presence and fame to help the United Nations agency in its work with children around the world. A video posted on Facebook showed Beckham’s visit to Swaziland, a landlocked nation on the border between South Africa and Mozambique that has just over 1 million people. In the video, which has been viewed more than 1.3 million times, Beckham said ""Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world."" That statistic checks out. Here’s the research behind it. There are two ways to talk about the reach of HIV/AIDS (or any disease for that matter). There’s prevalence, which tells you the fraction of people who are infected with the virus at any particular time. And there’s incidence, which tells you how many new people get infected in a given year. Swaziland tops the rankings for both. UNAIDS, the United Nations group focused on HIV/AIDS, reports that last year, HIV prevalence among adults 15-49 in Swaziland was 28.8 percent of the population -- more than 1 out of 4. The incidence rate was 2.36 per 100 person-years. These charts, drawn from UNAIDS data, back up Beckham’s claim. The CIA World Factbook has the same rankings, although the actual numbers vary a bit. A survey published in 2012 by the Swaziland Ministry of Health found slightly higher rates -- 31 percent prevalence and 2.4 percent incidence -- but that would certainly leave the ranking unchanged. Why so high? Kate Grabowski and Ronald Gray at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told us that a constellation of factors led to what Gray called ""an unmitigated disaster"" in Swaziland. Researchers debate the relative importance of certain drivers, but a lack of HIV treatment and prevention, as well as migration patterns and social structures all likely play a role. In Swaziland, there are ""very high rates of polygamy,"" Gray said, plus many men work as miners in South Africa and Botswana where prostitution is common. That could explain the high rate, but as far as Swaziland’s top rank among nations, that might have more to do with its small size. Grabowski noted that in some ways, Swaziland resembles other HIV hot spots. ""There are other communities that are not necessarily countries which also have high HIV prevalence,"" Grabowski said. ""Unfortunately Swaziland gets highlighted because it happens to be one of those places and it is also a country."" Our ruling Beckham said that Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV in the world. Official numbers back that up. Whether you look at how many people are infected with HIV at any moment, or how many new infections emerge in a year, Swaziland is worse off than any other nation. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C09E2C0>],/factchecks/2016/jun/17/david-beckham/david-beckham-says-swaziland-has-worlds-highest-ra/

Joaquin Castro to Trump: San Antonio is 60 percent Mexican-American - Mostly True
","Considering the polarization Donald Trump’s promised border wall has created in the presidential campaign thus far, it’s no big surprise that there was apprehension in his visit to San Antonio — the largest majority-Hispanic city in America as of the 2010 Census. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a longtime Clinton supporter, took to Twitter on June 6, 2016 with his take: ""@realDonaldTrump is coming to San Antonio, which is 60% Mexican-AMERICAN & built on respect for many cultures. The last place he'd fit in."" ""That was my best approximation of San Antonio’s Mexican-American population,"" Castro said in an email we fielded via his press secretary, Erin Hatch. We wondered whether Castro’s very specific tweet accurately described San Antonio’s demographics. Is the city 60 percent Mexican-American? We started by looking at what percentage of San Antonio’s population claims Mexican heritage when describing their ancestry to the U.S. Census Bureau. According to methodology information on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website, when U.S. Census respondees check the box identifying as ""Hispanic/Latino,"" they’re asked about their ""specific origin,"" with four possible answers: ""Mexican, Mexican Am[erican], Chicano,"" ""Puerto Rican,"" ""Cuban,"" and ""another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin"" (with a write-in option). According to numbers from the most recent American Community Survey in 2014, the city of San Antonio is 63.8 percent Hispanic or Latino (916,540 of 1,436,723 people are Hispanic or Latino). The 822,106 people identifying their specific origin as Mexican are by far the largest subgroup, making up 57.2 percent of the city’s overall population — not 60, but close. The margin of error given is plus or minus 0.9 percent, so it could be as high as 58.1 percent or as low as 56.3. But what about the ""American"" part of Castro’s claim? The bureau counts every resident, regardless of immigration status. So, how many of that 57.2 percent of San Antonians are citizens? On this front, we turned to the Texas state demographer, Lloyd Potter, who by email pointed us to Census Bureau numbers estimating that in 2014, roughly 11 percent of Hispanics in San Antonio (almost 90 percent of whom are Mexican or Mexican-American) were noncitizens as of 2014. The 2014 Census data doesn’t specify the citizenship status of San Antonians of Mexican origin, but since Mexicans and Mexican-Americans are such a large share of San Antonio’s Hispanic population, the citizenship numbers for Hispanics overall can help us get a rough idea of how many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans are citizens in San Antonio. Estimating using the overall citizenship rate for San Antonio Hispanics of 89 percent would mean that of 822,106 Mexican Hispanics in San Antonio in 2014, 731,674 were citizens. The same year, by our calculation using the bureau’s population estimate for the city, those citizens would have comprised 50.1 percent of San Antonio’s population -- and 55.9 percent of San Antonio’s population of U.S. citizens (which totaled 1,309,676 that year). Complicating things is the existence of legal permanent residents (green card holders). These people are not naturalized citizens but could be considered ""Americans,"" since they are authorized to live and work in the country indefinitely so long as they don’t violate certain rules -- according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, ""Lawful permanent residents are legally accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States."" They pay taxes, register for the draft, and have Social Security numbers. In 2013, a report from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics estimated that 1.32 million permanent residents lived in Texas, 950,000 of whom were eligible to be naturalized as citizens. Bureau records don’t show how many live in San Antonio, but it’s perhaps worth noting that some of that 11 percent of San Antonio Hispanics who are noncitizens are likely to be permanent residents. It’s also been a year and a half since the American Community Survey was conducted (in January 2014). In the period since, the Hispanic share of San Antonio’s population (which has historically grown faster than the overall population) has probably increased. By email, Potter told us ""The county population projections for Bexar County produced by the Texas Demographic Center indicate the percent of the population that is Latino will continue to increase and the percent that is non-Hispanic white will decline."" Our ruling Castro said San Antonio is 60 percent Mexican-American. The city of San Antonio is 63 percent Latino, or Hispanic, with the number of people of Mexican descent pegged at 57 percent of the population. But how many of those residents are American, either naturalized or holding permanent resident cards, is undetermined. Because of the unknowns, we rate this claim Mostly True.

Greg Abbott makes unfounded claim about ISIS 'running through' U.S.-Mexico border
","At the May 2016 Republican Party of Texas convention, Gov. Greg Abbott told thousands of delegates that the Islamic State group, which has ravaged parts of the Middle East, was at work along the Texas-Mexico border. ""Our country better wake up. We’re facing an existential threat,"" he said. ""ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies."" ISIS has seized vast territory in Iraq and Syria wielding heavy weapons of war. It terrorizes civilians and broadcasts footage of sadistic executions. Does it also operate over the 1,254-mile Texas-Mexico border? Rumor says they do, though we’ve found previous claims short of factual footing. In October 2014, we rated False then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst’s claim that prayer rugs had been found at the border, suggesting an ISIS presence. The same month, we rated False a claim by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter that 10 ISIS fighters had been caught at the border. In April 2015, we rated False a report by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch stating that ISIS was running a camp in Mexico just over the border from El Paso. Most recently, in December 2015 we rated Mostly False Abbott’s claim that Texas had seen three ISIS-related incidents, finding his definition of ""ISIS-related"" extremely loose. So, here we go again. Abbott’s data Abbott, who in 2015 touted and signed into law the state’s $800 million border security package, offered his declaration as proof of the urgency of his border security agenda and as a jab at the immigration policies of the Democratic president’s administration, over which then-Attorney General Abbott filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Texas and more than 20 other mostly Republican-led states in 2014. It alleged the president exceeded his constitutional authority when he used executive action to shield certain young adults and parents from deportation.   In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the Texas-led challenge to the Obama administration’s policy; a ruling could come this year. We emailed Abbott spokesman John Wittman to ask when ISIS ran through the border, and also which Obama policies had made the border more porous, as Abbott said. Regarding the porous border, Wittman sent a link to the 2014 lawsuit filed by Attorney General Abbott. ""A specific policy which has made the border more porous,"" Wittman wrote. Regarding ISIS, Wittman provided a web link, tweeted by Abbott on April 23, 2016, to a Fox News Latino article published the day before. The news story, citing prosecutorial documents, said a 21-year-old Minnesota man charged with conspiracy to join ISIS ""told the ISIS members about the route (‘to the U.S. through Mexico’) so that it could be used to send members to America to carry out terrorist attacks."" ISIS at the gates For our part, we looked first for signs of ISIS border crossings, then considered Abbott’s charge about Obama fostering a porous border. Abbott’s backup did not say, as the governor did, that ISIS was operating at the border, but we still made inquiries. At the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency for border security, including the U.S. Border Patrol, spokeswoman Marsha Catron emailed in reply: ""The suggestion that (ISIS) operatives have been apprehended at the Southwest border is not supported by facts on the ground. DHS does not have any credible intelligence that terrorist organizations are planning to attempt to cross the southwest border to carry out attacks in the United States."" We also emailed the Texas Department of Public Safety, which patrols the border, to ask for any reports of ISIS activity thereabouts.DPS spokesman Tom Vinger emailed: ""The department does not have any information to provide."" In the past, groups or individuals bandying similar claims alleged that law enforcement agencies suppress news of ISIS at the border to avoid public panics. That in mind, we also queried experts outside of government. By phone, we asked Victor M. Manjarrez, director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, if ISIS was operating at the border. Manjarrez, a former Border Patrol sector chief, said, ""no,"" adding that every report of ISIS at the border has been debunked. We thought perhaps there are reports Manjarrez hadn’t seen, so we looked elsewhere. At the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C.-based think tank which focuses partly on border security and international terrorism, we were referred to Rick Nelson, former director of the center’s Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program, who said in a phone interview he knew of no reports of ISIS at the border. Nelson said: ""There’s no doubt that if ISIS had the opportunity, they would conduct an attack in the U.S., but to state that they’re going to do so by going through Mexico and going through the southern border is a little bit disconnected."" He said the group was more focused on radicalizing Americans already in the country. We also emailed the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank focused partly on national security, to ask about reports of ISIS at the border. By phone, Colin Clarke, a political scientist and national security research at RAND, said: ""I haven’t seen any evidence that there are ISIS people coming across the border. My standard response is I haven’t seen the evidence, but that doesn’t mean that at some point they won’t try that."" Clarke said ISIS would need a domestic network of safe houses and weapons stashes to wage a significant attack, even if members were to come across the border. So, no confirmed ISIS sightings. We looked next at if the border has become ""porous"" on Obama’s watch, as Abbott said. Border Patrol spending up, apprehensions down There are no signs of a more porous border that we divined. When we asked Nelson at the CSIS to what extent border security had decreased under Obama, he said, ""I would say it hasn’t."" He said, ""The amount of resources Obama has put forward to secure the border has been significant."" On Obama’s watch, federal figures suggest, border security spending and staffing escalated and, in the latest full fiscal year, 2015, apprehensions of individuals crossing the border without legal authority declined in comparison to the three previous years. Some perspective: --The congressionally approved $3.8 billion fiscal 2015 budget for the Border Patrol, the on-the-ground border enforcement unit of Customs and Border Protection,was up an inflation-adjusted 29 percent from fiscal 2009, the year Obama succeeded George W. Bush. --The 17,522 Border Patrol agents in 2015 were up a sliver, less than 1 percent, from 2009, though down 6 percent from the all-time high of 18,611 agents in 2013. --Apprehensions along the southwest border escalated in 2013 and 2014, according to Border Patrol data, but the 331,333 apprehensions near the border in fiscal 2015 were the fewest since 2011--and down 39 percent compared to 2009. Also worth noting: Deportations from the U.S. hit a record high under Obama in 2013, the year before the surge, according to Pew Research. Obama policies? Abbott’s lawsuit, which Wittman cited as backup, identified two Obama policies: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), announced in 2012, and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), unveiled in 2014. DACA blocked deportation for qualified unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children and DAPA did the same for parents of qualified citizens and permanent residents.    The lawsuit predicted that both moves would ""substantially increase the number of undocumented immigrants in the plaintiff states"" because ""the removal of the deportation threat, combined with the incentives to stay, will make remaining in the United States far more attractive."" We asked Manjarrez if DACA and DAPA made the border more porous. ""I wouldn’t say porous, I’d say it’s increased the clutter,"" he said. ""Some people translate that to more porous, I say the border is now at a higher risk to be exploited by some interest."" For instance, he said that many children who arrived amid a surge in 2014-2015 cited rumors that they would not be deported as a motivation for their trips to the border. The increased ""clutter"" at the border, he said, made it harder for Border Patrol agents to pinpoint security threats. We’ve looked before into claims that Obama policies fueled the migrant surge. At the time, experts and news reports gave more credit to rising violence in Central American countries and to a 2008 law passed under Bush shielding non-Mexican children from immediate deportation when apprehended at the border. Abbott again We shared our findings--no confirmation of ISIS on the border and statistics suggesting a greater security presence--with the governor’s office. Wittman said Abbott had nothing to add. Our ruling Abbott said ""ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies."" We found no factual basis — Abbott offered none — to support the claim that ISIS is ""running through"" the border. Other claims of ISIS forces marshaling on the U.S.-Mexico border have been debunked, and this one deserves the same fate. Border security itself has been stepped up, by the federal government and Texas, with apprehensions lately on the decline. Abbott’s claim isn’t just wrong, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Louie Gohmert singles out 514 federal inmates, mostly noncitizens, convicted of possessing drugs
","A Texas Republican, maintaining that proposed sentencing reforms won’t benefit Americans, told U.S. House colleagues that the vast majority of federal prisoners convicted of possessing illegal drugs aren’t even U.S. citizens. U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Tyler opened his May 10, 2016, floor remarks by mentioning concerns about opioid abuse and his suspicion that President Barack Obama wants to release thousands of criminals as part of sentencing reform under debate in Congress. Gohmert then questioned whether all that many Americans are behind bars for possessing illegal drugs such as marijuana. To the contrary, Gohmert said that ""of all the people in federal prison for possession of illegal substances, 77 percent of them are not citizens of the United States. That is, 77 percent of those in federal prison for possession are not U.S. citizens,"" he said. ""So, obviously,"" Gohmert asserted, ""this president has been giving illegal, unconstitutional amnesties out like they were water at a marathon."" Gohmert didn’t reply to our requests for the basis of his ""amnesties"" claim. Let's start by mentioning that state prisons hold many inmates with drug convictions. Regardless, we focused on whether nearly 8 in 10 inmates federally imprisoned for drug possession lack citizenship. In general as of April 2016, we found that nearly 80 percent of the federal system’s approximately 195,000 total inmates were U.S. citizens; 15 percent were citizens of Mexico, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Sentencing reform debate Gohmert made his comment in the wake of an April 2016 White House report stating that drug-related arrests spurted nationally between 1980 and 2014, contributing to rising incarceration rates. Specifically, a 2015 Pew Charitable Trusts analysis says, the share of federal inmates serving time for drug offenses increased from 25 percent in 1980 to a high of 61 percent in 1994 before decreasing due to rising admissions for other crimes—though drug offenders still represented 49 percent of federal inmates. ""Changes in drug crime patterns and law enforcement practices played a role in this growth,"" the Pew report says, ""but federal sentencing laws enacted during the 1980s and 1990s also have required more drug offenders to go to prison—and stay there much longer—than three decades ago."" To our inquiry, Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project, which says it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, addressing unjust racial disparities and advocating for alternatives to incarceration, stressed by email that the ""vast majority of people in federal prison for a drug offense are there on a conviction for selling drugs, not possessing drugs."" Gohmert’s backup To our request for factual backup, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham said by email that Gohmert relied on a chart from the U.S. Sentencing Commission; its duties include the collection and distribution of information on federal crime and sentencing issues. The chart, ""Citizenship of Offenders in Each Primary Offense Category, Fiscal Year 2015,"" has a line indicating that 1,680 of 2,181 individuals whose ""primary offense"" was ""simple possession"" of drugs (77 percent) were non-U.S. citizens. In general, according to the chart, 41,059 of 70,225 total convicts, 58.5 percent, were citizens with 29,166, nearly 42 percent, being noncitizens. But, we noticed, those counts solely reflected individuals sentenced to federal prison in the 12 months through September 2015--not the entire population of federal inmates. A BOP spokesman, Justin Long, answered our request for detail with an email stating that 84,911 inmates ""are drug offenders (the offense associated with the longest term of sentence is a drug offense), and of those 18,132 (21%) are not U.S. citizens."" Put another way, most drug offenders, including individuals convicted of drug trafficking, are Americans. But that’s also describing a more general population than what Gohmert singled out. Bureau officials told us the agency doesn’t classify inmates in the way that Gohmert did in his remarks. Fortuitously, Willingham sent us an April 2016 document she attributed to sentencing commission staff stating that as of March 27, 2016, 514 individuals were serving a federal sentence for simple drug possession--94 percent of them having been sentenced since September 2015. ""Most of these offenders are non-citizens (95.5%),"" the document says, ""and most are Hispanic (96.9%)."" The provided document didn't name an author or even specify the commission as its provider. Mindful that we can't rely on anonymous sources, we reached a commission spokeswoman, Christine Leonard, who confirmed the information we'd fielded from Willingham was earlier sent to a member of Congress. By phone, Leonard said that generally, Glenn Schmitt of the agency’s Office of Research and Data has a hand in producing such responses. Gohmert referred to 514 inmates So, who was Gohmert talking about that day? By our calculation, the tallied 514 prisoners amounted to about 0.6 percent of all drug offenders in federal facilities around the time he spoke--or 0.3 of 1 percent of all federal prisoners. The document has more detail including an indication that nearly all these possession-only inmates were sentenced in Arizona. For instance, a footnote says: ""Simple Possession offenders are defined as offenders 1) sentenced under USSG §2D2.1,"" referring to a provision in the commission’s U.S. Sentencing Guidelines describing penalties for possession of heroin or any ""Schedule I or II opiate, an analogue of these, or cocaine base."" Other substances specified in the section include LSD and PCP. A ""commentary"" in the document says: ""The typical case addressed by this guideline involves possession of a controlled substance by the defendant for the defendant’s own consumption. Where the circumstances establish intended consumption by a person other than the defendant, an upward departure may be warranted."" The document also says: ""The vast majority of the simple drug possession crimes for which offenders were incarcerated involved marijuana (97.5%)."" ""The median weight of the drug involved in the cases from the border districts was 21,700 grams (approx. 48 pounds)."" Also, the document says, of offenders sentenced in a ""border district, the average sentence was 6.3 months (and the median sentence was 6.0 months)."" Next, we sought to learn more about the cases against the tallied inmates sentenced in Arizona. Perhaps something unique to that state explains its dominance of this statistical slice. By email when we sought guidance, Julie Samuels, a senior fellow in the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, speculated that the preponderance of noncitizens among the inmates reflects the likelihood that each one wasn’t eligible for probation or any sentence short of incarceration after which she or he would be deported. We didn’t confirm that. Cosme Lopez, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Phoenix, told us by phone he had no information about prosecutions of the inmates. Attempts to reach other possible experts in the state didn’t pan out. Our ruling Gohmert said that of ""all the people in federal prison for possession of illegal substances, 77 percent of them are not citizens of the United States."" In fact, nearly all the 514 inmates in federal prison for simple possession of illegal drugs aren’t citizens. But this claim lacks context. The clutch of inmates who fit Gohmert’s categorization--nearly all of them sentenced in Arizona since September 2015--account for a minuscule fraction of the people in the federal pen for drug crimes, of whom 21 percent are noncitizens. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Russ Feingold says average UW-Madison student graduates with $28,000 in student debt
","During the first day of the Wisconsin Democratic Convention, Russ Feingold told delegates about what he experienced during his trip across Wisconsin -- an effort marked by campaign stops in all 72 counties in his bid to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson. After saying Wisconsinites talked about hot topics such as income inequality, paid family leave and Social Security, Feingold turned his attention to Johnson and college students. ""Finally, I didn’t hear a single student in this state agree with Sen. Johnson’s comment that students like to take out student loans because they think it’s free money,"" said Feingold, a Democrat who lost to Johnson in 2010. ""Students don’t like that. It’s actually scary. ""The average debt coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like $28,000."" With in-state tuition ringing up at just over $5,000 a semester, we wondered if Feingold was right. Behind the numbers We checked a similar claim about student debt from Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in 2014. She claimed that ""this generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they’ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt."" We rated her claim Half True, as she didn’t mention the data’s limitations and some cases suggest the level may be lower. For backup to Feingold’s, his team sent us links to a few news articles that cited the average debt incurred by students at UW-Madison. We reached out to the officials to confirm the numbers, which come from UW’s Office of Student Financial Aid. The most recent year for which statistics are available is 2014-15 and the average debt for students at the time of graduation that year was $28,769. That’s slightly higher than the figure Feingold used. Loans taken out by students through the university are tracked by the office through its Student Information System. Loans not borrowed at UW-Madison are fed into the system through the National Student Loan Data System, a student aid database from the U.S. Department of Education. Loans taken out by parents on behalf of students are not included. But the number is a little over reaching. When UW’s Office of Student Financial Aid calculates the average debt of students, it only counts those who take out loans. So, how many students are included? According to the office, just about half of students at UW-Madison graduate with debt -- 3,374 of the 6,798 students who graduated in 2015. If we spread out the loans among all students, average debt would hover around $14,000. We think the best way to measure the amount of debt incurred is to examine only students who take out loans. And that tracks more closely with what Feingold said. Another qualifier: The numbers doesn’t take into account other ways students could be in debt -- credit cards, car loans, for instance. But that is impossible to track. Meanwhile, in the entire UW System, 73.5 percent of students borrow money, with the average debt at graduation for those students reaching $30,651. Our rating Feingold said the average student debt ""coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like 28,000 dollars."" His number was on target, but he failed to mention the average only included about half of all students -- those who borrowed money for their educational expenses. The other half left with no debt at all. Feingold’s statement is accurate, but needs additional information. That’s our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968B0E40>],/factchecks/2016/jun/17/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-average-uw-madison-student-grad/

Americans For Prosperity exaggerates the number of failing schools in North Carolina
","In vouching for a law that would allow some struggling public schools to be taken over by charter schools, the state chapter of the conservative group Americans For Prosperity said one in every five North Carolina public schools is failing. ""This Achievement School District legislation is a small first step testing one approach to the long-overdue process of improving 500 failing schools in North Carolina,"" wrote AFP’s North Carolina director, Donald Bryson, on the group’s website. North Carolina has 2,583 public schools, including 148 charter schools. So if Bryson is right about 500 failing schools, that means nearly 20 percent of schools fall into that category. His proposed solution, a relatively new and controversial program called an achievement school district, or ASD, is moving forward in North Carolina. The ASD program was approved by the N.C. House on June 2 (the day after Bryson published his argument) and is now up for a vote in the Senate. The idea is to take a handful of the lowest-performing schools away from their districts and turn them over to charter school operators. Bryson said it’s noteworthy that there are 500 failing schools because such schools ""remain broken education communities, systematically failing to teach tens of thousands of students without any path towards meaningful, long-term reform or improved achievement."" We wondered if the picture was really so bleak. How many schools are failing? The state has give out school grades since the 2013-14 school year. Last year, 146 schools received Fs. That’s a far cry from 500, so we asked Bryson where his number came from. He said he was actually underestimating it – that there are 547 low-performing schools, according to a state law that defines the term. However, ""low-performing"" is not the same as ""failing"" – the law that Bryson cited includes F schools as well as D schools. And as any slacker can tell you, D’s get degrees. For Bryson to count D schools as failing seems to be self-evidently wrong. But that’s not the whole story. The state gave its schools a grading scale that we all would’ve loved to have had ourselves. While a typical grading scale gives any score below 60 an F and then goes up by 10-point intervals, North Carolina uses the following scale to grade its schools: F: 0-39 D: 40-54 C: 55-69 B: 70-84 A: 85-100 The scores are mostly based on how students do on standardized tests, with a small amount of consideration given to whether the schools met their expected student growth goals. Grades for high schools also include factors like graduation rates. If the state used a traditional scale, every D school (and even some C schools) would have instead received an F. That’s a pretty good argument in Bryson’s favor. We decided we needed to talk to an expert on education policy to determine whether the state had a good reason to give itself this scale, or if it was simply protecting its image. Eric Houck is a former public school teacher who now teaches education policy at UNC-Chapel Hill. He said many academics, including himself, don’t really pay attention to school grades – including the question of whether the scale is too generous. The rubric doesn’t give much weight to how much students improved in a given year, Houck said, and instead focuses mostly on raw scores. He said that punishes schools for having students who came to them below grade level and largely ignores how well teachers did getting those students caught up. ""The entire grading system is a little suspect in terms of being able to accurately identify what schools are actually failing,"" he said. Using growth to measure schools The ""low-performing"" metric that Bryson cited includes all D and F schools that didn’t meet their growth goals, as well as those that met their growth goals. Those that exceeded their growth goals are not considered low-performing. That’s a bit more in line with Houck’s philosophy on how to best judge schools, but it’s still misleading to say all those students are being left behind. By equating ""low-performing"" with ""failing,"" Bryson’s claim considers a school to be failing if its average student is a D student whose scores are improving as much as the state expects. A reasonable person wouldn’t say that student is failing. He’s below average, but above the threshold for failure and on track for improvement. And nearly half of the schools Bryson is talking about, 225 of them, are in that category. Paying a bit more attention to growth, like Houck suggested, we found that a better estimate of the number of failing schools could range from 80 to 415, depending on how much you trust the state to have given itself a fair grading scale. 80: The number of F schools in 2014-15 that did not meet their expected growth. 146: The number of F schools in 2014-15. 299: The number of low-performing schools that did not meet their expected growth (out of 547 total low-performing schools). 415: The number of schools that scored 59 or below in 2014-15 and thus would’ve received an F on a traditional grading scale, and which also didn’t meet growth goals. Our ruling It’s hard to say exactly how many failing schools are in North Carolina, but we do know there are not 500 like AFP state director Donald Bryson said. He was referring to low-performing schools, but the majority of low-performing schools are D schools – which most people don’t consider failing. We counted failing schools in a number of ways, with the results ranging from 80 to 415 depending on the grading scale used to define what an F is. Any way you slice it there are clearly dozens, and maybe hundreds, of failing schools statewide. Bryson’s statement was overly broad, but it’s not totally wrong.

Obama: 'We've seen more manufacturing jobs created' than anytime since the 1990s
","Attempting to defend his economic record, President Barack Obama cited manufacturing job creation as a key indicator of growth under his presidency. In a PBS NewsHour special held in Elkhart, Ind.  — the RV capital of the world — Obama said that his presidency has seen more manufacturing jobs created since the 1990s when Bill Clinton was president. ""We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s. That's a fact,"" Obama said. His statement came in a larger discussion of manufacturing, where Obama tried to assuage the concerns of his skeptics. During the interview, Obama also claimed that the United States has a bigger manufacturing base than it has for much of history, but that automation has led to fewer workers at the same time. But is what he claimed, that ""we've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s,"" truly a fact? In one sense, yes, but Obama is using some clever phrasing and picking a most advantageous timeframe. Manufacturing employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics best shows the situation. Remember, Obama took office in January 2009. As you can see, Obama actually has presided over a net loss of manufacturing jobs since he has been in office of about 95,000 jobs.    But all of those losses are concentrated in the first year-plus of his presidency. Isolating the period from March 2010 forward, the number of manufacturing jobs steadily has been increasing (though not back to the 2009 levels). Between March 2010 (the trough of Obama’s presidency) and May 2016, there has been an increase of 832,000 manufacturing jobs. This is what Obama was referring to, the White House told us. And by that measure, that is indeed the greatest period of increase since the 1990s. Is it really an accomplishment, though? That’s debatable for several reasons. Bigger gains in the 1990s. The United States saw a bigger increase in manufacturing jobs in the 1990s. From July 1993 through April 1998, for instance, the country added 898,000 jobs. Manufacturing was in sharp decline for all of the 2000s. The chart above shows how far, how fast the manufacturing sector has fallen, and while the jobs picture has brightened in recent years — far fewer people remain employed in the manufacturing sector. At the start of 2000, there were a total of 17.28 million employed in manufacturing. Today, that number stands at 12.29 million We’ve seen job losses recently. The United States lost manufacturing jobs — 10,000 — in May 2016. Who deserves credit? And while Obama did not directly attribute the recent increases to his policies, that is an obvious implication. In that regard, it is important to note that other economic factors beyond the president’s control also played a role. Sujit CanagaRetna, a senior fiscal analyst at the Council of State Governments, said external influences such as energy production and the global economic climate also played a role. Our ruling ""We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s. That's a fact."" There has indeed been a consistent decline in manufacturing jobs between 1998 until 2010, so Obama is correct that his presidency has seen the largest period of sustained manufacturing growth since the 1990s. However,  manufacturing jobs have still suffered a net loss over Obama’s term. Obama’s statement could lead people to believe there has been the first net gain compared to the 1990s, but that is incorrect — just the first growth spurt.

Trump mostly correct about Sharia law support in Afghanistan
","Donald Trump reinvigorated calls for a ban on Muslims entering the United States following the mass shooting of an Orlando nightclub by a U.S. citizen who pledged allegiance to ISIS during the fatal attack. Among his reasons, many Muslims support Sharia law —a set of religious principles that critics say include harsh punishments and can be used as a rationale for violence.  Trump singled out Afghanistan to make his point in a speech June 13, 2016, in New Hampshire. ""According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia law,"" Trump said. Is that number correct? What is Sharia law First, what is Sharia law? The Council on Foreign Relations offers a useful primer. Meaning ""path"" in Arabic, Sharia is largely derived from the Quran and is intended to guide various aspects of Muslim life. Sharia law has been incorporated in different ways, ranging from secular governments to fully Islamic governments. Many Republican presidential candidates have criticized Sharia law for its unequal treatment of women and after the Orlando attacks its views on homosexuality. They have also criticized the inclusion of Hudud punishments (ranging from stoning to execution) that are required for certain crimes such as adultery or theft. Scholars say that these punishments are not necessarily used in practice and that different countries interpret and apply Sharia law differently. Like other religions, personal interpretations are subject to change over time, said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Nai’im, a professor of law at Emory University. ""Sharia is understood to be the religious obligations of Muslims, but it is a normative system in which Muslims have profound differences and always have,"" An-Nai’m said. Pew’s research Trump’s figure does come from a Pew Research study published in April 2013, titled ""The World’s Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society."" One clarification right of the bat — the Pew study found that 99 percent of Muslims in Afghanistan supported Sharia law as the ""law of the land."" Trump said people in Afghanistan. However, Pew also estimated in a 2012 study that Muslims made up 99 percent of the Afghanistan population, so that distinction does not invalidate Trump’s claim. Furthermore, Pew reported that their 2013 sample was representative of 94 percent of the Afghani adult population. A Pew spokeswoman said that Trump’s claim is ""largely accurate."" The ""largely"" qualification came because their study did not include the word ""oppressive"" like Trump did. Caveats Trump’s statistic is relatively solid, but the survey does shed some additional light on what the 99 percent figure means, and does not mean. The survey notes that, while overwhelming numbers of Afghani Muslims favored making Sharia law official, respondents were not unanimous on certain beliefs contained within Sharia law. Percentages are of Afghani Muslims.  Violence 81 percent favored corporal punishment for crimes like theft; 79 percent favored a death penalty for leaving Islam; 58 percent think suicide bombing is rarely or never justified in the defense of Islam. Women’s rights 30 percent believe men and women should have equal inheritance rights; 37 percent believe it is ""often justified"" to kill a woman for dishonoring her family. Views on religious plurality 96 percent believe converting others to Islam is a religious duty. So people’s interpretation of Sharia law is not universal. Nor is it universal whom Sharia law should apply to. Nearly 40 percent of respondents, for instance, said that Sharia law should only apply to other Muslims, not non-Muslim citizens. Moving away from Afghanistan, it is also important to note that other Middle East countries yield different figures. Only 12 percent of Muslims in Turkey favor making Sharia law the ""law of the land,"" for example, and only 66 percent of Muslims in Iraq think converting others to Islam is a religious duty. The Pew study Trump cites is also not the only study on the matter. A November 2015 study found that the majority of people in 10 countries with large Muslim populations viewed ISIS negatively (except Pakistan). The study did not include Afghanistan. Our ruling Arguing in favor of his proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, Trump said that a Pew Research Study had found ""99 percent of the people in Afghanistan"" support Sharia law. Pew said Trump’s contention was ""largely accurate,"" noting that the phrase ""oppressive"" was Trump’s own. We did not take a stance on his use of the adjective. There is some nuance in the Afghanistan results, however, as Muslims surveyed have different perspectives on various aspects of Sharia law and how it ought to be implemented. And nearly 40 percent of respondents in Afghanistan said that Sharia law should only apply to other Muslims, not non-Muslim citizens. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4a912410-e50d-4843-b468-a9002ea4b3ae",[<zip object at 0x000002809A294840>],/factchecks/2016/jun/16/donald-trump/trump-mostly-correct-about-sharia-law-support-afgh/
"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Is Paul Ryan right that American colleges amount to ‘a cartel’?
","Several years ago, the phrase ""college cartel"" was used to describe the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which critics said enabled collusion among athletic departments. Then the use of the phrase expanded to encompass colleges in general. A 2012 National Review article headlined ""The College Cartel"" argued the college accreditation process gives accredited schools a monopoly on higher education and weakens incentives for them to control tuition costs. Today, those who want to reform higher education voice the same concerns — and the phrase ""college cartel"" is a go-to soundbite. ""Why don’t we break up the college cartel & let students try different options?"" U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, tweeted on May 14, 2016. ""Let's give students a choice."" The tweet included a link to a video clip from a Ryan town hall meeting focused on millennials from the same day. Ryan has argued that reforms in the accreditation process — including the embrace of non-traditional teaching formats such as massive online open courses — could help lower tuition costs. ""College cartel"" makes for great alliteration. But how accurate is it as a description? Going to the dictionary When asked for evidence, Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana began by sharing a definition from the Collins Dictionary: ""Cartel: a collusive . . . association of independent enterprises formed to monopolize production and distribution of a product or service, control prices, etc."" The ellipses in the definition stood in for ""international,"" a word that wouldn’t apply to this case. A second, broader definition in the same dictionary seemed to better match Ryan’s argument: ""an alliance of parties or interests to further common aims."" ""The word ‘cartel’ in the tweet is a figure of speech,"" Martorana said, ""referring to the fact that the federal government controls the supply of higher education through the accreditation process."" Martorana noted that to qualify for federal aid, schools must be accredited by a private educational association that has been certified by the Department of Education. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Education acknowledges accreditation plays a ""gatekeeping"" role in access to the annual $150 billion spent on federal student aid. ""Accreditors are responsible for ensuring baseline levels of acceptable quality and performance across diverse institutions, degree types, and academic programs,"" the department said in a 2015 news release. But that does not mean the private accreditation firms are working with the government — nor that the more than 60 active accreditors, which are private entities, are working together. ""I’m not sure how they constitute a cartel,"" said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of Colleges and State Universities. ""If by cartel you mean a group that gets together behind closed doors to set policy, that does not happen."" Meanwhile, there are approximately 4,200 accredited colleges and universities in the United States. And they compete against each other for students, government aid and grant money. Each institution decides what degrees to offer and what is required to attain them. Indeed, anyone can create a college — the accreditation only comes in as a means for students to get federal student loans. ""As we know from Trump ‘University’ and from McDonald’s ‘University,’ you can use it as a euphemism,"" Nassirian said. ""You can use it in any context you want to. And nobody stops you from awarding whatever degree you want to award."" We also turned to somehow who knows cartels well — Ellen R. Wald, an expert on the OPEC oil cartel and a professor of social science at Jacksonville University. She defines cartel as ""a group of companies or countries that coordinate and collude to set prices by increasing or decreasing production in unison."" There is no indication that universities collude to determine the number of diplomas granted, let alone the price, she said. If they appear to act in unison, it is because they are responding to the same government regulation and accreditation requirements. ""The only example in which universities coordinate to set prices is the Ivy League's decision to prohibit scholarships that are not need-based, which has the effect of raising overall prices,"" she said. Even then, the eight Ivy League schools are only a tiny portion of the 4,200 accredited institutions. Our rating Ryan called to break up the ""college cartel,"" implying that collusion is preventing better options from entering the higher education market. While it is true that the accreditation process acts as a ""gatekeeper"" of federal student aid, but that is a policy standard and, in practice, is different than a cartel which would require collusion between institutions and many other factors. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097211A40>],/factchecks/2016/jun/16/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-american-colleges-amount-cartel/

Donald Trump suggests Barack Obama supported ISIS, but that's a conspiracy theory
","In a series of comments designed to cast doubt on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump has charged that the Obama administration has actively supported the Islamic extremist group that became ISIS. In this fact-check, we’ll begin by recapping what Trump said. Then we’ll look at whether he has any evidence to support the allegation. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) What Trump said It all began with a June 13 interview with Fox & Friends, when Trump said, ""Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind. And the something else in mind — you know, people can't believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on. It's inconceivable."" Trump, as we have previously detailed, declined to clarify what he meant in a subsequent interview on NBC’s Today show. He said, ""Well, there are a lot of people that think maybe he doesn't want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesn't want to know about it. I happen to think that he just doesn't know what he's doing, but there are many people that think maybe he doesn't want to get it. He doesn't want to see what's really happening. And that could be."" Then, on June 14, Trump told the Associated Press that Obama ""claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people."" A day later, Trump tweeted, ""An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump ""may have insinuated about @POTUS."" But he's right."" The tweet then linked to a Breitbart story that began, ""Hillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State."" Finally, later that day, Trump posted on Facebook, ""Hillary Clinton --- is CROOKED! Hillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State."" This post also linked to the Breitbart article. The 2012 intelligence memo The story on the conservative website Breitbart was based on a classified and partially redacted U.S. intelligence document written in August 2012 and released last year as a result of a lawsuit by the group Judicial Watch. The document outlines what is known about ""the general situation"" on the ground in Syria and Iraq after the rebellion against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. In that context, the document refers, among other groups, to al-Qaida in Iraq, or AQI, which eventually morphed into ISIS,  sometimes called the Islamic State or ISIL. The document calls AQI one of a few ""major forces driving the insurgency in Syria."" Specifically, it said, ""AQI supported the Syrian opposition from the beginning, both ideologically and through the media. AQI declared its opposition (to) Assad’s government because it considered it a sectarian regime targeting Sunnis."" (As background, AQI and ISIS are part of the Sunni branch of Islam, which is often in conflict with the Shia branch.) Meanwhile, the document said that ""the West, Gulf countries and Turkey support the opposition, while Russia, China and Iran support the regime."" The significance of the memo Trump sees the memo as the smoking gun that demonstrates U.S. support for ISIS or its predecessor group. But that’s not the case. Rather, experts say it means that the United States shared an overarching goal with the opposition -- namely, countering Assad -- without actively supporting all elements of that opposition. In the byzantine world of the Syrian opposition, the United States sought to support moderate elements while opposing extremists such as AQI and, later, ISIS. The White House firmly rejected the notion that the United States actively supported either AQI or ISIS, noting the number of terrorists the administration has killed, including major leadership figures. ""We, in conjunction with our Iraqi partners, relentlessly pursued and ultimately degraded AQI with every tool in our arsenal -- including military force,"" said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council. ""And, of course, the fact that we eliminated AQI's leader, Abu Ayyub al-Masri in a joint U.S.-Iraqi raid leaves no doubt about our determination to rid Iraq of this group."" Independent experts agreed with the White House. ""The United States has never backed AQI and has never backed ISIS,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. ""It was never part of the opposition that the United States supported, full stop."" Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, agreed. ""It has never been the policy or stated goal of the Obama administration to arm or assist al-Qaida,"" he said. ""I would say it's another unsupportable conspiracy theory,"" said John Limbert, an international affairs professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who previously served as a foreign service officer in post-war Iraq and as deputy coordinator for counterterrorism in the State Department. John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said it would be putting it ""mildly"" to call it a conspiracy theory. And Gartenstein-Ross also used that term, tweeting that Trump’s effort to make this argument was a ""transparently fallacious conspiracy theory."" A point Trump could have made, but didn’t Ironically, experts say, Trump could have made a different point against the Obama administration's Syria policy. Gartenstein-Ross has written about the perils of the administration’s attempts to identify and support potential allies from the motley ranks of the opposition. The effort, he wrote, ended up ""benefiting the very jihadist groups the U.S. has been fighting for the past 15 years."" Specifically, the policy of arming and promoting Sunni rebel groups fighting the Assad regime ended up indirectly helping the al Nusra Front, an al-Qaida affiliate in Syria, Landis said. Al Nusra was ""allied with many of the leaders that the U.S. did arm or assist,"" Landis said. And other rebel groups were overrun by al Nusra, he added, even having to surrender their U.S.-provided arms to the al-Qaida affiliate on occasion. The difference with what Trump said is that these developments were unintended -- and unwanted -- side effects of the United States’ policy, not a goal of it. ""I think our policy has been both foolish and tragic, but it doesn’t make the argument from Breitbart true,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. Our ruling Trump said ""the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State."" U.S. efforts to court ""moderate"" opponents of Assad may have benefited other Islamic extremist groups such as al Nusra, but any such benefits were an unintended consequence of U.S. policy, not a goal of that policy itself. That’s different from the argument made by Trump -- that the U.S. was actively supporting ISIS or its predecessors. In fact, experts say that assertion is flat wrong. The implication that the Obama administration was actively helping the United States' enemies is ridiculous. It has always been U.S. policy to oppose AQI and ISIS, and the United States has aggressively fought the group for years. We rate Trump’s assertion Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2D8500>],/factchecks/2016/jun/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-suggests-barack-obama-supported-isis-/
