No, Time magazine cover does not call Trump worst president ever
","There is no Time magazine cover featuring President Donald Trump with the text ""Worst. President. Ever."" This cover you may have seen going around Facebook isn't real. The fake cover has a close-up portrait of Trump, with the special effect of his profile morphing into a skull. Below the magazine’s iconic red logo are large white letters that say ""Worst. President. Ever."" The subhead says: ""How DONALD TRUMP"" has disgraced the highest office in the nation,"" with more name-calling thrown in. Time has featured Trump on its cover several times before and after his presidential victory. But there is no record of this cover in Time’s vault. As our fact-checking friends at Snopes noted, the fake cover has been circulating on social media since at least November 2017. The ""worst"" president cover has a fabricated twin with a counter message about Trump: ""Best. President. Ever."" Earlier this year, the weekly magazine published an online post about Trump’s many cover stories. ""Since launching his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has appeared on more than a dozen TIME magazine covers,"" Time’s post said. ""He has been depicted in multiple stages of meltdown, standing beside his election opponent and an unstable Washington monument, speaking behind a podium on the campaign trail and at his inauguration."" Time has featured Trump on its covers in unflattering ways. But he hasn’t been on a cover with the text ""Worst. President. Ever."" That’s a made-up claim making the rounds on Facebook.

Fired CNN 'Journalist of the Year' recipient was not Jim Acosta, or any other CNN reporter
","A Facebook post is trying to trick you into a click by placing the headline ""CNN Journalist Of The Year Fired For Creating Fake News Stories"" next to an image of CNN's Jim Acosta. Don't do it. The person fired wasn't Acosta, CNN's White House correspondent who made waves in November after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump.

Der Spiegel said Relotius confessed he had made up material in at least 14 articles since 2011. In 2014, CNN named Relotius the Journalist of the Year and Print Journalist of the Year. The awards were for German-language journalism and decided by an independent jury. The last awards were given in 2015, CNN reported.  In a statement to the Associated Press, CNN International said the independent panel of judges who awarded Relotius the awards decided unanimously to remove them following revelations about his fraud.

Meme mischaracterizes Chuck Schumer's record on border security funding
","A meme gaining traction on social media claims Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., supported a border wall deal during Barack Obama’s presidency but then flip-flopped once President Donald Trump took the White House. The post contains a photo of Schumer and a mock first-person confession revealing the Senate minority leader’s partisan reason for the apparent policy pivot. ""In 2014, I helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall,"" reads the post from a group called The Right View Of Washington State. ""Now, Trump wants $5 billion for a border wall. Well I’m gonna b----, cry, piss and moan just because he’s a Republican and wants it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The meme is swimming in factual errors and fishy interpretations. The post says Schumer helped put together a border wall deal in 2014. That’s wrong — there was no border barrier deal that year. It’s possible the creator of the post was thinking of a 2013 proposal that Schumer shepherded through the Senate. But characterizing the 2013 legislation as a $25 billion deal to fund a ""border wall"" runs into factual hurdles. That proposal, a comprehensive immigration plan Schumer sponsored and voted for, cleared the Senate in 2013. But the Republican-controlled House did not take up that bill after that. (It’s worth noting that presidents, not lawmakers, as the meme suggests, sign bills into law.) The package included more than $46 billion for border security. The vast majority of that money ($30 billion) was for hiring more U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. Around $8 billion would have gone toward building or repairing 700 miles of fencing (including some double-layer fencing) along the U.S.-Mexico border. That’s not $25 billion for a wall, as the meme claimed. It would be a stretch to say the fencing Schumer supported in 2013 fits the same description as Trump’s ""impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall,"" with ""precasts going up probably 35 to 40 feet in the air."" Schumer’s office insisted a border fence is very different from Trump’s promised wall. The senator’s office pointed us to a Trump tweet from the election when then-candidate Trump scolded his opponent Jeb Bush for conflating the two. ""Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ‘fence.’ "" Trump tweeted. ""It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!"" Daniel Yoken, a Schumer spokesman, said, ""Sen. Schumer supported fencing where it makes sense then and still does today."" Schumer has also argued that border security isn’t limited to a wall, and that there are other, more effective ways to secure the border. The meme claims Schumer opposes a wall ""just because"" Trump is a Republican. One more point to clarify: Schumer in January 2018 said he offered to back funding for Trump’s border wall in exchange for a broader immigration package that included a deal for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants living in the country illegally. Schumer reportedly made a $25 billion offer for the wall during a private meeting with Trump, as lawmakers negotiated a way to avert a government shutdown. Schumer rescinded his offer just a few days after making it, saying it was off the table because Trump rejected the broader immigration package. The New York Times reported that while the White House refused to acknowledge that Schumer made the wall offer, Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle confirmed it. An offer on behalf of Schumer’s part to fund a border wall undermines the meme’s notion that he’s automatically ruled out the wall simply because Trump wants it. The Facebook post says Schumer in 2014 ""helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall"" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall ""just because he's a Republican."" There are numerous factual errors here: there was no border barrier deal in 2014. A 2013 legislative package proposed $8 billion for border fencing — not $25 billion for a border wall. More importantly, the border fencing Schumer backed in 2013 is different than how Trump has described his border wall. And the meme glosses over Schumer’s previous support for border wall funding earlier this year, in exchange for protections for Dreamers. We rate this post False.

No, three Muslim congresswomen did not 'refuse' to take the oath - the ceremony hasn't happened yet
","Supporting the U.S. Constitution and its amendments is probably the most agreed upon tenet in politics today, though politicians commonly accuse one another of trying to undermine the text. Now, a viral meme is going around social media that says if incoming politicians refuse to sign the oath to uphold the Constitution, ""they should not be allowed to serve."" It then goes on to claim that ""three Muslim congresswomen just refused"" to do so. In just one day, the inflammatory post garnered over 70 comments and has been shared more than 3,000 times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The full meme: ""If you refused to sign an oath of office to uphold the U.S. Constitution, as every other holder of that office is required to do, you should not be allowed to serve … Three Muslim congresswomen just refused."" There are two problems with this claim. First, at the start of each new Congress, all members beginning a new term of office are actually required to take an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution. So, they can’t refuse. Second, no members could have refused because the swearing-in ceremony (when the oath is taken) hasn’t happened yet. In the federal government, in order for an official to take office, he or she must first take the oath of office, which is also known as the swearing-in ceremony. Article VI of the Constitution ""requires all representatives, senators, executive officers, judicial officers, and state legislatures to affirm support for the Constitution,"" according to the 1789 Oath of Office bill brought forth by the First Congress.   Oaths are taken in all three branches of government, including the president, vice president, Congress members and Supreme Court justices. The wording has changed throughout the years, but the version used today hasn’t been altered since 1966, and is prescribed in Title 5, Section 3331 of the United States Code. It reads: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."" Today, members of Congress take the oath to uphold the Constitution en-masse in a public, group swearing-in ceremony on the opening day of a new Congress. The ceremony consists of members raising their right hands and repeating the oath. No religious texts are used (as specified in the Constitution). Some members pose for photos individually following the official swearing-in and hold private ceremonies. Since the 80th Congress, (1947-49) members have also been required to sign an oath. The 116th U.S. Congress is set to convene on Jan. 3, 2019, and representatives and senators take their oath during the first day of a new Congress. Since the swearing-in has yet to take place, no members would have been able to refuse to take or sign the oath of office, as the meme implies. Looking for one more reason that this claim is a hoax? There will not be three Muslim women serving in Congress in 2019, like the post claimed. There will be two. Michigan elected Rashida Tlaib, and Minnesota elected Ilhan Omar. They will be the first to Muslim women to serve in Congress. A popular meme says politicians shouldn’t be allowed to serve if they refuse to take an oath of office and that ""three Muslim congresswomen refused."" Each new member of Congress, along with the president, vice president and Supreme Court justices, are required to take the oath of office when they are sworn in, as written in the U.S. Constitution. The 116th Congress will convene after the holiday break, on Jan. 3, 2019, which is when incoming representatives and senators will take their oath – so no member could have refused yet.

Fact-checking meme about costs for Mueller investigation, Trump golfing, Benghazi, GOP tax bill
","A Facebook post claims to offer a cost comparison on different matters of national interest: the special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, the Benghazi probe, President Donald Trump’s golf outings, and the fiscal impact of the Republican tax law. The clear goal of the meme, based on the items and costs associated, is to discredit Republicans and Trump. Here’s the cost breakdown, according to the meme posted on Facebook Dec. 9: ""Cost of Mueller’s investigation: $3,200,000 Benghazi ‘investigation’: $7,000,000 Trump’s golfing trips: $83,000,000 New debt from Republican tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000"" The meme adds: ""Dear Republicans, please spare us your selective outrage about the cost of the Trump-Russia investigation."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The meme includes accurate information, but leaves out critical facts and details. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections and whether Trump’s campaign supported those efforts. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. It’s unclear when the meme began circulating, but it was shared on Facebook as recently as Dec. 9, 2018. The investigation’s first spending report came in December 2017 and showed that from May 2017 through the end of September 2017, Mueller’s office incurred $3.2 million in direct spending, and $3.5 million in indirect spending, totaling $6.7 million. If the meme relied only on that report, then it omitted from its tally indirect spending costs. Also, the spending didn’t stop there. Mueller’s office released additional spending reports in May 2018 and again in December 2018. The latest information released Dec. 14 shows that since the investigation started in May 2017 through Sept. 30, 2018, direct spending reached $12.3 million and indirect spending $12.9 million, totaling $25.2 million. That’s notably higher than the $3.2 million claimed by the meme. Lawmakers in May 2014 began investigating the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead. Led mostly by Republicans, critics saw the congressional investigations as a political move against Hillary Clinton, who served as secretary of state when the attack happened. The investigations concluded in 2016, costing about $7 million. The investigations did not suggest that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the attack. This claim in the meme is more in line with the facts than the claim about the Mueller probe. Trump routinely criticized his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the time he spent golfing. Trump as president has been a regular on the golf course, and that has motivated observers to track his trips to the golf course. (We have our own Trump golf tracker.) The meme’s source for $83 million is unclear. But Sophie Germain, self-described as a data junkie, runs the website trumpgolfcount.com, which updates its tally after Trump visits ""a location whose primary offering is golf (i.e., a ‘golf club’)."" The site relies on White House press pool reports. According to trumpgolfcount.com, Trump has made 154 daytime visits to golf clubs since his inauguration, ""with evidence of playing golf on at least 70 visits,"" and that has cost taxpayers $84 million. (The site’s last recorded outing was Nov. 25, 2018.) It says its cost estimates are based on: • Flights to Trump properties; • Coast Guard protection for Mar-a-Lago (a Trump property in Florida); • Trump's stay at his club and rental of luxury vehicles in Turnberry, Scotland, in July 2018; and • ""An additional $6.4 million per year, prorated per day at a rate based on money reimbursed so far, allocated to Palm Beach and Bedminster for ‘extraordinary law enforcement personnel costs’."" While the site has been cited by multiple outlets, our fact-checking friends at the Washington Post found that some of its estimates, particularly the cost of Air Force One flights, may be too high. The Washington Post Fact Checker also questioned whether it’s fair to attribute all costs of presidential travel and support to a golf outing, since that logistical support follows the president wherever he goes. The Washington Post’s July 2018 fact-check also cautioned against the site’s then-use of a precise dollar figure for the cost of Trump’s golf outings, since it’s not known exactly how many times Trump has golfed or the precise costs. Trumpgolfcount.com addressed the fact-check on its website, saying: ""At the time his article was published, our cost estimate was $72,251,706, but (Washington Post’s Glenn) Kessler correctly pointed out that since our estimates have a great deal of uncertainty, they shouldn't be stated to the exact dollar. We've updated our site accordingly, and our total cost is now rounded to the nearest million."" The meme suggests that it’s known how much Trump’s golfing trips cost, but that figure is uncertain. President Donald Trump in December 2017 signed into law a new tax bill that included significant tax cuts for corporations as well as temporary tax cuts for individuals. The changes in the tax law are projected to increase the federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The deficit is the difference between annual government spending and government revenue. Debt is the total amount the government owes. We rated as False a claim by Larry Kudlow, top economic adviser to President Donald Trump, that ""the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP."" A Facebook meme says, ""Cost of Mueller’s investigation: $3,200,000; Benghazi ""investigation"": $7,000,000; Trump’s golfing trips: $83,000,000; New debt from Republican tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000.""

No evidence FBI officials' texts deliberately erased, as Donald Trump said
","President Donald Trump, seeking to discredit the investigation into whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia, claimed without evidence that thousands of text messages exchanged between former FBI officials were deliberately erased. Trump also said the text messages, between former agent Peter Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page, would have exposed Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe as a hoax, had they not been ""purposely and illegally deleted.""   Here is Trump’s tweet: ""Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely & illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!""  Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely & illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest! There are some major factual problems with Trump’s claim, we found. First, a new report from the Justice Department’s internal watchdog suggests the roughly 19,000 messages slipped through the cracks due to technical glitches with the FBI’s data-collection tool on Samsung devices, not because Strzok and Page went around the system. Second, perhaps most importantly, while the messages were initially not captured, they have since been recovered. Trump’s claim gives the false impression the texts are still unaccounted. In fact, at least a portion of the recovered texts were given to Congress and described in press reports. Some messages between Strzok and Page were published by the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General in a June 2018 report. The inspector general was unable to recover text messages Strzok and Page may have sent using iPhones they were given when they joined Mueller’s team. But a special counsel official who reviewed Strzok’s iPhone before it was reset found it contained no substantive messages. There is no evidence the text messages show the special counsel investigation is a ""hoax."" We reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back Following the 2016 election, the Justice Department’s internal watchdog looked into whether the FBI followed protocol when it investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. It published its findings in a June 2018 report. As part of its inquiry, the Office of Inspector General collected texts exchanged between Strzok and Page, some of which showed hostility toward Trump and a preference for Clinton. (Strzok was later fired from from the FBI and Page has since left.) The inspector general discovered a five-month gap in the Strzok-Page communications, from mid-December 2016 through mid-May 2017. This prompted the inspector general to conduct a follow-on report to supplement its June 2018 findings. The follow-on report, which further described the inspector general’s forensic efforts to recover the missing Strzok-Page texts, was released Dec. 13. The inspector general found no evidence Strzok and Page tried to prevent the FBI from collecting their texts. The watchdog’s findings suggest the most likely reason the texts weren’t captured had to do with technical flaws in the FBI’s data-collection process, not deliberate wrongdoing. It concluded: ""The OIG investigation determined that the FBl's collection tool was not only failing to collect any data on certain phones during particular periods of time, it also does not appear that it was collecting all text messages even when it was generally functioning to collect text messages."" FBI tech specialists cited a number of possible explanations for the text-collection breakdown, from a 2016 software bug, to misconfiguration during the phone’s setup to a range of possible hardware errors, according to the inspector general report. The collection tool had an estimated failure rate of 20 percent when used with FBI-issued Samsung S5 mobile devices. Both Strzok and Page used the S5 model during the five-month gap, the report found. Only later in mid-2017 were they issued S7 models ""as part of a regular technical refresh and to address issues with the FBl’s text message collection tool,"" according to the inspector general. An outside expert hired by the inspector general to assist with the Samsung portion of the investigation concluded ""it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities,"" and the watchdog found no evidence they did. The inspector general also found the ""content of the text messages did not appear to be a factor"" in the retention practices of Strzok and Page. Separately from their Samsung devices, the two officials were issued Apple iPhones when they began working as members of the special counsel investigation. By the time the inspector general obtained their Apple phones, they had been reset to factory settings so they could be reassigned, and contained no data related to the previous owner’s use, the report states. The special counsel records officer told the inspector general that she reviewed Strzok's DOJ-issued iPhone after he returned it to the special counsel ""and determined it contained no substantive text messages."" (Upon her departure from the FBI, Page left her iPhone in her office, rather than return it to the special counsel records officer.) Trump’s tweet seems to suggest the Strzok-Page texts are gone forever — hence why Trump laments that they ""would have"" exonerated him. But this overlooks the fact that the inspector general managed to recover thousands of messages that were initially not collected because of the technical snafu described above. ""OIG digital forensic examiners used forensic tools to recover thousands of text messages"" from the Samsung S5 devices of Strzok and Page, the report notes. Forensic experts recovered more than 9,300 texts sent or received from Strzok's S5 phone, about 8,300 of which were sent to or received from Page. They also collected 10,760 texts from Page’s S5 device, about 9,700 of which were communications with Strzok. It’s impossible to say with precision how many unique texts were recovered. That’s because some are duplicates, and because the inspector general nabbed some message fragments that did not have an associated date or time, and these were not included in the inspector general’s calculation. They also recovered texts from a separate database which added marginally to the overall number of texts the inspector general recovered. Trump’s reference to 19,000 texts appears to be the result of adding the total texts recovered from Strzok’s and Page’s S5 phones together. But his suggestion that the messages are permanently lost is wrong. The OIG recovered a total of more than 126,000 lines of text from Strzok and Page. At least a portion of the recovered texts were given to Congress and described in press reports. Some messages between Strzok and Page were published in the inspector general’s June 2018 report on the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation. Trump said 19,000 text messages exchanged between former FBI officials that were ""purposely and illegally deleted ... would have explained (the special counsel investigation) hoax."" The Justice Department inspector general’s report suggests the texts slipped through the cracks due to technical glitches with the FBI’s data-collection tool, not because Strzok and Page deliberately deleted them. An outside expert hired by the inspector general concluded ""it was unlikely that Strzok and Page attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities,"" and the watchdog found no evidence they did. Trump’s suggestion that the messages are permanently lost is wrong. The OIG recovered more than 19,000 messages from the government-issued Samsung phones of Strzok and Page, totaling more than 126,000 lines of text. And lastly, there is no evidence the texts show that the special counsel investigation is, as Trump called it, a ""hoax."" We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

The quote comes in varying versions, with some words replacing others. It has been long attributed to economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who passed away in April 2006. It has also more recently been connected to another economist, Russell Roberts, who has used it during events and also in his book. The original version of the phrase: ""Under capitalism man exploits man. Under socialism it’s just the opposite."" In some cases, the word socialism is swapped for communism, mostly when Galbraith is cited as the speaker. It has also been described as an ""old Soviet joke,"" here, and according to Snopes, was listed as a ""wry Russian joke"" in Jules Archer’s 1977 book Police State: Could It Happen Here? The book was published 12 years before Ocasio-Cortez was born. A viral graphic being spread on social media claims that Ocasio-Cortez said ""under capitalism, man oppresses man. Under socialism, it’s the other way around."" The phrase itself is a version of an old quote that is meant to disparage socialism or communism. Ocasio-Cortez, who calls herself a democratic socialist, never said those words. We rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2018/dec/18/blog-posting/meme-mocks-ocasio-cortez-repeating-quote-disparagi/
"['State Budget', 'California', 'Jerry Brown']","
Does California have a budget surplus of nearly ‘$30 billion,’ as Gov. Jerry Brown claimed?
","Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s has received wide praise for his ability to manage California’s fiscal health. Brown inherited a $27 billion budget deficit when he started his most recent two terms as governor in 2011. Early on, he sharply reduced spending, spearheaded voter-approved tax increases and benefitted from a resurgent economy. Next month, he’ll leave office with a sizeable surplus. But just how large is that pot of excess money? Brown claimed in a recent interview on NPR that it’s ""closer to $30 billion,"" after the interviewer cited a figure of $14 billion. Here’s the full exchange: NPR: ""Today there is a surplus, with a $14 billion rainy day fund. How much of that do you think was only possible because you had big majorities of your own party?"" Brown: ""By the way we not only have a $14 billion surplus — a rainy day fund that's locked in for uncertain times in the future — we have a $15 billion spendable deficit right now, and that deficit surplus. So yeah, there's a lot of money. We're talking closer to $30 billion."" Was Brown correct? Does California really have that much extra cash? We set out on a fact check. Our research Asked about the statement, a spokesman for Brown’s Department of Finance pointed to a November report by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. It forecasts the state’s finances for the upcoming fiscal year, which starts July 1, 2019. That report, The 2019-20 Budget California's Fiscal Outlook, projects the state’s ‘Rainy Day’ reserve fund will reach $14.5 billion by the end of the next fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2020. The Brown Administration estimates that fund will hit $13.8 billion at the end of the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2019. In addition to the Rainy Day money, the LAO report anticipates the state will have $14.8 billion of ""discretionary surplus,"" said Ann Hollingshead, a senior fiscal and policy analyst at the LAO. ""That is money that is freely available for the Legislature to allocate. So, either on spending increases or tax reductions,"" she said. Altogether, those amounts would reach $29.3 billion, or ""closer to $30 billion,"" as the governor stated. Hollingshead said the governor’s statement was a fair representation of the LAO estimates. Experts weigh in We asked two additional government finance experts to assess the LAO report and the governor’s claim. They said Brown’s statement about a $30 billion surplus was generally correct. They noted, however, there are limits on how the different funds can be used and that the state’s surplus is expected to be dramatically smaller in future years due to predictions of an eventual economic slowdown. Looking at the Rainy Day fund, it can only be spent in a fiscal emergency. It was created after voters approved Proposition 2 in 2014. ""I think if somebody hears $30 billion, they may think, ‘Oh, that’s available to spend.’ It’s actually not all available to spend on Legislative priorities or policy priorities,"" said Leonor Ehling, executive director of the Center for California Studies at Sacramento State, who previously worked for the State Assembly Budget Committee. Brown, in his exchange with NPR, provided some context about the Rainy Day fund, describing it as money ""locked in for uncertain times in the future."" Michael Genest, who served as Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s director of finance, also reviewed Brown’s claim. ""Yes, I think it's fair to say that there is about $30 billion between the actual reserve and the forecast of excess of revenues over spending,"" Genest said in an email. ""Note, however, that the LAO shows that a recession would wipe out those reserves pretty quickly."" Hollingshead, the LAO analyst, agreed. The $14.8 billion in discretionary spending is ""an amount that’s available on a one-time basis. So, it’s really only available for the 2019-20 process,"" she said. That figure is expected to shrink to about $3 billion in future fiscal years, Hollingshead added. ""In the coming years, the budget will face challenges,"" the LAO report states.
""The most significant risk to our outlook is the economy, which could slow and result in billions of dollars in revenue losses annually. Decisions outside of the Legislature’s control, for example by the federal government or state retirement systems, also can affect the state budget. The $15 billion surplus we anticipate for 2019‑20 gives the Legislature a unique opportunity to prepare for these foreseen—and other unforeseen—challenges still to come."" The next forecast for the state’s finances will be published in January 2019, after Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is sworn into office and releases his budget. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown in claimed in an interview with NPR that California’s budget surplus is ""closer to $30 billion."" A report by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office projects the state will have $14.5 billion in its Rainy Day reserve fund by the end of the next fiscal year. That would be an increase over the $13.8 billion the state expects to have in that fund when the next fiscal year starts July 1, 2019. The report also estimates the Legislature will have $14.8 billion in discretionary funds during the same time period. Brown’s description of a surplus ""closer to $30 billion"" is generally correct, though he leaves out the fact that this is a projection. Government finance experts pointed out there are restrictions on the Rainy Day money, a fact Brown clarified in the interview. They also note that California’s surplus is expected to dwindle in coming years, with an economic slowdown predicted. We found Brown’s statement was accurate but needs a couple clarifications, most notably that the ""$30 billion"" figure is a projection, not a certainty. We rate Brown’s statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",/factchecks/2018/dec/18/jerry-brown/does-california-have-budget-surplus-nearly-30-bill/

NC Democrat: trust in US elections at an 'all-time low'
","Come January, it’s possible that North Carolina will fill only 12 of its 13 seats in Congress because of one election that’s under suspicion. North Carolina’s elections board is investigating voting irregularities in the 9th Congressional District, where Republican Mark Harris appeared to beat Democrat Dan McCready on election night. However, the board has refused to certify Harris’ win because it discovered unusual voting patterns among mail-in absentee ballots. Under state law, the board can order a new election if ""irregularities or improprieties occurred to such an extent that they taint the results of the entire election and cast doubt on its fairness."" Meanwhile, legislators recently crafted a voter ID bill in response to a November referendum on the idea. Critics of the bill, including Democratic state Sen. Dan Blue, have called on their peers to delay its advancement until the District 9 investigation has concluded. Cooper vetoed the bill on Dec. 14, but the GOP-led legislature is expected to override his veto later this year. ""Public trust in our election system is at an all-time low,"" Blue, of Raleigh, tweeted on Dec. 6. The ""#ncga needs to take the first steps in restoring public trust and delay further changes to voting requirements or to the NC Bd. of Elections until investigation complete and remedy is ordered."" Is it true that trust in our election system is at an all-time low? Overall, there isn’t much national data to compare trust in elections over time, and various polls or studies have framed the question in different ways. There’s no data specific to North Carolina, according to David McLennan, director of the Meredith College Poll, and Jason Husser, director of the Elon University Poll. But a pair of national polls stand out for their consistency, and neither points to 2018 as the low point of election confidence. Confidence up? One key source of historical data is Gallup, which has poll data on election confidence dating back to 2004. Gallup’s most recent poll, when it surveyed 1,011 adults in October, found that 70 percent of Americans were ""very or somewhat confident"" votes would be accurately cast and counted in this year’s midterm elections. Those results are slightly higher than Gallup’s 2016 results, as well as the poll’s historical average of 68 percent confidence. This year’s results were also 11 percentage points higher than in 2008, the low point of election confidence collected by Gallup. Even in Blue’s political party, Gallup found that confidence in elections wasn’t particularly low this fall. Since 2004, Gallup has found that Americans of the same political party that occupies the White House are more confident in election accuracy than the opposing political party. That’s true this year, too. However, about 66 percent of Democratic Gallup respondents expressed confidence in this year’s elections — that’s down from 2016 but still higher than confidence rates in the 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections. Gallup’s polls were conducted prior to elections, as many polls are because the results sometimes help predict voter turnout or enthusiasm. Blue’s tweet came roughly a month after the midterm elections in a state where one congressional contest remains undecided and three legislative races qualified for recounts. But PolitiFact has struggled to find any post-election polling on voters’ faith in the election results. New numbers The best data we could find comes from Charles Stewart III, a distinguished professor of political science at MIT and member of its Election Data and Science Lab. Stewart reviewed pre-and-post election survey responses for the 2014, 2016 and 2018 elections. The 2014 and 2016 data was drawn from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, while Stewart said he compiled this year’s data himself. The 2014 study had 1,000 respondents, 2016 had 1,500 and the two 2018 studies had 1,000 respondents apiece, Stewart said. The poll question was: ""How confident are you that your vote will be/was counted as intended in the most recent election?"" Responses to that question — both pre-election and post-election — were higher in 2018 than in previous years. The low point for pre-election and post election polls occurred in 2014, according to charts provided by Stewart. ""As you can see, measured this way, we’re certainly not at a low point in 2018,"" Stewart wrote in an email. Respondents in 2018 were 84.3 percent confident pre-election and post election. By contrast, voters were only 50 percent confident before the 2014 election, 56 percent confident after the 2014 election and only 59 percent confident after the 2016 election. ""I think it’s fair to say that when you ask people what they think about the accuracy of vote counting nationwide, (which is a good proxy for how people feel about election administration), confidence is lower now than in 2000, when we started asking these questions,"" Stewart said. ""However, when you ask people about confidence in counting their own votes, the overall numbers have been pretty stable for nearly 20 years."" Incomplete data Some studies suggest waning voter confidence. But they aren’t up-to-date or don’t address faith in elections, specifically. For example, Stewart’s work was included in a recently published study by the Democracy Fund, ""Understanding the Voter Experience: The public’s view of election administration and reform,"" authored by elections researcher Natalie Adona and Reed College professor Paul Gronke.* That study found that, between 2000 and 2012, voters gradually lost confidence that their ballot would be counted. The Democracy Fund report only includes data up to 2016. Data for 2018 should be available soon, Adona told PolitiFact in an email. She summarized existing data this way: ""The public’s confidence in vote counts remains high with respect to their own ballots,"" Adona said. ""However, people express less confidence when it comes to vote counts across the nation. Since the 2000 election — when the voter confidence question started being asked regularly on surveys—voter confidence in national vote counts has decreased, while confidence in one’s own vote being counted remains steady."" Lauren Prather, an assistant professor at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, conducted her own study after this year’s November election that asked Americans to rate their trust in the midterm election results on a scale from 0-10 where 0 meant no trust at all and 10 meant absolute trust. The average for her sample of about 1300 Americans was 7, she said, down from 8 in 2016. She also cited a Gallup World Poll of ""Anglo-American"" democracies, which found that the percentage of Americans who believe elections are ""honest"" fell from 52 percent in 2006 to 30 percent in 2016. Trends suggest a drop in confidence since 2006, Prather said in a phone interview. Asked about Blue’s claim, she said ""I’m not confident that we have data that supports that."" What Blue said Blue’s office, when contacted by PolitiFact, referenced national polls by NPR/Marist and Pew Research. The NPR poll of 949 adults, conducted in September, found that 47 percent of respondents said they think it’s ""likely or very likely"" that some votes wouldn’t be counted in the November elections. Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, described the results as a"" pretty lousy report card on the state of American elections."" But Marist didn’t have data to compare this year’s results to that of previous years, or address voters’ overall confidence in the election system. The Pew Research Study, published in December 2017, found that trust in government reached ""near-historic"" lows. While the public’s trust in government may offer insights into its level of trust in elections, the subjects aren’t synonymous. Research published in the Election Law Journal in 2015, ""Voter Confidence: How to measure it and how it differs from government support,"" found that voter confidence in elections doesn’t necessarily track with confidence in government. ""Voters are often trusting of elections, but distrustful of government,"" researchers Lonna Rae Atkeson, R. Michael Alvarez and Thad E. Hall wrote in their abstract. Another Pew survey, published Oct. 29, found that 89 percent of American surveyed believed poll workers would do a ""good job"" in the midterm elections. Only 45 percent were ""very or somewhat confident"" that election systems are secure from hacking. However, it’s unclear how those responses compare to previous years. Pew hasn’t consistently asked voters about their views on elections through the years, according to spokeswoman Haley Nolen. ""So we don’t have trend data for comparison,"" she said. Our ruling Blue claimed that ""public trust in our election system is at an all-time low."" That claim is largely undermined by the lack of historical data. Some studies suggest declining confidence, but those are incomplete or outdated. And some of the strongest, most recent data doesn’t support Blue’s tweet. We rate his claim False.

No, Donald Trump did not call Republican voters dumb in the 1990s
","Donald Trump has made plenty of questionable claims over the years, but calling Republican voters dumb isn’t one of them. Still, one political meme continues to spread across social media sites and claims he said just that. The story goes that in a 1998 interview with People Magazine, Donald Trump said he was considering a run for president and would do so as a Republican because ""They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The meme features a repurposed image of a younger Trump, with the quote billed as a statement he delivered in an interview with the magazine. So did Donald Trump actually say that – or anything like it? No, the quote is bogus. The fabricated quote appeared on social media sites in October 2015, when Trump’s campaign started to gain steam. The meme has continually resurfaced over the years, though it has repeatedly been debunked. We searched People’s archives, which date back to the 1970s, and found no Trump interviews in 1998 – or any other time – that feature that quote or anything resembling it. Most of the magazine’s articles at the time that involved Trump discussed his celebrity and high-profile divorce from Marla Maples. People also issued a statement rebuking the quote’s authenticity.

For example, in a 1988 episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump said he would probably never run for president, but wouldn’t rule it out completely. The image used in the meme is from that interview: On Sept. 30, 1999, Trump wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal and said he was considering a presidential run, and sounded as if he would do so as an independent. ""Unlike candidates from the two major parties, my candidacy would not represent an exercise in career advancement ... The Republicans are captives of their right wing. The Democrats are captives of their left wing. I don’t hear anyone speaking for the working men and women in the center."" Just a few days later, on Oct. 8, 1999, Trump appeared on CNN’s Larry King Live and said he formed a committee to explore a presidential run and that he was a registered Republican. A meme claims Donald Trump said in an interview 20 years ago that if he ever ran for president, he would do so as a Republican because they were ""the dumbest group of voters in the country"" and ""they believe anything on Fox News."" While Trump flirted with the idea of a presidential run in a few interviews in the late 1990s, there is no record of Trump saying this quote in People, or in any other publication.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Bart Stupak']","
Stupak says every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management plan would have to to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards abortion
","With abortion as one of the biggest remaining stumbling blocks in the health care reform push, Rep. Bart Stupak has been in high demand on political talk shows. An antiabortion Democrat from Michigan, Stupak says he and at least 11 other House Democrats would vote against the Senate language on abortion, which he says would allow federal funding for abortions. His biggest issue is in the proposed government-created health exchange (for people who do not get their insurance through their employer), government subsidies could go to people who choose plans that cover abortions. But Stupak has repeatedly raised another point as well. ""The bill that they're using as the vehicle is the Senate bill, and if you go to page 2,069 through page 2,078, you will find in there the federal government would directly subsidize abortions, plus every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management enrolled plan, every enrollee has to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards reproductive rights, which includes abortions,"" Stupak said in a Good Morning America interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on March 4, 2010. Stupak made similar statements in a Politico article on March 4 as well as in an interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews on March 3. The Senate language on abortion was written by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who is an abortion opponent. While the language Stupak penned for the House version would prohibit insurance companies in the exchange from offering abortion services, Nelson's plan would allow companies to offer abortion services. But Nelson sought to ensure those services would be paid through patient premiums, not federal subsidies. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill requires that all enrollees in plans that offer abortion services ""without regard to the enrollee’s age, sex, or family status"" pay a separate amount to cover the actuarial value of abortion services for the entire population covered by the plan. The insurer ""may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee, per month."" So that's where Stupak gets his $1 a month figure. This is not necessarily an add-on cost. Many health insurance experts quietly acknowledge what Slate's Timothy Noah referred to as the ""gruesome reality"" that it actually costs insurance companies less to pay for abortions than it does to pay for prenatal care and delivery. But the Senate bill specifically states that the actuarial estimate ""may not take into account any cost reduction estimated to result from such services, including prenatal care, delivery, or postnatal care."" So the set-aside for abortions is at least $1, regardless of whether it costs less than a dollar, or whether it actually saves insurance companies money. In other words, this $1 a month is not really over and above what someone would pay for their insurance otherwise. It's a mechanism to segregate a pot of money from insurance premiums (rather than federal subsidies) that would pay for abortions. But Stupak didn't say the $1 a month was an additional cost, only that it would go ""towards"" abortion services. And that's correct. But Stupak errs when he says that ""every enrollee"" would have to pay the $1 a month. That extra dollar would be separated out only for people who select a plan that offers abortion services. Someone could just as easily choose a plan that does not cover abortions. In fact, the Senate bill requires that ""with respect to multi-State qualified health plans offered in an Exchange, there is at least one such plan that does not provide coverage of (abortion) services."" In other words, if you don't want to participate in a health plan that offers abortion, and for which you'll have to pay into an account specifically for abortions, you don't have to. We further note that the Senate bill also says that a state ""may elect to prohibit abortion coverage in qualified health plans offered through an Exchange in such State if such State enacts a law to provide for such prohibition."" So it's not required for states to offer plans in the exchange that cover abortions; but if they do have plans that offer abortion, they must also offer plans that do not. Lara Cartwright-Smith of George Washington University's public health school explains: ""The legislative language he's referring to is about how the government determines the value of abortion coverage for plans offered through the Exchange to ensure that federal money is not used to pay for that coverage,"" Cartwright-Smith said. ""This section does not apply to people who are covered outside of the Exchange, such as through an employer’s health benefit plan. Everyone buying insurance through the Exchange will have the option to enroll in a plan that does not include abortion. Those people will not pay any amount for abortion coverage and no federal funds for that plan will have to be segregated. ""If, and only if, an enrollee selects an insurance plan that includes abortion coverage, then the value of that abortion coverage must be calculated and that amount must be segregated from the value of the rest of the benefits of that plan, so that the enrollee can pay for the abortion coverage separately with their own private money. The calculated value of the abortion coverage must be at least $1. This process is to ensure that federal funds aren’t used to pay for abortion coverage. These rules only apply to plans in the Exchange that include abortion coverage, so people who select a plan that does not include abortion will not have to pay for abortion coverage even if other plans in the Exchange do offer it."" It's also important to note, she said, that these rules are about abortions for which federal funding is not allowed, such as elective abortions. Abortions for which federal funding is allowed, such as in cases of rape, incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother, may be covered by any plan in the exchange. We called Stupak's office, and they provided a statement from the congressman essentially acknowledging that his statement only refers to people who opt for a plan that covers abortions. But he warned that many people will be unaware that a portion of their premium would be earmarked for abortion. Stupak is correct that people who select a plan that covers abortions would have at least $1 a month of their premiums set aside for a fund that would pay for abortions performed for people in that plan. And everyone in that plan, even men, would have to pay into that account. But Stupak misspoke when he said, repeatedly, that ""every enrollee"" would have to pay into an account that would pay for abortions. In fact, the issue doesn't apply at all to people who choose a plan that does not cover abortion. And every state must offer a plan that does not offer abortion. Furthermore, people would have to be told up front if the plan they are considering covers abortions. So when Stupak says that ""every"" person would need to set aside this abortion money, it's not only wrong, we think it stokes misplaced outrage on an already highly charged issue. We rule Stupak's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/11/bart-stupak/stupak-says-every-enrollee-office-personnel-manage/

Will says that 95 percent of people with health insurance are satisfied with it
","As the debate over health care reform moves slowly toward a climax, Republicans and other critics have argued that the public has made clear its opposition to the Democratic approach.

On the Feb. 21, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, conservative columnist George Will -- a critic of the plan backed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats -- cited poll figures about Americans' satisfaction with their own health coverage.

""When we started this health care debate a year ago, 85 percent of the American people had health insurance, and 95 percent of the 85 percent were happy with it,"" Will said during the show's roundtable discussion. ""So there was no underlying discontent that you now postulate to drive this radical change.""

We thought it would be worth checking whether Americans are really so enthusiastic about their health coverage.

First, we'll dispatch with Will's claim that 85 percent of Americans had health insurance. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the leading arbiter of the number of uninsured Americans, Will is exactly on the mark. In the last Census Bureau study, 255.1 million Americans had health insurance in 2008, while 46.3 million did not. That's 84.6 percent, or rounding up, 85 percent -- just as Will said.

Now, for the polling data.

We were able to find eight surveys taken in 2008 and 2009 that asked Americans whether they were satisfied with their health coverage. We ruled out poll questions that asked about satisfaction with the costs of health care, which we decided goes beyond the scope of Will's comment. To conform with Will's formulation, we also ruled out polls that questioned people who lack insurance in addition to those who have it. Our two-year search period covers a longer time than Will's phrasing of ""a year ago,"" but doing so provides us with a much wider sampling of polls to choose from.

Typically, the polls we located offered their respondents four or five possible choices. Most common was ""very satisfied,"" ""somewhat satisfied,"" ""somewhat dissatisfied,"" or ""very dissatisfied."" One poll, sponsored by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, added another category: ""extremely satisfied.""

To determine whether respondents of a given poll were ""happy"" with their health insurance -- as Will phrased it -- we lumped together the percentages for ""very satisfied,"" ""somewhat satisfied"" and, where applicable, ""extremely satisfied.""

Here's what we found, poll by poll, in reverse chronological order:

• Quinnipiac University, Sept. 2009. ""How satisfied are you with your health insurance plan?"" 54 percent very satisfied, 34 percent somewhat. Total: 88 percent satisfaction.
    
• Quinnipiac University, June 2009. ""How satisfied are you with your health insurance plan?"" 49 percent very satisfied, 36 somewhat satisfied. Total: 85 percent satisfaction.

• ABC News/Washington Post, June 2009. ""For each specific item I name, please tell me whether you are very satisfied with it, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. ... Your health insurance coverage."" 42 percent very satisfied, 39 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 81 percent satisfaction.

• Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, May 2009. ""Overall, how satisfied are you with your current health insurance plan?"" 21 percent extremely satisfied, 37 percent very satisfied, 30 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 88 percent satisfaction.

• ABC News/Washington Post, June 2009. ""For each specific item I name, please tell me whether you are very satisfied with it, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. ... Your health insurance coverage."" 42 percent very satisfied, 39 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 81 percent satisfaction.

If you average these eight scores, the total rate of satisfaction is 87 percent. In all but one poll, the satisfaction level was below Will's stated level of 95 percent.

One poll, taken five months before Obama was inaugurated, did come up with 95 percent satisfaction. But alone among these eight polls, that survey asked participants about the ""quality of health care I receive through my (health insurance) plan."" While we decided that the wording was close enough to merit inclusion on our list, the modest difference in satisfaction levels may stem from the way the question was phrased. Many people feel more warmly toward their doctors than they do toward their insurers.

So, while one poll with unique wording pegged satisfaction at 95 percent, the average of all relevant polls over a two-year period was eight points lower than what Will cited. However, Will is correct that the levels of satisfaction with one's own health insurance are consistently high. Indeed, they're extraordinarily high, when one considers how rarely surveys find such high levels of agreement among Americans. Since Will portrayed the larger point accurately, even while modestly overstating the number, we rate his comment Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/10/george-will/will-says-95-percent-people-health-insurance-are-s/
"['Federal Budget', 'Florida', 'George LeMieux']","
LeMieux's plan would eliminate deficit
","Republican U.S. Sen. George LeMieux, appointed to his job by Gov. Charlie Crist last year to replace retiring Sen. Mel Martinez, says he is sounding the alarm about the federal debt. In a March 8, 2010, interview with the Miami Herald editorial board, he discussed his proposal to balance the budget. ""If we just froze spending at 2007 levels...by 2013 we would balance the budget ... and by 2020 we would cut the national debt in half,"" he said.For now, LeMieux's proposal is little more than simple math on an Excel spreadsheet, to back up his assertion that a freeze at the 2007 levels would have a profound impact on the budget. He plans to introduce legislation about it this year, said spokesman Ken Lundberg. The proposal has been praised by the Weekly Standard, a conservative journal.""LeMieux's ideas on curbing spending haven't gotten much attention,'' wrote Fred Barnes, the Standard's editor, in a Feb. 15, 2010, column. ""That's because of who he is, a 40-year-old appointed rather than elected senator filling out the final 16 months of the term of Mel Martinez, who resigned. He's not running for election this November. In fact, he's never been elected to any office.""Another reason it may not have sparked much interest: It's vague and pie-in-the-sky. Two experts on the federal budget told us that LeMieux's budget proposal is unrealistic and lacking details about how he would achieve such a freeze. First, we'll examine the math. LeMieux's office sent us a two-page spreadsheet showing budget projections through 2020 and two options outlined by LeMieux. The spreadsheet lists revenues and outlays and the resulting deficit or surplus. Under President Barack Obama's current budget, LeMieux's chart shows the deficit growing from $161 billion in 2007 to an estimated $1.6 trillion this year. Current projections call for the deficit to average about $900 billion a year through 2020. LeMieux's math shows two options: freezing spending at 2007 or 2008 levels starting in 2011. Under both scenarios, LeMieux concludes that the federal budget would start to see a surplus in 2013 or 2014. By 2020, the cumulative surplus would be nearly $6 trillion. According to the U.S. Department of Treasury, the debt as of March 8, 2010, was about $12 trillion. ""You use the $6 trillion surplus to pay that debt,'' Lundberg said.(A note on LeMieux's methodology: He uses different revenue numbers than the White House because he assumes the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts would be extended and LeMieux assumes that the alternative minimum tax -- a tax designed to prevent wealthy people from using loopholes to avoid taxes -- would be adjusted for inflation.)We sent LeMieux's spreadsheet to Jim Horney, the director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, and Josh Gordon, the policy director at the Concord Coalition, an independent group that advocates responsible fiscal policy. Both agreed that freezing spending at the 2007 level would ultimately lead to erasing the deficit, although Gordon said it appeared that LeMieux's analysis omitted a few factors including calculating the debt service from extending the tax cuts, provisions in the tax code that usually get extended every year and whether the tax cuts in the stimulus package that are set to expire would continue. Gordon wasn't certain how much that would change the year LeMieux would achieve his goal but said ""I think he would still get to a balanced budget at some time in the 10 years.''LeMieux's office said the plan does factor in debt service and does not assume that temporary tax cuts in the stimulus package would continue.What's the magical benefit of a freeze at 2007 budget levels? Horney said it's a combination of avoiding inflation and sidestepping the expense of the costly economic stimulus package. So the math is solid. But both Horney and Gordon said it's not as simple as it looks and that LeMieux should explain which programs he would cut and by how much to achieve those savings.""It is certainly the case that over time if you don't spend any more dollars than you spent in 2007, even under current policy, revenues will go up in nominal terms, spending will not go up in nominal terms and you will balance the budget,'' Horney said. ""That is ignoring that it takes more dollars in nominal terms to provide the same services and benefits in 2007.""That's a function of demographics and inflation, Horney said. ""In 2020 it is going to cost more to pay teachers, keep people in prison, it's going to cost more for each individual Medicare beneficary. There will be more Medicare beneficies in 2020,"" he said. ""Simply saying, 'Let's don't spend anymore in nominal terms' -- it's a huge policy change. You would have to have real cuts across the board. As a math exercise it works, but you should be aware that means very draconian cuts ... that would not be able to provide the same level of services and benefits we provided in 2007.""To illustrate that difficulty, Horney used an analogy: If a family in 2020 was told it could not spend one dollar more than it spent in 2007, the family would be pinched because the cost of food, clothing and rent would have increased over that time.Like Horney, Gordon wanted more details about how LeMieux would cut.""Is he taking money out of defense? The Department of Education? These are dramatic cuts, some major things are going to have to be sliced. I think there needs to be an explanation exactly which line items to stop increase spending on. ... This would be almost impossible to enact because it involves freezing total outlays -- not just the spending that Congress controls annually. You would have to freeze Social Security spending, Medicare spending....Those programs are on autopilot -- Congress does not consider them on an annual basis.""LeMieux's plan could also affect the economy.""Such dramatic spending cuts during a recession might prolong the recession which would lead to lower economic growth than the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) proposes, which would affect all the estimates for revenues and budget deficits,'' Gordon said.We asked LeMieux's office how the plan they call the ""2007 Solution"" would achieve the savings. ""The effect would be to force lawmakers to reprioritize spending decisions,'' Lundberg wrote in an e-mail. ""There are a number of programs greatly in need of reform but until tough choices are made, spending will continue to run out of control. The 2007 Solution would force those tough choices to be made. For instance, waste, fraud and abuse of Medicare dollars is estimated in the billions each year. Capturing those dollars would be a start. In addition, there are hundreds of redundant federal programs that could be eliminated or made more efficient.""Lundberg also sent us a copy of an unsuccessful Jan. 22, 2010, amendment by LeMieux and several other senators called ""Elimination of Duplicative and Wasteful Spending."" That amendment would have reduced overhead in several departments and called for investigations to identify duplicative programs. So, to recap: LeMieux's math is correct: If we lowered federal spending to 2007 levels and kept it there, we could balance the budget and soon have a surplus that we could use to pay down the debt. The omissions in LeMieux's analysis would not have a substantial effect, Gordon told us.But it's important to note that beyond the simple addition and subtraction, LeMieux's proposal is quite unrealistic because of inflation and demographics. LeMieux saying we could balance the budget by 2013 is like someone saying they could lose 20 pounds in a month by just eating lettuce. It might be accurate, but it's probably not going to happen.Still, he gets an A for his math. We find his claim True. ",/factchecks/2010/mar/10/george-lemieux/lemieuxs-plan-would-eliminate-deficit/

AG candidate Kottkamp says nearly all of nation's top 50 oxycodone prescribers are in Florida
","Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, who is seeking the Republican nomination for attorney general, is highlighting the abuse of prescription drugs as a key issue in his statewide campaign.Kottkamp wrote a column that was published in newspapers across the state detailing the severity of the problem in Florida.""An average of six Floridians die each day from a prescription drug overdose — five times as many deaths as from all illegal drugs combined,"" he wrote in article published Feb. 28, 2010. ""In fact, the number of drug overdose deaths in Florida increased by 77 percent from 2003 to 2008, and each one involved at least one prescription drug.""Often the illegal prescription drug of choice is oxycodone, a very strong narcotic commonly prescribed to relieve moderate to severe pain,"" Kottkamp wrote. ""Nearly all of the top 50 prescribers of oxycodone in the United States are located in Florida.""Kottkamp's op-ed contains several interesting facts, but we're choosing to focus on perhaps the most startling number -- that ""nearly all of the top 50 prescribers of oxycodone in the United States are located in Florida.""Oxycodone is the active ingredient in OxyContin and other painkillers such as Percocet. Oxycodone abuses have been well documented, particularly the problems in Florida. From 2001 to 2008, more than 2,000 Floridians have died of overdoses of oxycodone, the St. Petersburg Times reported. The Miami Herald also wrote an in-depth examination of the problem last year.Kottkamp said the problem was more severe in Florida because the state had lax regulation, particularly in tracking clinics that prescribed a large amount of the drug.Abuse, in part, stems from ""pill mills,"" which can be advertised as pain clinics, but can also be health care facilities that routinely conspire in prescribing and dispensing controlled substances, Kottkamp says.Are almost all of the top 50 prescribers of oxycodone -- the leading candidates to be pill mills -- in Florida?We started by asking the Governor's Office of Drug Control, a group Kottkamp leads, to see if the figure was accurate.Bruce Grant, the director of the drug control office, cited a report from the United Way of Broward County Commission on Substance Abuse. While the report focuses primarily on Broward County, it uses national figures from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to say that 49 of the 50 top prescribers are in Florida. And 25 of the top 50 prescribers are in Broward, according to the report, which relied on figures from Oct. 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009.""We're trying -- without saying the sky is falling -- to let people know this is a genuine crisis,"" said Grant. ""This is bad.""Grant said South Florida has become a popular marketplace for people from all over the country who want the painkiller. ""If you go down there, when you see what's going on, it will blow your mind,"" Grant said. ""The parking lots are literally filled with out of state plates. People from Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, they're hanging around. People are lined up outside the doors.""DEA Special Agent David Melenkevitz, who is based in Miami, confirmed the accuracy of the Broward report. He said the numbers come from oxycodone distribution statistics, which the DEA tracks. A list of the specific pharmacies or clinics is not public record, Melenkevitz said. And what can be done to tame the problem?In an interview, Kottkamp said the Legislature took a good first step last year when it approved a bill that requires the state to track and monitor the distribution of certain prescription drugs. Kottkamp also supports measures that would regulate who can own a pain clinic, restrict the ability of clincis to be ""cash only,"" and take away the ability to dispense medications on site.""We need to bring all of our resources to bear,"" Kottkamp said. ""What we don't want to happen is that these clinics move out of South Florida and just move to some other part of the state. We want to drive them out of business all together.""Back to Kottkamp's original statement. Trying to underscore the severity of the prescription drug problem in Florida, Kottkamp said that ""nearly all of the top 50 prescribers"" of the powerful pain killer oxycodone in the country are located in Florida.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Daniel Lipinski']","
Lipinski says Senate bill allows money to pay directly for abortion at community health centers
","Abortion foes have seized on a new issue with the Senate version of the health care reform bill: a plan to funnel an additional $7 billion to expand the reach of community health centers. Groups like the National Right to Life Committee, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the conservative Family Research Council claim the bill would create a loophole for roughly 1,250 community health centers nationwide to offer abortion services. Rep. Daniel Lipinski, an antiabortion Democrat from Illinois who said he could not vote for the Senate version of the bill due to its stance on abortion, stated it more definitively in a January press release that said the bill ""allows taxpayer money to pay directly for abortion in federal community health centers funded in the bill."" Community health centers are clinics that provide primary and preventive health services primarily to low-income Americans and those who live in underserved rural areas. None of them provide abortion services. And we could find no legislators who said they intend for the new funds to pay for abortions. So why are abortion opponents worried they will if the Senate health plan moves forward? It's the way the $7 billion would be distributed. Currently, community health centers receive their funding -- about $2.2 billion a year -- through the annual appropriation budget for the Department of Health and Human Services. That appropriation money is subject to the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of funds for abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger. In the Senate health bill, however, the additional $7 billion for community health centers would be dedicated (read: guaranteed) funding for five years, and would be administered directly through HHS. In other words, the $7 billion would bypass the annual appropriations process, and does not carry any Hyde-type restrictions on using that money to pay for abortions, said Lipinski spokesman Nathaniel Zimmer. ""Therefore, there is nothing legally prohibiting community health centers from using the money to provide abortions."" The Washington Times quoted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops saying the new community health center funding could lead to ""hundreds of thousands of abortions per year that taxpayers would be forced to pay for."" Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the Senate bill includes ""federal funding for community health centers that could be used directly to kill unborn babies."" Not so, says Rep. Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, who told the Washington Times the idea that federal dollars would cover abortions is ""patently false."" ""They're interpreting the Senate language incorrectly,"" DeGette said. ""Any federal money that goes to community health centers or anything else cannot be used for abortion."" That's also the opinion of the National Association of Community Health Centers, which just wants to be left out of the abortion debate. Community health centers ""have never performed abortions,"" said Dan Hawkins, senior vice president of policy and programs for the group. ""They do not plan to or seek to become a provider of abortions. They don't do that."" Community health centers are focused on their mission of providing primary and preventive health care -- things like immunization and prenatal care -- to those typically underserved by the health care community, he said. Community health centers were around for 11 years before the Hyde Amendment went into effect in 1976 and they never provided abortions, he said. And last year, they got $2 billion in federal stimulus funds. Of that, $500,000 was for operational funding. It has already been used to provide health care to more than 2 million additional people, he said. Like the Senate bill's proposal, the stimulus money came separate from the HHS appropriation funds (with its Hyde Amendment limits) and contained no specific abortion language. And again, none of it was used for abortions. Hawkins makes one last point: the $7 billion over five years through the Senate health care bill would be combined by the secretary of HHS (currently Obama appointee Kathleen Sebelius) with the roughly $2.2 billion the centers receive through the annual appropriations bill. ""In our opinion, once this money is combined with the appropriated funds, the Hyde restrictions will apply to the whole thing,"" Hawkins said. Together with repeated assurances from Sebelius that no federal funds will be used to pay for abortions, Hawkins said, ""We feel confident the restriction (against abortions) will apply."" ""And again,"" Hawkins said, ""they haven't done abortions and they aren't looking to do them in the future."" It doesn't really matter whether the authors of the bill or the folks running the community health centers intend for the new money to fund abortions, said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. By failing to address the issue directly in the health care bill, he said, the courts will certainly rule that abortions are permitted, and even require that they be allowed. Even without the additional funding, he noted, powerful abortion rights groups are pushing for community health centers to segregate federal funding to allow them to provide abortions right now. Providing new federal dollars without Hyde Amendment restrictions will only strengthen their position, he argued. ""We know what the result is if they don't put that language (specifically prohibiting abortions) in there,"" he said. ""If it's not explicitly excluded, it ends up being included."" The courts have several times ruled that without specific abortion prohibitions, generic health care language like that spelled out for community health centers ""would certainly encompass abortions, if it ever got to court,"" Johnson said. Johnson can't say whether the funding construction was a deliberate attempt by some in the Senate to allow abortions at community health centers. But, he said, ""If they really want to prevent that, it requires a quick legislative fix: put the money through the regular pipeline."" So why didn't the Senate put the money through the annual HHS appropriations pipeline? Hawkins said the intent was to provide a guaranteed, dedicated source of funding as part of a multiyear effort to ramp up access to health care. So then why not simply add language that spells out that the additional money provided to the community health centers could not be used for abortions? ""It probably would have been a lot easier if they'd done that,"" Hawkins said. A Washington Times story on the issue quoted White House spokeswoman Linda Douglass saying, ""If there is a drafting issue that requires a technical change to make clear that federal funds for community centers should not be used to fund abortions, he (Obama) will work with Congress to clarify it."" So in summary, the White House and the co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus said they do not intend for the additional funds to be used for abortions. The White House says it's even willing to put that in writing in the bill. A spokesman for the National Association of Community Health Centers says the clinics have never provided abortions, that they don't plan to or want to. And he's satisfied that it would be prohibited under existing law anyway, as the additional money would be combined with the appropriations money (which is subject to the Hyde Amendment). Could the money be used for abortions? It doesn't seem likely based on the comments from the White House, Sebelius, the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus and the umbrella organization for community health centers. But neither can we say definitively that the scenario laid out by the Lipinski and the National Right to Life Committee could not happen. If you focus on the technical possibilities -- which is an entirely legitimate thing to do -- who can say whether a court might rule that without a specific prohibition, abortions could be permitted? You can't fault organizations like the National Right to Life Committee for raising concerns about potential loopholes, even if they seem unlikely. And perhaps language will have to be added to remove any doubt. A White House official saying the president would work with Congress to draft language to make clear that federal funds for community health centers should not be used to fund abortions certainly sounds like an acknowledgement that there is at least room for interpretation. But we think the issue looks more like a political dart than a legitimate concern. That's especially true in light of the track record of community health centers. They have never in their 45 years provided abortions. They did not even before the Hyde Amendment was enacted. They have not even when they got $500,000 from the economic stimulus to expand their services (essentially coming the same way as proposed through Senate bill). They have not even though federal funding limited by the Hyde Amendment comprises just 20 percent of their annual budget now (and they'll still be getting that appropriations money, with its strings). Given all that and the public pronouncements from the White House, the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus and Sebelius that the money could not be used to provide abortions, we think it's highly misleading to state definitively, as Lipinski did, that if the Senate bill passes then federal dollars will start flowing to community health centers to provide abortions. We rule Lipinski's statement Barely True.

"['Agriculture', 'Veterans', 'Texas', 'Hank Gilbert']","
Gilbert says Staples tried to woo right wing with proposal to cut food aid program
","
Just before extinguishing Kinky Friedman’s political cigar in the Democratic primary for agriculture commissioner, Hank Gilbert lit into his November opponent, incumbent Republican Todd Staples.

In a March 1 news release, Gilbert accused Staples of using some of the state’s most vulnerable residents for political purposes. ""Todd Staples recently tried to woo his supporters and right-wing base by suggesting the agriculture commission cut programs intended to feed the elderly and disabled, many of whom are veterans,"" the release said.

We wondered what Gilbert was talking about.

Gilbert’s campaign told us that he was referring to the Texas Department of Agriculture’s response to a request from Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus that state agencies submit plans for cutting 5 percent of their general revenue budgets. Experts say lawmakers could face a shortfall of $11 billion or more in projected revenue when they gather again in 2011.

In their Jan. 15 letter to the agencies, the leaders said ""reducing direct services should be your last option, but should be identified, if necessary, in order to meet the 5 percent target."" Decisions on the agencies’ proposals are expected within six weeks.

The Agriculture Department’s proposal, submitted Feb. 15, listed $7.2 million in possible cuts, the largest a $2 million reduction to a program that gives grants to organizations that serve meals — a direct service — to homebound Texans who are elderly or disabled. The cuts would reduce the program’s grant money for 2010 and 2011 by 10 percent.

""Reduced funding would likely impact the number of meals served to elderly and disabled Texans by eligible organizations,"" the department’s plan states. Bryan Black, a department spokesman, said the agency does not know exactly what the impact would be because recipients of grants — 192 were awarded for 2010 — can use the money for things besides food, including salary, equipment and transportation costs.

We also wondered if Gilbert is correct that ""many"" of the recipients of the meal aid are veterans.

The Gilbert campaign said it did not have figures to support the veterans reference. Black said the Agriculture Department doesn’t track whether veterans are among meal recipients.

However, a spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels and More, an Austin recipient of the grant money, told us that about 30 percent of the organization’s clients are men, and a ""significant"" share of those are Vietnam and World War II veterans. Dan Pruett, president of the local Meals on Wheels, said the grant money from the Agriculture Department had improved the group’s ability to serve the older population.

Finally, there’s Gilbert’s statement that the food delivery grants were targeted because Staples was trying to appeal to his ""right-wing"" base.

That’s the sort of speculative political claim that our fact-checking team doesn’t usually address, but we were curious about Gilbert’s reasoning. An explanation came from Vince Leibowitz,  a spokesman for the Gilbert campaign, who said Staples’ action signals to conservatives that he’s willing to trim what they consider to be frivolous social programs.

Black said that proposed reductions to state-funded grant programs were made equitably and that none was singled out for larger cuts.

Summing up: Gilbert accurately described part of the Agriculture Department’s budget-cutting proposal. But it’s misleading to suggest that the food program was targeted for reduction. Nor did Gilbert present any evidence that Staples suggested the cuts to pander to his right-wing supporters.

We rate his statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Bush Administration', 'Pundits', 'Dana Milbank']","
Milbank says Bush was 'least popular president in modern history'
","It's become an article of faith for many Democrats that the presidency of George W. Bush was a failure. That kind of opinion is beyond the scope of the Truth-O-Meter, but we do feel comfortable assessing something more concrete: measuring how Bush fared in public opinion polls.
 
In a March 7, 2010, opinion column, the Washington Post's Dana Milbank took a critical -- and in some cases, rather harsh -- look at the new memoir by Karl Rove called Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight.
 
In his column, Milbank writes that before the former Bush adviser published his book, he had ""2 1/2 years to reflect on what turned Bush into the least popular president in modern history."" We thought it worth checking whether Milbank was correct that George W. Bush was ""the least popular president in modern history.""
 
We will start by raising a caveat. Milbank's exact words were that Bush was ""the least popular president in modern history."" There's no direct scientific measurement of popularity, but the polling industry offers two barometers that come close: presidential approval ratings and presidential favorability.
 
Approval ratings are based on how well poll respondents rate the job someone is doing as president (""Do you approve or disapprove of the job the president is doing?""). By contrast, favorability questions are more broad. They usually ask whether the respondent feels favorably or unfavorably toward the president. (Pollsters call the two numbers the ""fave/unfave""). Favorability is not strictly about someone's job performance, though that certainly plays a role in most people's assessments; rather, it's about how they feel generally toward the person.
 
The differences between these two measures are not trivial. President Bill Clinton famously recorded strong job-approval ratings even as his personal popularity sagged during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The opposite seems to be happening with President Barack Obama, who has maintained relatively robust favorability rankings even as his job approval numbers have sunk. However you decide this question, most polling experts agree that Gallup offers the best source material to test Milbank's claim, since it offers both the longest-running data set (going as far back as Harry Truman for approval rating) and the most consistent wording.
 
One drawback: Gallup only began asking regular favorability questions in 1992, the final year of George H.W. Bush's presidency. The company continued through the presidencies of Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama.
 
Here's how Bush stacked up: Measured on favorability, Bush did indeed record the lowest numbers of the four presidents studied. His father George H.W. Bush never fell below 38 percent favorability, Clinton never fell below 42 percent, and Obama has not yet fallen below 55 percent. But George W. Bush recorded a low of 32 percent.
 
That bolsters Milbank's point, but it's a narrow field. It only compares Bush against the full term of one other president -- Clinton -- and brief portions of two others. And besides, it's hard to argue that the ""modern"" presidential era, to use Milbank's term, began in 1992.
 
Polling experts told us job approval is a better measure. That allows us to compare Bush against nine of his predecessors and Obama.
 
But there are several ways to slice the data: • Average job-approval rating. On this one, George W. Bush ranks in the bottom half of the table, but well above the bottom. With an average job-approval rating of 49.4 percent, Bush ranked below John F. Kennedy (70.1 percent), Dwight Eisenhower (65.0), George H.W. Bush (60.9), Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton (tied at 55.1) and Ronald Reagan (52.8). But Bush ranked ahead of Richard Nixon (49.0), Gerald Ford (47.2), Jimmy Carter (45.5) and Truman (45.4). (We're not counting Obama in this category because of his short tenure.)
 
So by this measure, Bush was not the least popular modern president.
 
• Final job approval rating. Measured by final job-approval rating just before they left office, Bush ranks low, but -- once again -- not the lowest in the ""modern era."" He ranks behind Clinton (66 percent), Reagan (63), Eisenhower (59), Kennedy (58), George H.W. Bush (56), Ford (53) and Johnson (49). But Bush is tied with Carter at 34 percent, and ranks ahead of Truman at 32 percent and Nixon at 24 percent. (Here too, we won't count Obama because he's in the midst of his term.)
 
By this measure, too, Bush was not the least popular modern president.
 
• Lowest job approval rating at any point. By this measure, Bush -- who bottomed out at 25 percent approval -- comes close to ranking the lowest. His worst rating is lower than those of nine presidents (including Obama) and is narrowly ahead of two others.
 
In descending order, the low scores run from a high of 56 percent (Kennedy), through Eisenhower (48), Obama (47), Ford and Clinton (37 each), Johnson (35), Reagan (35), George H.W. Bush (29) and Carter (28). Bush's score ranked slightly ahead of Nixon at 24 percent and Truman at 22 percent.
 
We asked Gallup spokesman Eric Nielsen whether there was any practical difference between Bush's 25 percent, Nixon's 24 percent and Truman's 22 percent. He noted that most of these polls have an error margin of plus or minus 3 percent, which suggested to him that these three low scores are close enough to be statistically tied. So even though Bush's worst number isn't technically the lowest of the bunch, it's close enough that we can't say for sure that it's not the lowest.
 
• Highest presidential disapproval ratings. Gallup doesn't post a summary of highest disapproval ratings on its Web site, but Charles Franklin, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) and co-founder of the Web site Pollster.com, told PolitiFact that only four presidents have registered disapproval ratings north of 60 percent.
 
George H.W. Bush peaked at 60 percent disapproval in Gallup's polls. Nixon peaked at 66 percent. Truman peaked at 67 percent. And George W. Bush peaked at ... 71 percent -- easily the highest on record.
 
So measured by highest disapproval ratings, Milbank would be right.
 
The results, then, are a mixed bag.
 
We can't use the favorability rating because it only goes back to 1992. As for job approval, two of the three measures show that Bush was definitely not the least popular president. In the third, it was a statistical tie for the bottom spot. The only way Bush is the clearly the least popular is when measured by disapproval ratings. So we rate Milbank's claim Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2010/mar/09/dana-milbank/milbank-says-bush-was-least-popular-president-mode/

Charlie Justice says the Legislature raised $2 billion in new taxes and fees
","Facing a staggering budget shortfall last year, Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature had to make some tough decisions. Lawmakers relied on $5 billion in federal stimulus money, trimmed Medicaid reimbursement rates and cut several hundred government jobs. They also raised taxes and fees, a move that didn't sit well with Sen. Charlie Justice, D-St. Petersburg, who is running for the congressional seat now held by Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young.""The Florida Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion"" in the 2009 legislative session, Justice claimed in a press release. He said the new taxes fell disproportionately on the middle class and that lawmakers should end exemptions to the sales tax and corporate income tax that ""cater to corporate special interests.""Republicans say their goal was to maintain basic levels of service while still cutting government. (State spending has dropped more than $7 billion since 2006-07, largely because of plummeting tax collections.)""We were in kind of a unique situation last year,"" said Todd Reid, the staff director for House Majority Leader Adam Hasner. Reid said that Florida had to maintain previous levels of education and health care spending to qualify for stimulus funds. ""We felt we had reduced about as much as we could at that point.""Given the size of the budget shortfall and the state's high unemployment rate -- it was 11.8 percent in December -- lawmakers sought new revenue sources. But $2 billion in tax and fee hikes? From a Legislature dominated by Republicans? We wondered if that was right. According to the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, the number mostly checks out. The office, which crunches budget figures for the Legislature, published a handy spreadsheet that details all of the laws passed in 2009 that affected state revenue, either positively or negatively. They include:- $935 million from a $1-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes.- $797 million from sharp fee increases to get a driver's license or new car tags. - $304 million in higher business taxes to replenish Florida's bankrupt unemployment compensation trust fund.- $195 million from fee increases for filing various types of court motions. The bottom-line projection for the budget year that ends in June: A little more than $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees (in a total state budget of $66.5 billion). So Justice was actually a little low.Two caveats: On the first day of the 2010 legislative session, lawmakers voted to delay the increased unemployment compensation tax for two years. (The rate was scheduled to jump from $8 per employee for most businesses to more than $100.) Without that increase, the total in new taxes and fees drops below $2 billion. But even though they put off the tax increase, lawmakers still approved it in 2009.Also, it's worth noting the Legislature didn't increase taxes all by itself. Gov. Charlie Crist had veto power over every revenue increase and chose to strike only two small items from the budget.Still, Justice's comment about new taxes is generally correct. State economists confirm that lawmakers passed new taxes totaling more than $2 billion last session. Even though he was slightly low, Justice was close enough to earn a True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/08/charlie-justice/charlie-justice-says-legislature-raised-2-billion-/

New fingerprint technology results up solve rate by 300 percent, Crist claims
","In the crime portion of his final State of the State speech, Gov. Charlie Crist touted the success of a new technology that he says is helping police close unsolved cases.The technology -- an advanced fingerprint and palm print identification system -- has increased solve rates on cold cases three-fold, Crist said in his 43-minute address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 2, 2010.""Florida's new fingerprint identification system is improving our rate of solving cold cases by 300 percent, benefiting victims hurt by previously unsolved crimes,"" Crist said.Is this new technology putting that many more bad guys behind bars?The new system Crist is talking about is called the Biometric Identification System, or BIS for short. According to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which manages the new system, BIS is more precise and has more capacity than previous systems. Here's how it works: Law enforcement officials from across the state upload fingerprint and palm print information from crime scenes and from people they arrest. The computer then tries to match the two, looking for people in the system who may have committed unsolved crimes. The concept isn't new -- FDLE has been matching fingerprints electronically for years -- but the state is now able to match palm prints for the first time. The new system also improves accuracy in fingerprint searches, said FDLE spokeswoman Kristen Chernosky.The new statewide BIS system has been up and running since May 2009 and has paid great dividends, Chernosky said.In fact, the FDLE spokeswoman said it was the state law enforcement agency that provided Crist's office the 300 percent figure he cited in his speech.But the number isn't calculating what Crist said it was.""There has been an approximately 300 percent increase in the number of fingerprint hits that have been provided to our local law enforcement agencies,"" Chernosky said. ""That means there was some kind of match, but not necessarily the number of cases solved.""Put another way, the new system is increasing the number of fingerprint and palm print matches to aid local law enforcement, but it's yet unclear if those matches are leading to a similar increase in arrests. The FDLE hasn't tracked that number, Chernosky said.Bill Schade, who manages Pinellas County's fingerprint records department, sings the praises of the new system. He said it produced 20 fingerprint hits on cold cases in February 2010, and already has produced a handful of matches in the first week of March. Some hits lead to arrests -- he pointed to one case in Clearwater where a fingerprint match tied a suspect to a string of local burglaries. But many do not, Schade says.A recent example involved a stolen washer and dryer. Forensics investigators were able to get prints at the home where the crime occurred, and eventually, law enforcement officials got a match. But in between the crime and finding a fingerprint match, the washer and dryer were returned to the home. In that case, no one wanted to press charges and the investigation stalled.That's an important distinction in assessing Crist's claim. He said the new technology is ""improving our rate of solving cold cases by 300 percent, benefiting victims hurt by previously unsolved crimes.""Crist is right that the new BIS system is helping police and sheriff's deputies. But he's making it sound like the new technology is having a dramatic impact on the number of cases solved. In fact, fingerprint matches are up 300 percent, but that doesn't correspond to a similar percentage of additional cases being solved. That data doesn't exist, and system users acknowledge that fingerprint matches don't always lead to arrests. As a result, we rate Crist's claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/08/charlie-crist/new-fingerprint-technology-results-solve-rate-300-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Pelosi claims that health care reform will create thousands of jobs
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put a new spin on health care reform during a recent meeting between President Barack Obama and members of Congress.""It's about jobs,"" she said. ""In its life [health care reform] will create 4 million jobs, 400,000 jobs almost immediately."" To be clear: Pelosi was not arguing that the bill would literally put people to work in the field of health care. Rather, she claims that cheaper health care will allow businesses to hire more workers, thus creating more jobs. ""Imagine an economy where people could change jobs, start businesses, become self-employed, whether to pursue their artistic aspirations or be entrepreneurial and start new businesses, if they were not job-locked because they have a child who's bipolar, or a family member who's diabetic with a pre-existing condition, and all of the other constraints that having health care or not having health care places on an entrepreneurial spirit,"" she said.We'll start out by noting that both sides claim that health care reform will either create or destroy many jobs.The Democrats assume that their bills will make health care less expensive, meaning that employers will have more money to hire more workers. For instance, Obama's Council of Economic Advisers estimated in December that health care reform could create 320,000 additional jobs. The Republicans, however, are claiming the opposite. They maintain that the House and Senate versions of the bill, as well as a recently released proposal by Obama, would levy such hefty fines on employers -- if they don't offer their employees health insurance -- that employers would end up laying off workers to keep costs down. To back up this claim, they point to a Congressional Budget Office report from July 2009 that cited several older studies. One study from 2007 estimates that 224,000 workers could be unemployed if employers were required to provide insurance that cost, on average, $2 per hour worked. A second study, also published in 2007, found that an employer mandate could cost about 750,000 jobs. But that study also took into account a minimum wage increase from $5.15 to $7.25, the current rate. Ultimately, the CBO concludes that requiring employers to offer health insurance will reduce employment, but the effect ""would probably be small."" Another study by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also looked at the employer mandate in June 2009. At the time, the Senate bill would have required employers who do not offer insurance to fully cover the cost of coverage for their lowest income employees who purchase insurance through a new health care insurance exchange. The group concluded that such a requirement could deter employers from hiring low-wage workers and might ultimately lead to job losses. All this information shows that health care reform may have some impact on employment, but there's a catch: Since the CBO and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities did those analyses, the Senate has changed its bill to say that employers will not be required to offer insurance, but that employers with 50 or more employees must help workers defray the cost if they qualify for new tax credits to help buy insurance. Obama's proposal includes similar language. Employers with 50 or more workers that don't provide coverage would be penalized, but the proposal would exempt the first 30 workers when calculating a $2,000 per worker fine. That background is meant to demonstrate one thing: The House, Senate and Obama proposals are moving targets. As a result, it is nearly impossible to quantify with any certainty how many jobs will be created -- or lost -- from health care reform. And we want to emphasize here, we've found no studies on lost jobs that examine the current proposals, which include fines but not full employer mandates. So, we asked Pelosi's office for more information. Her spokesman, Nadeam Elshami, pointed us to a recent study by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning public policy think tank. According to the report, ""one important way to create jobs is to slow the growth of medical spending. If health care cost increases slow down, then businesses will find it more profitable to expand employment, and workers will more readily move into those new jobs.""The study is a combination of data collected by Neeraj Sood, a professor at the University of Southern California who has looked at the impact of rising health care costs on employment, and David Cutler, a economist at Harvard University who has studied the impact of health care reform on care and insurance premiums.The initial impact of health care reform would be lower administrative costs, the authors argue. Those costs are associated with the marketing, underwriting and brokers’ fees charged by health insurance companies. The authors also argue that health care reform would make treatment more cost effective. Eventually, those efficiencies would trickle down to employers; in short, they won't have to pay as much to cover their employees and can instead use that extra cash to hire more workers. All told, the authors of the report estimate that health care reform could produce, on average, 250,000 to 400,000 jobs a year over the next decade. To come up with those job numbers, Cutler and Sood modeled two scenarios. In the first, medical cost reductions would occur at a moderate 0.75 percentage points annually, producing an average of 250,000 jobs every year. In the more aggressive scenario, medical cost reductions are as high as 1.5 percent annually, producing an average of 400,000 jobs per year. In reality, the number of jobs produced per year would vary, according to the report. For instance, in 2013, the number of jobs created under the second scenario would be about 210,000. That number would climb to nearly 800,000 in 2019.So, in her statement, Pelosi assumes that 400,000 jobs are created every year for a total of 4 million over 10 years. But Pelosi is cherry-picking the most optimistic number from one study. A more moderate rate of reduction could produce fewer jobs per year, according to the report. Furthermore, she fails to mention that the 400,000 is an average, meaning that some years could produce a higher number of jobs and others could produce fewer jobs. And finally, there's clearly a lot of uncertainty about whether the health care bill, with its fines on employers who don't provide health insurance, will create jobs or cut jobs. As a result, we find Pelosi's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/08/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-claims-health-care-reform-will-create-thous/

Glenn Beck gets numbers on Social Security and life expectancy correct
","To show that Social Security today is not what President Franklin Roosevelt intended when he signed it into law in 1935, talk show host Glenn Beck claimed that its creators may have designed it so many people would not live long enough to receive the benefits.

""When Social Security started, age expectancy for the average man was 58. It was 62 for women,"" said Beck. ""Wait a minute, when did benefits come in? At 65.""

His point was that Social Security was not meant to benefit as many people as it does today. Indeed, Beck went on to say that if Roosevelt had passed the law now, the starting age would be around 80 years old, due to longer life expectancy.

We wondered if Beck was right about life expectancy in the 1930s.

Indeed, he was correct. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency that tracks birth and death data, says that a man born in 1935, on average, lived until he was 60; a woman typically lived until she was 64. So Beck's claims of 58 and 62 were just off slightly. And Beck was correct that an average person would die before Social Security took effect. What about Beck's implication that the age was chosen purposefully so that the majority of Americans would never recieve their Social Security benefits? Was FDR making this calculation?

Probably not, said Edward Berkowitz, a professor on Public Policy at the George Washington University and author of several books on Social Security. ""I think that the age was chosen somewhat at random, certainly not to hedge actuarial bets.""

Berkowitz thought that an alternative explanation for the age choice was that the Germans had a similar program that the Americans used as a model. Berkowitz also pointed out that the median age might not reflect real life expectancy because the number was skewed by a large share of infant deaths. ""After you survive infancy, life expectancy goes up.""

Of course, we can't be sure what FDR was thinking, but for our purposes, Beck's statement is off by just a couple of years and his overall point is right that life expectancy was below the retirement age of 65.

Perry says Texas is the fastest growing state with the most Fortune 500 companies
","
After Gov. Rick Perry won the 2010 Republican nomination for governor Tuesday, he thanked voters in a cinematic Web video posted on his campaign site.

The ""Leader"" video, set to rock music, shows stampeding horses, standing ovations and a glamour shot of Perry. More than 20 proclaimed accomplishments flash by on the screen including two claims PolitiFact Texas hadn't previously checked — that Texas has the ""most Fortune 500 companies"" and that it's the ""fastest-growing state.""

Superlative claims often draw our attention; sometimes they stretch the truth.

We decided to look first at whether Texas is home to the most Fortune 500 companies.

Every year, Fortune magazine ranks the top 500 U.S. companies by revenue. In 2009, Texas was home to the most companies in the compilation, topped by Exxon Mobil, which had more than $442 billion, and also including behemoths such as ConocoPhillips, AT&T and Valero Energy. In 2009, Texas was the hostess with the mostest, with 64 Fortune 500 companies; Texas also topped the list in 2006 and 2008. New York and California were home to 56 and 51 companies, respectively, in 2009.

And how about Texas being touted as the fastest-growing state in the United States?

Perry's campaign pointed us to population data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which reported in December that Texas gained more residents than any other state between July 2008 and July 2009, when the bureau issued its last population estimates in advance of the 2010 census.

That's 478,012 additional people — no small potatoes. California had the next highest number: 381,293.

Still, doesn't it stand to reason that a state that already has the second-biggest population — Texas — will tend to add more people than less populous states? Does that really mean the state is growing faster than all others?

Not exactly. Robert Bernstein, a public information officer at the Census Bureau, said: ""The term 'fastest-growing' is somewhat subjective. When we (at the bureau) say 'fastest-growing,' we usually mean highest rate of growth.""

In the July-to-July period, Wyoming and Utah had the highest rate of growth at about 2.1 percent each. Texas wasn't far behind at 2 percent, followed by Colorado, with a 1.8 percent bump in population.

Bernstein said: ""You might want to say Texas had the highest numerical growth in the country, rather than (it) was the fastest-growing state.""

Of course, Perry's fastest-growing-state statement makes for a sharper sound bite. But it fuzzes the fact that two Western states grew a little faster in the same time period.

And when we looked at year-to-year growth covering previous years, other states also outpaced Texas. For instance, from July 2007 to July 2008, Texas similarly added the most new residents. But its rate of population growth trailed both Utah and Arizona.

From 2006 to 2007, Texas had the seventh-highest rate of growth of the states.

Where does that leave us?

In 2009, Texas was home to the most Fortune 500 companies.

And it gained more people than any other state from July 2008 to July 2009. But raw numbers don't tell the whole story. Comparative growth is best measured by the rate at which it occurs. By that measure, Wyoming and Utah grew faster than Texas from July 2008 to July 2009. Texas was outpaced by other states during each of the two immediately preceding year-to-year periods as well.

We rate Perry's combined claims as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/08/rick-perry/perry-says-texas-fastest-growing-state-most-fortun/

White says almost 1 million people are unemployed in Texas — a state record
","
Former Houston Mayor Bill White, who won the 2010 Democratic nomination for governor Tuesday, wasted no time attacking Gov. Rick Perry's legacy.

Hint: White doesn't think it's shaping up so well.

""Rick Perry and his consultants and his insiders will take credit for all the good times in Texas,"" White said. ""But they won't take responsibility for the fact that today, there's almost 1 million Texans who are unemployed and that's an all-time record number in our state.""

The gauntlet is thrown. Do the jobless numbers back White up?

According to the Texas Workforce Commission, more than one million people were unemployed in January, but that includes seasonal employees who were laid off after the holidays. The seasonally-adjusted data shows that 996,863 were unemployed — about 3,000 shy of 1 million. That number has been increasing steadily since early 2008.

The latest count also is a Texas record, topping the 765,894 residents who were out of work in October 1986.

But a head count isn't the only way to judge joblessness over time. We looked at the rate of unemployment, too.

The state rate — 8.2 percent as of January — has also crept up since 2008, due at least in part to a nationwide recession. But it hasn't yet matched the worst times of the 1980s recession in Texas, which was driven by an oil bust.

The monthly unemployment rate peaked twice that decade, reaching 8.4 percent in January 1983 and 9.3 percent in September 1986.

The annual unemployment stats are similar. The 2009 unemployment rate was 7.6 percent — the same as the rate in 1992. But the state's annual unemployment rate has been higher; it was 8.5 percent in 1987 and 8.9 percent in 1986.

So the unemployment rate isn't yet at its highest in Texas — not that having the third highest rate is anything to celebrate.

Anyway, White didn't cast the rate as highest-ever. Nor did Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, when he blasted Perry on primary election night for an ""unemployment rate (that's) higher than it's been in decades."" Two decades, to be precise.

White is correct that the number of unemployed Texans — almost 1 million — is an all-time high. We rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/07/bill-white/white-says-almost-1-million-people-are-unemployed-/

Perry says Texas has installed more wind power than all but four countries
","
Federal regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? ""Don't tread on us"" sums up the reaction of GOP Gov. Rick Perry, who's running for reelection.

In February, the state filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency to prevent the regulation of carbon dioxide. Perry has resisted the EPA's finding last year that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health — a verdict that sets the stage for federal regulation.

State officials say such curbs could jeopardize jobs and threaten businesses in Texas, which leads the nation in carbon emissions.

As evidence that Texas is doing just fine protecting natural resources, thanks, Perry says Texas also leads the nation in wind power. From a press release the governor issued Feb. 16 announcing the state's lawsuit: ""Texas has installed more wind power than any other state, and all but four countries.""

Does Perry have it right?

Let's start with those other states.

According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), a trade group that tracks development in the industry, Texas has the largest installed wind capacity in the country. That means its wind projects are producing more power than any other state. As of 2009, Texas boasted 9,410 megawatts of it — enough to power about two million-some homes here.

Iowa has the second-largest installed wind capacity with 3,670 megawatts of power, followed by California, Washington state, and Minnesota.

In 2009, Texas installed the largest amount of new capacity with 2,292 megawatts of wind power, trailed this time by Indiana, Iowa, Oregon and Illinois.

So Texas is — sorry — blowing the competition out of U.S. waters.

How does the state fare worldwide? The Global Wind Energy Council, of which the AWEA is a member, reports the United States had an installed wind power capacity of 35,159 megawatts as of 2009. Germany had 25,777 megawatts, China had 25,104 megawatts, Spain had 19,149 megawatts and India had 10,926 megawatts.

Italy was the country with the sixth largest installed wind power capacity (4,850 megawatts) — just over half of Texas' capacity.

Not including the U.S., Texas had installed more wind power than any all but four countries. And more than any other state.

Alex Sink says 'nobody' paying attention to Medicaid fraud in Florida
","Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink is criticizing her potential November opponent for governor for failing to address abuses in the state-run Medicaid system.The Democrat's campaign is touting that the number of Medicaid fraud cases opened has dropped significantly since Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum took office, and that Florida has the second-highest number of Medicaid recipients in the nation, but ranks 39th in convictions per person in its fraud unit.By one estimate, Medicaid fraud costs Floridians $3.2 billion annually. The attorney general's office oversees Medicaid fraud investigations.""That Medicaid thing is just glaring,"" Sink said in a March 4, 2010, interview with the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald. ""And ... this is nothing new, this is not a new problem. Nobody has been talking about it, focused on it, or paying attention to it. It goes on and on and on. Very frustrating.""For this item, we'll zero in on Sink's statement that ""Nobody has been talking about it (Medicaid fraud), focused on it, or paying attention to it.""We'll cut to the chase. It turns out lots and lots of people -- including McCollum -- have.Medicaid fraud, in fact, has been a constant topic of discussion among state lawmakers since at least 2004. From the highlight reel: McCollum, specifically, also has been involved. As attorney general, he twice wrote to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius asking for a federal waiver to expand some fraud detection programs in his Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. That unit, meanwhile, has seen Medicaid fraud convictions steadily rise, from 38 in 2004 to 64 in 2007 to 109 in 2009, the attorney general's office reported. That's a contrast to the number of cases opened -- the figure Sink cited. The attorney general's office says that's because it changed the way it classifies when a case is opened. Previously, every complaint constituted an open case. Now, only complaints with merit become a case.Fighting against Medicaid fraud has long been a priority of state government, said Alan Levine, who served as the Agency for Health Care Administration secretary under Gov. Jeb Bush. AHCA manages the Medicaid program, while the attorney general's office investigates and prosecutes fraud cases.""We made fighting fraud a huge effort,"" said Levine, who now leads Louisiana's health department. ""Legislatures going back eight or nine years passed sweeping measures with significant statute changes for the sole purpose of fighting fraud.""Levine said in his office he had anywhere between 50 and 100 people examining Medicaid claims, in addition to the 200 or so investigating fraud in the attorney general's office. The problem, he said, is the system -- which pays out the claims before regulators have a chance to look at the charges. As he talked, he kept referring back to a 2006 Associated Press article to help make his point. Its title, ""Florida's Efforts to Crack Down on Medicaid Fraud Paying Off.""The story said fighting fraud was one of Levine's ""biggest priorities.""Still, Medicaid fraud remains a serious problem like Sink suggests. The Legislature's policy research office estimated that fraud could account for 5 to 20 percent of the Medicaid program, or $940 million to $3.7 billion, in 2008, the Times/Herald reported. Medicaid costs will hit about $19 billion in 2010, providing health services to about 2.8 million poor children, frail elders and severely disabled Floridians -- about 14 percent of the population.The numbers get groans from Republicans and Democrats alike. Sen. Durell Peaden, a Crestview Republican who chairs the Senate health budget committee, grumbled about McCollum's efforts. ""He needs to get his butt in gear,'' Peaden said.McCollum, in the same story, agreed that there was room for improvement. Sink spokeswoman Kyra Jennings notes that's like an admission of his failures. (Jennings also wanted to note that during the interview, most of Sink's comments about Medicaid fraud were directed at McCollum. The ""nobody"" quote came near the end of the interview, almost as in summation. We don't disagree with that).Look, we're not here to weigh in on how successful anti-Medicaid fraud efforts have been in Florida. By the sound of it, by the fact that the state may be losing $3.2 billion a year, it sounds like there is indeed room for improvement. And so we're clear, we're not saying who's to blame. Sink's campaign touts that the number of cases are down. McCollum's attorney general office touts that fraud convictions are up. But any inference that elected officials are just letting the money walk out the door ignores reality.Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate are proposing legislation each year meant to clamp down on Medicaid abuses. The House held a previously scheduled hearing about Medicaid and Medicaid fraud the very morning after Sink made her claim. The state Senate talked about Medicaid fraud the same week as well. McCollum, meanwhile, has at least twice written to federal officials in Washington suggesting a fix that he says will better protect Florida against fraud. And more than 250 people are employed at two state agencies to monitor Medicaid payouts for fraud and abuse.At PolitiFact Florida, we always say words matter. In this case, Sink said, ""Nobody has been talking about (Medicaid fraud), focused on it, or paying attention to it."" While the outcomes may not be to her liking, people are paying attention. For that, we rate her claim False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/06/alex-sink/alex-sinks-nobody-medicaid-fraud/
"['Bipartisanship', 'Florida', 'Dave Aronberg']","
Aronberg says Crist called him ""rock star""
","State Sen. Dave Aronberg, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, is trying to appeal across party lines with an eye toward the general election. He's portraying himself as a politician focused on principles rather than partisan warfare.The ""About Dave"" page on his campaign Web site says, ""The Naples Daily News called him 'the real deal,' and Governor Charlie Crist has praised him as ""a rock star."" It does not explain the context or source for the Crist quote. Given how partisan politics have become, it's surprising to see such favorable comments from someone of the opposite party. So we wondered if the Republican governor really described a Democratic legislator and attorney in such favorable terms. We found the quote in an April 19, 2007, post on the Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog titled, appropriately, ""Aronberg is Crist's 'rockstar.' "" Here's what it said: ""To be honest, about anything Sen. Aronberg does is important to me,"" Crist said when asked about Aronberg's proposal to revise state sex offender residency rules. ""The guy is brilliant. He's a rockstar, and I have such great respect for him. And he's just a good, decent man. And almost everything I can think of that he's ever promoted or pushed has been something I'm able to support gladly.""The ""rock star"" quote was repeated in several other articles, mostly in the Palm Beach Post. A May 14, 2007, Palm Beach Post article said: ""After Crist gushed last month about Greenacres Democratic state Sen. Dave Aronberg ('The guy is brilliant. I mean, he's almost a rock star.'), Aronberg got a tape and planned to give it to his mom for Mother's Day."" You'll notice the Post version of the quote includes the qualifier ""almost,"" but we listened to audio from the original Miami Herald interview and indeed Crist unequivocally says, ""He's a rock star.""The ""rock star"" quote even played a role in a debate among Republicans about whether to support Aronberg. A Palm Beach County-based lobbyist wanted to launch a Republican committee to endorse Aronberg ""citing the Democrat as 'honest' and having 'integrity,' and invoking Crist's praise of Aronberg as a 'rock star,' "" the Palm Beach Post reported July 19, 2008. Then party chair Jim Greer nixed the idea of the Republican party backing the Democrat.So Aronberg is correct. Crist sang his praises and put him on the big stage. We find his claim True. UPDATE: This item was updated on March 6, 2010, because audio of the original quote shows Crist did not use ""almost"" as a qualifier.",/factchecks/2010/mar/05/dave-aronberg/aronberg-says-crist-called-him-rock-star/

Is Obama a hypocrite on reconciliation?
","With President Barack Obama calling for Congress to move toward a reconciliation bill on health care (which would require only a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate rather than the customary supermajority of 60), many conservative opponents have posted pre-presidential Obama quotes that they say expose his hypocrisy on the issue. We'll examine the context of some of the more popular quotes being cited, and then weigh in with our 2 cents on whether Obama has flipped on reconciliation. The quote that seems to be making the widest rounds is one Obama made during the presidential campaign in an interview with the Concord Monitor on Oct. 9, 2007. It has been featured in segments by pundits Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck. Here's how Beck presented it on his show March 3, 2010: Beck: ""In fact, you know, one of the big people that was really outspoken on reconciliation, said it was a really big mistake, especially using it for health care, you can't use the 50-plus-one option and still govern. That person was Barack Obama."" Beck then played a clip in which Obama said the following: ""You've got to break out of what I call the sort of fifty-plus-one pattern of presidential politics. Maybe you eke out a victory of fifty plus one. Then you can't govern. You know, you get Air Force One, there are a lot of nice perks, but you can't deliver on health care. We are not going to pass universal health care with a fifty-plus-one strategy."" This turns out to be a splice of Obama's comments. Obama actually said a good bit between the first sentence and the rest of the quote. That added context doesn't make this one as cut-and-dried as it may appear. Obama was talking about the differences between himself and his then-opponent in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton. ""I think it is legitimate at this point for me to explain very clearly to the American people why I think I will be a better president than Hillary Clinton, and to draw contrasts,"" Obama said. ""But that's very different from this sort of slash-and-burn politics that I think we've become accustomed to. Look, part of the reason I'm running is not just to be president, it's to get things done. And what I believe that means is we've got to break out of what I call, sort of, the 50-plus-one pattern of presidential politics. Which is, you have nasty primaries where everybody's disheartened. Then you divide the country 45 percent on one side, 45 percent on the other, 10 percent in the middle -- all of them apparently live in Florida and Ohio -- and battle it out. And maybe you eke out a victory of 50-plus-one, but you can't govern. I mean, you get Air Force One, there are a lot of nice perks to being president, but you can't deliver on health care. We're not going to pass universal health care with a 50-plus-one strategy. We're not going to have a serious bold energy policy of the sort I proposed yesterday unless you build a working majority. And part of the task of building that working majority is to get people to believe in our government, that it can work, that it's based on common sense, that it's not just sort of scoring political points. The interviewer then asked, ""So is your answer to 'Why I will be a better president than Hillary Clinton,' is your answer that she'll be a 50-plus-one president and you won't?"" ""Yes,"" Obama said. A bit of historical context is in order. During the campaign, one of the knocks on Hillary Clinton -- even among Democrats -- was that she was a politically polarizing figure, and that would make it hard for her to get things done. It was an image the Obama campaign played up, presenting Obama as someone better able to forge consensus on difficult issues. Asked about the quote in a press briefing on March 4, 2010, press secretary Robert Gibbs said Obama was talking about ""electoral strategy, not vote counting in the House and the Senate."" The same scenario unfolds with a quote Obama made when he was speaking a couple of weeks earlier at the Change to Win Convention on Sept. 25, 2007. Again, Obama was contrasting himself with Democratic primary opponents, this time both Hillary Clinton and John Edwards, and Obama suggested that he was better able to ""excite and inspire the American people"" and build a larger consensus (even with Republicans) on issues like health care, immigration and energy. ""The bottom line is that our health care plans are similar,"" Obama said. ""The question once again is, who can get it done? Who can build a movement for change? This is an area where we're going to have to have a 60 percent majority in the Senate and the House in order to actually get a bill to my desk. We're gonna have to have a majority to get a bill to my desk. That is not just a fifty plus one majority."" Obama was right: short of a reconciliation bill (which wasn't even being discussed at the time), health care legislation would require a 60 percent majority to pass the Senate. Again, Obama was touting his ability to build consensus and was not saying specifically whether he was for or against reconciliation. There's one more quote we'd like to address. This one was made in a press conference at the National Press Club on April 26, 2005. At the time, Democrats and Republicans were jousting over controversial judicial nominations made by President George W. Bush. Republicans were threatening a so-called ""nuclear option"" in which they could use a simple majority to get the judges affirmed. Obama was asked to weigh in on the issue. ""What I worry about would be that you essentially have still two chambers, the House and the Senate, but you have simply majoritarian absolute power on either side,"" Obama said. ""And that's just not what the Founders intended. You know, the Founders designed this system, as frustrating it is, to make sure that there's a broad consensus before the country moves forward. ""You know, and if we want to start getting into the frustrations of minority rights, you know, we could talk about the fact that (South Dakota Sen.) John Thune, with a population of 600,000, has the same vote as I do, with a population of 11 million. I mean, there are all sorts of counter-majoritarian impulses in our system of government, and that's why this government has worked so well. And I think that's why we should try to back off the brink on this one."" We should note that while the issues are similar, this was a debate over judicial nominations, not a reconciliation bill. We think it's important to note that none of the quotes from Obama directly addresses reconciliation. So that makes his position less definitive. But he makes it clear that he doesn't believe a slim majority is enough for a major piece of legislation. Specifically, he talked about health care not being a 50-plus-one issue. And the fact is, he's now advocating a 50-plus-one strategy on health care. Obama may argue that he has tried to include Republicans, but that they have simply been unwilling to play ball. He also has noted that the first iteration of the health care bill passed the Senate with a supermajority. But the fact is, the health care bill is not getting any Republican support, and Obama is pressing forward with a plan to push through a health care plan without them, and without a 60-vote majority. And we think the last quote, from 2005, is even more on point. Yes, Obama was speaking about the ""nuclear option"" as it related to judicial nominees, and not a reconciliation bill. But the principles are largely the same, especially as Obama noted that having simple ""majoritarian"" power in the Senate is ""just not what the Founders intended."" And we think that's enough to warrant a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2010/mar/05/barack-obama/obama-hypocrite-reconciliation/
