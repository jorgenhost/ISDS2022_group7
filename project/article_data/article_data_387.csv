Herman Cain said workers now pay 15.3 percent in payroll taxes
","
Herman Cain’s 9-9-9 plan was the talk of the debate held Oct. 11, 2011, in Hanover, N.H., with Cain’s Republican opponents for the presidential nomination assailing the plan as unworkable.

At one point, moderator Charlie Rose warned other candidates that mentioning the plan meant more rebuttal time for Cain. ""If you keep mentioning 9-9-9 and Herman Cain, I'm going to have to go back to him every other question,"" Rose said.

Basically, Cain’s plan would replace the existing laws on income taxes, payroll taxes and corporate taxes with flat tax rates of 9 percent -- a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent national sales tax and a 9 percent corporate tax.

Cain’s opponents focused on the proposed new sales tax. ""We're not going to give the federal government, Nancy Pelosi, a new pipeline, a 9 percent sales tax for consumers to get hammered by the federal government,"" said Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania. ""How many people believe that we'll keep the income tax at 9 percent? Anybody?""

Cain’s plan seems to have struck a chord with some voters because it appears easy to understand, particularly compared with the current tax code and its mish-mash of different rates, deductions, credits and loopholes.

But would voters be better off? The day after the debate, Cain was grilled by NBC’s Chuck Todd, who wanted to know how the plan would affect working people. Todd quoted an analysis by economist Bruce Bartlett that said, ""At a minimum, the Cain plan is a distributional monstrosity. The poor would pay more while the rich would have their taxes cut.""

""First of all, the fact that I got attacked so much and my plan got attacked so much last night, that's a good thing,"" Cain said. ""Because it gives me an opportunity to correct some of those misperceptions.

""For example, here's what a lot of people missed, including Bruce Bartlett. ...Start with the 9-9-9 and the fact that every worker pays 15.3 percent payroll tax. Now they're going to pay 9 percent, okay? That's a 6 percentage point difference. The 9-9-9 plan replaces payroll tax, capital gains tax, corporate income tax, personal income tax and the death tax. So, five taxes we replace with those three. We start with throwing out the current tax code.""

Cain is suggesting that the new national sales tax would be a smaller percentage than today’s payroll taxes. But the 15.3-percent number he mentioned didn’t sound quite right to us, so we decided to check it out.

What we found is that Cain is counting both worker and employer contributions to payroll taxes to arrive at the 15.3 percent number.

First, here’s a quick primer on how payroll taxes work: If you work for an employer, the employer deducts payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and then sends the money on to the federal government. The taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. That’s a total of 7.65 percent in payroll taxes for workers making less than $106,800.

But the employer also has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. That means total payroll taxes for each worker reach 15.3 percent, the number Cain mentioned.

So most workers see only about half the amount Cain mentioned deducted from their paychecks.

(And for every tax rule now in place, it seems like there are exceptions. The exception in this case is on the self-employed. They are required to pay the worker’s share of payroll taxes and the employer share. So that group would be paying the 15.3 percent Cain mentioned.)

Also in Cain’s defense, many economists believe that if the government were to end payroll taxes, it would mean higher pay for workers -- maybe not immediately, but at least over the long run, because it’s part of the cost of labor.  

Still, there’s no rule or law that would require employers to give workers a raise equal to the employer's share of payroll taxes previously paid to the government. The taxes paid now are not considered part of workers’ wages in any formal or legal sense.

We have to add one other note of explanation that’s particular to the current economic downturn. In 2010, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most workers are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. That means the current overall number isn’t 15.3 percent, but 13.3 percent.

One final note on the 9-9-9 plan itself: In our review of the commentary on Cain’s tax plan, we saw that economic analysts have said the Cain campaign needs to release more detailed information on the plan so that it can be properly modeled, to find out how much revenue it would generate and how it would affect taxpayers of different income levels. Cain said in the interview with Todd that he intended to release more information on the plan soon.

Our ruling 
Cain said, ""Every worker pays 15.3 percent payroll tax."" That's not accurate. Workers only pay half that, with the exception of the self-employed, as we mentioned above. The worker contribution is normally 7.65 percent, and thanks to the payroll tax rollback of 2010, the number this year is 5.65 percent. You can reach that number only by including the half of the tax that employers pay. Some economists say that if the employers’ half of payroll taxes were ended, workers would see  a proportional rise in wages over the long run. But whatever the case, Cain was talking about the reality today. Workers don't pay a 15.3 percent payroll tax, so we rate Cain's statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/oct/12/herman-cain/herman-cain-said-workers-now-pay-153-percent-payro/
"['China', 'Jobs', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Virginia', 'Edd Houck']","
Houck says Reeves ""OK"" with shipping Va. jobs to China
","
Democratic State Sen. Edd Houck, D-Spotsylvania, is airing a cable television ad charging that his Republican opponent, Bryce Reeves, ""is OK"" with sending Virginia jobs overseas.

""Bryce Reeves chaired a group bankrolled by a New York billionaire who fired hundreds of Virginia workers and sent their jobs to China,"" the ad’s narrator says.

We wondered if it’s true Reeves is linked to a company that sent hundreds of Virginia jobs to China.

We started by tracing the Houck campaign’s circuitous route in linking Reeves to the job losses.

Reeves in 2009 chaired the Fredericksburg regional chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a national conservative organization advocating less spending, taxes and government. It was a volunteer position Reeves held for a few months, according to Chris Leavitt, Reeves’ campaign manager.

Americans for Prosperity was co-founded and gets money from David Koch, a New York billionaire who co-owns Koch Industries. The New Yorker and other publications have reported that Koch and his brother, Charles, have helped finance the rise of the Tea Party in recent years.

Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kansas, owns Invista, a global manufacturer of nylon, spandex and polyester products. In December 2008, Invista, announced plans to lay off 210 employees who made nylon fibers for carpets at a plant in Waynesboro.

A Dec. 11, 2008 story in The News Virginian, Waynesboro’s newspaper, said Invista cited the sluggish housing market and decline in the demand for carpet as reasons for the job cuts. The article said many workers might be shifted to spandex production.

The story said the nylon job losses were in addition to the layoff of another 135 contractors at the plant just a week earlier.

Did those jobs end up being sent to China? To buttress that line of reasoning, Houck’s ad references a December 12, 2008 article in The News Virginian that said while Invista was cutting in Waynesboro, it was expanding operations in China.

""Where there’s smoke, there’s fire,"" Craig Bieber, Houck’s campaign manager, told us.

The story, however, did not say the Waynesboro jobs specifically went to China.

In an attempt to prove the jobs did go to China, Bieber cited a 2006 Invista news release announcing the company was acquiring Honeywell’s nylon filament business in Asia to make Stainmaster carpets. Bieber told us the jobs losses in Waynesboro fits a pattern of Koch Industries off-shoring jobs.

But Bieber could not provide any direct evidence the Waynesboro jobs were shipped to China. And we couldn’t find any, either.

The Department of Labor allows U.S. workers to petition the federal government for benefits if their jobs have been lost to international trade. We searched that agency’s website for trade assistance cases involving Invista’s Waynesboro facility.

We found a February 2009 Department of Labor decision signing off on trade assistance to Invista employees and contract workers at the plant’s facility whose nylon yarn production work was being shifted to Canada, where the company has three large plants and has been expanding its production of air bags. But we found no decisions saying workers claimed that their jobs were being sent to China.

For insight, we repeatedly tried to reach Jim Flickinger, president of the International Brotherhood of DuPont Workers, the union representing workers at the plant. He didn’t call us back.

Kenneth Henley, the union’s general counsel, declined comment. ""We don’t want to get in the middle of it,"" he said.

Kemp Harr, publisher of Floor Focus Magazine, doubted the Waynesboro jobs went to China. Harr said Invista is faced with a drop in  U.S. demand for nylon carpet -- down 40 percent since 2006.

""The only thing Invista makes in China is for domestic consumption (in that country),"" said Harr, whose publication is based in Chattanooga, Tenn.

Invista officials deny that Waynesboro nylon workers’ jobs were sent to China, adding their job loss was due to a ""dramatic decline in housing and significantly reduced customer demand for residential carpet.""

""No nylon workers’ jobs were moved to China,"" Erica Taylor, an Invista spokeswoman, told us in an email. ""Additionally, even though the ad implies otherwise, our owners are not presently involved in Mr. Reeve’s campaign.""

That gets us to our next point.

Houck’s ad uses Reeves’ brief work with a local chapter of Americans For Prosperity chapter to tie him to David Koch, Invista and the company’s 2008 layoffs.

""Reeves is OK with sending our jobs to China,"" the ad’s narrator states.

It’s a pretty flimsy argument to link Reeves to the Invista layoffs solely because he once headed a regional group of a national organization that received money from David Koch. It’s even more of a stretch to say that link, tenuous as it is, proves Reeves is OK about sending jobs to China.

Leavitt, Reeves’ campaign manager, said the Republican has never commented on the Invista layoffs, adding it was ""ridiculous"" to suggest he was OK with sending jobs to China.

Our ruling:

Houck’s ad links Reeves to the 2008 exporting of hundreds jobs from a nylon plant in Waynesboro to China. The charge does not stand up.

First, the connection between Reeves and Invista is weak, to say the least. Invista is a subsidiary of Koch Industries, co-owned by billionaire David Koch. Reeves never worked for the company. But Houck says the tie is that Reeves in 2009 chaired the Fredericksburg chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative national organization that Koch co-founded.

Secondly, Houck offers no proof that the jobs went directly to China. There’s some strong evidence to the contrary, however: Invista denies it; an industry expert says it’s improbable; and the union filings with the Department of Labor make no such claim.

Houck uses a flimsy logic to conclude Reeves ""is OK"" with shipping Virginia jobs to China.

We rate the claim False.

"['Abortion', 'Candidate Biography', 'Education', 'Florida', 'George LeMieux']","
Did Adam Hasner call himself a moderate based on abortion and school choice votes?
","
In the Florida Republican primary for U.S. Senate, George LeMieux is using Adam Hasner's past as a state legislator to try to slap him with the dreaded ""moderate"" label.

LeMieux's even created a website, www.phonyconservative.com, specifically to attack Hasner's conservative credentials.

""As we've come to expect, Hasner's rhetoric is quite different from his record,"" the LeMieux campaign says its website, which launched Oct. 3, 2011. ""For years, Hasner described himself as a moderate and maintained a moderate reputation. He even cited his efforts to weaken pro-life and school choice legislation as unequivocal proof that he's a moderate. Now that he's running in a Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, Hasner’s telling a different story, wearing a new masquerade mask every day.''

We wondered if Hasner cited his own efforts to weaken pro-life and school choice legislation as proof that he's a moderate.

Abortion and school choice votes

LeMieux spokesman Anna Nix directed us to two votes during Hasner's time in the Legislature from 2002-10 to back up the claim.

The first vote relates to a 2004 resolution seeking to amend the state Constitution to require that parents be notified when their minor daughters seek abortions. Hasner supported an amendment to the resolution introduced by then-state Rep. Dan Gelber, a Miami Beach Democrat, which would have ""guaranteed"" a minor the right to bypass parental notification with a judge's okay. The amendment failed 42-73.

Hasner supported the final version of the resolution and in fact co-sponsored the legislation, which included less stringent judicial bypass language than Gelber proposed. ""Mine was guaranteed that bypass be available,"" Gelber told PolitiFact Florida. ""I didn't trust the Legislature essentially to implement this with a view toward protecting minors.""

Hasner adviser Rick Wilson said that Hasner wanted to ensure the bill's constitutionality so he wanted to make sure it had judicial bypass language. And Hasner defended the constitutional amendment after voters approved it, according to a Nov. 6, 2004, article in the Boca Raton News.

The second vote that LeMieux's campaign cited was against a bill that would have established the K-12 GI Bill Program to allow dependents of a Florida veteran or an active duty member to attend a public school other than the one they were assigned to or a private school. On April 22, 2004, it passed the House 68-45 with Hasner listed as a ""No"" vote after roll call. The bill ultimately died.

An Oct. 3, 2004, article in the Sun-Sentinel paraphrased Hasner as saying that ""he supports the state's voucher program but voted against expanding it to military families until stricter accountability measures have been put in place."" However, Hasner voted in favor of a similar bill the year before.

In both cases, there are some caveats to the votes. Hasner actually co-sponsored the parental notification bill, which included language whereby a minor could not notify their parents about their desire to get an abortion by instead asking a judge. But Hasner voted for an amendment with stricter judicial bypass language.

And Hasner voted for a bill in 2003 that would have expanded a school voucher program for dependents of Florida service members but voted against a similar bill in 2004, because he said he wanted stricter accountability measures first put in place.

The votes, however, are only half the story, since LeMieux claimed that Hasner cited them as proof he was moderate.

Campaign mailer

For that part of the fact-check, LeMieux's campaign sent us to a mailer Hasner sent when he was running for re-election as a state representative in 2004 in which he used the word ""moderate"" to describe himself. Hasner was running at the time in a Republican-leaning Palm Beach-Broward district. 

""Re-elect Hasner... A rising star with moderate leanings ... works behind the scenes for school funding ... can move opinion and craft meaningful laws,"" said the mailer, pulling partial quotes from a pair of 2004 Sun-Sentinel articles. The mailer also quoted the Boca Raton News from 2004: ""well rounded in his views and not stuck on following party lines."" 

The first Sun-Sentinel story was evaluating area state legislators after the 2004 session and gave Hasner three out of five stars. ""A rising star with moderate leanings and leadership hopes, he (Hasner) has gotten several bills passed and works behind the scenes for funding for Palm Beach County schools and other interests."" The article did not address Hasner's votes on abortion or school choice.

The second story was an endorsement from the Sun-Sentinel's editorial board, which described him as a ""moderate voice."" ""He also wants to establish meaningful accountability and educational standards for the state's voucher programs."" The endorsement did not address abortion and did not explain any efforts in detail Hasner took related to vouchers.

The third article, which appeared in the Boca Raton News, came from the publisher and was about the editorial board preparing to make endorsements. The piece gave kudos to Hasner and called him an ""open-minded legislator"" but made no specific mention of his votes on abortion or school choice. ""Make no mistake about it he is a Republican, but, he unlike so many members of both parties seems to be willing to find resolution to issues based upon what's best for his constituents and not only what's best for his party.""

There is, however a Sun-Sentinel article -- not quoted on the mailer the LeMieux campaign cited -- in which Hasner is paraphrased as citing his votes on abortion and/or school choice laws as examples of being a moderate. In the Oct. 3, 2004, story, Hasner's Democratic opponent Doug West claimed that Hasner's voting record closely resembled former Republican House Speaker Johnnie Byrd.

The article quoted Hasner as saying: ""Nothing could be farther from the truth."" 

And then it continued by paraphrasing Hasner: ""His voting record reflects the interests of the constituents of District 87, where Republicans hold only a slight majority, he said. Hasner cited votes in support of stem cell research and judicial bypass language in a parental notification bill and votes against a bill to expand the voucher program to families of active and retired military officers as proof he is a moderate Republican. The son of public school teachers, Hasner said he supports the state's voucher program but voted against expanding it to military families until stricter accountability measures have been put in place. He also would support a review of the state's tax exemptions by the nonpartisan group, Florida Tax Watch."" 

Our ruling

LeMieux says that Hasner ""cited his efforts to weaken pro-life and school choice legislation as unequivocal proof that he’s a moderate.""  
What we have here, based on our review, is a rare double cherry-pick. LeMieux has cherry-picked Hasner cherry-picking his own record. It is true that Hasner cited a vote on judicial bypass and expanding a voucher program as proof that he is a moderate Republican in 2004 and he did use the word ""moderate"" on his own mailer.

But those 2004 votes have caveats of their own as we've already detailed. 

And being labeled a ""moderate"" does not tell the full picture of Hasner's voting record on the issues of abortion and school choice.

Hasner voted in favor of a bill requiring women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound and review it unless they signed a waiver. Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed the bill in June 2010. Hasner supported a 2008 bill that required patients to review an ultrasound and that third-trimester abortions be performed in a hospital. (That bill never made it into law.)

Hasner also voted in favor of the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program -- which provides a credit to taxpayers who contribute to organizations that award scholarships to students to attend private schools -- in 2008, 2009 and 2010. All were approved by Gov. Crist.

Ultimately, it looks like Hasner stretched the truth to appeal to moderate voters in 2004 and that LeMieux stretched the truth in his attack on Hasner in 2011. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/12/george-lemieux/did-hasner-call-himself-moderate-based-abortion-an/

Michele Bachmann says Rick Perry co-chaired Al Gore's presidential campaign
","
Given a chance to question any other presidential candidate, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann opened her question for Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Oct. 11, 2011, Bloomberg/Washington Post debate by saying: ""In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan introduced an economic miracle. And while all of us were wishing and yearning for a third term for Ronald Reagan, Gov. Perry, you were campaigning and co-chairing Al Gore's election campaign for president of the United States.""

Setting aside what Bachmann ultimately asked, we realized we’d previously explored the Perry-Gore connection.

For more than a decade, news accounts and Perry critics said that as a Democratic legislator, Perry played a leadership role in then-U.S. Sen. Gore’s unsuccessful 1988 presidential bid. Yet when we revisited this topic in September, we found no evidence--not a pinch--that Perry had a ruling role.

It’s the stuff of political legend--and it was all but unchallenged by Perry until after he launched his bid for president.

However, interviews with political players in Texas and Tennessee and news articles from 1988 convinced us that, although Perry endorsed Gore, he was not his Texas chairman.

Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Perry’s presidential campaign, told us by email: ""We have no record or recollection of any leadership position"" for Perry in Gore’s 1988 campaign.

Asked why Perry did not say as much when a 1998 opponent repeatedly lofted such claims, Sullivan replied: ""We did not (have) access to information about the Gore ’88 campaign organization and therefore 10 years later could not definitively say one way or the other.""
   
Perry says he voted for Republican George H.W. Bush in November 1988, Sullivan said.
   
In an August 2011 blog post, Texas political journalist R.G. Ratcliffe, who also reports for the Austin American-Statesman, declared that Perry did not chair the Gore campaign in Texas. That prompted us to take a closer look at the Perry-Gore connection.
   
Austin consultant George Shipley, who advised Gore’s 1988 campaign, told us in an interview that Perry ""made, to my knowledge, one, possibly two press tours, but he was not what I would call that active in the campaign."" Sherman lawyer Bob Slagle, who supported Gore while chairing the state’s Democratic Party, told us in an interview that Perry ""may have been chairman for some area around Haskell County,"" Perry’s home county, but he was no more than that.

Similarly, two staff members in Gore’s 1988 effort said Perry was not its Texas chief.

Tennessee lawyer Tom Jurkovich, Gore’s Texas director, told us by email that ""we may have named (Perry) to a ‘steering committee’ or as one of several campaign ‘co-chairs,’ typically honorific titles with no real role ... (Perry) wasn't highly involved in the campaign, however, and had zero operational responsibility.""
   
Mike Kopp of Nashville, who did press outreach for Gore, was more emphatic, saying in an interview: ""We didn’t have a chairman in Texas; we didn’t have co-chairs,"" either. ""We weren’t that organized; we didn’t have that strong a ground game.""
   
Perry, who switched to the Republican Party in 1989 before winning his first statewide office in 1990, has since said he realized around that time that Gore was not his man. Still, he did not— could not—deny he’d come aboard with 27 fellow Texas House Democrats who endorsed Gore at a Jan. 5, 1988, Texas Capitol press conference.
   
Perry and the other legislators saw Gore as the best conservative Democrat in a field that included Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Missouri U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   
A Jan. 7, 1988, news article in the Abilene Reporter-News quotes Dusty Garison, Perry’s district aide, saying: ""Rick thinks it’s important that conservative Texans who have traditionally voted in the Democratic Party not vote in the Republican Party simply because they want to vote for a conservative presidential candidate."" Gore, Garison said, appears to be a candidate who can bring the party back to ""mainstream America.""
   
But Gore’s candidacy faded after he fared poorly in Southern primaries. He wound up third in the March 1988 Texas primary, trailing Dukakis and Jackson.
   
Garison told us in an interview he didn’t remember Perry having an official position in Gore’s campaign.
   
Perry's ""chairmanship"" appears to have originated as a campaign attack that stuck after it was seemingly confirmed by Perry himself. Sprinkle in Nexis fever—the tendency of journalists to echo news clips they find using the Nexis database—and the legend abides.
   
A review of news articles archived by the Legislative Reference Library shows that Democrat John Sharp made the charge about Perry’s leadership role in the Gore campaign when Sharp faced Perry in the 1998 race for lieutenant governor.
   
In March 1998, Perry’s camp pressed Sharp to say whom he’d support in that year’s governor’s race between Gov. George W. Bush and Democrat Garry Mauro. Sullivan was quoted in a March 15, 1998, Dallas Morning News article as saying that while Perry would back Bush, Sharp had ""supported Mike Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992, (Democratic Gov.) Ann Richards in 1994 and was preparing to run against Gov. Bush in 1997. In 1998, will John Sharp continue his long opposition to the Bush family in Texas or change his position for political gain?""
   
""Texans deserve a straight and honest answer,"" Sullivan said.
   
The newspaper reported Sharp’s campaign then claiming that Perry served as a state vice chairman for Gore’s 1988 presidential campaign in the state. In an April 1998 debate with Perry, Sharp charged Perry with being Gore’s ""co-campaign manager,"" the Fort Worth Star-Telegram then reported.
   
In a Sept. 15, 1998, Dallas Morning News article, Sharp is quoted making the ""co-chairman"" claim again. Perry acknowledged that, the story says, but said there was a ""push to get a conservative Southerner"" elected president.
   
""Going through that was part of what started me through the process of changing parties in 1989,"" he told the newspaper. ""I came to my senses.""
   
It was Perry’s September 1998 acknowledgment that fed our conclusion in a January 2010 fact check that there was some truth to Republican gubernatorial candidate Debra Medina’s claim that Perry had been Gore’s ""campaign manager."" We again leaned on the 1998 article in rating Mostly True a similar claim by Rep. Ron Paul.
   
When we revisited this topic, Sharp acknowledged he was making a charge he could not prove.
   
Sharp, who lost a second bid for lieutenant governor in 2002, later helped devise a business tax overhaul at Perry’s behest. He’s now chancellor of the Texas A&M University System.
   
By text message, Sharp agreed Perry wasn’t chairman of Gore’s 1988 Texas campaign. Reminded that he said things otherwise on the hustings, Sharp said: ""Never could prove it.""
   
We couldn’t prove it either. We failed to find campaign-related documents potentially listing titles, if any, given to the Texas legislators who came out for Gore.
   
Interviews suggest campaign leadership titles may have been casually shared.
   
Hugo Berlanga, a former legislator who was then speaker pro tempore of the Texas House, said in an interview that the members committing to Gore, who was then a U.S. senator, were going to be his Texas co-chairs. ""The bottom line, whether he was a coordinator or co chair, (Perry) was involved,"" Berlanga said.
   
Bobby Aikin, also among legislators then for Gore, said in an interview: ""I think each one of us claimed to be a co-chair or coordinator or some-such like that.""
   
So, say so long to the ""Chairman Perry"" legend? Sure, barring contradictory evidence.
   
All in all, Perry indeed endorsed Gore for president, but he did not hold a campaign leadership post. We rate Bachmann’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/12/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-rick-perry-co-chaired-al-gor/

Mitt Romney raps number of uninsured kids in Texas, touts statistics for Massachusetts
","
During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sought to contrast health care in his state with that in Texas, the home state of a rival, Gov. Rick Perry. One of the yardsticks he used was how many children are uninsured in each state.

""We have less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured"" in Massachusetts, said Romney, who signed a law designed to get uninsured residents covered. ""You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids.""

We decided to check Romney’s math.

We turned to the statehealthfacts.org website, assembled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent research organization specializing in health care policy. The most recent state-by-state figures available are for the period 2008-09.

For Massachusetts, there were 51,400 uninsured children (that is, birth to 18), or 3 percent. (Of those with insurance, 65 percent got it from an employer and 29 percent got it from Medicaid.)

This means that Romney’s number is overly rosy -- he said less than 1 percent, when the percentage is actually three times higher.

To be fair, Massachusetts still had the lowest percentage of uninsured children in the nation. And it did a whole lot better than Texas.

Texas had 1,303,000 children without insurance over the same period, or 18 percent. (Of those with insurance, 42 percent got it from an employer, 35 percent got it from Medicaid, 3 percent from an individually purchased plan, and 2 percent from other public plans.) Texas' rate is the highest in the nation.

So for Texas, Romney was accurate. He even undercounted a bit.

The Romney campaign pointed to a report published by the Massachusetts state government that found that ""virtually all Massachusetts children had health insurance coverage in 2010 (99.8 percent). The uninsured rate for Massachusetts children fell from 1.9 percent in 2009 to 0.2 percent in 2010.""

However, the report did not address uninsured children in Texas, and we prefer to compare states using a study with equivalent methodologies if one is available, and in this case, we’re sticking with the Kaiser report’s numbers.

Our ruling

Romney said that ""less than 1 percent"" of Massachusetts kids are uninsured, when in fact the best available number is 3 percent. But that’s still the lowest in the nation. Meanwhile, he actually underestimated the number of uninsured children in Texas when he said there were a million.

Alliance for America's Future says government can't afford to pay 100 percent of employee benefits
","
The battle over State Issue 2 -- the referendum on Senate Bill 5 -- has drawn the the attention and money of groups from outside Ohio as well as within the state.

Among them is Alliance for America’s Future, a Virginia-based group that supports Republican candidates and conservative causes. Its principals include Barry Bennett, a former top aide to Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Republican from southwest Ohio, and political consultant Mary Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney’s daughter.

The group is funding a mail campaign that urges voters to support Issue 2. Voting ""yes"" for the issue Nov. 8 is a vote to uphold SB 5, which overhauls collective bargaining rules for public employees. A ""no"" vote is a vote to repeal.

The front of the campaign's oversize postcard displays a crumpled dollar bill under the heading ""Ohio taxpayers have taken a financial beating.""

On the back in large type, a headline makes this claim: ""We just can't afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits too.""

For emphasis, ""pay 100 percent"" is underlined and printed in red capital letters to set it off from the rest of the type, which is black.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

Just as the mailer states, SB 5, among its many provisions, requires public employees to pay at least 15 percent of their health-insurance premiums and it prohibits local governments from picking up any portion of an employee's share of pension contributions.

More problematic is the headlined statement: ""We just can't afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits too.""

""In this tough economy,"" the text continues, ""it's just not fair to ask taxpayers to pay even more for salaries and benefits for government employees."" Voting yes on Issue 2, it says,  ""means that government employees will make modest contributions to their benefits"" by paying ""at least 15 percent toward their health insurance coverage"" and ""just 10 percent toward their own retirement.""

Fair enough. We’ll stipulate that the comment about contributions from employees accurately states what employees would pay. And we’ll stipulate that state government and Ohio's hundreds of public employers do not have the budgets to pay 100 percent of employee benefits.

But that’s not what Issue 2 is about. If Issue 2 is rejected, that does not mean that government will have to pay 100 percent of the employee benefits.

Some public employees -- both union and non-union -- have deals in which the employer pays some portion of the employee benefits contribution.  But there is no one norm for Ohio’s 525,000 public employees.

Cities like Akron, for instance — where union and nonunion workers alike do not pay for health insurance — could save millions in personnel costs.

The city’s tab for health care in 2010 was $23.5 million. If the new law had been in effect, Akron workers would have paid more than $3.5 million of the cost. For the 1,941 workers with health care, that would amount to about $1,800 each.

Employees in Avon, on the other hand, already pay 20 percent of their health care costs. So they wouldn’t pay a dime extra for coverage under the law.

In a report on benefits titled ""The Grand Bargain is Dead,"" the Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a conservative think tank, said, ""State government workers today pay roughly 17 percent of the premium costs for the health care coverage"" -- or more than is required under SB 5. There are about 115,000 state government workers .

Public workers in Ohio pay an average of 9.5 percent of their health care coverage for a single plan and 10.7 percent for family coverage, according to a State Employment Relations Board report on the cost of health insurance in Ohio’s public sector.

In pension funding, state government pays only what is required and does not pay any portion of the employee share.

About 6.6 percent of public workers have individual or union contracts that call for the employer to pick up all or part of the employee share, according to a report from the state’s five public pension systems in the Dayton Daily News.

So what about the claim --  that ""we just can’t afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits.""

Accompanying language in the flier includes several statements that are mostly accurate. Issue 2 does ask government employees to ""share in the sacrifices we’ve all had to make."" It does mean ""that government employees will make modest contributions to their benefits.""

The statement, done in large headline type at the top of the flier, is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details needed to put the statement in context.

Many governments could not afford to pickup the total bill for health and pension benefits. But few do. Most public employees contribute something toward their health and pension benefits. And even if voters reject Issue 2 and SB 5 is repealed, that doesn’t mean government will have to pickup 100 percent of the costs.

A statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/12/alliance-americas-future/alliance-americas-future-says-government-cant-affo/

IPAB board is 15 bureaucrats who will decide for the nation, says Michele Bachmann
","
At a debate in New Hampshire, Michele Bachmann was asked how to make sure that Medicare doesn’t waste money. 
""No one wants the government to come between a doctor and a patient. But do you think that Americans are getting the most for their money in Medicare spending?"" asked Washington Post reporter Karen Tumulty, one of the debate’s moderators. ""And how can we make sure that the money that is being spent is being spent on the treatments and the preventive treatments that do the most?""

Rather than answering the question directly, Bachmann pivoted to attacking President Barack Obama’s health care law.

""I think that senior citizens across the country have no idea that President Obama plans for Medicare to collapse, and instead everyone will be pushed into Obamacare,"" Bachmann said. ""And just like Newt Gingrich said, the way that Obamacare runs, there's a board called IPAB. It's made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans. I don't want 15 political appointees to make a health care decision for a beautiful, fragile 85- year-old woman who should be making her own decision.""

We’re not sure what she means by when she says people will be pushed out of Medicare and into Obamacare. If what she means by ""Obamacare"" is the health care law, then the law assumes that Medicare will continue.

In fact, the law made a number of changes to Medicare intended to make it operate more efficiently and provide better care. One of those changes was the creation of a board called the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB.

Here, we’ll fact-check Bachmann’s claim that IPAB is ""made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans.""

We’ve looked at the board in some detail in a previous fact-check by PolitiFact Georgia.

Lawmakers created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare, the federal program that provides health care for seniors.

Under the health care reform bill, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time, it will be automatically implemented.  

IPAB has many critics. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule the board’s recommendations or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, some members of Congress have attempted  to repeal it.

Getting back to Bachmann’s statement, she’s right that there are 15 members of the IPAB and that they are political appointees. But that leaves out a lot of detail of the law’s requirements.

The law states that the members ""shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation and a balance between urban and rural representatives.""

It also says the board ""shall also include representatives of consumers and the elderly.""

And, it says individuals who are directly involved in providing or managing health care ""shall not"" constitute a majority of the board’s members.

The president appoints 12 of the 15 members, who undergo confirmation by the Senate.

Once appointed to the board, the members become full-time government employees and are not allowed to hold other full-time employment.

The IPAB is forbidden from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care,"" as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue.

What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing.

Bachmann said the IPAB ""will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans."" It is possible that private health insurance companies might look at the IPAB’s recommendations for cost-savings and efficiency and try those ideas for their own customers. But legally, the IPAB only has the power to suggest changes to Medicare, which includes 47 million beneficiaries.

Bachmann’s comments also give the impression that the IPAB makes decisions on individual cases. It does not. We looked at the claim that the board decides ""whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy,"" and rated it False.

Our ruling

Bachmann said, ""There's a board called IPAB. It's made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans."" There is a board with 15 members, and most are appointed through a political process, though they must have expertise in health care. But the board is intended to recommend cost savings for the Medicare program. It would not ""make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans."" We rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2011/oct/12/michele-bachmann/ipab-board-15-bureaucrats-who-will-decide-nation-s/

Jon Huntsman touts record on taxes, job creation in New Hampshire debate
","
During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., Jon Huntsman touted his achievements on both tax policy and job creation. 
""I created a flat tax in the state of Utah. It took that state to the number-one position in terms of job creation. 
We rated both of these claims previously. We’ll recap those analyses here. 
The flat tax 
When we first reported this item, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports from this spring and from 2007 that explained how he began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005. 
""We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states,"" Huntsman said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005. 
Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years. 
When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent.
  
This created a much flatter tax, stripping away most deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bonds or deducting withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts.
  
The research arm of the Utah Legislature says this was not a flat tax in the purest sense. ""Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people.)
  
Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit on state taxes a portion of their federal tax deductions and exemptions. The credit phases out and goes away for those making very high incomes in the state.
  
This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis.
  
""There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study.
  
Anti-tax groups have given Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax.
  
The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some ""minor blemishes""' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.)
  
So the system he and the Legislature enacted in Utah wasn’t a pure flat tax, since taxpayers may still make adjustments for certain financial factors -- but it is a flatter tax, and it includes one major defining factor of a flat tax, a single rate for all income groups.

Job creation

When we asked the Huntsman campaign in September for data to back up the claim, they directed us to a blog post at National Review Online, the website of the well-known conservative magazine. The item, posted June 20, 2011, compared employment statistics for several governors.

""During Huntsman’s tenure, January 2005 to August 2009, Utah had the best overall job-growth rate of any state in the nation,"" the item said. ""In that same time frame, Perry’s job-growth rate was 4.9 percent. (Minnesota Gov. Tim) Pawlenty’s job-growth rate was negative: The number of jobs in Minnesota decreased by 1.8 percent.""

At PolitiFact, we always double-check data in media reports against official statistics, so we did so here.

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment statistics. We looked at the Current Employment Statistics database for each of the 50 states and subtracted the number of jobs in January 2005 from the number in August 2009.

As it happens, this period was split between an expansion (2005 through 2007) and a deep recession (2008 and 2009), so a majority of states actually lost jobs over that period. Utah was not one of the job-losing states -- but it also wasn’t No. 1 in the nation, according to this set of statistics.

The states with the fastest employment growth over the period when Huntsman was governor were Wyoming, with a 9.5 increase; North Dakota, with 7.5 percent; Texas, with 6.5 percent; and Utah, with 4.8 percent.

So Huntsman’s claim gets a False, right? Not so fast.

When we showed our math to the Huntsman camp, they stood by their numbers. They sent us to a page for the state of Utah on the BLSwebsite that backed up the claim Huntsman made during the debate -- the number of jobs in Utah rose by 5.9 percent over the period. Using the equivalent pages for the other three states, we found that Utah exceeded them all -- Texas grew by 4.9 percent, as Huntsman indicated, while Wyoming grew by 4 percent and North Dakota grew by 3 percent.

Using these figures, Huntsman was correct. So what gives?

When we checked with the BLS, a spokesman explained that the way we calculated the numbers and the way the Huntsman camp calculated the numbers are different because the numbers come from different data sets. The data we used come from the Current Employment Statistics, a monthly study of the payroll data at 400,000 businesses, whereas the Huntsman campaign was using data from the Current Population Survey, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households.

Is one of these data set preferred in this context? The BLS’s answer is yes -- and the preferred method is not the one used by the Huntsman campaign. ""BLS uses changes in the payroll survey to describe job gain or loss,"" said spokesman Gary Steinberg.

We’ll note one additional factor. For claims like these, where elected officials suggest that they deserve credit for an achievement (or that their opponent deserves blame for a failure), PolitiFact attempts to determine whether the politician in question does in fact deserve credit or blame.

In the case of job creation, Huntsman, as governor, played some role, but there were so many other factors at play -- from the state of the national economy to the particular climate for specific industrial sectors in the state to broader demographic trends -- that we think it’s a stretch for Huntsman to claim a significant share of the credit. That’s particularly because he credited just one portion of his efforts in office, the tax overhaul, with the job-creation numbers.

Our ruling

Huntsman didn’t create a pure flat tax in Utah, but he did create a flatter one. As for jobs, the Utah economy did well, but was not the No. 1 job-creating state in the nation by the yardstick most economists, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, would use. And we don’t think it’s valid for Huntsman to claim as much credit as he does for himself and his tax changes for the jobs numbers. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

Perry switched to GOP at younger age than Reagan
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry wasn’t always a Republican.

His opponents like to remind him of that, as Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann did in a Republican presidential primary debate at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. And Perry likes to respond that another notable Republican once had a ""D"" behind his name too.

""I, like most people in the state of Texas and those southern states, grew up a Democrat. Michael Reagan and I were talking just the other day, Charlie, that I came to the Republican Party sooner in age than his dad, Ronald Reagan, did,"" Perry told debate moderator Charlie Rose on Oct. 11, 2011.

Perry said something similar to conservative commentator Sean Hannity during a radio appearance in August 2011. His words then, also repeated from a conversation with the former president’s son: ""I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.""

PolitiFact Texas checked it out. 
According to biographer Edward Yager, Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, ""was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.""

Yager said that he hadn’t seen copies of Reagan’s voter registration cards but that ""virtually all the sources that refer to"" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat.

He remained a Democrat even as he supported Republican presidential candidates, according to Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan’s presidential library.

The library’s website says Reagan made the switch and registered Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51.

As for Perry, born March 4, 1950, he won his first three political races for a Texas House seat as a Democrat, then switched parties in 1989 to challenge a Democratic agricultural commissioner. A Texas Tribune storysays Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29 of that year in a press conference outside the Texas Capitol.

On the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old, 12 years younger than Reagan when he made his switch. We rate Perry’s statement True. ",/factchecks/2011/oct/12/rick-perry/perry-switched-gop-younger-age-reagan/

Bachmann is on target on spending
","
Editor’s note: We originally published this item on Oct. 11, 2011, the night of a Republican presidential primary debate in New Hampshire. We thought Bachmann’s remark during the debate had the same ring as others we’ve checked, including one by Florida Senator Marco Rubio that ""40 cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed,"" as well as a similar statement by North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad and another by Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell. We rated each of those True, as well as Bachmann’s statement. However, an alert reader noticed that Bachmann’s statement didn’t match the others and told us we should have done our math differently. We looked again and found the reader is correct. We rated Bachmann’s claim based on government spending when we should have based it on revenues. So we have fact-checked her statement again, published this new analysis, and kept the rating True.

The U.S. government is living on credit, spending more than it receives and borrowing to keep up.

So Rep. Michele Bachmann says we need to tighten our belts.

""Our government right now -- this is significant -- we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in,"" Bachmann said during a Republican presidential debate on Oct. 11, 2011, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.

The Congressional Budget Office has released preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2011, which ended Sept. 30. According to the CBO’s chart, the federal government had revenues of $2.3 trillion and expenditures of $3.6 trillion, leaving a deficit of $1.3 trillion.

To calculate Bachmann’s figure of ""spending X percent more than what we take in"" -- the percent by which expenditures exceed revenues -- divide $3.6 trillion by $2.3 trillion. The answer: about 56 percent.

Two experts, one from the conservative Heritage Foundation and one from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, verified our math.

""If you say that spending is xx percent more than revenues, then the ratio is spending over revenues. So if you take in $2 and you spend $3, then you're spending 150 percent of revenues or you’re spending 50 percent more than you take in. That aligns with Bachman's language pretty closely,"" said JD Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Bachmann’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiry, but we suspect she was slightly off because she misstated a figure that has been cited by others in recent months.

""We're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend,"" Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said in January 2011 on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

And Scott Rigell, a Republican who represents Virginia’s Second District, said in a February 2011 press release, ""We are a nation $14 trillion in debt and are borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend.""

Those cases refer to the proportions of spending funded by taxes versus borrowing, said Richard Kogan of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Using the CBO’s new numbers, the proportion is 36 percent -- pretty close to 40 cents on the dollar. But Bachmann's claim referred to revenues (""what we take in""), so 56 percent is the right number.

Our ruling

Bachmann said, ""Our government right now -- this is significant -- we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in."" It turns out, she was actually lowballing the number. The correct percentage by which federal spending exceeded revenues in 2011 was 56 percent, not 40, but Bachmann’s broader point is correct. We rate her statement True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/12/michele-bachmann/bachmann-right-spending/

Mitt Romney says rising government share threatens free economy
","
During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney reprised two talking points about the government’s role in the economy. During the time of President John F. Kennedy, Romney said, ""the government at all levels -- federal, state and local -- was consuming about 27 percent of the U.S. economy. Today it consumes about 37 percent of the U.S. economy. It's on track to get to 40 percent. We cease at some point to be a free economy."" 
We checked prior versions of these statements in two separate items. Here, we’ll recap both in a single item. 
In the early 1960s, all levels of government were ""consuming about 27 percent of the U.S. economy,"" a number that has risen to 37 percent today. 
We found that the numbers Romney cited were close to correct -- but he also left out some important context. 
The Percentages 
The Office of Management and Budget produces a table every year that tracks total government expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. Here are the statistics for the years in question: 
Fiscal year 1961: 27.4 percent
Fiscal year 1962: 27.8 percent
Fiscal year 1963: 27.7 percent 
Fiscal year 2009: 36.5 percent
Fiscal year 2010: 35.0 percent 
Romney’s figures aren’t exact. But he’s got the general pattern correct. 
However, using the big-picture numbers is only part of the story. Digging deeper into the numbers provides a much fuller sense of what’s going on. For simplicity, we’ll choose the 1963 and 2010 figures for a more detailed analysis. Once again, the listed figures are expressed as a percentage of GDP and are rounded. 
1963 
Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 9.8 percent
Federal net interest expenditures: 1.5 percent
Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 2.6 percent
Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 2.6 percent
Federal spending in all other categories: 2.3 percent
State and local government: 8.9 percent
Total: 27.7 percent 
2010 
Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 5.1 percent
Federal net interest expenditures: 1.4 percent
Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 8.4 percent
Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 7.3 percent
Federal spending in all other categories: 1.6 percent
State and local government: 11.1 percent
Total: 35.0 percent 
Behind the numbers 
So let’s look at the components of government that expanded and contracted between 1963 and 2010. 
Defense spending was cut almost in half as a percentage of GDP, as was ""other spending."" Net interest barely budged, while state and local government increased by about one-fifth. 
But the big increases came from two categories: Social Security and Medicare, which more than tripled as a share of GDP, and other federal payments to individuals, which fell slightly short of tripling. 
First, we should note that Medicare didn’t exist until 1965, so a big share of the increase Romney pointed to stems from this single program. 
More important, there’s something that ties together all of these fast-growing expenditures: They are all payments made by the government to individuals. 
Why is this important? It’s a question of control, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, when we originally reported the item. These transfer payments, as they are known, ""can be more or less freely spent by private individuals,"" Burtless said. ""Your mom can spend her Social Security check any way she wants -- on food, shelter, vacations at Disney World or deposits in her bank account or her favorite mutual fund. Even cash public assistance recipients have pretty wide freedom over how they spend their welfare checks."" 
Some transfer payments are more restrictive, such as food stamps or Medicare and Medicaid benefits, but even these still allow some degree of consumer choice. ""This distinction is important for a simple reason,"" Burtless said. While lawmakers and government officials have direct say over many types of government expenditures, ""their say over government transfers is a lot more restricted."" 
In addition, he said, many government transfer payments ""are paid for with earmarked taxes – FICA and unemployment insurance taxes. When we get transfers from the government under Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, we’re getting back the money that we or our employers contributed when we were working."" 
So how would taking this into account change the equation? If you subtract the share for federal transfer payments from figures above, it turns out that government spending as a percentage of GDP actually declined between 1963 and 2010, from 22.5 percent to 19.3 percent. 
And this trend is confirmed if you use a different data set. The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes statistics that break down the components of national GDP. If you take the category ""government consumption expenditures and gross investment"" for all levels of government -- a figure that doesn’t include transfer payments -- and divide it by GDP, government accounted for 22.0 percent of GDP in 1963 and 20.7 percent of GDP in 2010. 
So Romney’s numbers are nearly correct, but they don’t tell the whole story. 
Yes, government spending has risen as a share of GDP, but the actual control on spending exerted by government has not risen by anywhere near that amount, because the bulk of the growth has come in transfer payments that individual Americans ultimately control (and, in many cases, under programs which they had paid into to begin with). On balance, we rated that part of the statement Mostly True. 
With that trendline, ""we cease at some point to be a free economy."" 
This marks the third time we’ve rated Romney’s claim that the United States is on the verge of ceasing to be a free-market economy. 
Here are some of the statistics to consider: 
Government  spending. On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. 
For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited. 
Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that Romney is ""implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent,"" Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s percentage of GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit. 
And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion.""It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom,"" Bartlett said in an interview for our original fact-check. ""Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about."" 
Here are a few other statistics to consider. 
Taxes. Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011. 
And as weconcluded in a separate fact-check, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. 
Regulation.""One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others,"" J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us when we first checked the claim. 
Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.) 
However, there’s strong evidence undercutting Romney's claim that comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation. 
Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011 -- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom. 
Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the ""mostly free"" category. The only nations to be considered more ""free"" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark. 
For the U.S. to fall into the ""mostly unfree"" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan. 
So where does this leave us? It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank. 
In June, we found this claim ridiculous. In August, we did again. Now, in October, we do for a third time, once again rating this part of Romney's statement Pants on Fire.

José Rodríguez says El Paso was named 'Safest Large City'
","After mentioning El Paso in the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry continued: ""It is not safe on that (Texas-Mexico) border.""

Democratic state Sen. José Rodríguez of El Paso countered in a press release two days later: ""The reality is that El Paso was named the ‘Safest Large City in the United States’ in 2010, just one year after San Antonio, Houston and Dallas had the highest crime rates in the nation. In fact, last year, when El Paso reported just 7 murders, Perry’s home city of Austin reported 37,"" Rodríguez said. ""Why isn’t he talking about that?""

Mild beef: Rodríguez aired slightly incorrect murder counts. In 2010, five murders occurred in El Paso, not seven, and 38 murders occurred in Austin, not 37, the cities’ police departments told us. Rodríguez spokeswoman Emily Amps Mora attributed the incorrect figures to typos. Also, five was El Paso’s lowest number of murders since 1965, and 38 was an unusually high number for Austin.

But was El Paso deemed the ""Safest Large City"" in the United States after other Texas cities led the nation in crime?

El Paso’s low crime rates have been noted for years. We looked at murder rates and overall crime rates, using FBI numbers, for the five Texas cities Rodríguez named: El Paso had the lowest rate per 100,000 residents in both categories each year from 2001 through 2010. In 2010, El Paso's murder rate was 0.8 murders per 100,000 residents. Rates for the other cities ranged from 4.8 for Austin to 11.8 for Houston.

The so-called ""El Paso Miracle"" has drawn outside attention, particularly as violence has increased next door in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, a city of 1.3 million which had more than 3,000 murders last year. The Texas Tribune, San Antonio Express-News and El Paso Times have recently written about El Paso’s low crime. Factors aired for the low crime rates include the presence of multiple federal agencies policing the border as well as the area’s high percentage of Hispanic residents (more than 80 percent), including Hispanic immigrants, a group described in a 2009 New York Times news story on El Paso’s safety as tending to be ""cautious, law-abiding and respectful of authority.""

But ""Safest Large City"" is still an eye-opening title; Amps Mora said she picked it up from a Nov. 21, 2010, City of El Paso press release. The release says: ""The latest rating by CQ Press names El Paso as the 1st Safest City followed by Honolulu, HI as the 2nd Safest City and New York, NY as the 3rd Safest City in the United States. This rating, developed by CQ Press, compares cities with a population of more than 500,000 people.""

CQ Press, a Washington, D.C.-based publisher, produces annual lists and books of crime statistics. However, it does not reward cities with ""Safest"" or ""Most Dangerous"" designations. In a Dec. 3, 2010, blog post, The Wall Street Journal said the annual reports stopped including such labels after CQ bought the reports’ publisher in 2007.

In an interview, Darrel Petry, spokesman for the El Paso Police Department, told us that the department solely used the ""Safest Large City"" designation in the Nov. 21 press release and did not repeat it, in part because of objections to CQ’s rankings immediately raised by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Regardless, El Paso did indeed top CQ’s 2010 ""Lowest Crime Rate"" list for cities with more than 500,000 residents.

Next, we looked at Rodríguez’s statement about San Antonio, Houston and Dallas, which Amps Mora told us was based on a 2010 Dallas Morning News blog post. The post spells out that among the nine U.S. cities over 1 million, the highest crime rates using 2009 numbers were in San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Jacksonville, Philadelphia and Phoenix. We got similar results, using FBI 2009 data for the standard categories of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft: San Antonio first, then Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York.

But again: These rankings are for cities over 1 million in population. There are only nine on that list (Chicago being excluded because it counted rapes differently) -- so it would be equally valid to say that in looking at lowest crime rates, San Antonio was No. 9 in the country.

So did San Antonio, Houston and Dallas have ""the highest crime rates in the nation,"" as Rodriguez said? No, it turns out. Using crime rates per 100,000 in all cities for which the FBI collected data in 2009’s Uniform Crime Reports, the five cities with the highest crime rates were Vernon, Calif., population 90; Industry, Calif., population 930; Black Hawk, Colo., population 104; Teterboro, N.J., population 17; and Mackinac Island, Mich., population 456. San Antonio is the first of the Texas cities cited by Rodriguez to land on this list of all cities -- in 472nd place.

Now, of course, that list we just rattled off is misleading, even ridiculous, because of the huge spread of population sizes among ""all"" U.S. cities. For a more serious comparison, we looked over crime statistics for cities with more than 500,000 residents.The five with the highest crime rates per 100,000 residents in the 2009 numbers were Memphis, Tenn.; Detroit; Atlanta; San Antonio; and Columbus, Ohio.

And finally, if we use CQ Press’ rankings for cities over 500,000 -- a list adjusted with the company’s particular methodology -- the five highest-crime cities were Detroit, Baltimore, Memphis, Washington D.C. and Atlanta. Houston, the first Texas city to crop up, was No. 9.

As we completed this check, we circled back to Amps Mora, who said by email that the senator's point holds. Objectively, by crime rates, she said, El Paso is safer than bigger Texas cities that also are not on the Texas-Mexico border.

Our ruling

El Paso has had low crime rates, and its murder rates are considerably below those of the other cited cities. But the statement is misleading in two meaningful ways. Only a City of El Paso press release named El Paso the nation’s ""safest"" large city--and its police department dropped the label. Also, the other Texas cities did not have the nation’s highest overall crime rates; that’s true only in comparison to a few huge cities. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/oct/11/jose-rodriguez/jose-rodriguez-says-el-paso-was-named-safest-large/

Bill Clinton attacks 'Buffet Rule' and President Barack Obama in new American Crossroads ad
","
American Crossroads, the conservative political group created by Karl Rove, is advancing President Barack Obama's trip to Orlando on Oct. 11, 2011, with a new television ad attacking Obama's plan to raise taxes on mainly wealthy Americans.

The ad, called ""Don't,"" also is running in Pennsylvania, and features a potentially powerful (and awkward) critic of Obama -- former President Bill Clinton.

The ad splices together television news reports highlighting Obama's plan to raise taxes a total of $1.5 trillion over 10 years, then pivots to Clinton. ""I personally don't believe we ought to be raising taxes,"" Clinton says in what appears to be an interview. ""It won't solve the problem.""

Between the lines ""we ought to be raising taxes,"" and ""it won't solve the problem,"" the ad jumps -- for just a split-second -- to some other image.
The cut-away caught our attention because we've seen instances where politician's words were cut in a way that would create a different impression.

Indeed, after further review, that's what American Crossroads did here.

The video of Clinton grabbed by American Crossroads comes from a 25-minute September 2011 interview Clinton did with the conservative news website Newsmax.com. The interview was set up in New York, where Clinton was holding the 10th annual meeting of his Clinton Global Initiative project.

We found the original Newsmax.com video. The two lines quoted by American Crossroads come more than three minutes apart, as Clinton was delivering a meandering answer on how to create jobs and fix the flailing American economy.

When American Crossroads quoted Clinton as saying, ""I personally don't believe we ought to be raising taxes,"" they clipped Clinton's full comments short. Here's the full quote, including what American Crossroads left out:

""I personally don't believe we ought to be raising taxes or cutting spending -- either one -- until we get this economy off the ground. This has been a dead flat economy. And you don't want in something this flat ... if we cut government spending, which I normally would be inclined to do when the deficit's this big, with interest rates near zero you can't get the benefits of it.""

So Clinton was as much deriding spending cuts as he was a plan to raise taxes.

Clinton went on to praise Obama's plan to continue cuts to the payroll tax, saying it's a proven way to help the economy, before spinning off into a discussion of former President Ronald Reagan and former House Speaker Tip O'Neill.

Later in the interview the second half of the quote comes up. But again, it's shortened.

""I would pay it,"" Clinton said, referring to a millionaire's tax (though Clinton said that many wealthy New Yorkers like himself wouldn't be affected because they already pay high state and local income taxes that can then be deducted from your federal tax bill).

""It's okay with me, I'd pay more,"" he said. ""But it won't solve the problem.""

After the American Crossroads ad was released, Clinton fired back saying the group wrongly implied his opposition to Obama's plan to raise taxes on the wealthy -- sometimes referred to as the ""Buffett Rule"" -- as well as Obama's jobs plan.

""The Republican group American Crossroads has used a quote from me in a video opposing President Obama's jobs plan and the 'Buffett Rule,'"" he said in the statement provided to POLITICO. ""The advertisement implies that I opposed the 'Buffett Rule.' In fact, I support both the American Jobs Act and the 'Buffett Rule.' I believe that it's only fair to ask those of us in high-income groups -- who have received the primary benefits of the last decade's economic growth and the majority of its tax cuts as well -- to contribute to solving our long term debt problem.

""What I did say was that the 'Buffett Rule' cannot solve the problem alone. Reducing the debt requires three things: more economic growth, more spending cuts, and more revenue,"" he said.

American Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio defended the ad's quoting of Clinton to PolitiFact Florida, noting that a 30-second ad cannot run two-minute-plus quotes and that the ""quotes selected for the ad are the most succinct and relevant clips of Clinton's Newsmax interview, and fairly represent his views.""

We see it differently. The ad suggests that Clinton opposes Obama's plan to raise taxes on the wealthy as a means of reducing the deficit. By our review of the interview, Clinton actually appeared to straddle that fence. At one point, he said that he didn't think the country should raise taxes ""until we get this economy off the ground."" At another point, he said he'd be ""okay"" with the tax and willing to pay it, though he said in his particular case, he probably won't be affected.

At the least, American Crossroads is guilty of cherry-picking parts of Clinton's statement to best fit into the narrative of its ad. But we think they go one step further by cutting out critical pieces of evidence -- namely that Clinton said he would be ""okay"" with higher taxes for the wealthy and that he'd pay additional taxes if he was required to.

Clinton's voice and image were no doubt selected specifically because it'd be a stinging rebuke of Obama's policies -- from a fellow Democrat.

But viewer beware. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2011/oct/11/american-crossroads/bill-clinton-attacks-buffet-rule-and-president-bar/

Fox Business reporter wrong about history of Sunday voting in Georgia
","Speaking about the controversial new elections law passed by Republicans in Georgia, Fox Business Network reporter Edward Lawrence wrongly claimed that the law’s provisions around early voting will allow Georgians to vote on Sundays for the first time. ""The fact is the law expands early voting to include Saturdays and Sundays,"" Lawrence said April 2 on Fox News. ""Sunday was never used before as a voting day in Georgia."" That’s inaccurate. Sundays have been popular early voting days in Georgia for years among Black voters who use ""souls to the polls"" events to mobilize church goers to the ballot box.  In the 2020 general election, approximately 65,000 votes were cast on Sundays, said Walter Jones, a spokesperson for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office. Fox News did not offer comment for this fact-check. After Georgia voters sent President Joe Biden and a pair of Democratic senators to Washington in the 2020 elections, the state’s GOP lawmakers drafted bills that they said would protect the vote, despite the fact that the state’s elections officials said the elections were safe and secure. The law signed by Republican Gov. Brain Kemp made several changes to elections in the state, including adjustments related to early voting on the weekends leading up to Election Day.  In 2020, counties had to offer one Saturday for early voting, and they had the option to make an additional Saturday and two Sundays available for early voting. The new law requires counties to provide two Saturdays of early voting and gives them the option of also offering two Sundays. Georgia Republicans had initially proposed scrapping Sunday early voting altogether, but they backtracked following criticism. Voting after Sunday church services is a tradition for Black communities in Georgia and across the country that traces back decades to the civil rights movement. The phrase ""souls to the polls"" started being used in Florida in the 1990s, according to David D. Daniels III, a professor of church history at McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago. Sunday early voting was first allowed in Georgia in 2014, and it has been available for every state and federal election since then, Jones said.  Not every Georgia county has allowed Sunday voting in the past. The text of the new law says that ""more than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday."" But a list provided by the Georgia secretary of state’s office shows that during the 2020 general election, the 16 counties that offered Sunday early voting included several of the state’s most populous, such as Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKalb, Chatham, Clayton and Richmond counties. In Gwinnett County northeast of Atlanta, early voting for the Nov. 3 election was offered Sunday, Oct. 18, and Sunday, Oct. 25. Early voting data provided by the county — the state’s second largest — shows that over 19,000 voters cast their ballots on those Sundays. Black voters made up roughly 37% of those who voted early on Sundays in Georgia, even as Black people make up about 32% of the state’s population, the New York Times reported, citing internal data from Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group. The Center for New Data, a nonprofit research group, also found that in 107 of Georgia’s counties, African Americans voted at a higher rate on weekends than voters in the same counties who identify as white.  Strong turnout among Black voters was considered key to the Democratic victories in 2020. Lawrence said, ""Sunday was never used before as a voting day in Georgia."" That’s not accurate. Early voting on Sundays has been allowed in Georgia for every federal and state election since 2014, although many counties have never offered it. For the 2020 general election, several of the state’s most populous counties offered Sunday early voting, and approximately 65,000 votes were cast on Sundays statewide. We rate Lawrence’s statement False.

No, report does not say Biden administration is busing migrants to red states
","With preliminary data showing border crossings at their highest in 15 years, social media posts attacked President Joe Biden as being up to something politically sinister. The claims were hung on a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that argues for low levels of immigration. ""Report: Biden Admin Busing ‘Thousands’ of Illegals to Red States to Get Permanent Status,"" was the way one widely shared headline put it.  In other words, the article under the headline alleged, the Biden administration is busing migrants to Republican-leaning states in an effort to add Democratic voters there. The headline and others like it were highlighted to PolitiFact by Vinesight, a company that monitors online misinformation. The original report, however, says the buses are taking migrants ""throughout the nation’s interior"" — not to red states in particular. Moreover, migrants must become permanent residents for at least three or five years before they become eligible for citizenship, which is required in order to vote.  The report, which provides more of a detailed narrative than a data-based study, was written by the center’s Todd Bensman, a former journalist and former counterterrorism unit manager at the Texas Department of Public Safety. Describing the scene in Del Rio, Texas, a city on the Mexico border 150 miles west of San Antonio, Bensman wrote: ""As best as the Center for Immigration Studies can determine from interviews and scattered media reporting, the buses are leaving regularly from Del Rio, the Texas Rio Grande Valley communities, and Laredo, but the busing also appears to be going on in Arizona, as well as in California. ""Where are the buses going? They often drop their Haitian, Venezuelan and Cuban passengers in Florida and New Jersey. Those from Nicaragua and other Central American nations have been delivered to Tennessee, Massachusetts, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and to large cities in Texas such as Dallas and Houston."" The article does not indicate how many migrants are being bused to any particular state. Of the 10 states mentioned, most are not reliably red states, in terms of presidential elections. Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Texas are swing states. All were decided by less than six percentage points in the 2020 race. New Jersey and Massachusetts are blue, or Democratic-leaning states. That leaves only Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky as states that are reliably red. And though the report says these migrants could ""pursue more permanent legal status later,"" there is no indication that this is a voting scheme. Only citizens can vote in U.S. elections and the path to becoming a citizen takes years.   We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2021/apr/07/blog-posting/no-report-does-not-say-biden-administration-busing/

Tim Scott overlooks Colorado’s massive vote-by-mail system in Georgia comparison
","Republicans are heaping scorn on Major League Baseball for moving the All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver in protest of Georgia’s new voting laws. MLB joined Georgia-based businesses like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines in voicing its opposition to the legislation. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., took a swing at the league and the new game venue, tweeting that Georgia actually offers more days for early voting — 17, compared with Colorado’s 15 days. ""The MLB is moving the All Star Game out of Atlanta which has more day-of voting rights than Colorado?"" Scott tweeted April 6, 2021. Georgia: Voter ID, 17 days of early voting.Colorado: Voter ID, 15 days of early voting.Atlanta is 51% Black.Denver is 9.2% Black.The @MLB is moving the #MLBAllStarGame out of ATL which has more day-of voting rights than CO? The Wokes are at it again, folks. 
Day-of voting rights refers to access to voting on Election Day, either in person or through dropboxes. On this issue, Scott is off the mark. Colorado allows election day registration, while in Georgia, registration closes about a month earlier.  Colorado also makes greater use of dropboxes, keeping them open until the evening on election day for voters to submit their ballots. Under Georgia’s new law, drop boxes are pulled the Friday before the election. Scott’s spokesperson Ken Farnaso said there was a ""mistype"" in the tweet, and it should have said ""more days of voting rights."" So we checked the claim on that basis, too, and found that he left out important context in comparing voting in Colorado with Georgia. Georgia’s new law expanded early voting by one day. The rules already required early voting for three weeks before election day, but only required that local officials include a single Saturday in that period. The new law requires two Saturdays, so Scott’s figure of 17 days fits. And the law allows for as many as 19 days. Colorado says that early voting centers must open 15 days before an election. ""The point of the tweet was to show that Georgia has more days to vote in person than Colorado, contrary to the left’s narrative that it restricts early voting,"" Farnaso said. But Scott’s comparison overlooks that the two states run their elections in very different ways. Colorado relies almost entirely on mail-in ballots. The state sends every registered voter a ballot, and all they have to do is fill it out and put it in the mail in time. ""Colorado has less of a need to rely on in-person voting than Georgia does because fewer of Colorado’s voters cast in-person votes,"" said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald. Data from the last general elections in both states show 94% of Colorado voters cast their ballots by mail, while in Georgia, 26% did. As for early voting, 3% of Colorado voters used that option, compared with over half in Georgia. 
""There are no reports of long voting lines in Colorado at the state’s vote centers, and the state has the second highest turnout rate in the country,"" McDonald said. ""Compared to Georgia, there is less evidence of a need for Colorado to provide more voting options."" Scott cited the rules for early voting to say that Georgia has more days for in-person voting than Colorado. But the comparison doesn’t account for Colorado’s universal vote-by-mail option. When 94% of voters mail their ballots, early voting days play a nominal role in elections. And in Colorado, voters have more options to register and use dropboxes on election day. Scott’s claim has a thread of accuracy, but what it leaves out creates a misleading impression about how voting access compares in the two states.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin partly right that drug price hikes outpace inflation
","U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is revisiting a problem she’s fought against more than once during her time in office: high drug prices.  The Wisconsin Democrat — joined by colleagues on both sides of the aisle — reintroduced legislation on March 23, 2021 that would require manufacturers to disclose and justify their decisions to increase prescription drug costs. Baldwin previously co-sponsored the bill with the late U.S. Sen. John McCain and highlighted it during her 2018 reelection bid.  The latest announcement from Baldwin and U.S. Sens. Mike Braun, R-Indiana, Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, painted an urgent picture of ""skyrocketing"" prices and argued the bill would ensure transparency for taxpayers.  ""Over the past decade, drug prices have risen at three times the rate of inflation,"" the news release stated. Does this claim add up? When asked for evidence to support the statement, Baldwin’s office pointed to two studies that analyzed the relationship between drug prices and inflation.  A study published in March 2020 looked at the prices of branded medications from 2007 to 2018 and found list prices increased by 159% over that time period and 9.1% per year. Researchers also determined that the drugs’ net prices — adjusted for discounts and rebates — increased 60%, or an average of 4.5% per year.  That was 3.5 times faster than the inflation rate, the study noted, which lines up with the figure Baldwin cited. But researchers didn’t touch on generic drugs, which make up the lion’s share of the market — some 90% of prescriptions. That said, despite accounting for just 10% of all prescriptions, brand-name drugs make up about 75% of all drug spending, according to recent congressional testimony from Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The same is true within the Medicaid program. According to a 2019 analysis from the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, spending on brand-name drugs increased from 76.6% to 80.5% from 2014 to 2017 even though generics exceeded 80% of all drug claims. ""There are a lot of essential medicines that are still available only in brand names,"" Kesselheim told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Another analysis cited by Baldwin’s office from the Kaiser Family Foundation looked at changes in pricing for both brand-name and generic drugs in a single year.  According to that study, the prices of half of all drugs covered under Medicare Part D — which amounts to more than 1,600 medications — increased more than the rate of inflation from July 2018 to July 2019. The median price hike among those drugs was 6.4% — more than 3 times the inflation rate of 1.8% that year.  Researchers also determined that 45 medications used by more than 1 million enrollees — including 38 generics — outpaced inflation with a median price increase of 5.7%. So, that part of the study bolsters Baldwin’s claim.  But the Kaiser study also found the increase in cost of 419 drugs was below inflation, while another 1,241 saw price decreases. And since that study limited its timeframe to one year, it doesn’t speak to the decade-long trend Baldwin referenced.  In a news release, Baldwin and her Senate colleagues claimed ""over the past decade, drug prices have risen at three times the rate of inflation."" One study that lines up with Baldwin’s claim doesn’t account for generic drugs, and the other only looks at one year of cost increases. But experts say brand-name drug prices in particular have outpaced inflation for years — some at the rate Baldwin referenced — and account for most of the spending on prescriptions. That leaves us with a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition for Half True. ",/factchecks/2021/apr/07/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-tammy-baldwin-generally-right-drug-price-hi/

Roy Blunt incompletely characterizes Joe Biden’s corporate tax rate proposal
","The White House and congressional Republicans are squaring off over President Joe Biden’s infrastructure proposal, with both sides zeroing in on the corporate tax rate, a major source of funding for the new initiatives. Biden is proposing to raise the federal tax rate on corporations from 21% to 28%. That’s below the 35% rate that was in place prior to the tax law signed by President Donald Trump in 2017. But Republicans say that an increase to 28% would leave the United States at a competitive disadvantage to other nations with lower corporate tax rates. (Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a moderate Democrat whose support will be needed to pass any such bill, has already said he opposes any increase beyond 25%.) In an April 4 appearance on Fox News Sunday, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., reiterated the argument that the United States can’t afford to increase its corporate tax rate to 28%. ""If we went back to 28%, I think we'd be No. 2 in the world in corporate taxes,"" Blunt said. Blunt has a point, but he left out some important wording. To make the most complete country-to-country comparisons, experts generally look at a country’s national corporate tax rate plus a weighted average of tax rates for its sub-national units. (In the case of the U.S., that would be states that have corporate income tax rates.) While the national rate under Biden’s plan would be 28%, experts have calculated that the national plus sub-national rate would average out to 32.34% under the proposal. Every year, the Tax Foundation collects the corporate tax rates for essentially every nation and subdivision. By their calculations, Biden’s proposed combined corporate tax rate would rank 20th in the world.  ""Looking at the highest corporate tax rates all around the world, this is incorrect,"" said Elke Asen, a policy analyst with the Tax Foundation. Eric Toder, the co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed with this assessment. Here’s a list of the top 25 corporate tax rates in the world if Biden’s proposal was enacted as is. (The Tax Foundation’s list includes some autonomous and quasi-autonomous regions that levy their own corporate tax rate, such as Puerto Rico and American Samoa, which are U.S. territories.)   But there’s an important caveat: Most of the countries with higher corporate tax rates than Biden’s proposal are relatively small economies. Of the larger economies, only Brazil would have a higher combined rate, and France and Portugal would be just slightly lower. Katie Boyd, a spokesperson for Blunt, said that the senator was intending to compare the United States with the larger economies. Biden’s combined rate would be higher than every country in the two groups of advanced industrialized nations — the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of Seven. A look at all OECD members shows the Biden proposal would be higher than any other member’s combined rate, with Portugal coming closest.   Looking only at the national rate, the Biden proposal would be tied for seventh among the OECD’s 38 nations, behind Australia (30%), France (32%), Colombia (32%), Costa Rica (30%), Mexico (30%), and Portugal (30%), and tied with New Zealand (28%). That would rank in the top one-fifth of OECD nations. Blunt said Biden’s proposal would put the U.S. ""No. 2 in the world"" for the highest corporate tax rate. Strictly speaking, Blunt is incorrect: If Biden’s proposal is enacted as is, at least 19 countries would still have a higher corporate tax rate, when national and sub-national tax rates are combined. However, with the exception of Brazil, these are mostly small economies. If you instead compare the United States to other advanced industrialized nations, Blunt has a point: The combined national and sub-national tax rate under Biden’s proposal would be higher than any other OECD country, and the 28% national tax rate alone would rank in the top one-fifth of OECD countries.

During an appearance on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm made the case for Biden’s 28% target. ""You recall that, just a few years ago, the tax rate for corporate taxes was 35%, and when Donald Trump passed his corporate and tax cuts for the wealthy package, he dropped it to a point that nobody was even asking for, which was 21%,"" Granholm said during the April 4 interview. ""So, what Joe Biden is saying is, let's put it to a reasonable middle. Let's put us in line with other industrial nations, which is at 28%."" We looked at whether Biden’s proposal would ""put us in line with other industrial nations"" on corporate taxation. The reality is that the new U.S. rate would be either the top rate or in the top one-fifth of rates, depending on which metric you use. To make the most complete county-to-country comparisons, experts generally look at a country’s national corporate tax rate plus a weighted average of tax rates for its sub-national units. (In the case of the U.S., that would be states that have corporate income tax rates.) While the national rate under Biden’s plan would be 28%, experts have calculated that the national plus sub-national rate would average out to 32.34% under the proposal. We looked at both measurements, using data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, a group of 38 economically advanced nations that is often used as a proxy for the ""industrial nations"" to which Granholm was referring. Using the more expansive tax rate — national plus sub-national corporate taxation — enactment of Biden’s proposal would put the United States highest in the rankings of advanced nations for corporate taxation. The closest would be Portugal, with a 31.5% combined rate. By this standard, Granholm is wrong. By comparison, the United States’ current 25.76% combined corporate tax rate ranks a little higher than the median for advanced countries. Here’s the full list:   Biden’s proposal ""would put us at the top of the OECD, though only slightly above some of the other major economies,"" said Eric Toder, the co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Taking an even more elite selection of world economies, the Group of Seven industrial nations, the proposed rate would also rank No. 1. The United States’ 32.34% combined rate would exceed that of Germany (29.9%), Japan (29.74%), Italy (27.81%), Canada (26.47%), France (25.83%), and the United Kingdom (19%). Looking at the national rate by itself changes the equation somewhat, but the United States remains near the top of the OECD rankings. Biden’s proposed 28% rate would be tied for seventh among the 38 nations, behind Australia (30%), France (32%), Colombia (32%), Costa Rica (30%), Mexico (30%), and Portugal (30%), and tied with New Zealand (28%).    In other words, the U.S. would rank in the top one-fifth of OECD nations.  By comparison, the United States’ current national corporate tax rate of 21% would be a better fit for the phrase ""in line"" with other industrial nations, as Granholm put it. The current 21% rate puts the United States broadly in the middle of the pack.  As for the G-7, the United States’ 28% national rate would rank second to France (32%) and ahead of Italy (24%), Japan (23.2%), United Kingdom (19%), Germany (15.8%) and Canada (15%). Granholm’s office focused on the national rate, arguing that national policy is the only thing the administration can control, and said it considers being tied for seventh in the OECD to be roughly in line with other industrialized countries.  They added that, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the United States has the lowest share of its GDP stemming from corporate taxation of any of the G-7 countries. That’s due in part to the United States’ current rate being the lowest of the G-7 countries except the United Kingdom. Granholm said Biden’s corporate tax rate increase would ""put us in line with other industrial nations."" Using the most expansive measure, a combination of the national and sub-national rates, the United States after enactment of Biden’s proposal would actually rank the highest of any of the 38 countries in the OECD, which is often used as a proxy for leading industrial nations. Using just the national rate, the U.S. would rank below Australia, France, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Portugal, and would be tied with New Zealand (28%). But that would still be in the top one-fifth of advanced countries. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/apr/06/jennifer-granholm/jennifer-granholm-spins-comparison-joe-bidens-corp/

COVID-19 vaccines have not led to 6,000% increase in patient deaths, as post suggests
","An Instagram post shares a startling headline on the reportedly sharp increase in the number of vaccine-related deaths during the coronavirus pandemic. ""6000% Increase in Reported Vaccine Deaths 1st Quarter 2021 Compared to 1st Quarter 2020,"" reads the screenshot of an article published on April 1 from a website called Truth Unmuted. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post includes as its caption a copy-and-paste of the full article, which appears to have originated from another site called Health Impact News. It asserts that the data show a link between the increase in reported deaths and the recent introduction of COVID-19 vaccines. It claims all vaccine-related deaths reported since January to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a federally maintained database that records health issues that occur after vaccinations, dramatically rose by more than 6,000% compared to the same time frame in 2021. Between Jan. 1 and March 19, 2020, 36 people were reported to have died in connection to a vaccination, according to the article. During that period in 2021, 2,213 people were reported to have died. ""The increase in deaths reported is most certainly related to the new experimental COVID injections, and yet the CDC and FDA’s position is that NOT ONE of these deaths are related to the COVID injections,"" according to the article. It’s a frightening statistic — but the article’s findings are a misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the numbers reported by VAERS. Maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, the VAERS database contains what it describes as ""unverified"" reports of adverse events that follow vaccines. The system allows almost anyone — from a doctor to a nurse to a pharmacist to a patient or parent — to enter in any information about illnesses or medical issues that follow someone receiving a vaccine. The information is collected so that officials can spot possible trends or side effects related to particular vaccines. The CDC has a lengthy disclaimer on its database landing page that says, in part: ""While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically."" Before clicking on the database, one must acknowledge having read this disclaimer. Our attempt to recreate the figures reported in the article yielded slightly different results as VAERS is constantly updating and numbers can ""change from week to week,"" according to the database. But when we searched on April 5, we found data that was pretty close to what the claim suggests: there were 30 reported deaths following vaccinations in the period between January 2020 and March 2020 compared to 1,813 during that same period in 2021. That’s an increase of just under 6,000%. And of those deaths, VAERS reports that 1,770 followed COVID-19 vaccinations.   But it’s inaccurate and misleading to say these deaths were caused by COVID-19 vaccines.  While federal public health officials, including the CDC and the FDA, are monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, there is no evidence linking these deaths to vaccines — and officials follow up on every report of death to learn more. ""A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths,"" the CDC says. ""To date, VAERS has not detected patterns in cause of death that would indicate a safety problem with COVID-19 vaccines."" The majority of people who received the COVID-19 vaccines during this period were older adults, many in nursing homes, said Susan S. Ellenberg, a professor of biostatistics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. ""If you take a group of 10 million people over the age of 65, how many would be expected to die in a period of two months? That number is not trivial,"" she said. ""And because of all the publicity about the vaccines, any death following the vaccine is likely to raise suspicion, even if the person who died was 88 years old and was diabetic, a smoker, and already had had a couple of heart attacks."" Ellenberg said comparing the two years is also meaningless as the vaccines that were administered in 2020 would have been around for a long time and without the same level of attention that has been given to COVID-19 vaccines administered during an historic pandemic. Most vaccines in 2020 were also given to infants and toddlers. Despite these warnings, anti-vaccination groups and skeptics frequently cite these figures from VAERS, as well as a similar database maintained by the European Union, stripped of their context and proof of a vaccine’s lethality. This has frequently become a common occurrence for the COVID-19 vaccines. PolitiFact has previously debunked a number of such claims. The CDC has maintained the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness as more than 167 million doses have been administered to people in the United States. An Instagram post shared an article claiming ""6000% Increase in Reported Vaccine Deaths 1st Quarter 2021 Compared to 1st Quarter 2020."" The article is based on a misrepresentation of information from a federally maintained database of suspected adverse reactions to vaccinations, including the COVID-19 vaccines. The database cautions users the numbers reported should not be taken as fact since they have not been verified through independent scientific study. Millions of people across the United States have been given a COVID-19 vaccination and not enough research has been done to show a definitive link between the vaccines and any of the reported adverse reactions.

Katie Pavlich falsely claims Biden administration is ‘engaging in,’ ‘enabling’ human trafficking
","As new migrant arrivals continue to strain U.S. immigration facilities, Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich falsely accused President Joe Biden’s administration of abetting human traffickers. Speaking on ""The Five"" about a video that officials said showed smugglers dropping two young children over a fence at the U.S. border with Mexico, Pavlich said April 1: ""Unfortunately, those little girls getting dropped over the fence is probably the least horrific thing that happened to them when they were being smuggled. And the Biden administration is engaging in human trafficking because they are enabling this to happen. And then they are taking these kids and delivering them to unvetted 'sponsors' in the United States. And when that happened under Obama, we found out a lot of those people were actually sex offenders themselves. So, they are enabling, and they are part of this third leg of this human trafficking process from Central America."" Pavlich made similar claims in a March 19 op-ed, writing that the Biden administration’s policy of not expelling unaccompanied children means that the U.S. is ""finalizing thousands of criminal transactions and completing human trafficking missions"" for smugglers across the border. But experts in immigration and human trafficking said Pavlich’s statement was inaccurate.  The Biden administration is not engaging or enabling human trafficking, they agreed. And the video of the two young children showed migrant smuggling, not human trafficking. ""The statement is totally false,"" said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor with the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. The biggest problem with Pavlich’s claim about human trafficking is that ""she’s alleging human trafficking when she’s talking about migrant smuggling,"" Correa-Cabrera said. The terms are different and not interchangeable. Human trafficking centers on exploitation, while smuggling centers on transportation, according to federal authorities. Under U.S. law and international protocols, human trafficking is defined according to the act, means and purpose of the crime. It involves the compulsion of a person into any form of labor through the use of force, fraud or coercion, and for the purpose of exploitation, Correa-Cabrera said. Transporting people over a border is not in and of itself an element of human trafficking. Nothing the Biden administration has done amounts to human trafficking, experts said. ""Using international definitions and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, which is what legislates and defines trafficking in the U.S., we have nothing close to that,"" Correa-Cabrera said. ""The government is not recruiting, transporting, transferring or harboring people for the purpose of exploiting them in any form — sexual exploitation, forced labor or anything else — and they are not using force, fraud or coercion to make that exploitation possible.""  Migrant smuggling occurs when smugglers transport migrants across borders for a fee and both parties consent, experts said. Smugglers can put migrants in danger, but it is not the same as trafficking. ""It is self-evident that this is not trafficking, as they (the Biden administration) are releasing the children to be reunited with their families,"" said David Kyle, associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis. ""So this is a very sensational and inaccurate framing of what we are looking at."" In a statement to PolitiFact, the Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has ""repeatedly warned"" about abuses by smugglers. Experts also rejected Pavlich’s claim that the Biden administration is enabling human trafficking by delivering unaccompanied minors to ""unvetted"" sponsors rather than swiftly expelling them. The Biden administration’s decision to take in minors despite the coronavirus pandemic is a change from the Trump administration and a reason for the crowding at the border. But not expelling minors has ""nothing"" to do with human trafficking, Correa-Cabrera said. She and other experts said such children could be escaping trafficking in their home countries. Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, associate professor and the director of the Arizona State University Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research, said that the Biden administration’s process for finding safe guardians for unaccompanied children is on par with past administrations. ""This system has not changed since the last administration, so whatever is being done now was done then as well,"" she said. ""All sponsors are very well vetted, but no system is perfect."" (In 2014, multiple migrant children were passed off to a human trafficking ring in an incident that spawned a congressional report and a criminal indictment, Snopes reported.) Currently, unaccompanied minors are transferred in the U.S. from Border Patrol to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Roe-Sepowitz said. They are then brought to shelters run by nonprofits, where trained staff work with them to determine who in the U.S. can take custody of them. ""The staff at the shelter spends many, many hours doing criminal checks on possible guardians (usually relatives) to make sure they are not sex offenders or sex traffickers,"" she said. It’s possible that the Biden administration’s reception of migrants at the border could lead to more smuggling, experts said. But human trafficking remains a separate issue, and experts noted that a lot of human trafficking in the U.S. involves only U.S. citizens. The Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization that combats human trafficking, said it’s seen no indication that the border situation has increased calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. In her op-ed, Pavlich referenced a 2011 court ruling from a federal judge in Texas as evidence in support of her claim.  In the order, Judge Andrew Hanen criticized the Obama administration over a case in which a mother living illegally in Virginia hired a woman to smuggle her daughter into the U.S. According to Hanen, Homeland Security officials delivered the daughter to her mother after arresting the smuggler. Hanen wrote that doing so amounted to ""completing the mission of the criminal conspiracy,"" and he described the smuggler several times as a human trafficker. Pavlich argued that the Biden administration has been doing the same thing by refusing to immediately expel unaccompanied children from the country.  But neither the Hanen order nor the video of young children at the border fence prove that the Biden administration is ""engaging in"" or ""enabling"" human trafficking. ""Are Biden policies unintentionally encouraging smuggling or protecting children by placing them with families?"" said Kyle, from the University of California, Davis. ""Perhaps all of the above, with several caveats, but definitely not abetting ‘trafficking.’"" Pavlich said, ""The Biden administration is engaging in human trafficking because they are enabling this to happen."" The Biden administration is not engaged in human trafficking, and experts rejected the idea that its policies for handling unaccompanied migrant children are enabling it to take place. Experts said Pavlich was confusing human trafficking — a practice that has a specific definition centered around exploitation — with migrant smuggling, which involves initial consent and crossing an international border.  The video Pavlich was responding to on ""The Five"" showed migrant smuggling, not trafficking. We rate this statement False. For help related to a case of human trafficking, the National Human Trafficking Hotline is available at 1-888-373-7888 or by email at [email protected].

Yes, the number of kids in Border Patrol custody is double 2019's peak
","Unaccompanied minors have been arriving at the southern U.S. border in record numbers since President Joe Biden took office, and Republican leaders in border states have been quick to highlight the challenges the federal government is facing. Gov. Greg Abbott has hammered the Biden administration on border issues throughout March. First he accused the administration of ""reckless border policies"" that have released migrants who tested positive for COVID-19 into the U.S. And in recent weeks, the governor has focused on the uptick of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border. On March 30, Abbott claimed in a tweet that ""twice as many children are in Border Patrol custody under Biden than Trump peak in 2019."" ""The Biden Admin. is unprepared for the crises they have caused,"" Abbott continued, adding that state police and National Guard forces have been dispatched to assist in the situation. 2019 was the last year border authorities recorded a surge in migrant children and family crossings. And authorities believe that the number of encounters this year will surpass levels seen then. But is it true that the number of unaccompanied minors in federal custody today is already twice the highest number recorded in 2019 under former President Donald Trump? Abbott’s claim cited an article published Tuesday by the Washington Examiner, a conservative Washington, D.C., news site. Citing ""federal data exclusively obtained Monday evening,"" the website reported the same claim.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed the numbers. Under Trump, the government recorded a peak of 2,600 unaccompanied minors in federal custody in June 2019. In 2020, the Trump administration stopped taking minors into custody after it implemented a policy that immediately expelled all people crossing the border, including children, citing COVID-19 precautions.  The Biden administration suspended that policy for children in January and now allows children who cross the border alone to remain in the U.S. while they await immigration court proceedings. U.S. Customs and Border Protection also released to PolitiFact a daily memo reporting the number of unaccompanied children in government custody. As of March 29, the number of unaccompanied children in custody was 5,160, which is nearly twice the number recorded in June 2019. The memo also reported that an average of 492 unaccompanied children were being placed in federal custody each day in March, while an average of 399 were being transferred out of custody daily. With facility intake consistently outpacing output, ""obviously, those numbers are going to stack up,"" a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official told reporters during a March 26 briefing. Migrant children can be held at Border Patrol facilities for a maximum of 72 hours, a rule set forth under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. From there, children are referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, within U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with providing care for the minors and connecting them with suitable sponsors.  But the strain the high number of migrant children has placed on the system has caused many minors to be held up at the Border Patrol facilities beyond the 72-hour limit. (The Trump administration also struggled with meeting that limit.) As of March 30, for instance, more than 2,000 children being held at a Border Patrol facility in Donna had been there for more than 72 hours, according to Pro Publica.  ""We need to do a better job of ensuring that HHS and ORR has greater capacity, and we need to speed up the transfer of these children from our custody to their custody much faster,"" the Border Patrol official said.  The Biden administration has raced to establish greater capacity in the Office of Refugee Resettlement to relieve the bottleneck within Border Patrol facilities. The agency has activated or opened what it calls influx care facilities, which are unlicensed care facilities that offer surplus shelter space and can be set up in a matter of weeks, and emergency intake sites, which are new facilities that serve as waystations for unaccompanied children moving from Border Patrol custody to Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, according to the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants.  Many of these new or temporary shelters have been opened across Texas. Influx care facilities now operate in Carrizo Springs and Pecos; emergency intake sites have been opened in a Dallas convention center and a former oil workers' camp in Midland.  It’s difficult to pinpoint the precise factors that are causing today’s numbers of unaccompanied children to double 2019’s peak, experts say.   Immigration experts often separate migration drivers into two categories: push factors, or the conditions in origin countries that are causing people to leave home; and pull factors, or the conditions of a destination country that make it a more attractive place to live.   Immigration policies in the U.S. are often listed as a significant pull factor, and Biden relaxing those policies following Trump’s immigration austerity is often cited as a significant one.  But many experts say that it’s the push factors in migrants’ home countries that are strong drivers of migration into the U.S. In 2019, Honduras struggled with civil unrest and an increase in gang violence, while Guatemalans wrestled with environmental issues that impacted the population’s food security.  This year, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua suffered two category-4 hurricanes that struck the region within a two-week span. With millions left in need of aid, the hurricanes exacerbated poverty and worsened access to clean water, giving an extra nudge to people considering northern migration.  ""The hurricanes made a huge difference,"" said Yael Schacher, senior U.S. advocate at Refugees International. ""People were in a situation where they were just getting by, and then the hurricane wiped them out.""  Abbott said in a tweet that twice as many unaccompanied children are in Border Patrol custody presently than during the peak number seen in 2019 under Trump.   Numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection verify this claim. The Trump administration recorded 2,600 minors in Border Patrol custody in June 2019, which was the highest amount seen during Trump’s term.  As of March 29, 5,160 minors were in Border Patrol custody waiting to be transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is 40 minors short of double 2,600.  We rate this claim True. ",/factchecks/2021/apr/06/greg-abbott/yes-number-kids-border-patrol-custody-double-2019s/

No sign that tax moves by Trump or Biden affected Ford car plans in Ohio, Mexico
","The United Auto Workers Union told its members at Ford Motor Co. in March that the automaker is backing out of a planned $900 million investment at an Ohio assembly plant and moving a key vehicle project to Mexico. A Facebook post attributes Ford’s apparent about-face to a shift in corporate tax policy between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The post begins by stating: ""Trump lowered taxes and in 2019 Ford made a commitment to invest $900 million at its Avon Lake, OH plant.""  Below that is a photo of Biden speaking and the text: ""I am increasing taxes and NOW the entire Ford project is moving to Mexico. I will always put other countries first."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are signs that Ford might be shifting plans for production of a new vehicle from Ohio to Mexico. But we didn’t find clear evidence from news reports or from Ford that the change is directly due to shifting tax policy. Meanwhile, the post leaves out context about other factors that influence automakers’ production decisions.   Mexico has long been an attractive production site for U.S. and foreign automakers because of its relatively low labor costs and trade agreements that make it economical to export Mexican-made vehicles around the world. But balancing production between the U.S. and Mexico is a politically delicate task. As a candidate and as president, Trump continually pressured Ford and other automakers to boost manufacturing in the U.S. and reduce their dependence on Mexico, including threatening a border tax on imported vehicles and pushing for a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement that would favor U.S. production. He pitched his 2017 corporate tax-cut proposal as a way to help reverse a decline in U.S. manufacturing. Ford praised Trump’s proposals to reduce corporate tax rates, although companies such as Ford with heavy debt were not expected to benefit from the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017. In November 2019, Ford and the United Auto Workers union approved a four-year contract with $6 billion in investment in Ford’s U.S. manufacturing facilities, including $900 million at the Ohio plant, which builds heavy-duty trucks and employs about 1,740 people. The plant was to get production of a new, unnamed vehicle by 2023.  News stories on the tentative contract agreement — including those by CNBC, Automotive News, the New York Times and Fox Business — made no mention of Trump’s tax policy as a factor.  The next month, Ford announced another domestic investment, saying it would invest $1.45 billion in its plants in southeast Michigan. While U.S. automakers keep an eye on trade rules, federal policy and political winds to guide their production strategies, other important trends have also influenced their thinking and reordered their production plans in recent years: a shift away from traditional car models in favor of SUVs and pickup trucks, a strategic shift toward electric vehicles, and rising costs for research on autonomous vehicle and fuel-efficiency technology. At Ford, several sedan models that Ford were built at its Mexico plants have been eliminated from its U.S. lineup. And this year, Ford doubled its spending commitment to electric vehicles. Biden campaigned on plans to grow federal revenue by $3.6 trillion over the next decade, primarily by raising business taxes and taxes on households with incomes over $400,000 a year. In mid-March 2021, news reports said Biden was considering moves to increase taxes on the wealthy and corporations.  More recently, after the Facebook post we’re checking was posted, Biden announced plans to finance his $2.3 million infrastructure plan in part by raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and by imposing a 21% global minimum tax, so that companies cannot avoid taxes by shifting income to low-tax countries. Reuters reported that Ford issued a statement that did not directly address the union’s criticism, but had said in a letter to employees that conditions had changed since 2019. Asked about whether its decisions about the Ohio plant were tied to tax policies, a Ford spokesman told PolitiFact: ""The business decision in question was not a result of then-presidential candidate Biden’s corporate tax proposals."" ""We remain committed to investing $6 billion in our U.S. plants and creating and retaining 8,500 jobs in America during this four-year UAW contract. We are invested in Ohio Assembly Plant and our dedicated workforce there,"" the spokesman said. ""Since 2019, we have invested more than $185 million and created and retained more than 100 jobs at Ohio Assembly Plant, including actions planned for this year.""  A Ford spokeswoman declined to say what vehicle the company plans to manufacture in Mexico, according to Fox Business. A post shared on Facebook claims that Trump ""lowered taxes and in 2019 Ford made a commitment to invest $900 million at its Avon Lake, OH plant,"" and Biden is ""increasing taxes and now the entire Ford project is moving to Mexico."" There are signs that Ford might be shifting plans for manufacturing a new model of vehicle from Ohio to Mexico.  But there are no indications that Trump’s tax cuts led to the initial plans in Ohio or that Biden’s possible tax hikes had any role in a possible shift in those plans to Mexico.

","Without mentioning COVID-19, a headline widely shared on Facebook raises an alarm about vaccines while referencing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading federal agency fighting the coronavirus. The headline is on an article from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website. It states: ""Per the CDC, there are nearly twice as many vaccine related deaths SO FAR in 2021 (1,755) than all the vaccine deaths this past decade (994)."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  These are not counts of ""vaccine deaths"" — they are unverified reports of deaths that occur after a vaccination. There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths. And there have not been more vaccine-related deaths in 2021 than in the previous decade. The headline cites figures from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, which is maintained by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The agencies warn that reports of adverse events — in other words, possible side effects — made to the VAERS database do not indicate whether an adverse event is linked to or caused by a vaccine; the reports, which can be made by anyone and are not verified, are intended as an early warning system to detect possible safety problems.  As Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a physician in the infectious-disease division at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told PolitiFact: ""The VAERS system is very noisy, so it's hard to compare."" Offit said the system identifies ""a lot of temporal associations that are not necessarily causal."" Moreover, the database does not compare death rates associated with vaccinations to see whether they are higher or lower than death rates among people who were not vaccinated, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center at Emory University. Orenstein also said that given the national focus on COVID-19, people are more likely to report deaths following a COVID-19 vaccination; and given the focus on vaccinating the elderly for the coronavirus in care facilities, it’s likely there will be more reports of death because those older people tend to have other health problems. Here’s what the CDC told us on the numbers Number of all vaccine-related deaths over the past decade: 2,928 Number of all deaths after vaccination in 2021: 1,934 Number of deaths after COVID-19 vaccination in 2021: 1,911 That means almost 99% of reports in 2021 followed COVID-19 vaccines. More than 145 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14, 2020, through March 29, according to the CDC. Reviews by physicians from the CDC and the FDA ""revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths,"" the CDC said. The Gateway Pundit recently made another False claim about fatal side effects, this time taking European data out of context to exaggerate the risk of vaccines. The claim shared information from a European database that stresses its information is preliminary and requires additional research before making conclusions.  The claim that there were nearly twice as many vaccine-related deaths so far in 2021 as the past 10 years is not accurate.

Yes, Evers’ budget increases Wisconsin taxes by more than $1 billion
","In the middle of the pandemic, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers presented his spending blueprint for 2021-22. The plan generated about the same enthusiasm from Republicans that his various actions aimed at stemming the coronavirus outbreak have.  Which is to say, very little. If any. At least one lawmaker called Evers’ budget ""terrible proposals,"" citing increased spending and expanding ""welfare."" ""These are some of the terrible proposals Governor Evers is pushing for in his budget,"" state Rep. Rick Gundrum, R-Slinger, said in a March 29, 2021 tweet. ""Governor’s ‘Bounce Backward’ Budget increases taxes $1 billion +""  That figure caught our attention. Is Evers really proposing to increase taxes by more than $1 billion?  When asked to back up the claim, Gundrum referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a March 24, 2021 memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau titled ""State Tax and Fee Modifications Included in the Governor's 2021-23 Budget Recommendations."" In the memo, the bureau spelled out for lawmakers the impact of the budget proposal. Here is the key point: ""The changes included in the Governor's budget would increase net taxes by $1,020,728,000 ($464,824,000 in 2021-22 and $555,904,000 in 2022-23) and would increase net fees by $17,162,700 ($7,172,900 in 2021-22 and $9,989,800 in 2022-23)."" Of course, with a net number, there are a mix of increases and decreases. For instance, according to a Feb. 17, 2021 report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Evers’ plan would raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy while providing tax breaks to the lower and middle classes. In addition, the plan would scale back a law that allows manufacturers to avoid having to pay state income taxes, but keep the tax break in place for small operations. The budget would also increase taxes on capital gains for individuals earning $400,000 a year or more. When asked about Gundrum’s $1 billion tax increase claim, the Legislative Reference Bureau referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to the fiscal bureau memo and noted ""the executive budget bill would increase taxes over the biennium by roughly $1.6 billion and reduce them by roughly $580 million, for a net increase of around $1 billion."" The reference bureau said much of this net increase can be attributed to the proposed increase in capital gains taxes as well as the proposed reduction in manufacturer tax breaks. Two notes of significance: The $1 billion figure, as mentioned above, is the combined impact of two years of the budget. That is, it’s not $1 billion per year -- something that readers could easily miss based on  Gundrum’s tweet. And, when Evers’ first budget went to the Legislature two years ago, Republicans rejected similar tax increases on manufacturers and capital gains. They are likely to do the same this time. Gundrum said Evers’ budget ""increases taxes $1 billion +""  A budget memo by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau confirms that tally, though it’s worth noting the figure is for a two-year period, not $1 billion for each year. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.   ",/factchecks/2021/apr/06/rick-gundrum/yes-evers-budget-increases-wisconsin-taxes-more-1-/

No, trafficked children, dead bodies were not removed from ship that blocked the Suez Canal
","The giant Ever Given container ship that clogged up the Suez Canal for six days isn’t out of the news just yet. After it was freed, Egyptian authorities towed the 1,300-foot ship to Great Bitter Lake, a wider expanse of the canal where authorities would be able to inspect the vessel for damage.  Within days, dubious websites posted stories that claimed that the U.S. Navy SEALs took part in the inspection and found dead bodies and over 1,000 trafficked children on board. ""Navy Seals rescue over a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal,"" reads the all-caps headline of an April 3 post by a blog called the Marshall Report.

Fact-checking Rep. Alex Mooney of W.Va. on requirements in H.R. 1
","The Democratic-backed elections and voting bill known as H.R. 1, or the For the People Act, has inspired sometimes fierce opposition from Republicans. One of them is Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va. The bill, which passed the House on a mostly party-line vote and awaits action in the Senate, includes proposals on voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections. In a press release issued March 3, Mooney explained why he voted against the bill, which he dismissed as the ""For the Politicians Act."" ""It mandates practices nationwide which are prone to fraud, such as ballot harvesting, universal mail-in voting and same-day registration,"" Mooney said in the news release. He argued that, collectively, ""this power grab would undermine ballot integrity and restrict the voice of each individual citizen in our election process."" PolitiFact’s national staff has previously fact-checked portions of this statement. Overall, Mooney’s statement gets some things right, some things wrong, and some in between. We’ll take a look at each. (Mooney’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) This is partially accurate but needs context.  ""Ballot harvesting"" isn’t an official legal term, but it generally refers to someone collecting completed and sealed absentee ballots on behalf of others and then submitting them. Many states’ current laws allow individuals to collect ballots on behalf of others, sometimes with certain restrictions. H.R. 1 doesn’t require ballots to be collected this way, but requires states to allow it in some forms. It says that states ""shall permit a voter to designate any person"" to return their sealed absentee ballot, as long as the person doesn’t get paid based on the number of ballots returned. It would prevent states from putting a limit on how many ballots any person could return on behalf of others. This is False. The phrase used by Mooney, ""universal mail-in voting,"" is not a commonly used term; more common is ""all-mail elections.""  In all-mail elections, ballots are automatically mailed to every registered voter. ""The voter marks the ballot, puts it in a secrecy envelope or sleeve and then into a separate mailing envelope, signs an affidavit on the exterior of the mailing envelope, and returns the package via mail or by dropping it off,"" according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. This system is used in Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington state and Utah. In addition, California has moved to temporarily extend its use of all-mail voting after adopting it during the coronavirus pandemic. H.R. 1 doesn’t force any state to adopt the all-mail system or send out ballots automatically. Rather, the bill would make it easier for registered voters who choose to cast their ballot by mail. The bill requires states to give everyone access to voting by mail if they want to use it. The law says that states cannot ""impose any additional conditions or requirements"" on an eligible voter’s ability to cast an absentee ballot by mail in federal elections. In addition, the bill nixes state laws requiring identification for mail ballots beyond a voter’s signature, such as  notarized statements. The bill allows states to set a ""reasonable deadline"" for requesting a mail ballot and returning it to elections officials. And it requires states to treat a mail-in ballot application for one election to stand as a default preference for all subsequent federal elections. There’s no question that these H.R. 1 provisions set new standards for access to mail ballots. But none of these provisions amount to ""universal mail-in"" voting. Voting by mail would be an option for voters, not a requirement. This is accurate.  A little under half the states already offer some form of same-day voter registration, in which individuals can cast a ballot on the same day they register.  H.R. 1  would mandate that states allow any eligible individual to register to vote on the day of a federal election and cast a ballot that day. People who are already registered could revise their voter registration information and still vote that day. Practices such as ballot harvesting, same-day registration and mail-in voting are already used in some states. Even so, there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the U.S. election system Between Election Day and late November, PolitiFact fact-checked more than 80 misleading or false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. Federal agencies, state election officials and technology experts have all said that last year’s election was among the most secure in American history. And in 2018, we found no widespread fraud in elections prior to 2020.  Mooney said that H.R. 1 ""mandates practices nationwide"" that include ""ballot harvesting, universal mail-in voting and same-day registration."" He’s correct that H.R. 1 requires states to allow same-day registration, which is already used in many states.  H.R. 1 does not mandate ballot harvesting, but it would remove some restrictions on voters’ letting other people return their completed and sealed absentee ballot for them. H.R. 1 doesn’t mandate universal mail-in voting. Rather, the bill would make it easier for registered voters who choose to cast their ballot by mail to do so.

This image doesn’t show gun owners in Texas shooting a robber
","In the wake of deadly mass shootings in the U.S., some old claims about guns and gun ownership are again circulating on social media.  Among them is a mischaracterization of what is shown in a real snapshot of 2017 security camera footage.  The low-resolution, black and white image shows at least three individuals pointing guns in the direction of a fourth person, who is on the ground. ""Man uses a gun to rob a Texas convenience store,"" the Facebook photo caption reads. ""Man was shot by every customer inside the store.""  The image is stacked on top of a photo of two bald eagles that is captioned, ""(Laughs in American)."" The problem? This didn’t happen in America. And what did transpire before the image was taken does not line up with what the Facebook post claims. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A reverse image search revealed that this video originated in Brazil in May 2017. And this claim about the video featuring customers stopping an armed robber has been fact-checked before. According to accounts on ConcealedNation.org, Snopes.com and G1 Goiás, the image captured an attempted robbery at a pharmacy in Itumbiara, Brazil, that was stopped by plainclothes military police officers.  At the time, Brazil had strict gun ownership requirements, making it unlikely that a convenience store would have so many customers who were licensed gun owners if they weren’t police officers. The security camera footage shows that a person wearing a helmet walked into the store and pointed a gun at the cashier behind the counter. As the officers realized what was happening, they drew their weapons. In seconds, the person who attempted to rob the store is on the ground, shot.  The person who attempted to commit the robbery was a 17-year-old, and he was dead by the time emergency medical services arrived. According to the reports, it is unclear how many officers fired, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it was ""every customer inside the store.""  Concealed Nation, a website that says its purpose is ""promoting responsible concealed carry,"" accurately shared in 2017 that the incident occurred in Brazil. When sharing this story, the conservative news website Breitbart also noted that the event happened in Brazil.  A viral image post reads, ""Man uses a gun to rob a Texas convenience store. Man was shot by every customer inside the store."" The incident captured by the security cameras happened at a pharmacy in Brazil, not a convenience store in Texas, and the individuals in the video who pulled their guns on the 17-year-old robber were plainclothes military police officers.  It is unknown how many officers shot the boy who attempted to rob the pharmacy.
