John Oliver hits on regulatory gap for food on 'Last Week Tonight'
","Ever wonder about the accuracy of your milk carton’s expiration date? Or exactly how late is too late to eat that apple? So did comedian John Oliver. He used the July 19 episode of his HBO show Last Week Tonight to discuss the issue of food waste, zooming in on little-known regulatory gaps that he argued cause mass confusion over the meaning and purpose of date labels on food. ""With the exception of baby formula,"" Oliver said, ""the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely."" And of the 50 states, he went on, nine don’t require any labels at all. The confusing issue has been well documented over several decades, though we doubt it’s ever been the target of an 18-minute monologue in a late-night comedy show. We wanted to see if Oliver had it right. Chaotic laws, confusing labels Oliver was right in saying, with the exception of infant formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date. Experts say it would be almost impossible to set up an effective umbrella regulation for labeling foods with expiration dates. The diversity of climates and crops in the United States means it’s hard to judge the pace at which different foods deteriorate in different places. A piece of fruit left out in the hot, humid fields of Georgia might spoil faster than the same piece of fruit left out in the cool, dry mountains of Colorado. In the absence of an overarching federal statute, a jumble of laws at the state level dictate which foods require date labels. The comedian’s research team got the bulk of its data from a 2013 report compiled by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental think tank, and the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. The study found that most states have laws that require date labels on some foods. Oliver cites the report’s finding that nine states don’t require any date labels, including New York, Idaho and Alabama. Of those nine, seven states don’t have regulations that govern the labels that manufacturers voluntarily place on products. These inconsistencies can make it hard to do business across state lines, said Emily Broad Leib, the study’s lead author and director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. Laws in Montana and Pennsylvania require milk to be sold 12 and 17 days after pasteurization, respectively, but don’t allow the milk to be donated if it goes unsold in that time. ""Without federal guidance,"" Leib said, ""some state laws require that (unspoiled) food be thrown away."" The Montana law prompted some out-of-state dairy farmers to argue that the law unfairly protects in-state producers. Label it what you want The regulatory gap also leads to confusion about what food labels actually mean. As a news clip in Oliver’s segment illustrates, one might see the same product labeled ""sell by"" or ""use by,"" or it may have no label at all. Most retailers and manufacturers use a labeling system referred to as ""open dating."" Though it might sound like a relationship status, ""open dating"" simply means that a calendar date is displayed on a product instead of a code that only makes sense to the producer. Perhaps surprisingly, the dates on these labels aren’t regulated. This means it’s entirely up to the manufacturer to decide what date to print on the labels in all 50 states. (The strictest federal regulation of this kind applies to poultry, but it allows the use of a packing date instead of a sell-by date.) The purpose of manufacturers’ date labels isn’t to ensure safety, but quality, according to the USDA. Oliver suggests that because manufacturers are free to determine their own best-by dates, they may have a financial incentive to falsify them. But one expert said he wasn’t convinced manufacturers try to help out their bottom lines by making it seem like food perishes faster than reality. Quality standards almost always consider safety, said Keith Schneider, a food microbiologist at the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Keeping a customer happy means also keeping them safe. ""These dates are usually based on lab tests and historical precedents,"" he said. Most of all, he said, manufacturers want to build brand loyalty by consistently guaranteeing fresh, safe food, so they are often overly conservative with sell-by and use-by dates. Leib said it would be difficult to prove a producer manipulates its dates to boost profits, ""but it would be perfectly easy to falsify that information."" Still, manufacturers have an interest in ensuring quality, and many times smaller companies don’t have the money to test their products and apply accurate sell-by dates. ""Sometimes,"" she said, ""dates are just made up."" Our rating Oliver said, ""With the exception of baby formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely."" While Oliver’s underlying argument for more regulation can be debated, he’s right to say that the federal government doesn’t require expiration dates on food, and state laws filling in that gap are inconsistent. We rate his statement True. A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",/factchecks/2015/jul/27/john-oliver/john-oliver-hits-regulatory-gap-food-last-week-ton/
"['History', 'PunditFact', 'Chuck Baldwin']","
No, 300,000 slave owners did not fight on the Union side in the Civil War
","A common argument in the dispute over official displays of the Confederate battle flag is that most people misunderstand the reasons behind the Civil War. It was not about slavery, these advocates say, but about the right to secede from the Union. Chuck Baldwin, a fundamentalist pastor and columnist, made this case in a recent essay that appeared on his website and many others, including a fan page for Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. Baldwin gave many reasons to back up his conclusion, but a reader asked us to examine one in particular: Slavery was not the pivotal reason for the war because thousands of slave owners supported the North. ""Do you not realize that when Lincoln signed his (Emancipation) proclamation, there were over 300,000 slaveholders who were fighting in the Union army?"" Baldwin wrote. ""Check it out."" The first thing we did was reach out to Baldwin to learn his source. We did not hear from him. As we researched this, we found that Baldwin’s statement was vague on one key point -- he didn’t say which states the slaveholders came from. When the war began, slavery was legal in four Union states. Those were Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. West Virginia fell somewhere in between because it split off from Virginia in 1863 to join the Union. So in theory, there were slaveholders from Union states and slaveholders from Confederate states that could have fought on the Union side. That distinction might make no difference to Baldwin’s argument, but it makes a big difference in the underlying math. Keep your states straight We don’t know where Baldwin got his number, but it could be tied to an 1889 book written by Thomas Seaman Townsend, a private historian with a passion for recording the role of soldiers from New York in the Civil War. Townsend had a brief passage about the number of West Point graduates who remained loyal to the Union. West Point is located in New York. ""It will be seen that the disloyalty of West Point was not as great as is generally supposed. In the navy about one-third of the officers came from slaveholding States, yet remained faithful to the Union; while one-eighth of the Union army, or 300,000 men, were contributed by the Southern States."" Townsend doesn’t say which ""Southern"" states he had in mind. Fortunately, one of the leading Civil War historians, James McPherson at Princeton University, knows Townsend’s work and told us that he included the Confederate states, plus Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. In addition to McPherson, we reached historians Robert Tinkler at California State University-Chico and Gary Gallagher at the University of Virginia. All of them agree on these approximate totals: White Union soldiers from Confederate states -- 75,000-100,000 White Union soldiers from slaveholding Union states -- 200,000 So, in round figures, it is reasonably accurate to say that 300,000 white men from slaveholding states fought on the Union side. (In addition, as many as 200,000 black former slaves became Union soldiers and sailors.) But there is no reason to believe that all or even a hefty minority of these white soldiers were slave owners themselves. In fact, all three historians we reached told us there was no evidence to back up that assertion and plenty of reasons to suggest it does not fit the facts that are known. Few slaveholding Union soldiers Gallagher told us that there is no breakdown of which Union soldiers came from slave-owning families. However, we do know where slavery was common and where it wasn’t, and the Union soldiers in question came from places where it wasn’t. For the men from the Confederate states, Tinkler said the pattern is clear. ""These soldiers generally came from low slaveholding areas, such as the mountain regions of Tennessee, and small, non-slaveholding families,"" he said. The upland residents of what became West Virginia fit the same mold. Tinkler said across Appalachia, support for secession was thin at the start of the war and as time went by, resistance increased. The Confederate Congress played a role in that. ""In October 1862, Congress amended the Conscription Act with what became known as the ‘Twenty Negro Law,’ a provision that exempted from the draft one white man of military age on plantations with at least 20 slaves,"" Tinkler wrote. ""Designed to help secure plantation districts against slave revolts, this exemption policy inspired much class-based opposition to the Confederacy. ‘A rich man’s war, but a poor man’s fight’ became the cry of many southerners of modest means."" Needless to say, men of modest means were less likely to own slaves. For the Union states that allowed slavery, the 1860 census shows that they had much lower rates of slave ownership than the Confederate states. The average fraction of slaveholding families was about 11 percent for those Union states, while in the Confederacy, it was about 40 percent. All three historians told us that the number of men on the Union side who owned slaves was quite small. ""Very few of them were slaveholders, probably not more than a very few thousand,"" McPherson told us. ""Among those Southern whites who did own slaves, even in the Unionist border slave states, many supported the Confederacy, and fought for it."" McPherson said in researching his book For Cause and Comrades, he read the letters of about 60 Union soldiers from slave states and he can't recall a single one who owned slaves. Implausible numbers Data from another direction also throws Baldwin’s figure into question. The nation’s 1860 census counted a bit under 1.6 million men of military age (18-45) in slaveholding states. This included men in all the Confederate states, plus Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. The census also reported the percentage of families that owned slaves in each state. State-by-state, we applied that percentage to the total number of military age males. In 1860, there were about 412,000 men from slaveholding families who could serve as soldiers. We can only take this as a rough guide for several reasons — in the course of the war, young men would be killed, others would come of age, and later in the war, the Confederates broadened the age of conscription to span from 17 to 50 years old. But the general scale shows how Baldwin’s figure stretches belief. If 300,000 Union soldiers were slave owners, it would mean that somewhere in the ballpark of three-quarters of the available slave owning men put on the Union blue. If that were true, it is hard to see how the Confederacy would have had enough men to deliver any success on the battlefield. For the record, in 1863, Confederate forces totaled about 300,000. Gallagher noted that over the four years of the war, the South put 800,000-900,000 men under arms. It was a mobilization effort that he called ""astonishing."" ""That could only be accomplished by putting the vast majority of males from slaveholding families into service,"" Gallagher said. Our ruling Baldwin said that 300,000 slaveholders fought in the Union army. The closest we can get to that figure is an estimate that 300,000 men from states that allowed slavery put on the Union blue uniform. But that provides no evidence that all of them owned slaves, either directly themselves or through their families. The historians we reached said the actual number of slaveholders who fought for the Union was tiny, perhaps a few thousand. The data from the 1860 census show that if Baldwin were correct, an overwhelming fraction of all of the young men from slave-owning families across the Deep South and beyond would needed to have broken with their communities and fought for the Union. Had that happened, it is hard to see how the Confederacy would have been able to fight at all. The chance that a few thousand slaveholders fought for the Union, rather than the 300,000 as Baldwin said, does little to keep this statement in the realm of reality. We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/jul/27/chuck-baldwin/no-300000-slave-owners-did-not-fight-union-side-ci/

David Jolly refused to cut funding for D.C. 'greenhouse,' anti-tax group says
","U.S. Rep. David Jolly’s Senate campaign was only hours old when he began taking fire from his fellow conservatives. The Club for Growth, a political action committee backing Jolly’s GOP primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, said that Jolly may have only been in office for 16 months, but during that time he ""racked up a terrible record on fiscal issues."" ""Jolly is so addicted to big government, he couldn’t even muster up the courage to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C.,"" the PAC said in a statement emailed on the afternoon of July 20, 2015, the same day Jolly announced that he would be vying for Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-open Senate seat. Jolly has only been in office since March 2014, after winning a special election for the late C.W. ""Bill"" Young’s 13th congressional district seat. Given such a short tenure, we wondered what action was so wasteful it would warrant Club for Growth’s assertion that Jolly had squandered too many greenbacks on a greenhouse. Flower power It turns out that ""national greenhouse"" is actually the conservatory at the U.S. Botanic Garden, a Washington museum first envisioned by George Washington more than two centuries ago with the mission of demonstrating and promoting ""the importance of plants to the young nation,"" according to the garden. The garden became a reality in 1820 and has been open in its current location on the Capitol grounds since 1933. Referring to it as just a greenhouse is an understatement: The grounds include various outdoor gardens, several plant collections in the aforementioned conservatory and an amphitheater. It is devoted to the study and cultivation of all manner of plant species and is free to the public. In 2013, the garden featured a 250-pound beast of a plant known as the corpse flower, which rarely blooms and stinks of rotting flesh. Curious botany fans braved an hourlong wait just to see (and perhaps smell) the bloom. That’s not the kind of stuff you find next to the tomatoes and zinnias at the local nursery. Because of the quirk that it was established by the federal government and has long been run by the Office of Architect of the Capitol, the garden is funded through the appropriations process for the legislative branch. A Club for Growth spokesman told us the PAC was referring to an amendment to the fiscal year 2015 legislative branch appropriations bill. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., proposed cutting $3.1 million slated for repairs and improvements at the Botanic Garden. Gosar said the cut would have reduced funding to 2014 levels, but the garden’s administrators had been planning some changes. ""Rather than making minor repairs to a few small leaks in the roof, the Architect of the Capitol is proposing to tear down the entire roof and replace it with something called a new vegetative roofing system,"" Gosar said, referring to a plan Architect of the Capitol Stephen Ayers had proposed. ""We shouldn’t be wasting precious taxpayer money on a new, state-of-the-art vegetative roofing system."" Ayers had testified in March 2014 to the House Appropriations Subcommittee that money also would go to repair chips and cracks in the conservatory’s facade. Ayers said a vegetative roof -- think of a living garden on top of the conservatory instead of tar or shingles -- ""will have a longer lifespan and will reduce water runoff."" South Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz said Gosar was merely ""trying to generate headlines by attempting to cut much-needed funding to one of the most beloved destinations in Washington, D.C."" But on May 1, 2014, the House voted in favor of the amendment, 219-198. One of the 37 Republicans who voted against the amendment -- and who as a result voted to keep the garden’s higher 2015 repair budget intact -- was Jolly. ""It would have been penny-wise but pound-foolish to score political points by refusing to replace a failing roof on a federal building visited by almost 1 million Americans a year,"" Jolly spokeswoman Sarah Bascom told PolitiFact. ""To not replace the roof jeopardized the safety of visitors and workers, and risked even greater cost should the roof and building fall in greater repair or lead to an accident with physical injury."" As it happens, after the amendment to cut the roof spending passed the House despite Jolly’s opposition, lawmakers found ways to cut other spending and were able to put the roof expenditure back in the final version of the bill. The Club for Growth didn’t mention this. Changes at the Botanic Garden, which last completed an extensive renovation in 2001, are not as of yet listed among the projects on the Architect of the Capitol website. Our ruling The Club for Growth said Jolly refused ""to cut spending for a national greenhouse in D.C."" While ""greenhouse"" trivializes the U.S. Botanic Garden, the group is right that Jolly broke with most Republicans in voting against a 2014 amendment to cut funding for repairs to the complex’s roof and facade.

Scott Walker says under his leadership incomes are up in Wisconsin, while they are down in US
","As he pursues his 2016 presidential bid, Republican Gov. Scott Walker is trying to show Americans they would be better off under his leadership than under President Barack Obama. In a July 21, 2015 tweet, Walker argued that by at least one measure, people in Wisconsin are better off than nationally. ""Under Walker, Wisconsin’s median household income +2.7% - Under Obama: -1.3%. RT if you prefer #Walker16"" At the end of the tweet, Walker linked to a New York Post article titled, ""How workers are winning in Scott Walker’s Wisconsin,"" written by Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock. The article cites the ""latest Census statistics"" that show even after adjusting for inflation, the average household income in Wisconsin has grown since Walker took office, while across the nation incomes fell in the same time frame. In October 2014, we fact checked a claim from Democrat Mary Burke -- Walker’s gubernatorial opponent -- that under Walker’s policies, ""the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years."" At that time, we found that median household income in Wisconsin had fallen $2,743 from 2009 to 2013. But most of the drop in income occurred before Walker took office -- in the last year of Democrat Jim Doyle’s term -- while Burke attributed the decrease solely to the Walker’s policies We rated the claim Mostly False. So, what about Walker’s claim that median household income is on the rise? Behind the numbers Walker and the New York Post article are both citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, a primary source of labor force statistics. Once a year, that monthly survey includes more detailed questions about income. From 2010 to 2013 the average household income in Wisconsin increased from $53,795 to $55,258 -- a 2.7 percent change -- and fell across the nation 1.3 percent. That mirrors what Walker tweeted. But there is more to the story. Census Bureau officials say that while the Current Population Survey is fine for the national picture, a separate survey with a larger sample size -- the American Community Survey -- provides the best picture of what is happening at the state level. The larger sample size means a smaller sampling error. These results paint a different picture for the average Wisconsin household, showing incomes falling, even after accounting for inflation. (Note: In the chart below, we use the American Community Survey for both the state and national numbers. The national ones generally track with the Current Population Survey, the measuring stick Walker cited.)   Wisconsin median income (in 2013 dollars) % change National median income (in 2013 dollars) % change 2010 $52,317 $53,163 2011 $52,111 -.39% $52,190 -1.83% 2012 $51,649 -.89% $51,915 -.53% 2013 $51,467 -.35% $52,250 .64% 2010-13 -1.62% -1.72% This time, incomes in Wisconsin and nationally faced a similar fate, falling 1.62 percent and 1.72 percent, respectively. Both the drops were noted as statistically significant by the Census Bureau. In any case, they point to a far different outcome than what Walker touted. Our rating Walker said under his leadership, ""Wisconsin median household income"" is up 2.7 percent and down 1.3 percent nationally under Obama. He pointed to data from the Current Population Survey. But the data considered more accurate -- from the American Community Survey -- showed the opposite.

Terry McAuliffe says all Maryland crabs are born in Virginia
","Maryland crabs, Maryland crab cakes, Maryland crab soup...Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe says it’s all a sham. ""You know, Maryland talks about its crabs,"" McAuliffe said with a chuckle during a July 21 radio interview. ""If anyone from Maryland is listening, I want to make this perfectly clear: All the crabs are born here in Virginia and they end up, because of the current, being taken (to Maryland). So really, they should be Virginia crabs."" No such thing as a Maryland-born crab? Let’s crack this claim open. McAuliffe’s office referred us to the website of the Chesapeake Bay Program, an environmental protection partnership between the federal government and five states, including Maryland and Virginia. We learned that blue crabs mate in the middle of the bay from May to October. This happens when the female molts and the male cradles her, injects sperm, and holds on until she’s developed a new, hardened shell. After their affair, the male takes off looking for new paramours and the female migrates to the saltier waters of the lower Chesapeake Bay. McAuliffe’s office also sent us a map showing that the areas of high salinity are in Virginia near where the mouth of bay opens into the Atlantic. All this information seemed to confirm the governor’s statement, but did not specifically state that all bay crabs are born in Virginia. Nor did it answer a more delicate question: Even if the crabs are born in Virginia, could it be argued that the moment of conception for many actually occurred in Maryland? We turned to Romuald Lipcius, a professor at Virginia Institute of Marine Science. He told us  that the females, a half year or so after they’ve mated and settled in the saltiest waters, develop sponges that carry as many 2 million eggs. The eggs, when ejected, pass through a sperm packet left by the male, become fertilized and emerge as larvae. In other words, the moment of conception and birth -- which Lipcius says are interchangeable terms in crab world -- almost always occur in Virginia. ""The bottom line is that the governor is essentially correct,"" he said. We sensed some hesitancy. ""In drought, the salinity can get very high in Maryland and it’s possible for females to give birth there,"" Lipcius explained. Tom Miller, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Chesapeake Biological lab, said McAuliffe is basically right. ""There’s no such thing as a Maryland-born crab in the Chesapeake Bay,"" he told us. ""Blue crabs require salinity of 26 parts per 1,000 to survive. You don’t find that on the Maryland side."" Miller said there are Maryland-born crabs, however. A comparatively small number are born outside the bay, in coastal waters around Ocean City, Md. ""But when people think of crabs, they think of the Chesapeake,"" he added. Here are a few other facts about crabs: •After their birth in the lower Chesapeake, the larvae drift into the even saltier Atlantic for a few weeks, then return to the bay and flow with currents to grassy waters. That’s how many end up in Maryland. •Females mate once in their lives and settle permanently in the salty waters. They still produce eggs, however, and the packet left by males contains enough sperm to fertilize eight sponges of eggs. Think about it: One sexual encounter could lead to 16 million larvae. But few survive into adulthood. •They taste great with beer. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""All (Maryland) crabs are born in Virginia."" He’s right when we’re talking about Chesapeake Bay crabs. There are, however, a small number of crabs that are born outside of the Chesapeake in Maryland coastal waters.

Rand Paul: Hillary Clinton's State Department 'admonished' ambassador for improper email use
","Hillary Clinton, already facing a congressional inquiry about the personal email account she used as secretary of state, could be facing another federal investigation by President Barack Obama’s Justice Department. Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky called the Justice Department’s potential review into whether classified information was mishandled ""damning"" before charging Clinton with hypocrisy. ""Even she knew there was a rule,"" Paul said July 26. ""They actually admonished one of her ambassadors because he wasn't using the proper server. I don't understand how she can skate by and act as if she wasn't aware of the law."" We won’t address here whether Clinton was or wasn’t ""aware of the law."" But we were curious about Paul’s allegation: Did the State Department under Clinton chide a diplomat for handling email on an improper server in the same way as Clinton? The Clinton campaign declined to comment. The ambassador A spokeswoman for Paul told us he was referring to Scott Gration, a former Obama advisor who left his post as ambassador to Kenya three years ago. After less than a year and half on the job, Gration resigned in June 2012 (while Clinton was secretary) after reading a draft of a highly critical audit by the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General, which works independently. Among Gration’s many failings was his continued usage of a personal email account, according to the report. Unsurprisingly, Gration’s drama resurfaced when the Clinton email controversy first erupted in March 2015, and some claimed that Gration was fired for his ""Hillary-like"" use of the email. (Gration used a Gmail account.) Gration himself called the State Department’s treatment of him a double standard. PunditFact, however, found that most of the reports inflated the significance of the personal email. Gration’s grating style of management, uncooperative attitude and ""disruptive"" initiatives were more pressing to the State Department. Out of more than 80 mission chiefs, he ranked last for interpersonal relations, next to last on managerial skill and attention to morale, and third to last on overall scores, according to the audit. Compared to these issues, the email problem played a minor role, according to Ronald Neumann, who served as an American ambassador three times, most recently in Afghanistan from 2005-07. ""It could be an important issue, but when you screw up as many things as this guy did, it’s hard to get through to that one,"" Neumann told PunditFact. The admonishment  Paul’s claim, however, is more tempered, and thus more accurate. That audit did indeed ""admonish"" Gration for his email habits. The fourth bullet point on the report’s summary reads: ""The Ambassador’s greatest weakness is his reluctance to accept clear-cut U.S. Government decisions. He made clear his disagreement with Washington policy decisions and directives concerning the safe-havening in Nairobi of families of Department employees who volunteered to serve in extreme hardship posts; the creation of a freestanding Somalia Unit; and the nonuse of commercial email for official government business, including Sensitive But Unclassified information. Notwithstanding his talk about the importance of mission staff doing the right thing, the Ambassador by deed or word has encouraged it to do the opposite."" The report describes Gration’s actions in detail starting on page 43: He deliberately defied the State Department’s rule on communication by installing a commercial Internet connection in his embassy office bathroom and authorizing his embassy staff to use personal emails.  ""He has willfully disregarded Department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business,"" the report says. Ars Technica, a technology news site, put it even more bluntly: ""Gration was the end user from hell for an understaffed IT team in a politically sensitive outpost.""   The report also spells out the reasons for the policy: Unauthorized systems increase the risk for hacks and loss of records. It then states that the use of personal emails ""must be limited to maintaining communications during emergencies"" and recommended the embassy stop using the unofficial email accounts. It is unclear if top State Department brass slammed Gration for violating the personal email policy, as Paul suggests. We found no on-the-record condemnations from department officials, though Gration said multiple times that Clinton’s chief of staff fired him after reading the report. An audit by an inspector general is different than Clinton directly criticizing Gration for the practice. Comparison to Clinton In short, the department’s watchdogs chided Gration for a number of issues, including his personal email use. But how closely did his improper email habits mirror Clinton’s? Clinton exclusively used a personal email account during her tenure as the country’s top diplomat. At the time, there was no law prohibiting the practice (one was put in place in 2014). There was, however, a long-standing policy against using personal emails, reiterated in a 2011 memo from the State Department under Clinton. Gration, for his part, used both, although he ""very infrequently"" logged onto his classified account, the report says. Without more information, it’s hard to compare the security risks of both setups. Gration likely channeled his personal emails through an unsecured Internet connection despite repeated warnings, according to the Washington Post. As for Clinton, her personal email was relayed through a private server guarded by the Secret Service, Clinton said at a March press conference. We don’t know if the State Department signed off on her private server, but it was aware of the server’s existence. The emails were encrypted after March 2009, according to her security provider, though there’s still debate over the account’s security. Overall, an expert told us it’s an apples-to-apples comparison, though he cautioned that the inspector general report does not address why Gration was using a personal email. (According to Gration, he couldn’t get news alerts through the official State Department server.) ""The similarities between the two situations are striking, and it is fair to compare them,"" said Douglas Cox, a law professor at the City University of New York, who studies records preservation. ""Both were in senior leadership positions. Both made a regrettable decision to use non-official email, which raised security and record-keeping concerns that should have been obvious. And both refused to accept that their continuous use of non-official email violated State Department rules."" Cox pointed out that the report condemned Gration’s email usage as a failure in leadership that ""sapped the morale"" of his staff. The same criticism could apply to Clinton, who, as secretary of state, should be held to a higher standard than Gration, Cox argued. ""The buck should have stopped with her, and she should have been leading by example,"" he said. Our ruling Paul said the State Department under Clinton ""actually admonished one of her ambassadors for not using the proper server."" The ambassador in question, Scott Gration, was effectively fired from his post in Kenya in 2012 mostly because of his poor management skills but also for his email management. The department’s office of the inspector general, which works independently, called Gration’s use of a personal email account for government business a leadership failure and a security risk.

The former Texas governor, standing next to a plane like the one he flew as a young Air Force captain, said in his June 2015 speech: ""When there was a crisis at our border last year, and the president refused my invitation to see that challenge that we faced, I told him, ‘Mr. President, if you do not secure this border, Texas will.’"" ""And because of that threat … posed by drug cartels … and transnational gangs,"" Perry continued, ""I deployed the Texas National Guard. And the policy worked. Apprehensions at the border declined 74 percent. If you elect me your president, I will secure that border."" Operation Strong Safety Perry was referring to Operation Strong Safety, the effort he launched on June 23, 2014, to place state troopers and, later, Texas National Guard troops along a portion of the 1,250-mile Texas part of the international border. Supporting the U.S. Border Patrol, the reinforcements were sent to secure the border by monitoring it. The Texas surge, so to speak, remained in place after Perry yielded the governorship to Greg Abbott in January 2015. When Perry acted, thousands of unaccompanied children, mostly from Central America, had lately been detained on the Texas side of the border. In the peak month, June 2014, the Border Patrol collected 10,622 unaccompanied children near the border, most of them in its more than 120-mile North-to-South Rio Grande Valley sector, which stretches west from Brownsville at the southern tip of the state to Falcon Village, 50 miles southeast of Laredo. Past Perry claims about the border have tickled the Truth-O-Meter.  In June 2014, Perry said on the ""Fox & Friends"" program that the southern border was seeing a record number of non-Mexican apprehensions. True, we found. And in August 2014, Perry declared that record numbers of apprehensions were people from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Syria, places, he said, with ""substantial terrorist ties."" Pants on Fire! We found no evidence of record numbers of individuals from these countries crossing the Texas-Mexico border. For this fact check, we were curious about the described plummet in apprehensions and if that decrease showed the Texas surge worked. We dug into apprehension counts and hunted possible explanations. But first, it’s worth noting the U.S. government has struggled to define best indicators of the southern border’s security. Border security index announced, not completed A February 2015 report from the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said the best metric to judge the security of any border is ""the number of successful unauthorized border-crossings,"" but admitted that it was impossible to pinpoint such a figure given that ""by definition, they are undetected."" A few years earlier, in 2010, the U.S. Border Patrol and Department of Homeland Security launched a project comprehensive border security metric. Later, the Border Patrol’s 2012 strategic report said the indicator, known as the Border Conditions Index, was still under development, but it would combine ""important indicators of activity between the ports of entry; indicators of the amount, nature and flow of traffic at the ports of entry; and quality of life indicators in border communities."" (The Border Patrol defines a ""Port of Entry"" as a location where officers are assigned to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.) In 2013, though, the government dropped the index project, according to a March 2013 New York Times news story, after more than two years of work did not give them a viable measurement because, as Border Patrol representative Mark Borkowski then told a congressional subcommittee, the index ""would only show trends"" but would not act as the end-all, be-all border security metric Congress had asked for. Omar Zamora, a Border Patrol spokesman based in the Rio Grande Valley sector, told us by phone that when the agency is judging the security of the border, officials first look at border apprehension and drug smuggling statistics, then take into account ""bigger picture"" figures like the economic health and crime rate of border towns versus comparable areas elsewhere in the state. Zamora said he personally hadn’t heard of the Border Conditions Index. Perry’s backup information Asked to elaborate on Perry’s 74-percent statement, his campaign spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, said he relied on a report by the Texas Department of Public Safety showing apprehensions in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector during the Texas operation. By email, Nashed provided a fact-sheet of the report. Nashed, asked to elaborate, said the 74 percent figure aired by Perry reflected the difference in apprehensions the first week of the state operation to the last week Perry was in office, the week of Jan. 18, 2015. That week, there were 1,561 people apprehended, according to a chart on the fact sheet, 76 percent fewer than the 6,606 apprehensions in the week of June 22, 2014, when the operation started. Nashed said: ""There’s actually a larger than 74 percent decrease in apprehensions, but it’s near enough that we feel saying 74 percent is still appropriate.""                   SOURCE: Chart, ""USBP Apprehension Trends in OSS Area of Responsibility (AOR) Zones,"" Texas Department of Public Safety, March 30, 2015 (received by email from Lucy Nashed, Rick Pery campaign, June 15, 2015) Broadly, the chart shows ups and (mostly) downs in weekly apprehensions in the sector of individuals attempting to enter Texas illegally from late June 2014 through Feb. 14, 2015. Summer Blackwell, a DPS spokeswoman, told us the chart was the latest available data at the time Perry announced for president. According to the chart, in the week of June 22-28, 2014, the start of Operation Strong Safety, the Border Patrol apprehended 6,606 individuals in the sector. But in the operation’s second week, the chart shows, apprehensions plummeted by more than a 1,000, a 22 percent decrease. In the operation’s sixth week, apprehensions were down 56 percent compared to the 6,606 apprehensions the first week, according to the chart. Apprehensions dropped, by varying degrees, every week until the week of Sept. 7, 2014, when apprehensions inched up from 1,976 to 1,997. From that week, apprehensions rose and fell within a limited range; from the first week of September to the last week of November, weekly apprehensions were never greater than 1,997 or less than 1,521. December 2014 and January 2015 brought the lowest weekly totals with the week including New Year’s Day showing the chart’s lowest total for the year, with 826 individuals apprehended. Past changes in apprehensions from summer to winter As we studied Perry’s claim, we wondered briefly about previous years. For instance, are there invariably fewer apprehensions in January compared to the previous June? Mostly so, at least in recent years. Per apprehension tallies for the sector, posted online by the Border Patrol, in four of the five pre-surge years, apprehensions in January ran at least 14 percent behind apprehensions the previous June. Outlier: Apprehensions in January 2012 outpaced apprehensions in June 2011 by 2 percent. On average, January apprehensions from 2010 through 2015 were down 52 percent from apprehensions the previous June. Then again, June 2014 was a watershed month for apprehensions. The 38,446 apprehensions exceeded the sector’s average for the five previous Junes by 30,349, or 375 percent. According to agency figures, the June 2014 tally was the highest monthly total of apprehensions for any border sector since 2008. Decreases after June 2014 There’s also no doubt apprehensions sunk in the months after Texas acted. According to Border Patrol figures, through the operation’s first seven months, there were 10,414 apprehensions a month. On average, then, apprehensions in each of the months were down 73 percent from June’s total of 38,446 -- the highest monthly total of any border sector since 2008. And did state law enforcement conclude the operation was successful due to the 74 percent difference cited by Perry? To that query, spokesmen gave nonspecific replies. By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said: ""It is clear that the surge operation directed by the Texas leadership to institute 24/7 saturation patrols on the Rio Grande River, the ground and in the air had a significant impact on the Mexican cartels’ ability to conduct successful smuggling operations along the border in the area of operation."" To our queries, DPS didn’t provide data on the operation’s effects on smuggling. Previously, the Austin American-Statesman said in a May 2015 news story that according to records, the DPS had been involved in less than 10 percent of Rio Grande Valley drug seizures tallied by the federal government since the state operation began. At the time, Vinger responded that stressing contributions by any one agency to the overall successes wasn’t logical--akin to ""trying to determine if a basketball team won a game by asking the point guard how many points he scored."" At different times in 2014-15, the DPS described reductions in apprehensions as a key indicator of law enforcement success--and not much of one. In July 2014, DPS Director Steve McCraw told a Texas House committee a decline in border apprehensions would be ""the best indicator across the board"" to qualify the operation as a success. Yet in April 2015, the agency wrote legislators to play down declines in apprehensions. The letter from Robert Bodisch, a deputy director, warned lawmakers of ""inaccurate and grossly misleading conclusions"" in an expected American-Statesman news story on the border surge. The letter said ""drug seizures and apprehensions are not a reliable means of accessing the level of security at the border."" (See the May 4, 2015, news story, a look into how best to measure the operation’s success, here.) At the time, Bodisch wrote that there’s one way to measure the level of security of the border: ""The only way to accurately assess the true level of security between the Ports of Entry is to be able to detect ALL smuggling events and determine whether each smuggling event was interdicted. Until you can detect and interdict all smuggling events between the Ports of Entry, the border will remain unsecured, regardless of the amount of drugs seized and people arrested."" For our part, we also reached the Texas National Guard’s public affairs office. By email, an unnamed contact said by email that its 1,000 troops ""amplified the visible presence on the ground and along the river to detect and prevent criminals from infiltrating the Texas-Mexico border and helping to ensure the safety of our fellow Texans."" Separately, the Border Patrol’s Zamora declined to comment on the impact of the Texas surge on apprehensions, calling our question ""too politically charged."" Other analyses Seeking other looks into Perry’s 74 percent declaration, we spotted a February 2015 report by the left-leaning Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy group focused on humanitarian missions in Central and South America. From October 2013 through September 2014, its report said, the Border Patrol reported its officers apprehended 49,959 unaccompanied children entering the Rio Grande Valley sector. From October 2014 through June 2015, the report said, far fewer minors — some 13,249 — were similarly apprehended, a decline of more than 25,000, or 59 percent. The report said the primary reason for the reduced apprehensions was, starting in July 2014, a crackdown by Mexico’s government on Central American immigrants. The references specifically to Perry surge were minimal, only mentioning the National Guard and DPS reinforcements that were sent to the border in the ""Border Security in the Rio Grande Valley"" subsection. The report, citing interviews with immigration experts from the Mexican government, said Mexico, acting at U.S. officials’ urging, ""curtailed migrants’ longstanding use of cargo trains to travel north from points near the Guatemalan border and stepping up deportations of apprehended Central Americans."" In May 2015, Factcheck.org, part of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Center on Public Policy, similarly noted the Mexican government’s increased attention to Central Americans, citing an April 2015 news article in The Arizona Republic that quoted Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher telling a Senate committee that the Border Patrol didn’t expect to see another surge in children crossing from Mexico because of the Mexican government’s crackdown. According to a report by the Mexican government footnoted in the Washington Office on Latin America report, there was a spike in Central Americans deported from Mexico in 2014 that coincided with the decrease in border apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley. Specifically, the report by Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Migración 2014 report, released in January 2015, said 67,097 individuals from the three Central American countries with the highest immigration totals -- Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- were deported in 2014 after that June, when the Texas operation took effect. In all of 2013, Mexico’s report said, 77,896 individuals from the aforementioned three Central American countries were deported by the Mexican government. To our inquiry, Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University’s Baker Institute of Public Policy, told us by email: ""Establishing a real cause-effect on Texas' efforts to secure the border is frankly very hard, but I am inclined to say that they really add very little to the enormous federal government efforts in progress well before Texas intervened."" In June 2014, according to the federal government, 115 Border Patrol officers were transferred to the Rio Grande Valley sector from other places. Later that month, the Department of Homeland Security announced the deployment of 150 additional Border Patrol agents to the sector. In July 2014, in addition, the Border Patrol announced an ad campaign in Central America, called the Danger Awareness Campaign, to warn potential immigrants about the dangers of crossing the Texas-Mexico border illegally. Our ruling Perry said: ""I deployed the Texas National Guard"" to the Texas-Mexico border. ""And the policy worked; apprehensions at the border declined 74 percent."" His statistic holds up, but Perry didn’t provide nor did we find proof the decrease resulted from the Texas surge. To be specific, Border Patrol apprehensions in the targeted part of the border region declined more than 70 percent through the second half of 2014. Unproven, however, is why that happened--and Perry’s statement crediting the Texas deployment ignored potentially substantive factors such as the Border Patrol staffing up, Mexico cracking down and, perhaps, a typical summer-to-winter flux. Proving the ""policy worked"" also is hindered by a lack of consensus on how to measure border security. This weakness similarly would apply, say, if President Barack Obama said the drop in apprehensions showed administration policies worked. We rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Chafee says drone strikes drive the unrest in Yemen
","Lincoln Chafee campaigned for president in New Hampshire last month proudly showcasing his foreign policy credentials based in large part on his opposition to the Iraq war. He also had some things to say about U.S. policy in Yemen. The targeting of al-Qaida terrorists with drones has killed militants and civilians in recent years. And many Yemenis have called on the Obama administration to end drone strikes, which Chafee refers to as ""extrajudicial killings."" ""No more drone strikes,"" Chafee said in New Hampshire. ""One of the reasons I believe we’re in trouble in Yemen is we lost the population on drone strikes issues. That’s what stirred up the population. That’s what is happening in Yemen."" The New America Foundation has counted 114 strikes in Yemen, all but one since 2009, with 15 this year responsible for 57 deaths. The foundation bases this information on ""credible news reports."" Have drone strikes turned the Yemen population against the U.S.? Is that the main issue?   We ask because there’s been heavy fighting in Yemen over the past eight months between Houthi rebels and Yemeni government forces backed by Saudi airstrikes. Cultural heritage sites have been destroyed. Food is in short supply. Rebels have chased the president from the capital city. And, according to a June 25 report in The New York Times, the warfare has displaced a million people. So why does Chafee place such a heavy emphasis on U.S. drone strikes? We asked Chafee’s spokeswoman, Debbie Rich, to provide evidence to support the candidate’s June 14 comments. An article provided by Rich from The Long War Journal, a respected source on the fight against terrorism, tells the story of a Yemeni provincial deputy governor, also the son of a prominent tribal leader, who was killed by a 2010 drone strike. At the other extreme, Rich also emailed an April 2014 Rolling Stone article, filled with the voices of Yemenis angered by U.S. drone strikes that have killed civilians. In addition, Peter Schaapveld, a British psychiatrist quoted in the Middle East Monitor, asserted that 99 percent of the people he met during a one-week visit to Yemen were suffering drone-related post traumatic stress syndrome. The fear of drones in Yemen, is ""traumatizing an entire generation,"" according to a quote in Rolling Stone. However, other experts we talked to say that what was happening in Yemen had a lot less to do with drones and a lot more to do with the war between militant Houthis, who are Shiite Muslims, and the current government, which is backed by the U.S. and by neighboring Saudi Arabia — a Sunni Muslim nation. Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution scholar with high-level foreign policy experience, including work for the Obama administration in 2009, wrote an analysis of the situation in Yemen one day after Chafee spoke. Riedel’s analysis doesn’t include a word about drones. ""It is safe to say that Yemen's civil war, the humanitarian catastrophe that it faces and the Saudi intervention in the country are not caused by drone strikes,"" Riedel told us in an email. ""Yemen's problems are much more complex than a result of the drones."" A more recent NPR clip provided by Rich, from January, includes comments from another Brookings Institution expert, Ibrahim Sharqieh, who asserted that U.S. drone strikes had contributed to instability in the country. But Sharqieh also blames the international community for ignoring the situation in Yemen over a two- to three-year period, not drones, when he talks about a solution to Yemen’s latest tumult. Another Yemen expert, Shaul Gabbay, a former professor at the University of Denver, asserts that it’s ""a very large leap"" to suggest that dissatisfaction with drone policy at the local level is an explanation ""for what is happening in Yemen."" ""For example, the fact that Iran is interested in destabilizing Yemen from the much more important macro conflict, arising from the Shiite/Sunni conflict, does not have anything to do with the specific use of drones,"" he said. And while surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center in other countries, including Pakistan and Jordan, have documented strong opposition to the targeting of militants with drones, no public opinion surveys have been done in Yemen.  And the director of Pew’s Global Attitudes surveys warns against making judgments about public opinion in the absence of a credible survey.   Our ruling There is strong evidence that the U.S. drones in Yemen have antagonized many Yemenis who might have been allies in the fight against al-Qaida.   But Chafee takes a big leap when he suggests that because of drone strikes ""we lost the population"" — especially when there are no public opinion polls to back him up. Others argue that a civil war, with little link, if any, to drone strikes, is what’s driving unrest in Yemen, pushing about one million people out of their homes. That makes more sense to us. We rate Chafee’s statement Half True.  (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)    ",/factchecks/2015/jul/26/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-drone-strikes-drive-unrest-yemen/

Conservative columnist: Trump once backed single-payer health care
","The rise of Donald Trump is striking not merely because it has come so quickly, but because there’s much in his resumé that clashes with Republican orthodoxy. Conservative columnist Erick Erickson ran down the list in a recent post on RedState.com. Trump has given money to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. He has supported abortion rights. And ""he has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system,"" Erickson wrote. We decided to look into Trump’s track record on health care. The billionaire’s 2000 book The America We Deserve makes a strong pitch for universal health care. ""I’m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one,"" Trump wrote. ""We should not hear so many stories of families ruined by health care expenses. We must not allow citizens with medical problems to go untreated because of financial problems or red tape."" When he turned to how the country might achieve universal coverage, Trump focused like a laser beam on a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. He said it would eliminate many billions of dollars of overhead. ""The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America,"" he wrote. ""We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing."" Ever the pragmatist, Trump noted change would not happen overnight. ""While we work out details of a new single-payer plan, there are a number of ways to make the health care system now in place work more efficiently,"" Trump wrote. So, it’s fair to say that in 2000, Trump supported a Canadian-style health care plan. By 2011, his views had changed. As he contemplated a presidential bid, he told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., that ""I will fight to end Obamacare and replace it with something that makes sense for people in business and not bankrupt the country."" In an interview with the New York Times, Trump backed away from a single-payer plan, as well as another of his proposals from a decade earlier, a surtax on the wealthiest Americans. ''We had a much different country when I proposed those two things,'' he said, according to the New York Times reporter. We searched the Nexis database of news reports for any other views Trump might have voiced on universal health care between 2000 and 2011 and found none. In a recent radio interview, Trump did not so much reject his previous support for a Canadian-style plan as describe, in a roundabout fashion, a totally different approach. He gave few details but said, ""we're going to have great (private) plans,"" and that government should help people ""at the lower levels."" ""You can’t have a guy that has no money, that’s sick, and he can’t go see a doctor, he can’t go see a hospital,"" Trump said. ""I mean, because I’m actually a conservative with a heart."" Our ruling Erickson said that Trump has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system. Trump’s own book from 2000 affirms that. By about 10 years later, he had changed his position.

Barack Obama met with Iran president, says PAC backing Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson for re-election
","A new super PAC supporting U.S. Sen Ron Johnson’s re-election bid released a TV ad July 22, 2015 that praises the Wisconsin Republican while criticizing President Barack Obama on Iran. A still image used in the ad, funded by the suburban-Chicago based Restoration PAC, purports to show Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Both men are smiling. Obama led negotiations that resulted in a deal, eight days before the ad was released, aimed at limiting the nuclear weapons capability of Iran -- a nation regarded by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. The two nations have been adversaries since 1979, when Islamic militants took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. So, was there a historic meeting between the two presidents that somehow never made worldwide headlines? The group and its ad Restoration PAC is led by Doug Truax, who in 2014 ran in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. It was formed in January 2015, according to the Federal Election Commission. The PAC said in a news release that the ad is running in Madison, Milwaukee and Green Bay in support of Johnson. He faces a tough re-election battle from former U.S. Sen. Russell Feingold, the Democrat he defeated in 2010 to win the Senate seat. At one point in the ad, the narrator says: ""Iran is funding terrorism not just in the Middle East but in Africa, Asia, South America and right here in the United States. Some of our leaders, like Ron Johnson, understand that preventing Iran from getting the bomb is essential to our safety."" Then an an image of Obama and Rouhani appears on the screen as the narrator says: ""Others, like President Obama, insist on signing a toothless agreement that makes us less safe."" A fake? The day after the ad was released, BuzzFeed News posted an article saying that not only have Obama and Rouhani never met, but that the image used in the ad was fake. Without citing a source, the article said the image was created from a photograph of Obama meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan in 2011. Asked for comment, Restoration PAC spokesman Dan Curry said, according to BuzzFeed: ""I don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re saying that’s a photoshop -- can you explain what you’re talking about?"" When Curry was told that Obama and Rouhani have never met, Curry said he would ""take a look at that,"" BuzzFeed reported. Curry did not reply to request for comment from PolitiFact Wisconsin. Perhaps because there is no meeting he could point to. In September 2013, Obama and Rouhani made history by talking on the phone -- the first direct conversation between leaders in Washington and Tehran since 1979. That signaled a change in relations that culminated in the nuclear deal. But, as two experts on Iran told us -- barring some meeting that has never been made public -- a phone call is the closest the two presidents have gotten. Certainly there is no record of them ever meeting in person. Our rating Through an image in a TV ad backing Johnson, Restoration PAC claimed Obama had met with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. The image shows the two men together smiling and shaking hands. There is no record that any such meeting has ever occurred. That makes the claim ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire. Editor's note: After this item was posted, Curry called PolitiFact Wisconsin to say the group had decided the day before -- after the Buzzfeed article -- to replace the image with side-by-side photos of the two men. He said the new ad began running the morning of July 24, 2015. (However, the old version contined to appear on YouTube and as a link from the group's website that afternoon). In a statement, Curry criticized BuzzFeed as ""not able to provide any proof that the photo was fake"" and noted the photo ""is in circulation widely on the internet, posted on dozens of websites. There also are no articles directly claiming the image is fake. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are replacing the image with side-by-side Obama and Rouhani photos that makes exactly the same point."" Editor's note II: When posted, this item included a link to a video of the ad in question.

Robert Henneke says Obama's Clean Power Plan eliminates coal-fired power plants
","A federal plan to drive down carbon emissions wipes out coal-fired power plants, an Austin analyst wrote. In a June 2015 opinion column published in the Austin American-Statesman, Robert Henneke of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation took issue with the Clean Power Plan released in 2014 by President Barack Obama’s administration. Henneke, director of the foundation’s Center for the American Future, wrote: ""Coal, the target of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, generates 34 percent of Texas’s electricity. The plan eliminates coal-fired power plants and requires Texas to assume reductions in excess of 27 other states combined."" It doesn’t surprise us that the nation’s second-largest state would be saddled with more reductions than a slew of other states. For this fact check, we focused on whether the Obama plan eliminates coal-fired plants — a claim the Texas office of the Environmental Defense Fund brought to our attention, calling it inaccurate. To our inquiry, a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, conceded by email that under the Environmental Protection Agency plan, all ""coal-fired plants are not eliminated, though,"" she said, ""a great number of them will be: enough to cause grievous harm to the Texas economy and Texas families."" Let’s summarize the plan, which is to be finalized this year, then explore its impact on coal-fired electricity plants. Clean Power Plan The Clean Power Plan is premised on the states by 2030 collectively driving down carbon emissions from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels — in part, the agency has said, through regional ""cap and trade"" networks, investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology — plus phase-outs of many existing coal-fueled plants. ""Power plants,"" the EPA says in a fact sheet last updated in June 2015, ""are the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, making up roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions."" A 2014 fact check But PolitiFact concluded previously that the plan doesn’t outlaw coal as fuel or require coal-fired plants to close. In August 2014, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., rated False a claim by U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., that the administration plan meant coal would not be permitted as an electricity fuel, even in limited amounts. In 2014, Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said: ""In no way does this program say coal can’t live. What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for"" technology upgrades. Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, said at the time that states would influence the process as each one creates its blueprint for decreasing emissions. ""It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can’t be coal,"" Jaffe said. EPA: Plan doesn't mandate retirement of coal-fired plants To our inquiry, a Washington-based EPA spokeswoman, Enesta Jones, said by email ""EPA’s proposal provides each state with enormous flexibility to design plans that meet their individual and unique needs, and does not mandate the retirement of any coal plants."" Nationally, though, coal is expected to recede as a fuel. The EPA’s initial estimates assumed 30 percent of the country’s energy would come from coal in 2030, down from 39 percent in 2013. According to the agency, the plan gives each state a different threshold for reducing carbon emissions it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among factors. And, the agency says, it’s up to each state to decide how to comply. Federal rules against mercury emissions, which experts have described as more stringent than the pending power plan, also could factor into coal fading. Foundation cites national and Texas studies Espinosa, elaborating on Henneke’s claim, told us there are reasons to expect Texas plants to close due to the plan. By email, she pointed out a May 2015 analysis of the plan undertaken by the U.S. Energy Information Administration at the request of U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Nationally under the plan, the report says, projected coal plant ""retirements,"" meaning closings, would total 90 gigawatts in power generation, most of that occurring by 2020. That prediction compares with an expected retirement of 40 gigawatts in coal-fueled power if the plan doesn’t take effect, the report says. New plants, the report says,would largely be fueled by natural gas and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Texas stands to see coal-fired generation decline by 100 billion kilowatthours by 2025 — alongside spurts in natural gas and renewable energy — with a slight coal rebound occurring by 2040, the report says. In the illustration below, the ""Base Policy"" case refers to EIA’s modeling of the Clean Power Plan and the ""AEO2015 Reference Case"" reflects its projections of energy supply, demand and prices based on federal, state and local laws in place as of October 2014 — in other words, without the EPA plan in effect:  Espinosa, in her email, said the ""remarkable extent of de facto coal-fire plant elimination in Texas"" is backed up by the the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition--which represents consumers and coal producers, transporters and industrial users, spokesman Russ Keene told us. By email, Keene said the EPA’s own Integrated Planning Model indicates 24 of the 41-coal fired power plants in Texas would close from 2020 to 2025 under the administration plan even though none are currently scheduled to retire for other reasons. The EPA in 2013 described the planning model as a ""multi-regional, dynamic, deterministic linear programming model of the U.S. electric power sector. It provides forecasts of least cost capacity expansion, electricity dispatch, and emission control strategies while meeting energy demand and environmental, transmission, dispatch, and reliability constraints. IPM can be used to evaluate the cost and emissions impacts of proposed policies to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), mercury (Hg), and"" hydrochloric acid ""from the electric power sector."" Espinosa forwarded an email from Austin attorney Michael J. Nasi, who represents the coalition, stating the calculations behind the projection were rooted in EPA data. Separately, Terry Hadley, spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, pointed out an August 2014 filing with the commission from Nasi on behalf of the Partnership for a Better Energy Future, which the filing describes as drawing together more than 150 trade groups including the American Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Texas Association of Business and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The filing says EPA’s assumptions about plants switching from coal to natural gas to reduce carbon emissions indicate Texas would experience a decrease of 72 million megawatt hours from coal-fired plants, most of that by 2020. Other analyses We asked others including the EPA  to assess the plan’s effect on coal-fired plants. By phone and email, Ilan Levin, an Austin-based lawyer for the Environmental Integrity Project, which focuses on strict enforcement of anti-pollution laws, questioned the coalition’s conclusion that the plan would result in 24 Texas coal-fired plants shutting down. While the EPA predicts a drop in coal-fired electricity by 2030, he said, and an EPA scenario involves Texas fulfilling its CO2-reduction goals by moving from coal to natural gas power generation and improved efficiency, Levin said, the federal plan ""simply sets goals and leaves it to the states on how to get there. It's premature to say the CPP eliminates coal plants,"" he said. That said, Levin added, there ""are certainly very realistic scenarios with retirements of many Texas coal plants in the next 15 years or so. But these are driven mainly by economics. Regulatory drivers, specifically EPA rules that will involve more costs to power plants, include a long list of anti- smog and mercury rules and clean water and waste rules that have been in development for years if not decades. So, CPP is an important rule,"" he said, ""but it has not yet been implemented by the states, so all the details in terms of how it will get implemented have yet to be written."" By phone, Adele Morris, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution, said coal has been supplanted by other fuel sources already for a variety of reasons, some of them regulatory, others having to do with natural gas being cheaper and new plants being cheaper to build than it costs to fix up old ones. Jones, the EPA spokeswoman, called the coalition’s calculation a ""reasonable interpretation of the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) data for the proposed Clean Power Plan.  Our own review was slightly different, showing 23 additional retirements in 2025,"" she said. ""Actual compliance may differ from the illustrative approaches that EPA lays out,"" she said, again noting each state is to determine how to meet its carbon reduction goals. In Texas, Robbie Searcy, a staff spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the flow of electricity to most Texans, responded to our inquiry by pointing us to a November 2014 report in which ERCOT estimated the proposed CO2 emission limits would result in the retirement of 3,300 to 8,700 megawatts of coal generation capacity in Texas. Yet Searcy also emailed us an agency summary of a December 2014 ERCOT report indicating multiple federal pollution regulations might explain plant closings. The summary said: ""Coal-fired power plants are the most affected by environmental regulations, which include the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, the Regional Haze program, the 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures Rule, the Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines Rule, the Coal Combustion Residuals Disposal Rule, and the proposed Clean Power Plan released earlier this year. ""ERCOT assessed the impacts of these regulations through a generator survey and a modeling analysis. Results indicate that the Regional Haze Program and Clean Power Plan, in combination with other regulations, could result in the retirement of up to 8,700 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation resources in the ERCOT region. That is about half the coal-fired capacity and more than 13 percent of the overall thermal generation resources, by MW, that serve ERCOT today."" By telephone, John Hall of the Environmental Defense Fund, Texas, said he read the December 2014 ERCOT report to mean the Clean Power Plan could by itself account for 200 megawatt hours in additional coal-fueled power plant reductions in Texas--which he said amounts to one third to one half of a plant. We asked ERCOT if it expects coal-fired plant closings due to many federal pollution regulations, with the pending power plan perhaps playing a minimal role? By email, Searcy said: ""Yes, ERCOT anticipates that some coal-fired plants will retire as a result of changes to environmental regulations. It is too early to tell what… role (minimal or otherwise) CPP specifically will play."" Our ruling Henneke said ""Obama’s Clean Power Plan ... eliminates coal-fired power plants."" That’s off the mark in that the plan, yet to be finalized, doesn’t wipe out any coal-fired plants. It looks to us like decisions to close plants (or individual units) will depend on how Texas decides to address its assigned carbon-reduction goals. Meantime, pollution limits already in place might hasten shutdowns--with or without the Clean Power Plan taking effect. We rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['History', 'States', 'Texas', 'Christine Gilbert']","
Letter writer says Texas Capitol built facing south in memory of battle at Goliad
","Amid debate about Confederate flags, statues and like symbols, artist Christine Gilbert of Austin drew our attention by spreading the word about a claim on a state web page that the Texas Capitol faces south to honor a revolutionary conflict. Gilbert wrote a letter to the editor of the Austin American-Statesman about the pink-granite Texas Capitol, planted in downtown Austin at the top of Congress Avenue north of the Colorado River. The letter, published July 11, 2015, opened by mentioning reader Jim Challstrom’s earlier letter saying he’d told Uber passengers that the Capitol (which opened in 1888) faces south ""to snub the Union."" In early 1861, after all, Texas had joined the rebellious Confederate States of America. Gilbert said she wondered if Challstrom was right, noting in her letter that the Capitol ""was built"" starting ""in 1885."" Also, she wrote, the ""previous Capitol was built in 1853 and also faced south,"" her point being that this construction occurred before the Civil War. Then Gilbert's letter quoted a statement on a Texas Senate web page: ""The Texas Capitol building faces South toward Goliad, in memory of the most horrific battle of the Texas Revolution. ‘Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!’ were cries that were heard in 1836."" Gilbert made us wonder afresh. Is Goliad, site of the infamous massacre of Texas soldiers about 130 miles southeast of Austin, why the Capitol faces south? A Texas Senate website A few days after Gilbert’s letter appeared, we clicked to the cited Senate web page, titled ""Capitol Images,"" and noticed 14 statements about the Capitol including the Goliad entry alongside photos from the archives of Senate Media Services: There were two major revolutionary turns in Goliad—an 1835 battle won by the Texians (pointed out to us by a reader after we initially posted this fact check) and a nearby battle of the Coleto in March 1836 where Col. James Fannin and his men were surrounded and forced to surrender. ""The Texans were imprisoned by the Mexicans at Goliad and subsequently murdered by order of Antonio López de Santa Anna"" with Fannin shot separately, according to an account by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. About a month later, Sam Houston led forces to victory at San Jacinto in the rout that brought Texas its independence by treaty in May 1836. Next, we contacted the secretary of the Texas Senate, Patsy Spaw, who told us by phone she didn’t know the basis of the Goliad reference on the Senate web page. ""I’m not certain we can say anything definitely about why the Capitol faces south, but the more likely reason,"" Spaw speculated by email, ""is that it was built to face the town and the river."" Historical resources We also ventured to the Legislative Reference Library and perused the ninth (2010) edition of a publication from the Texas Legislative Council, ""A History of the Lone Star Statehouse,"" which said the current Capitol was preceded by a one-story building a few blocks south and before that, just south of the current location, the three-story Old Stone Capitol, which was destroyed in an 1881 fire. That publication did not speak to why the Renaissance Revival-style Capitol that’s still in place faces south. We also reached the State Preservation Board, which maintains the Capitol, whose staff spokesman, Chris Currens, said by phone the agency has no records connecting the Capitol’s alignment and Goliad. Currens added that he believes the Capitol was built to face the heart of the city including its main business thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, in keeping with surveyor Edwin Waller’s plan for the city (see below) showing a Capitol Square in a prominent place on a rise north of the river. Waller's plan for Austin In 1839, according to the Handbook of Texas, Mirabeau Lamar, president of the young Republic of Texas, chose Waller to supervise the surveying and sale of town lots and the construction of public buildings at the new capital at Austin. Waller did so and also was elected Austin's first mayor in 1840.  SOURCE: Austin History Center (received by email from Chris Currens, director of special projects, State Preservation Board, July 15, 2015) Currens emailed us a page from a December 1989 report on the preservation board's master plan, which said: ""When Waller laid out the city of Austin between the river and two creeks (now Waller and Shoal), he situated his imaginary Capitol building at the high northern end of a grand avenue stretching 10 blocks from the river. His so-called Capitol Square, roughly the size of four city blocks, held the most prominent point in the plan, and Waller’s vision of the building was no doubt one of grandeur."" A 1932 thesis and a 2013 book Our search for insight on this claim led next to the Austin History Center where we read a 1932 master’s degree thesis on the building of the Capitol by Joubert Lee Greer. Greer noted that legislators who set the construction in motion specified in 1879 that it be located on the Capitol grounds. Later, the architectural plans developed by E.E. Myers of Detroit made it clear which way the main entrance would face. Greer wrote: ""The building was shown in the form of a Greek Cross, with the main entrance of the building fronting the south."" The thesis did not specify why. Meantime, Spaw advised by email that additional research by her office had yielded no sign of a Goliad element to the Capitol facing south. She pointed out that a 2013 book, ""Seat of Empire: The Embattled Birth of Austin, Texas,"" by Jeffrey S. Kerr of Austin, says Waller originally planned for the Capitol to be in the center of Austin ""grid"" that he drew south of the present-day Capitol but that when he arrived at the intended site, he decided the ""topography called for situating the public buildings on high ground to the rear so as to overlook the river.""  Spaw added: ""Of course, the current Capitol wasn’t built until much later but this indicates that the plan all along was to have the Capitol face the river."" Kerr also wrote that Waller ""quickly recognized the advantage of placing the permanent capitol to the rear of the city overlooking the sloping plains leading down to the river."" Reached by email, Kerr told us he’d never heard the Capitol was built to face Goliad. Facing the Capitol north would have turned it away from town, Kerr wrote. ""When it was designed in the 1880s most of the city (certainly the business part of town and government buildings) still lay toward the river."" He added: ""I cannot state that honoring Goliad was not a consideration; I've just never seen that mentioned anywhere."" Former Sen. Terrell's Goliad mention Like us, Spaw separately reached out to the state library where researchers unearthed a newspaper story from the 1880s quoting a former officeholder mentioning Goliad in a speech during ceremonies dedicating the new Capitol. Alexander Terrell, who as a state senator had carried legislation authorizing the sale of state-owned lands to fund the Capitol’s construction, recalled that after Austin became the capital, Texans came ""and erected a rude state house for the republic."" Urging celebrants to remember those who sacrificed their lives in the Texas Revolution, Terrell then mentioned Goliad, saying: ""This stately edifice typifies in its strength and fair proportions the unity of a mighty state. On its lofty dome you behold the statue of Liberty, holding up in her hand a single star to blaze amid its sister constellations, fit emblem of the aspirations, the grandeur and the unity of Texas. It rose above the massacre at Goliad to typify redemption. Its lustre is for all the land from the Red river to the Rio Grande, and from New Mexico to the gulf, and for a people who will preserve this state one and indivisible forever."" By email, Spaw agreed this Goliad mention did not demonstrate the Capitol was built to face that site. She also said that she'd ordered the declaration at issue removed from the Senate’s website. The Goliad claim isn’t substantiated, Spaw said. Our ruling Quoting a snippet on a Senate website, Gilbert said the Texas Capitol faces south toward Goliad in memory of a key battle in the Texas Revolution. We found no factual foundation to that; the Goliad claim also was removed from the site a few days after we launched our inquiries. Besides, we conclude, the Capitol faces south so lawmakers can perennially keep an eye on the Austin American-Statesman, located on the south bank of the Colorado River. Just kidding! The historical consensus is that in keeping with Waller's Austin vision, the Capitol was built, on a gentle rise at the top of the city’s main street, to face south toward the capital’s heart.

CORRECTION, 10:30 a.m., July 25, 2015: This story has been amended to correct the original version stating there was no battle at Goliad during the Texas Revolution.

Marco Rubio says Iran deal means we have to help defend Iran from Israel or other allies
","Sen. Marco Rubio says that part of the Iran deal could force the United States into the position of helping Iran defend itself against our allies, including Israel.    ""At the last minute, they were able to get all sorts of outrageous concessions including the concession that I talked about earlier which now says this: Iran, we have to help Iran protect itself against sabotage,"" Rubio said on Fox News July 22. ""If any other country tries to undermine their nuclear program, we have to help them defend themselves against Israel, Egypt, Saudis, our own allies."" As the Republican from Florida campaigns for president, he has repeatedly criticized the recently negotiated nuclear deal with Iran. Is he correct that the deal would force the United States to defend Iran from Israel and Egypt and Saudia Arabia? The Iran deal Six major powers including the United States reached an agreement this month with Iran with the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining or developing a nuclear bomb. The agreement has several components that include allowing inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor Iranian assets and lifting sanctions. The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously in favor of it while it is expected to receive a vote in Congress in September. A spokeswoman for Rubio’s campaign pointed to Article 10, Annex III, of the agreement which states: ""E3/EU+3 parties, and possibly other states, as appropriate, are prepared to cooperate with Iran on the implementation of nuclear security guidelines and best practices."" That includes the following: • ""Co-operation in the form of training courses and workshops to strengthen Iran's ability to prevent, protect and respond to nuclear security threats to nuclear facilities and systems as well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and physical protection systems; • ""Co-operation through training and workshops to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against, and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage, as well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and physical protection systems."" This Article has been criticized in the Israeli media. ""One of the clauses in the nuclear deal reached between world powers and Iran last week guarantees that the world powers will assist Iran in thwarting attempts to undermine its nuclear program,"" Israel Hayom, a newsletter, wrote July 20. But experts told PolitiFact that such interpretations are, at best, exaggerated. The aim of the provision, they said, is to protect nuclear materials from theft (say, if terrorists tried to steal Iranian assets) or from sabotage (with the intent of causing a hazardous-materials threat to health). For years, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, the United States has pushed countries around the world to improve security for their nuclear material and facilities, said Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard and an expert on nuclear theft and terrorism. This agreement furthers that goal, he said. ""It has nothing to do with helping Iran protect its nuclear facilities from a military attack"" of the kind that Israel or Egypt might carry out, Bunn said. ""It’s about protecting against thieves and terrorists who might want to steal nuclear material or sabotage a nuclear facility."" Bunn called Rubio’s interpretation ""absurd,"" asking whether the senator ""thinks it would be a good thing if a terrorist attack led to a Fukushima-scale release from the Bushehr reactor?"" Bunn added that by its plain language, the provision does not obligate any of the signatories, including the United States, to do anything in particular. Rather, it says the signatories are ""prepared"" to cooperate with Iran on these topics, with lots of wiggle room for all sides. ""My guess is that very little cooperation in these areas will take place,"" Bunn said. Russia and China might be willing to do some training, but nothing would force the United States to do so. If the United States did participate, there’s even some historical precedent for intelligence gains from this sort of activity, Bunn said. He said United States’ cooperation with Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union dramatically reduced the risk that nuclear material would be stolen and gave the U.S. insights into the Russian nuclear complex. Meanwhile, the agreement allows -- but doesn’t mandate -- training for Iran in protecting against threats such as cyber-sabotage. Some see this as ironic because of reports that Obama secretly ordered the Stuxnet computer virus to be launched against Iran to derail its nuclear program. But it’s hard to believe that the U.S. would share its secrets in this realm, and the agreement doesn’t force them to do so. ""Do you seriously think that any training we might offer Iran would help them ward off another Stuxnet?"" Bunn said. ""This is really silly. There are good arguments on both sides about this agreement, but this isn’t one of them."" Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. and a career Army officer, agreed that the agreement doesn’t prevent the U.S. from attacking Iran using cyber or other means or require the U.S. to develop measures to counter a future cyber attack. ""The intent (of the provision) is to make certain that Iran is capable to protect nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and help it prevent sabotage,"" he said. Justin Logan, director of foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed that while this particular article in the agreement is not very well defined, ""I would assume on the U.S. side that it is interpreted as pertaining to the sorts of nuclear insecurity we would worry about, not the kind we’ve been engaged in over the past several years. It’s a perfectly reasonable thing to ask about, but it’s irresponsible to jump to conclusions about its interpretation, as Rubio has here,"" he said. The strongest argument for the provision being problematic is that it could make it harder for the United States or its allies to degrade the Iranian nuclear complex if Iran doesn’t abide by the agreement. ""At one level, this is a good thing because there is an overriding interest in ensuring that nuclear materials are safeguarded,"" Brennan said. ""On the other hand, success in developing these security protocols would also make it more difficult to attack or degrade the program in the future should Iran violate the terms of the agreement."" The administration has been clear about how it interprets this provision. A day after Rubio made his claim on Fox News, he quizzed Secretary of State John Kerry on this portion of the deal during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Here is an excerpt: Rubio: ""If Israel conducts an airstrike against a physical facility, does this deal, the way I read it, does it require us to help Iran protect and respond to that threat?"" Kerry: ""No."" Rubio followed up with a similar question: Rubio: ""If Israel conducts cyber attack against Iranian nuclear program are we obligated to help them defend themselves against the Israeli cyberattack?"" Kerry: ""No, I assure you, that we will be coordinating very, very closely with Israel as we do on every aspect of Israel’s security."" Our ruling Rubio said that according to the Iran deal, ""if any other country tries to undermine (Iran’s) nuclear program, we have to help them defend themselves against Israel, Egypt, Saudis, our own allies."" The claim rests on an interpretation of a provision that the U.S. and other partners are prepared where ""appropriate"" to cooperate with training to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage. But this provision is targeted at terrorists and saboteurs, not ""countries"" as Rubio put it, and certainly not toward such U.S. allies as Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. Kerry made clear that that’s how the administration is interpreting it. And even if you adopt Rubio’s more expansive interpretation, nothing in the agreement says the United States will ""have to"" offer assistance, as Rubio puts it; the language of the provision offers significant wiggle room surrounding who, if anyone, might provide such assistance. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-iran-deal-means-we-have-help-defe/
"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
 Hussein did say he hoped to get WMD
","Sen. John McCain visited St. Petersburg, Fla., on June 4, 2008, to raise money for his presidential campaign, and sat down with

St. Petersburg Times

political editor Adam C. Smith for an interview.
 
McCain criticized his opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, as inexperienced, especially in foreign policy.
 
When asked about Obama's early opposition to the Iraq war when others, including McCain, thought it was necessary, McCain defended the invasion, saying the intelligence community believed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.
 
Smith pointed out that Florida's Bob Graham, former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, opposed the war, too.
 
""I respect Sen. Graham enormously,"" McCain said. ""But I don't think there's any doubt that Saddam Hussein, who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before, had invaded a neighbor, Kuwait, where we had to fight one war with him, that his intent was — and he said so himself after his capture — to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction.""
 
Most of what McCain said here has been heavily discussed, but we were intrigued by the very last sentence in McCain's quote, in which he says that Hussein had said after his capture that he intended to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction. True?
 
Among the most definitive records yet produced on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction is a report from the Iraq Survey Group, a group affiliated with the CIA. It released its initial report in 2004 and a concluding addenda in 2005. The report stated that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction during the run-up to the U.S. invasion in 2003.
 
The detailed report, which runs more than 1,000 pages, emphasizes that the story of Iraq's weapons is complex and unfolded over many years. One complicating factor was Hussein's repressive style of leadership, in which he often avoided direct discussion of sensitive military matters. Another was his desire to pursue multiple goals that sometimes conflicted with each other. After the Persian Gulf War of 1991, for example, Hussein very much wanted to present his country as an imposing military presence to avoid invasion by either the United States or Iran. But he also wanted to satisfy weapons inspectors and stop international sanctions that were causing economic problems for his country.
 
The report concluded that Hussein did away with his weapons program in the years after the Persian Gulf War, but deliberately encouraged ambiguity about whether his regime possessed the weapons or not. Hussein believed the threat of weapons would act as a deterrent to Iran and the United States. The report also said that Hussein intended to restart the program after the scrutiny of the international community was off him. Though that prospect could have been years off, Hussein kept weapons experts employed in the country for that purpose.
 
But, what about Hussein's remarks after he was captured? Here's what we know:
 
The Iraq Survey Group interviewed scores of people, including Hussein's top advisers. After his capture in 2003 by the U.S. government, the survey group gained access to information gleaned from Hussein during detention.
 
In 2008, Hussein's interrogator for the group, George Piro of the FBI, gave a lengthy interview to Scott Pelley of

60 Minutes

in which he discussed what Hussein said while in custody.
 
Piro, a native Arabic speaker, said that Hussein told him he wanted to pursue weapons of mass destruction again.
 
""What weapons of mass destruction did he intend to pursue again once he had the opportunity?"" Pelley asked.
 
""He wanted to pursue all of WMD,"" Piro said. ""So he wanted to reconstitute his entire WMD program.""
 
""Chemical, biological, even nuclear?"" Pelley asked.
 
""Yes,"" Piro said.
 
McCain's statement was quite specific: He said Hussein intended to acquire weapons, not that he had them. That's what our review of the evidence shows. Granted, the evidence was compiled by the U.S. intelligence community, the same group that got the weapons question wrong before the invasion. But it's the best record publicly available, and it supports McCain's statement. Hussein told Piro that he did want to pursue weapons of mass destruction someday. So we find McCain's statement to be True.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Republican Party of Florida']","
Castro not stumping for Obama
","The subject line of an e-mail from the Republican Party of Florida was designed to grab attention: ""Fidel Castro endorses Obama.""
 
Inside is a doctored (read: fake) image of Castro holding a poster of Obama. Above Castro are the words, ""I love this guy!""
 
A link in the e-mail sends you to an article that states that Castro gave Obama ""a qualified endorsement,"" calling him ""the most advanced candidate"" in a commentary published in a Communist newspaper on May 26, 2008.
 

 
The absurdity of this claim is demonstrated by the very headline of Castro's article: ""The empire's hypocritical politics.""
 
In the article, Castro actually spends most of his words criticizing a speech Obama made to the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami just a few days before, on May 23. In that speech, Obama pledged that if elected, he would immediately allow unlimited family travel to Cuba and family members to send money to relatives in Cuba. Obama reiterated his position that he would meet with the leaders of enemy nations without preconditions. But the thing that really raised Castro's ire was Obama's vow to maintain the embargo as ""leverage"" to encourage Cuba to ""take significant steps towards democracy.""
 
Here was Castro's assessment:
 
""I feel no resentment towards him (Obama), for he is not responsible for the crimes perpetrated against Cuba and humanity. Were I to defend him, I would do his adversaries an enormous favor. I have therefore no reservations about criticizing him and about expressing my points of view on his words frankly.""
 
Yes, Castro says Obama is ""doubtless, from the social and human points of view, the most progressive candidate to the U.S. presidency."" Castro also praises Obama's ""great intelligence, his debating skills and work ethic."" But it amounts to lesser-of-two-evils praise, at best. For example, Castro later calls the embargo that Obama pledged to maintain ""an act of genocide.""
 
Said Castro: ""Presidential candidate Obama's speech may be formulated as follows: hunger for the nation, remittances as charitable handouts and visits to Cuba as propaganda for consumerism and the unsustainable way of life behind it.""
 
Not exactly a warm and fuzzy endorsement.
 
Katie Gordon, press secretary for the Republican Party of Florida, said the whole thing was a joke. The ""cartoon"" image, she said, was not meant to be taken literally.
 
""It was our way of finding a creative way to illustrate a larger point,"" Gordon said. ""The idea is that Sen. Barack Obama has expressed numerous times his willingness to sit down with the leaders of Communist regimes."" While Castro did not literally endorse Obama, she said, the point is that Castro stated that ""of the people running for president, he (Obama) is the one he'd prefer to work with.""
 
But Castro never says that in his commentary.
 
Gordon said she doesn't think the image or the headline caused any confusion. The e-mail isn't trying to say that Castro ""actually"" endorsed Obama, she said. Rather, she said, it was used as an attention-getter.
 
First of all, it was not a ""cartoon"" image. It was a doctored photograph. And a pretty good one. A trained eye, or someone who closely follows Cuban politics, would probably recognize the image as implausible. But it's too realistic-looking to be passed off as a cartoon spoof.
 
And we realize the word ""endorse"" can have a formal meaning, as well as a generic one. A

New York Times

blog originally ran a story about Castro's commentary under a headline that read ""Castro's stinging endorsement."" The story now carries the headline ""Castro Weighs In on Obama."" An update notes: ""The headline was altered to avoid the misinterpretation that Mr. Castro's remarks represented a formal endorsement."" But we don't think Castro's commentary even amounts to a generic ""endorsement.""
 
The RPOF makes our call on this one easy. Even its press secretary acknowledged the claim that Castro endorsed Obama is not accurate. She said it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. We're all for keeping a sense of humor in this long election season. But there are better ways to get people's attention than to distort facts. And this comes off less like a joke and more like an intentional smear. We rate it Pants on Fire.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Barack Obama']","
Yes, but you can't lump Gorbachev with Mao
","Sen. John McCain has been putting the heat to Sen. Barack Obama for the senator's willingness to meet with the leaders of enemy nations ""without any preconditions.""
 
Obama has countered that principled, strong involvement is a better option than President Bush's failed approach of not reaching out, which he says has made countries like Iran stronger.
 
Obama has also pointed to the history of American diplomacy, saying on May 20, 2008:
 
""Ronald Reagan met with Gorbachev; Kennedy met with Khruschev; and Nixon met with Mao — and these were folks who have done horrendous damage not only to their own countries but to other countries.""
 
First, those meetings did take place. And they happened without any public demand by the American presidents that action be taken by the other side before the sitdowns could occur, according to scholars of U.S. diplomacy with the Soviet Union and China.
 
In fact, in the case of Nixon's 1972 meeting with Mao, there's evidence that the Chinese were the ones with demands, making it clear America would have to lay off the question of Taiwanese sovereignty if it wanted to meet, said Robert Sutter, a visiting professor at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.
 
Nikolas Gvosdev, editor of the

National Interest

and a senior fellow at the Nixon Center, said there were no public demands that the Soviet Union make concessions or change policy as a condition for Kennedy's 1961 summit with Khruschev or for the Reagan/Gorbachev talks, the first held in 1985.
 
If you define the idea of ""preconditions"" more loosely as diplomatic agreements that set the agenda and parameters of such high-level talks between heads of state, then that certainly did happen, Gvosdev said.
 
Obama hinted at this latter approach during the May 20 appearance, saying, ""Keep in mind, I have never said that I would somehow have meetings with these folks right away, that there wouldn't by any preparation for them.""
 
Obama should have been more careful, however, about how he characterized those leaders whom American presidents met with.
 
There's a strong consensus among scholars that Mao ranks among the great tyrants of the 20th century, who did indeed cause ""horrendous damage"" to his country and others.
 
Khruschev is both loathsome and admirable, scholars say. He did have blood on his hands as Stalin's deputy in the Ukraine and the move to crush the Hungarian uprising in 1956. But he also freed prisoners from the Gulags and had a record as a reformist.
 
As for Gorbachev, his reforms sparked domestic disorder and a hard-liner could argue that as a younger man he helped perpetuate an evil system, but even Reagan gave him credit for bringing about the end of the Cold War, as does history.
 
Gorbachev is ""not in a class with Khruschev who is not in a class with Mao when it comes to damaging his own country and the world,"" said William Taubman, a professor of political science at Amherst College who won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Khruschev in 2004.
 
Stephen F. Cohen, a professor for Russian and Slavic studies at New York University, said Obama should have stuck to the thrust of his argument, that American presidents had a record of meeting with antagonistic heads of state, rather than getting into details.
 
""I think he violated a rule of political campaigning,"" Cohen said. ""Be as imprecise as possible when making generalizations.""
 
So while Obama is right that American presidents have met with some contentious leaders, he's wrong to say that they all had horrendous records. Gorbachev stands out as the strongest exception. We give Obama a Mostly True.

Obama and Bush found common ground
","On the campaign trail, Sen. Barack Obama regularly criticizes President Bush's ""failed policies"" and leadership abilities. On the floor of the Senate, however, the freshman from Illinois is much less contrary than his rhetoric would suggest.
 
Responding to Obama's criticisms of Sen. John McCain's 95 percent presidential support score in 2007, McCain's campaign on June 3, 2008, sent a mass e-mail noting that Obama's own presidential support score is higher than one might think.
 
The e-mail cited vote studies compiled by

Congressional Quarterly

to note that Obama voted to support President Bush's positions between 40 and 50 percent of the time over the past two years. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers also noted that Obama voted with his party more than 95 percent of the time during that period, while McCain was more independent, tallying party unity scores between 70 and 90 percent.
 
""Can you imagine Obama touting his record of supporting President Bush half the time? Well, it's true by his numbers,"" Rogers said.
 
McCain's campaign is correct on both counts. Though Obama is a loyal Democrat who has opposed Bush on legislation more often than the average for his party in the Senate, running for president hasn't made him significantly more partisan. He opposed Bush 51 percent of the time in 2006 and 60 percent of the time in 2007.
 
In 2007, Obama found himself in Bush's camp on immigration policy; in a series of votes, Obama backed legislation, which failed, that would have provided a temporary guest worker program and new border security measures. Obama and Bush also were allied on legislation that raised the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour over two years and provided $8.3-billion in small-business tax incentives. In 2006, as Obama was laying the foundation for his presidential bid, he supported the president's position on key votes dealing with immigration policy and on making permanent 14 provisions in the ""Patriot Act"" antiterrorism law.
 
All of which hardly makes Obama a full-blown Bush supporter. But his record also doesn't put him near the Senate's top 10 Bush foes — a list headed in 2007 by Democrats Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Barbara Boxer of California, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who each were opposed to Bush more than 65 percent of the time. Because Obama has shown a willingness to vote the administration's position on a number of occasions over the past two years, we rule the McCain campaign's claim True.

"['National', 'Bush Administration', 'Barack Obama']","
That's what the votes show, yes
","Sharpening his attack line that electing Sen. John McCain is the equivalent of giving President Bush a third term, Sen. Barack Obama used his triumphant speech in St. Paul, Minn. June 3, 2008, in which he finally claimed the Democratic nomination, to note that his Republican rival voted with the commander-in-chief 95 percent of the time last year.
 
""It's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year,"" Obama said.
 
The number Obama cited didn't come out of thin air. It reflects McCain's 2007 ""presidential support"" score from

Congressional Quarterly,

part of a carefully measured and widely cited series of vote studies that demonstrate how often lawmakers back or oppose the president, as well as the majority of their parties.
 
But while Obama may be accurately quoting the CQ analysis of 2007, he's selectively picking facts while not telling the entire story.
 
McCain's 95 percent score was the high-water mark of his presidential support during President Bush's tenure, and was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the Democratic-controlled Congress. McCain supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005, and backed the president's position an average of 89 percent of the time since 2001. By congressional standards, that's solidly partisan, but hardly marching in lockstep.
 
The 2007 votes reflected the Senate agenda after Democrats gained a one-vote majority in the chamber in the 2006 mid-term elections. Bush stated a position on 97 roll call votes and won 64 of them — a 66 percent success rate. Deduct the 29 Senate votes to confirm Bush nominees to executive branch positions or judgeships, and the president's success rate fell to just over 51 percent.
 
But while he had a terrible year on paper, Bush was the winner on critical votes on spending limits, taxes and energy policy, thanks to unified support from Republicans. Because Senate rules require 60 votes to end prolonged debate or a filibuster, Republicans repeatedly used the stalling tactic to stop initiatives on the Democrats' agenda. The Senate voted 18 times last year on motions to cut off debate and end filibusters that Bush was on record as supporting. He prevailed 17 times.
 
McCain missed more than half the votes on which Bush had a position, as he campaigned for the White House. But repeated votes on immigration and the Iraq war — two issues on which he was closely allied with Bush — as well as the filibuster votes helped elevate McCain from one of the president's chief adversaries three years ago to one of his biggest supporters.
 
McCain's vote score can thus be viewed both as a reflection of ideological kinship with the Bush administration and with the hard-line, tactical decisions he made in response to some Democratic initiatives. Because Obama correctly quotes an accurate measure of how often McCain was in sync with the president in 2007, we rule the claim True.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Counting votes is tricky this year
","After winning the primary in Puerto Rico on June 1, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton proclaimed in her victory speech, ""We are winning the popular vote!""
 
Clinton's implicit argument is that she may trail Sen. Barack Obama in delegates — the representatives who attend the convention and formally choose the nominee — but she's winning by another measure that should be more compelling.
 
It's an argument that could resonate with the Democrats' bitter memory of the 2000 campaign, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush in the Electoral College.
 
But it's important to note that general elections are very different from nominating contests. In the general election, people in every state vote on the same day. For the nominating contest, people don't always vote — sometimes they caucus — and the political parties control when and how the contests unfold.
 
Which brings us to the significant problems with the way Clinton arrives at her winning number.
 
These problems chiefly have to do with the state of Michigan. Recall that before the nominating process kicked off with the Iowa caucuses back in January, Michigan and Florida moved their primaries to earlier in the year without the authorization of the Democratic Party. As punishment, the party stripped the two states of their delegates, and Clinton and Obama promised not to campaign in the states.
 
This very likely suppressed turnout.
 
""They were not elections that were conducted as free and fair elections in any sense of the words,"" said Anthony Corrado, professor of government at Colby College in Maine.
 
In Florida, neither candidate campaigned, and Clinton beat Obama by a good margin, about 17 percent.
 
In Michigan, state rules allowed candidates to remove their names from the ballot, which Obama and several other Democratic candidates did. Clinton, however, did not remove her name. In the primary, Clinton faced off against Chris Dodd, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich and Uncommitted.
 
When Clinton calculates her popular vote lead, there's no way she can get to a winning number unless she counts Michigan, where Obama's name was not on the ballot. The Clinton campaign has said Obama didn't have to take his name off the ballot, which is true, but counting a Clinton victory over Obama when his name didn't appear on the ballot is dubious.
 
Another problem with the nomination process is the difficulty with counting voter support in caucus states. Caucuses can work different ways, but in some cases voters don't cast traditional ballots. In Iowa's Democratic caucus, for instance, supporters stand in different parts of a meeting room. Minor candidates are knocked out of the running, and their supporters in turn pick new candidates. At the end of the night, each candidate's support is translated into state delegates, who attend a state convention and

then

pick delegates to go to the national convention. But there's never a formal tally of individual caucusgoers.
 
In caucuses, the best that can be done is to calculate estimates, based on state delegates and turnout estimates; Obama holds a sizable lead in these contests.
 
The news Web site

RealClearPolitics

has developed caucus estimates for Iowa, Nevada, Maine and Washington, and has applied it to several scenarios involving Michigan:
 
* If you don't count Michigan, Obama wins the popular vote with or without caucus estimates.
 
* If you do count Michigan, Clinton wins the popular vote with or without caucus estimates.
 
* If you count Michigan and award Uncommitted's votes to Obama, then Obama wins with the caucus estimates, and Clinton wins without caucus estimates.
 
Obama could similarly claim to lead the popular vote, Corrado said. But Clinton is talking about the popular votes because she can't say she has won the most delegates or the most states.
 
""The bottom line is that they have divided the vote up fairly closely,"" he said. ""It shows how closely contested the race was between these two candidates. It's really remarkable when you think about it.""
 
Indeed, in every scenario presented by RealClearPolitics, whether Obama leads or Clinton leads, the difference between the two candidates is less than 1 percent.
 
For Clinton's statement to be true, a lot hinges on how you think Michigan's votes should be counted, and how you handle voter support in the caucus states. We can't say how Obama would have done in Michigan if his name had been on the ballot, but he certainly would have garnered more than zero votes. The wishes of voters in caucus states should also be considered for a claim on the popular vote. Finally, some could argue that you shouldn't count Florida since neither candidate campaigned there.
 
For all of these reasons, we find Clinton's argument that she's winning the popular vote to be true only if you consider the messy, real-world results in the light most favorable to Clinton, and for this reason we find her claim Barely True.

Present for votes, but not a player
","Nuclear proliferation is one of those arcane-but-important issues that tends to get pushed into the shadows during presidential campaigns. But as Sen. John McCain tries to distance himself from Bush administration policies, he's using the topic to help make his case.
 
In a May 27, 2008, speech in Denver, McCain endorsed seeking a new disarmament treaty with Russia and said he was open to re-evaluating the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on underground nuclear tests that he voted against in 1999. Additionally, McCain called for eliminating the ""bunker buster"" that President Bush supports.
 
Experts say the positions put McCain in a more centrist camp than Bush on the question of how to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. They may also reflect a desire by McCain to steal some of his Democratic rival's thunder. Sen. Barack Obama has made nonproliferation something of a specialty during his 3 years in the Senate, partly by virtue of his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
 
Responding to McCain's speech, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton charged the veteran Arizona senator was playing catch-up, and asserted that Obama has been the more prominent player on nonproliferation during his brief tenure in the chamber.
 
""By embracing many aspects of Barack Obama's nonproliferation agenda today, John McCain highlighted Obama's leadership on nuclear weapons throughout this campaign, and his bipartisan work with Richard Lugar in the Senate. No speech by John McCain can change the fact that he has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate,"" Burton said.
 
He's got it right. Obama last year teamed with Nebraska Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel to write a nuclear nonproliferation bill that, among other things, called for disarmament talks with Russia and for ratifying a global ban on nuclear testing, and strengthened efforts to halt the transfer of weapons and fissile material. Portions of the bill dealing with terrorist threats were incorporated into a fiscal 2008 Foreign Operations spending bill enacted into law. Obama also collaborated with Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., on enacting a 2007 law allowing the United States to export nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for peaceful purposes for the first time in three decades. President Bush praised it for increasing the transparency of India's civilian nuclear program.
 
McCain certainly has been a key player on many thorny and controversial issues during his long Senate career, among them campaign finance reform, tobacco regulation and national security by virtue of his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. But a look at his record on nonproliferation shows he mostly showed up for key votes but didn't influence debates.
 
During a 2004 debate on a fiscal 2005 defense authorization bill, McCain endorsed the continuation of the nuclear bunker buster by voting against a Democratic amendment that would have eliminated money for studying the weapon and for research efforts into low-yield nuclear weapons. The amendment was rejected 42-55.
 
As he noted in the Denver speech, McCain in 1999 voted with a majority of Republicans against the Test Ban Treaty, a pact that garnered attention after nuclear tests in India and Pakistan increased tension between the countries. Conservatives at the time questioned how the ban would affect the long-term prospects of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, and thought then-President Bill Clinton's desire to set an example to the global community by ratifying the treaty was misguided. The pact – which the Senate rejected, 48-51 – also required the approval of the 44 nations with nuclear capability; at the time of vote, only 26 had approved it.
 
In 1997, McCain was among 29 of 55 Republicans who joined with 45 Democrats to ratify the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which banned the development, production, sale, use or stockpiling of chemical weapons. And in 1992, he voted with the majority of the Senate in a 93-6 tally to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which provided for reduction of about one-third in the arsenals of long-range missiles and bombers of the United States and former Soviet Union.
 
""The majority of people following the issue would point out McCain has not taken a leadership role on nonproliferation during his career in the Senate,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association.
 
In spite of McCain's moves to the center, and his more fleshed-out positions on nonproliferation, we don't find much in McCain's Senate record to refute the charge of the Obama camp. We say, True.

McCain's off on Iraq details
","Immediately following days of allegations from Sen. John McCain and his allies that Sen. Barack Obama is short on knowledge about Iraq, McCain made a pair of questionable claims about the war.
 
They came during his discussion of the troop surge at a town hall-style event in Greensdale, Wis., on May 29, 2008.
 
""I can tell you it is succeeding. I can look you in the eye and tell you it's succeeding,"" McCain said. ""We have drawn down to presurge levels. Basra, Mosul and now Sadr City are quiet.""
 
Problem is, the U.S. military has not drawn down to presurge levels, according to the Pentagon. Before the start of the surge last year there were about 132,000 troops in Iraq — now there are about 155,000, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mark Ballesteros said.
 
And what about McCain's characterization of Basra, Mosul and Sadr City? All three are places where Iraqi and American forces have launched offensives of late, with varying degrees of success.
 
Basra is indeed enjoying a period of relative calm two months after some 33,000 members of the Iraqi security forces, backed by smaller contingents from the American and British militaries, launched a push called Operation Charge of the Knights to regain control from militias, according to news accounts and the Web site of Multinational Force-Iraq.
 
Relative peace also has reportedly graced Sadr City, a district of Baghdad, following a cease-fire in mid May between government forces and followers of Muqtada al-Sadr. At the urging of Sadr, thousands of residents flooded the streets a day after McCain made his remarks to protest negotiations between the Iraqi government and U.S. officials to allow U.S. forces to stay in Iraq past the December expiration of the U.N. mandate allowing them in the country.
 
Mosul, however, is not quiet. It's true that an Iraqi army and police campaign against al-Qaida in Iraq there met little resistance when it was launched in early May, according to accounts of news reporters on the ground. But on May 29, earlier on the very day McCain made his remarks, at least two Iraqi commandos were killed and nine other people wounded in a suicide bombing in the city, according to the Pentagon's Web site, as well as news accounts. Other attacks were reported in the area surrounding Mosul that day.
 
McCain foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann characterized McCain's comment about troop levels as a mere ""verb tense"" mistake — meaning he had spoken in the present instead of the future tense. And he said McCain has no misconceptions about the situation in Mosul. ""Clearly there is continuing combat there,"" Schenemann said. ""I don't think he's saying that there's no combat in Mosul.""
 
But what else could he have meant by ""quiet""? And when it comes to describing events in a war zone, tense is rather important. We find that McCain erred in his assertion about troop levels and in his characterization of conditions in Mosul. He was, however, accurate in describing the situation in Sadr City and Basra. We say his statement is Barely True.

Maybe not a lot, but Obama held fundraisers
","Due to a pledge not to campaign in Florida — as punishment for Florida holding an early primary on Jan. 29, 2008 — Sen. Barack Obama had been a no-show in the Sunshine State since last fall.
 
Obama tried to make up for lost time with his first big campaign swing through Florida in mid May. On May 22, the day Obama drew a crowd of 15,000 for a speech in Tampa,

St. Petersburg Times

political editor Adam C. Smith asked Obama in a private interview if the no-campaign pledge might have consequences with Florida voters.
 
""Do you see why some Floridians would be offended by that? Raising money but not willing to talk about issues?"" Smith asked.
 
Said Obama: ""I think we came down here one time, I think for a day, after that rule was passed, because we already had a series of things that were scheduled. But we weren't actively fundraising here.""
 
That might come as news to some of the folks who attended a $1,000-per-person fundraiser Obama attended at the home of Tim and Donna Main in St. Petersburg on Sept. 30, or to the 200-plus guests who donated $1,000 apiece to hear Obama make a brief speech at the home of David and Lisa Grain in Sarasota on Nov. 5.
 
According to press accounts, on Sept. 30, 2007, Obama appeared at private fundraisers at homes in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Miami.
 
On Nov. 5, Obama stopped in for a fundraiser at the bayfront home of a supporter in Bird Key, Sarasota. According to the

Sarasota Herald Tribune,

more than 200 guests paid at least $1,000 each or committed to raise as much as $10,000 for Obama's campaign.
 
And Michelle Obama attended three fundraisers at private homes in Florida — in Tampa, Sarasota and Coral Gables — on Dec. 13 and 14.
 
Miami lawyer Kirk Wagar, Obama's Florida finance director, downplayed those fundraising efforts. The late September fundraisers were planned in August before the pledge and Obama was simply following through on a commitment, he said.
 
And the November fundraiser was a quick stop-off on Obama's return from a campaign trip to Puerto Rico. Obama is on such a whirlwind campaign tour, he probably just forgot about that other brief fundraiser in November, Wagar said.
 
And Wagar doesn't count the visits to Florida by Michelle Obama.
 
""He'd have been specifically talking about himself,"" Wagar said.
 
Frank Sanchez, a top Obama fundraiser and adviser in Tampa, said Obama's statement is ""pretty accurate.""
 
""Three visits in nine months, from a fundraising perspective, is pretty dismal,"" Sanchez said. ""He came down here twice, and Michelle came down once. That's fundraising? Not in my book.""
 
Even without Obama making visits, the campaign's money-raising machine chugged along quite nicely. One night earlier this year, the Obama campaign had fundraising events at 100 different house parties around the state.
 
In all, the campaign raised more than $9-million for Obama in Florida by the end of March, Wagar said, with about $5.5-million coming from donations of $200 or more.
 
They'd have raised a lot more, Sanchez said, if Obama had not signed the pledge against campaigning in Florida. ""Nothing compares to when we have the candidate or their spouse,"" Sanchez said.
 
Assuming that Obama was talking about the three Sept. 30 fundraising parties when he referred to the campaign's one visit to Florida, that still leaves out the Nov. 5 fundraiser in Sarasota. No, that's doesn't amount to a whole lot, and some may consider it nitpicking to say otherwise.
 
But the fact is that after signing the ""no campaigning"" pledge, Obama came to Florida twice — a month apart — and held four private fundraising events. We call that active fundraising. And while Obama's Florida finance director doesn't think Michelle Obama's visit counts when Obama says ""we"" have only been to Florida one time, we think it does. We rate Obama's statement False.

But the thesis did not say that the United States was founded on ""crime and hatred"" and that whites in America are ""ineradicably racist."" This appears to be a complete fabrication.
 
The thesis is available on the Internet;

E-mail takes college work out of context
","A chain e-mail about Michelle Obama, the wife of presidential candidate Barack Obama, purports to be excerpts from a senior thesis she wrote while at Princeton University.
 
It's true that Obama, then Michelle Robinson, attended Princeton and wrote a thesis 23 years ago titled ""Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.""
 
The e-mail takes a few actual sentences out of context, and fabricates a few quotes that don't exist in her work.
 
The e-mail begins:
 
""In her senior thesis at Princeton, Michele Obama, the wife of Barack Obama stated that America was a nation founded on 'crime and hatred.' Moreover, she stated that whites in America were 'ineradicably racist.' The 1985 thesis, titled 'Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community' was written under her maiden name, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson.""
 
But

nowhere in the thesis does Obama write the words ""crime and hatred"" or that whites are ""ineradicably racist.""

The e-mail does get the thesis title, Obama's maiden name, and the year correct. It also uses real quotations from the thesis, though a few are taken out of context.
 
For this fact check, we'll look at the following statement the e-mail says is from Obama's thesis:
 
""There was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the black community, I am obligated to this community and will utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit the black community first and foremost. ""
 
The e-mail then asks, ""What is Michelle Obama planning to do with her future resources if she's first lady that will elevate black over white in America?""
 
In Obama's thesis, she sought to quantify how the attitudes of black Princeton alumni changed after graduation in regard to race relations and social change. Obama was especially interested in the attitudes of Princeton alumni in regard to improving the lives of lower-income blacks.
 
To document the change in attitudes, Obama devised an 18-question survey and mailed it to black alumni. Her thesis is a discussion of her methodology and an analysis of the results. It contains a limited amount of personal opinion in the introduction, including the sentence above. Here is a fuller exerpt:
 
""Earlier in my college career, there was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the Black community I was somehow obligated to this community and would utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit this community first and foremost. My experiences at Princeton have made me far more aware of my 'Blackness' than ever before. I have found that at Princeton no matter how liberal and open-minded some of my White professors and classmates try to be toward me, I sometimes feel like a visitor on campus; as if I really don't belong. Regardless of the circumstances under which I interact with Whites at Princeton, it often seems as if, to them, I will always be Black first and a student second.""
 
But Obama writes a few paragraphs later that her earlier assumptions were changing, too:
 
""At the same time, however, it is conceivable that my four years of exposure to a predominately White, Ivy League University has instilled within me certain conservative values. For example, as I enter my final year at Princeton, I find myself striving for many of the same goals as my White classmates — acceptance to a prestigious graduate or professional school or a high paying position in a successful corporation. Thus, my goals after Princeton are not as clear as before.""
 
Certainly, Obama's thesis is race-conscious. But the statement used in the e-mail doesn't include the context, that Obama's desire to help the black community ""first and foremost"" was leavened by later ""conservative"" values such as attending school or getting a well-paying job.
 
Perhaps at this point it's best to point to some outside commentary. When the thesis became public in February 2008, it was a topic on the Fox News show

Hannity & Colmes

. Former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, a noted conservative and a commentator for the network, said on the show he thought her thesis work wasn't relevant to the current campaign.
 
""First off, a spouse's personal life is out of bounds, period, end of discussion,"" Santorum said. ""This is something that she did at an age when you write some pretty strange stuff sometimes. I hope they don't pull up my college thesis papers.""
 
The quote about Obama wanting to help the black community ""first and foremost"" is an actual quote from her senior thesis. But it's not given the proper context. And nowhere in her thesis does she say the black community should be elevated over the white community, as the person who wrote the e-mail claims. On these grounds, we rate the statement Half True.

""I had an uncle who was . . . part of the first American troops to go into Auschwitz and liberate the concentration camps,"" Obama said in the speech on May 26, 2008. ""And the story in our family was that when he came home, he just went up into the attic and he didn't leave the house for six months. Right? Now obviously something had really affected him deeply. But at that time there just weren't the kinds of facilities to help somebody work through that kind of pain.""
 
Obama's story immediately seems implausible because Auschwitz was liberated in 1945 by Soviet, not American, troops. It's further complicated by a back-and-forth between Republicans and the Obama campaign the day after his remarks.
 
The Republican National Committee issued a press release drawing attention to the historical gaffe.
 
""Barack Obama's dubious claim is inconsistent with world history and demands an explanation,"" Republican National Committee Secretary Alex Conant said in a statement. ""Obama's frequent exaggerations and outright distortions raise questions about his judgment and his readiness to lead as commander in chief.""
 
Later that day, the Obama campaign acknowledged getting the location wrong but said Obama's great uncle (his grandmother's brother) was part of liberating a concentration camp in Ohrdruf, a subcamp of Buchenwald in Germany.
 
""Sen. Obama's family is proud of the service of his grandfather and uncles in World War II — especially the fact that his great uncle was a part of liberating one of the concentration camps at Buchenwald,"" said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton. ""Yesterday he mistakenly referred to Auschwitz instead of Buchenwald in telling of his personal experience of a soldier in his family who served heroically.""
 
Now, in order to rule on Obama's statement, PolitiFact needed to answer two questions: First, what military unit liberated the camp at Ohrdruf? And most important, was Obama's great uncle in that unit at that time? Here's the answer to both:
According to an article from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the 89th Infantry Division on April 4, 1945, overran Ohrdruf, about 40 miles southeast of the Buchenwald concentration camp.
 
""Ohrdruf was the first Nazi concentration camp liberated by U.S. troops in Germany,"" the article states. ""A week later, on April 12, Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower, George S. Patton, and Omar Bradley visited Ohrdruf to see, firsthand, evidence of Nazi atrocities against concentration camp prisoners.""
 
According to a Web site dedicated to the 89th Infantry Division, ""Ohrdruf was a work camp, not an extermination camp, but the difference is difficult to discern. Prisoners were literally worked to death and disposed of by burning in incinerators, which was the most 'cost-effective method.'""
 
According to a 1998 account by Bruce Nickols, a member of the 89th Infantry Division:
 
""As we stepped into the compound one was greeted by an overpowering odor of quick-lime, dirty clothing, feces, and urine. Lying in the center of the square were 60-70 dead prisoners clad in striped clothing and in disarray. They had reportedly been machine gunned the day before because they were too weak to march to another camp.""
 
There's little question, then, that the 89th Infantry Division liberated Ohrdruf, a Nazi work camp that may not have been a facility on the scale of Auschwitz but shared many of that camp's notorious characteristics.
 
That leaves the matter of whether Obama's great uncle really served in that Army unit at that time.
 
The Obama campaign did not provide any documentation to confirm that Charles T. Payne, 83, served in the 89th Infantry Division in April 1945. And we wanted more than their word.
 
Although we were not able to reach Payne directly, Payne's son, Richard Payne, said his father ""definitely served in the 89th Infantry Division"" and confirmed that Obama's account was substantially accurate, except for identifying the wrong concentration camp. Richard Payne declined to say anything further.
 
Mark Kitchell, who maintains a Web site dedicated to the 89th Infantry Division, said he was able to locate a list of servicemen that includes a Pfc. C. T. Payne who served in the K Company of the 355th Infantry Regiment of the 89th Infantry Division. The list included only the initials for first names.
 
The 355th Infantry Regimen was the one that liberated Ohrdruf, Kitchell said. Kitchell, the son of 89th veteran Raymond E. Kitchell, obtained the list from the official Division History book, written shortly after the war.
 
Finally, the National Personnel Records Center, an operation of the federal government's National Archives and Records Administration, put this question to rest.
 
Researchers confirmed to PolitiFact that Army personnel records for Payne would have been destroyed in a 1973 fire that consumed many such archives, but they dug up a ""Morning Report"" dated April 11, 1945, showing Pfc. Charles T. Payne was assigned to the 355th Regiment Infantry, Company K. The Records Center provided a copy of the report. A faxed copy provided to PolitiFact was legible enough for us to make out Payne's information, but the faxed photocopy of the record is too grainy to be of use if posted here.
 
There's no question Obama misspoke when he said his uncle helped to liberate the concentration camp in Auschwitz.
 
But even with this error in locations, Obama's statement was substantially correct in that he had an uncle — albeit a great uncle — who served with troops who helped to liberate the Ohrdruf concentration/work camp and saw, firsthand, the horrors of the Holocaust. We rate the statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Campaign in '68 didn't start until March
","Sen. Hillary Clinton has dismissed arguments that she should drop out of the race for the Democratic Party nomination, saying past races were competitive into the summer.
 
""My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June, right? We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California. I don't understand it,"" Clinton told the editorial board of the

Argus Leader,

a South Dakota newspaper, on May 23, 2008.
 
""Historically, that makes no sense,"" she said of the idea that she should drop out.
 
The remarks caused controversy because some people interpreted them to mean she was suggesting she should stay in the race because Sen. Barack Obama might be assassinated. In the context of the full exchange, however, Clinton is making an argument she's made previously, that it's too early for her drop out because nomination races in years past have extended into June.
 
We previously examined her claim that the 1992 nomination fight didn't end until June, when her husband, Bill Clinton, won in California.

We concluded that Sen. Clinton overlooked some key facts in making that argument, and gave her a Barely True.



 
In this case, she mentions Robert Kennedy's attempt to win the Democratic nomination of 1968. His quest ended tragically when he was assassinated hours after winning the California primary on June 5, 1968.
 
We decided to look into the details of the 1968 campaign to see if Clinton's Kennedy analogy holds up any better than her Clinton analogy. In short, it doesn't. We found that the timetable for the 1968 race diverges from the current race in several important ways that make her comparison not very accurate.
 
For one thing, the 1968 race started much later than the 2008 race, in terms of both when candidates declared to run and the primary calendar.
 
In 1968, incumbent President Lyndon Johnson was widely expected to seek another term. But dissatisfaction with the Vietnam War prompted talk of a challenger. Kennedy's friends urged him to run, but Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race first. McCarthy exceeded expectations dramatically when he took 41.9 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary on March 12, 1968, compared with Johnson's 49.6 percent.
 
With Johnson's vulnerability revealed, Kennedy entered the race. Johnson then surprised everyone by withdrawing on March 31.
 
""I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office — the presidency of your country,"" Johnson said in an address to the nation. ""Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.""
 
The race between Kennedy and McCarthy was tumultuous. Kennedy seemed to be outpacing McCarthy, but lost to him in Oregon on May 28. The California primary, set for June 4, was widely seen as a crucial turning point. Kennedy won the primary, but was assassinated shortly after midnight on June 5 by Sirhan Sirhan. Ultimately, Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, secured the nomination at a chaotic convention in Chicago that August, and then lost to Republican Richard Nixon.
 
So, the chronology of the 1968 race has some important distinctions from 2008. The 1968 race didn't start in earnest until the middle of March. One might even argue that it didn't begin until the very end of March, after the sitting president announced that he wouldn't seek re-election.
 
Compare that to this cycle, when the field of candidates was largely settled nearly a year before the first primary vote in January 2008. Clinton and Obama were declared candidates for their party's nomination in early 2007 with no national figure around to cloud the picture.
 
Also, the 1968 New Hampshire primary, the first significant vote of the year, was March 12. In 2008, New Hampshire had its primary on Jan. 8, and Iowa held its crucial election five days before that. If you calculate days between the New Hampshire primary and June 3 of each year, the distance was 81 days in 1968, but 141 days in 2008.
 
So Clinton is right that the 1968 contest was still going on in June of that year, and it was still competitive. But she ignores important facts that make her comparison between that election year and this one inaccurate. We are not evaluating the question of whether Clinton should drop out of the race, but we find her historical argument that there's nothing unusual about a Democratic primary still being contested in June to be technically accurate but completely misleading. We rate this claim, like the last one, Barely True.

They were hired
","
In an attempt to wrest the moral high ground on special interest influence, Sen. Barack Obama has gone on the offensive, accusing Republican Sen. John McCain of talking tough on campaign finance reform, but then stocking his campaign with lobbyists.
 
At a rally in Tampa on May 21, 2008, Obama said that despite 10 years ago proposing a bill that would have banned lobbyists from being paid by a campaign, McCain ""hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign.""
 
The McCain campaign's ties to current or former lobbyists has been well documented in recent weeks. Disclosures about some of those ties — including clients they have served — led to a handful of departures from the campaign. The highest profile casualty was former Rep. Thomas Loeffler, campaign co-chairman and national finance committee co-chairman. Loeffler is a lobbyist and founder of the Loeffler Group, a multimillion-dollar lobbying operation that, according to

Houston Chronicle

reports last year, has included clients such as AT&T, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Port of Houston, Southwest Airlines and Toyota Motor Co. The firm also has represented the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on trade issues.
 
In response, the McCain campaign on May 15, 2008, instituted a ""conflict policy"" — the campaign will not keep any federal lobbyists on its payroll. Period.
 
""We are in compliance with that policy,"" McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers told PolitiFact.
 
But the campaign is still thick with former lobbyists, some who left or took unpaid leave of absences from their lobbying firms just before joining the campaign.
 
One of them is Charlie Black, a senior adviser on the McCain campaign. Described by the

Washington Post

as a ""longtime uber lobbyist,"" Black retired as chairman of BKSH & Associates in March. He told the

New York Times

he is not paid by the campaign.
 
Then there's campaign manager Rick Davis, who hasn't been a registered lobbyist for five years and took a leave of absence from his lobbying firm Davis Manafort two years ago.
 
Black defended the use of former lobbyists.
 
""I think you can change professions and unless you did something unethical or criminal, your past profession should not be injected into the candidate's campaign,"" Black told the

New York Times.

""It's absurd.""
 
Said Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign: ""John McCain has an unmatched record of fighting the influence of special interests in Washington. The McCain campaign has implemented the strictest policy against lobbyists in presidential campaign history, and we challenge Sen. Obama to meet our standard.""
 
Okay, so McCain has clearly set a policy that forbids current federal lobbyists from drawing a campaign paycheck and campaign officials say they are in full compliance with that. Now. But the policy comes more than a year into the campaign. Current lobbyists hired by the campaign may have now been purged, but the fact is they were hired.
 
We rule Obama's statement True.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Ethics', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama's right, McCain's campaign said it doesn't matter
","
In a speech before 15,000 people in Tampa on May 21, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama said that it was time to get away from ""special interest-dominated politics in Washington."" He criticized Sen. John McCain for hiring some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his presidential campaign.
 
""And when called on it,"" Obama said, ""his top lobbyist actually had the nerve to say, 'The American people won't care about this.' I think the American people do care about it.""
 
Obama didn't say who he was talking about, and his campaign did not respond to clarify.
 
But we think Obama was referring to comments McCain campaign senior adviser Charlie Black made aboard McCain's campaign plane on May 19.
 
Several days prior, the McCain campaign had issued a ""conflict policy,"" which prohibits anyone paid to work for the campaign from being a registered lobbyist. Unpaid volunteers can be lobbyists, but they must list their clients and can't serve on policy committees that deal with issues in which those clients may have an interest.
 
The policy came on the heels of the departure of several high-level campaign officials after embarrassing disclosures about their current or former lobbying activities.
 
Black is himself a former lobbyist (the

Washington Post

described him as ""longtime uber lobbyist""), but he retired from his lobbying firm in March to work full time for the campaign.
 
According to accounts from NBC News and the

New York Times,

as reporters peppered Black with questions about the debate over former lobbyists working for the campaign, Black responded, ""This is complete inside-the-Beltway nonsense.""
 
NBC News' Carrie Dann recounted the interview with Black as follows:
 
""Asked today if questions about potential conflicts of interest might be affecting the choices of average American voters, Black responded bluntly: ""Hell, no."" He was careful to say that Sen. McCain is committed to maintaining the integrity of the campaign — hence his commitment to the re-vetting process. But, Black added, 'I do not believe that average voters out there care.'""
 
Sure sounds like Black was saying he doesn't think the American people care about this issue. We rate Obama's statement True.

McCain proposed bill that didn't pass
","
Special interests and lobbyists are perennial topics for political campaigns, and Sen. Barack Obama has made them a repeated target in his attacks on Sen. John McCain.
 
""Ten years ago, John McCain offered a bill that said he would ban a candidate from paying registered lobbyists,"" Obama said. ""He did this because he said that having lobbyists on your campaign was a conflict of interest. This is what he said 10 years ago. Well, I'll tell you John McCain then would be pretty disappointed with John McCain now, because he hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign. And when he was called on it, his top lobbyist had the nerve to say that the American people won't care about this.""
 
(We checked the statement about McCain hiring ""some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign"" and

ruled it True.

Also,

we ruled it True

that McCain's top lobbyist did have ""the nerve to say that the American people won't care about this."")
 
We delved into legislative history and found that McCain did introduce a bill, in 1996 and again in 1997, to ban lobbyists from being paid by political campaigns. The Lobbying Conflict of Interest Elimination Act said that ""a candidate and the candidate's authorized committees shall not make disbursements for any services rendered by any individual during any period if such individual was required to register for such period as a lobbyist.""
 
McCain made remarks recorded in the Congressional Record about the bill on Jan. 22, 1997: ""Registered lobbyists who work for campaigns as fundraisers clearly represent a conflict of interest. When a campaign employs an individual who also lobbies that member, the perception of undue and unfair influence is raised. This legislation would stop such practices.""
 
The bill never made it out of committee.
 
It was part of a flurry of campaign finance reform legislation proposed in the aftermath of the 1996 campaign for president, during which Bill Clinton raised large amounts of ""soft money,"" the unregulated gifts to political parties from individuals, corporations and unions. At least 57 pieces of legislation were filed in the spring of 1997, according to news reports from the time.
 
One of those pieces of legislation included comprehensive reform banning soft money, sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin. The McCain-Feingold bill didn't succeed that year, but in 2002 it did pass and was signed into law by President Bush as the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. Though considered landmark legislation, it did not address lobbyists working for campaigns.
 
Obama's description of McCain's legislation from a decade ago is accurate. We rule his statement True. For more on the other aspects of Obama's attack,
