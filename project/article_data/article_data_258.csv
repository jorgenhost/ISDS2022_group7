Barack Obama says if there's a government shutdown, Social Security checks won't get sent
","
With President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans on a potential collision course over the federal budget, the possibility of a government shutdown is closer than it’s been in years.

Shutdowns occur when appropriations bills expire and Congress and the president are at an impasse. A shutdown typically prevents federal agencies from carrying out any functions deemed non-essential.

A shutdown last occurred in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. That led to two shutdowns -- one for five days in November 1995 and the other for 21 days from December 1995 to January 1996.

During the past 15 years, lawmakers and the president, despite frequent turbulence, have always managed to come to an agreement on funding bills. But the streak could come to an end this year.

At a Feb. 15, 2011, press conference, a reporter asked Obama whether he was willing to work with Congressional Republicans ""to avoid a government shutdown?""

Here’s part of Obama’s answer:

""We’ve got to be careful. Again, let’s use a scalpel; let’s not use a machete. And if we do that, there should be no reason at all for a government shutdown. And I think people should be careful about being too loose in terms of talking about a government shutdown, because this has -- this is not an abstraction. People don’t get their Social Security checks. They don’t get their veterans payments. Basic functions shut down. And it -- that, also, would have an adverse effect on our economic recovery. It would be destabilizing at a time when, I think, everybody is hopeful that we can start growing this economy quicker.""

A reader asked us to explore whether it was true that Americans won’t get their Social Security checks if the government shuts down.

First, some background about the laws that govern shutdowns, from a recent briefing paper by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.

The Constitution (Article I, Sec. 9) says, ""No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."" This is reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, which stems from an 1870 law and which has been revised significantly over the years. That act prohibits federal officials from spending money before an appropriations measure has been enacted, though exceptions exist for ""emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.""

But when looking at the fate of Social Security during a government shutdown, there’s an important wrinkle to remember.

Social Security is a mandatory program supported by a trust fund. As such, Social Security benefits aren’t appropriated -- and thus aren’t directly subject to the restrictions of the Antideficiency Act. However, the Social Security Administration’s operational employees are paid through appropriated funds. So the real question is whether a shutdown would prevent those employees from going to work, and if so, whether that would mean the payments wouldn't be sent.

A 1981 attorney general's opinion protects the right of at least some Social Security workers to carry out necessary functions -- and that’s essentially what happened during the 1995 shutdowns.

According to Social Security's official history on its website, 4,780 employees remained at work at the start of the four-day shutdown, while the other 61,415 were furloughed. But this cut ""significantly impacted the Agency’s service to the public,"" the account said, and on the second day, additional employees were recalled to work.

The second shutdown -- which lasted three weeks, the longest in history -- could have brought even more severe consequences. But the agency deployed 55,000 employees and operations remained close to normal. (Experts told us it’s possible that the agency could get by with fewer employees today than in 1995 because today, many Social Security benefits are paid electronically.)

So, in 1995, the bottom line was that checks went out pretty much as they were supposed to. Does that mean they will if there’s a shutdown this year?

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed the question during his Feb. 24, 2011, press briefing. Asked by a reporter why checks might not go out in 2011 like they did in 1995, Carney suggested that at least some beneficiaries may not be able to receive adequate customer services during a shutdown due to workers being furloughed.

""The president was pointing out some of the consequences, the potential consequences of failing to act, of failing to prevent a shutdown,"" Carney said. ""And some recipients, new retirees, new applicants might not receive their checks. If retirees have questions about their checks, if they didn't get their check in the mail, if they had a change of address, all those things could prevent them from getting their checks. So there are, obviously, consequences that directly affect people who are recipients of Social Security benefits.""

This statement -- which is noticeably more nuanced than Obama’s original comment -- comes close to the assessments of experts we spoke to. They told us it’s likely that payments will once again be made -- but there’s no guarantee. As CRS put it, while ""past experience may inform future OMB and agency decisions,"" past precedents on activities and personnel ""would not necessarily hold for any future shutdown.""

Experts told us that there is enough of a gray area that it’s impossible to say with certainty that checks will go out during the next shutdown.

The president and Congress ""could decide whether to send out Social Security checks in the event of a shutdown,"" said Alice Rivlin, who headed OMB under Clinton. ""Congress could mandate that enough workers be declared 'essential' to get the checks out or the president could decide to take that action—or not.""

John Palguta, a former federal official who is now vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, agreed, saying that it’s ""probable"" that Social Security payments will continue, but added that ""it’s not an iron-clad guarantee.""

So at the very least, we believe there’s considerably more uncertainty on this issue than Obama stated in the news conference. While Obama had said that if there’s a government shutdown, ""people don’t get their Social Security checks,"" the reality is that the law provides significant leeway for employing federal workers to carry out Social Security functions during a shutdown, which allowed most checks to go out in 1995.

On the other hand, making that approach work depends on the president utilizing his authority, and on Congress not blocking him from carrying it out. It’s also possible, as Carney suggests, that depending on the number of Social Security employees assigned to work, certain customer services may become unavailable during a shutdown, such as checks not going out to new beneficiaries or those with address changes.

Ultimately, the law and history suggest that it’s likely that checks will go out, though it’s not a certainty. On balance, we rate Obama’s statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-if-theres-government-shutdown-so/

Gov. Rick Scott and Senate budget chief in spat over sale of state airplanes
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott is at loggerheads with powerful Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander over whether Scott was allowed to sell the two state airplanes. 
The decision fulfilled a campaign promise, but Alexander believes the sale was ""not proper"" because it needed approval of the Legislature. Citing statutes and the Florida Constitution, the Lake Wales Republican made his case in a trio of letters to Scott starting on Feb. 17, 2011. The governor, Alexander wrote, failed to respect ""the Legislature's constitutional duty to appropriate funds and your duty to spend appropriated funds in accordance with the law."" 
Scott countered in a pair of statements to the press that he did nothing wrong. 
PolitiFact Florida wanted to step in here and try to referee the disagreement between these two top Republicans. 
The background: On Feb. 11, Scott announced the sale of the state's two airplanes -- a 2000 King Air 350 and a 2003 Cessna Citation Bravo jet. The King Air fetched $1.77 million, while the jet sold for $1.9 million; $3.67 million all together. Most of the proceeds actually went to pay off the $3.4 million the state still owed on the Cessna. The money went from the buyers directly to the bank the state owed the money. 
What remained was deposited into the Aircraft Trust Fund -- $84,072.13 was deposited on Feb. 14, and $176,500 was deposited on Feb. 17, according to Alexis Lambert, spokeswoman for Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater. Scott said the money budgeted for the aircraft program would also be returned to the general revenue fund, saving about $556,000 this current budget year, and $2.4 million in future years. 
Alexander's problem 
Alexander, for the record, doesn't oppose the sale. Just how it happened.

On the merits of this particular case, his debate with Scott is somewhat academic. The planes already have been sold and are gone, and Alexander is willing to retroactively approve the arrangement. But the disagreement could have broader implications that result in shifting previously sacrosanct budget powers away from the Legislature and to the executive branch.

The roles of the branches of government generally have been well defined. The Legislature passes the budget every year, and the governor carries out the budget as passed (after having the opportunity to veto parts of the budget, or the entire budget).

Alexander's contention is that Scott's sale of the two airplanes violates that balance. He believes that: 
What would stop Scott from not spending money on Medicaid, then? Or from selling other state property to finance deeper tax cuts?

""The Constitution doesn't allow executive agencies to embargo appropriated funds,"" Alexander said. ""When money is appropriated, there is an obligation to spend it.""

He recently made a similar claim when discussing Scott's decision to reject federal funding for high-speed rail. Alexander said that the state already had budgeted money for the project and that Scott couldn't just pull out without legislative approval. PolitiFact Florida found Alexander's claim in that case to be accurate, but noted that Scott held most of the cards to kill the rail line anyway. We found the claim, overall, to be Half True.

When it comes to the state planes, Scott is prohibited by statute from impounding state money, which is defined by statute as ""the omission of any appropriation or part of an appropriation in the approved operating plan."" Put another way, Scott cannot simply stop or ignore budget appropriations that are law except when necessary to avoid a deficit.

The governor also is prohibited from taking money from the state treasury unless appropriated by law. Buying out the lease may constitute a violation because the payment wasn't authorized by the Legislature. 
However, the money went straight from the companies that bought the planes to the bank the state owed $3.4 million to, to pay off the Cessna.

In that case, there also are specific regulations regarding the selling of state property, and the money received from those sales.

According to statutes, money received from the sale of state property must be retained by the custodian and may be disbursed for the acquisition of exchange and surplus property and for all necessary operating expenditures. The custodian shall maintain records of the accounts into which the money is deposited. In this case, the custodian of the plane is the Department of Management Services, which is under the governor's direction. 
The other side 
We asked the governor's office to cite statutes supporting Scott's decision to sell the plane without legislative input, and we asked to speak to the general counsel or any person who advised Scott that the sale complied with Florida law. We did not hear back. 
Interim general counsel Rick Figlio did respond to Alexander on Feb. 24. 
Figlio said he advised Scott that it was legal to sell the state planes ""subject to the condition that the purchaser clear outstanding debt."" He then asked Alexander to provide specific statutes restricting the disposal of state property in the way Scott sold the state planes. 
""If any such restrictions exist, I would appreciate your counsel directing me to them as they will assist this office in advising the Governor regarding the scope of his powers as they relate to future transaction,"" Figlio wrote to Scott. 
An outside opinion 
We asked Bruce R. Jacob, dean emeritus and professor of law at Stetson University, to sort through the back-and-forth. In short, he sides with Alexander. 
Jacob said it appears that Scott failed to comply with state statutes prohibiting him from withholding appropriated funds. The key, in this case, is that Scott never adequately went through a process to determine that there was a budget deficit, which could have given him cover for selling the planes. Scott would have needed to consult with the state's Revenue Estimating Conference -- a legislative body -- and certified that a deficit will occur in the general revenue fund.

""What Alexander is complaining about is that, under this section, where the Legislature has appropriated money for the expense of the planes, the governor is required to spend that money,"" Jacob said. ""I am sure the governor from time to time does not spend money that the Legislature has appropriated for a particular purpose, and I doubt that anyone gets upset about it.

""However, the main point, it seems to me, is that if the governor was thinking of doing this, he needed to consult with the leadership of the Legislature,"" he said. ""Common courtesy called for such consultation. The governor and the Legislature have to work together. The governor should not be allowed to 'go it on his own,' so to speak, in a situation such as this.""

Jacob also says Alexander has a ""point"" by claiming that the amount owed on the Cessna should have been appropriated by the Legislature and paid from the state treasury. ""Money of the state should not be spent unless it is for an authorized purpose and complete records should be kept so that anyone in the state can see what was spent and for what purpose. In this case it seems to me that the governor short-circuited the process,"" Jacob said. 
Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Merritt Island, said Scott's intention wasn't to be deceptive.

""This is his first month on the job. If he made a mistake, he'll fix it,"" Haridopolos said. ""His intent was the correct intent. I don't think he meant any malice by it ... no one thinks the governor tried to pull a fast one."" 
Our ruling 
The majority of the evidence and a legal expert side with Alexander in this argument about the sale of the state's two airplanes. Alexander said the sales were ""not proper,"" and cited specific state statutes. Most germane is a statute that requires the governor to spend the money allocated for a specific purpose in the state budget. 
The governor's office offered no rebuttal, and as such, we see no evidence that Alexander's wrong. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/24/jd-alexander/gov-rick-scott-and-senate-budget-chief-spat-over-s/

Fitzgerald: Wisconsin legislators would have to give up the same amount of pay as other state employees
","
Facing a budget shortfall, many legislators in Wisconsin have talked about the need for shared sacrifice to justify Gov. Scott Walker's plan to require state employees to pay more for health and pension benefits.

But what about the elected officials themselves? Are they making a sacrifice?

In an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity on Feb. 22, 2011, Republican Jeff Fitzgerald, speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, said Wisconsin legislators would be subject to the same cuts the governor is proposing for other government workers.

""You know, we are all in this together,"" Fitzgerald said. ""Every legislator that votes for this bill as well is going to do the same for themselves. We have to give up the same amount of pay.""

Amid the fiery debate over benefits cuts and collective bargaining rights -- and the potential ripple effect around the nation -- we haven't heard much about how Walker's plan would personally affect the legislators who will vote on it, so we decided to check Fitzgerald's comment.

Walker's plan would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs -- typically 5.8 percent of pay for state workers -- and at least 12 percent of their health care costs.

A detailed analysis of Walker's proposal by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau says that under Walker's plan any participant in the Wisconsin Retirement System, including elected officials, ""would be required to make an employee contribution to the WRS in an amount equal to one-half of all actuarially-required contributions, as approved by the Employee Trust Fund (ETF) Board.""

Under current 2011 rates, one half of the general participant rate would be 5.8 percent and one half of the executive/elected official rate would be 6.65 percent. So elected officials would actually be paying a little more than government workers, said Robert Lang, director of the Wisconsin's Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Currently, Lang noted, most general government employees pay a slight share -- less than 1 percent of their salary -- toward their pension, and elected officials don't pay anything.

As for health benefits, the bill doesn't specifically mention the effect on elected officials. It simply talks about changes related to anyone participating in the state's ""group insurance board coverage."" That includes elected officials, Lang said. So elected officials also would have to pay the same share for health care as all state employees covered by the health plan. (For details, see pages 29 and 30 of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis).

There's one other piece of the bill that would affect the benefits of elected officials, and it has to do with the way pension benefits are calculated. Pension payments are based on a formula derived from the employee's salary, years of service and a set multiplier. For general employees, that multiplier is 1.6. For elected officials, the multiplier is currently 2.0. Under the budget repair bill, however, the multiplier for elected officials would drop to 1.6, the same as everyone else (see page 3 of the budget repair bill, or page 33 of the Fiscal Bureau analysis for further details). Bottom line, they'll be getting less in their pension checks. The new, lower multiplier won't take effect until the next legislative session. 
We also ran Fitzgerald's statement by Jeff Leverich, senior researcher for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, and he agreed with Lang.

""That is our understanding too, co-pay applies to elected officials; however, some ambiguity remains about when they might be enacted given statutory language governing timing of compensation changes for  elected"" officials, Leverich stated via e-mail. 
According to Lang, elected officials would have to start paying more toward pension and health benefits immediately, just like everyone else.

Leverich, of WEAC, also argued that while co-pays may be the same for elected officials, there would still be a disparity in bargaining positions. 
""Please realize, however, that the elimination of bargaining rights is a different order of magnitude,"" Leverich said. ""The effects of the legislation on the two parties (legislators/public workers) is truly dissimilar."" 
In short, Fitzgerald said the legislators who will vote on Walker's bill would have to give up the same amount of pay. Aside from the collective bargaining issues, Walker's plan would make state employees pay more for health and pension benefits. And according to the bill, elected officials would take the same hits.

Ohio Democratic Party claims a top assistant for Gov. John Kasich makes triple what firefighters are paid
","
Columbus politics is dominated at the moment by a fiery debate over a proposal to overhaul collective bargaining laws for public workers. Known as Senate Bill 5, the legislation is drawing raucous crowds to the normally serene Statehouse atrium.

Republican Gov. John Kasich, backed by a Republican-controlled legislature, wants to end collective bargaining for state workers and abate the ability of city workers, including firefighters and police officers, to bargain for pay and benefits. Republican leaders say such reforms are needed to lower costs and ease the financial burden on the state and city budgets.

Democratic leaders, flanked by a few Republcian office holders and lots of labor leaders, argue that teachers and firefighters and other union workers are not overpaid and that collective bargaining keeps both workers and employers in check at a minimal cost.

The Ohio Democratic Party on Feb. 14 boiled down its argument in a Twitter message. Both the brevity and first word of the tweet caught Politifact Ohio’s attention: ""FACT: the ‘special assistant’ in @johnkasich's office makes over three times more than an average #OH firefighter""

Given the debate that rages on behind the tweet, we thought it was worth checking out.

The tweet refers to Jai Chabria, a senior advisor, or special assistant, to Kasich, says ODP communications director Seth Bringman.

Chabria, who worked with Kasich at the defunct Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers, is part of governor’s inner-circle, whose members are paid six-figure salaries, a point that received a good bit of attention earlier this year. Chabria’s annual salary is $145,000 and is not subject to any collective bargaining deal. He serves at the pleasure of the governor.

ODP’s Bringman says the tweet also refers to the average annual salary of an Ohio firefighter of $41,160. He cities the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the tweet’s source.

The bureau indeed shows that the mean, or average, salary of an Ohio firefighter is $41,160. The figure does not include benefits and is based on the data compiled in May 2009, the latest available.

It’s important to note that the figure, however, is based on six surveys of 200,000 employers collected over a three-year period, not on an actual accounting of every Ohio firefighter’s salary.

Looking for something more current, Politifact Ohio compared the bureau’s survey data to actual salary data collected by the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund, which manages the retirement plans for safety officers. Spokesman David Graham says the fund doesn’t track the average salary of an Ohio firefighter but actual raw data is compiled in actuary reports.

According to one such report in 2010 by Buck Consultants, there are 13,001 full-time fire personnel in Ohio whose collective annual salary totaled $860,966,828. Dividing the total salary by the number of personnel produces an average annual salary of $66,000.

The actuary reports also reveal that firefighters with one-year of experience are paid an average salary of $45,000. Fire personnel with 40 years of experience can earn $80,000. The data can also be sliced numerous other ways to produce a range of salary figures.

But the pension fund figures also include other ranking officers, like captains or chiefs, who earn more and would raise the average. The data also doesn’t separate firefighters who are cross-trained as paramedics or in hazardous materials and typically earn more than others firefighters.

""It includes the fire chief from Cleveland to the firefighter from Piqua,"" Graham said. He couldn’t say exactly what ranks and specialties are in the latest figures but said captains and others all qualify under Ohio Revised Code as firefighters and therefore are members of the pension fund.

So where does this leave the Ohio Democratic Party’s tweet on the Truth-O-Meter?

Chabria’s salary of $145,000 is more than three times the salary figure of $41,160 that the party cited.  And its based on widely accepted data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is widely regarded as a reliable source for statistics. But it’s important to know that some of that data, collected in surveys, is several years old.

Chabria’s salary is also more than three times the average salary of a firefighter with one year of experience, according to the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund’s actuary reports. (But only 3.7 percent of current firefighters had 1 year of experience, the report shows.)

While we would like to have more current data, the overall pension fund numbers are skewed because they also include pay figures from higher ranking, higher paid officers.

All of this  also underscores the point often made by the Politifact: Statistics often need illumination. We rate the tweet as Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/feb/24/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-claims-top-kasich-makes-trip/

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says out-of-staters account for “almost all” in Madison protests
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker got right to the point when he was chatting Feb. 22, 2011, with a prank caller  pretending to be a major Republican power-broker: The protests in Madison are dying down.

And changing to mostly out-of-state residents.

In the secretly-recorded call, Walker assured a New York blogger posing as industrialist David Koch -- a contributor to Walker’s campaign and many GOP causes -- that things were under control at the Capitol.

""Well, we’re actually hanging pretty tough,"" Walker said in the call, which was taped and made public Feb. 23, 2011. ""I mean, you know, amazingly there’s a much smaller group of protesters almost all of whom are in from other states today.""

We know Wisconsin is awful popular these days. And the battle over the budget-repair bill is national news. But are ""almost all"" of the protesters in from other states?

We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie about the not-intended-for-the-world-to-hear statement from his boss.

He sent us two links to news stories from over the weekend -- one from the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, and another from the Decatur, Ill., newspaper.

Here’s what the Feb. 21, 2011, blog post in the Weekly Standard said: ""Labor groups and Democratic Party organizations from outside the state have been sending people to Madison for the demonstrations.""

It went on to note an e-mail from the Chicago Teachers Union, which said it was sending a bus Feb. 21, 2011, to Madison. The union’s twitter feed posted a message the evening of Feb. 19, 2011, saying: ""CTU Supports Wisconsin Workers. Get on the bus Monday.""

Meanwhile, the Decatur paper reported Feb. 22, 2011 -- the day Walker made his comment during the non-Koch call --  that Illinois union leaders were sending protesters to Wisconsin.

""A number of Illinoisans have headed to Madison in recent days to join the battle over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's effort to end collective bargaining for public employee unions,"" the paper reported.
                        
""The Illinois Education Association, the state's largest teacher union, reports it has sent 14 staff members to Wisconsin to help organize members in their fight,"" the story said.  It went on to say another  union -- Council  31 of the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal   Employees -- ""has a number of staff members on the ground"" and was sending a two bus loads on  Feb. 22, 2011 and one on Feb. 23, 2011.
                
OK, fair enough. That’s a few bus loads accounted for -- albeit not all on the day of Walker’s phone conversation. And, of course, there surely were other out-of-state protesters that day.

But ""almost all""?

The crowds in Madison did drop on the day of the call. After several days of school district closings around the state due to teachers calling in sick to attend protests, the vast majority of teachers were back in the classroom. Milwaukee and Madison school districts reopened.

We did a little more investigating to learn: Who are these protesters?

Of course there’s no one checking ID cards, and no way to come up with a definitive percentage, but there are ways to gauge the makeup of such crowds.

The Journal Sentinel has had reporters and photographers on the scene day and night since the protest began. We looked at dozens of pictures from protests Monday night and Tuesday, taken by Journal Sentinel photographers (You can see some of these pictures here.)

We saw many signs and clothing that suggest Wisconsin protesters -- Badgers and Packers attire, a sign mentioning Janesville, signs mentioning the Madison teachers union and so forth. One man wore a T-shirt from the Shoe Box, a Madison-area store.

However, that man, Thomas Brown, is from New Mexico. He came back to visit family near Madison. We won’t count him as an out-of-state agitator.

We did see signs such as ""Michigan Supports WI workers,"" and one that read ""Coast to Coast Solidarity"" that mentioned California and New York. On Feb. 23, 2011, when Teamsters President Jim Hoffa spoke, signs for Chicago Sheet Metal Workers were evident and there were Teamsters from other states present, according to news reports and Madison police.

We sent a Patrick Tricker, a reporter for the UW-Madison The Daily Cardinal, through the crowd the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2011. It was day two of the state Assembly’s marathon vote on Walker’s measure, which involved hundreds of Democratic amendments.

In an informal survey, Tricker spoke directly to 26 protesters in the Capitol rotunda. About a fourth of the 26 were from out of state, half from Madison and the remainder were from other parts of Wisconsin. He found one from California and one from Alaska.

That’s nowhere near ""almost all.""

Finally, we asked law enforcement for their take.

""The vast majority of people protesting are from here -- Wisconsin and even more from Dane County,"" said Joel DeSpain, public information officer for the Madison Police Department.

How would DeSpain know?

""I grew up here,"" said DeSpain, who attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison and worked 25 years as a television journalist in that city before taking the job with the cops. ""I know Madison, this is my town,""

DeSpain said he has seen friends, family members, people he has known for more than 30 years attending protests. The crowds on Feb. 22, 2011  -- the day of the Walker phone call -- included hundreds of state corrections officers and Madison police officers, he said.

Said DeSpain: ""Unless somebody’s giving them all sorts of t-shirts from Wisconsin"" these are local protesters.

Let’s bring this item home.

In his not-so-private phone call, Walker claimed protests were getting smaller and almost all of the protesters at the state Capitol were there from out of state. Certainly there are folks there from far and wide. But there’s no evidence the out-of-towners have taken over. All evidence points to this being -- and remaining -- a home grown effort.

We rate Walker’s statement False.

Labor union supporters say Wisconsin test scores vastly outpace those in five states without collective bargaining for teachers
","
In tweets and Facebook postings, supporters of labor unions in Wisconsin have promoted statistics that would suggest that collective bargaining for teachers -- which would be severely restricted under a proposal by Gov. Scott Walker -- is correlated with higher scores on standardized academic tests.

On Feb. 23, we found the following version on Facebook by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin:

""Only 5 states do not have collective bargaining for educators and have deemed it illegal. Those states and their ranking on ACT/SAT scores are as follows: South Carolina -50th/ North Carolina -49th/ Georgia -48th/ Texas -47th/ Virginia -44th. If you are wondering, Wisconsin is currently ranked #2.""

When a reader brought this to our attention, we thought it deserved a look.

First, we checked to see whether it’s true that only five states bar teachers from collective bargaining. We found a webpage maintained by the National Council on Teacher Quality, an independent research group that urges ""reforms of the nation's teacher policies.""

The group agrees. It reports that all but five states -- Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia -- ""either require or permit school districts to bargain a contract with the local teachers' union."" While the organization notes that states' ""scope of bargaining statutes has a considerable impact on the balance of power,"" we think the Facebook post is accurate because it referred explicitly to states that deemed teacher collective bargaining ""illegal.""

With that question out of the way, we’ll take a look at the thornier question of how those five states' test scores stack up nationally, and against Wisconsin in particular.

On Feb. 20, 2011, Angus Johnston, an adjunct assistant professor at the City University of New York, published a comprehensive analysis of this question on his blog. He published links to a chart that appears to have been the inspiration for the tweets and Facebook postings. It offers a state-by-state analysis of scores on the SAT and the ACT, the two leading college-admissions tests, assembled by University of Missouri law professor Douglas O. Linder.

Johnston is critical of Linder’s methodology for a variety of reasons, which he explains in more detail here. But without even taking those concerns into account, we find the statistics unreliable. They were published in 1999, meaning that the statistics themselves are likely more than a dozen years old -- far too old to be presumed valid in 2011.

Fortunately, it’s possible to obtain state-by-state rankings for the SAT and ACT of a more recent vintage. Here’s a table of the relevant states:

Mean SAT scores by state, 2010:
  
Mean ACT scores by state, 2009
  
Before we analyze these figures, let us explain why we included the fourth column above -- ""participation rate."" That refers to the percentage of high school graduates in that state who took the test in question.

The SAT and the ACT serve the same general purpose -- gauging academic achievement for college admissions, but the tests are essentially competitors in the marketplace. By force of tradition or other factors, states vary widely in the percentage of students who take one test rather than the other (or both). So, knowing the participation rate is crucial to knowing whether the ranking being measured is statistically valid.

Consider Wisconsin’s third-place ranking in the SAT. It sounds great -- but only 4 percent of graduates in the state took the test in 2010, and those that did likely did so because they had a particular need to take the SAT as they applied to certain colleges. And that means that Wisconsin SAT takers were a self-selecting group, probably more academically advanced than average.

As a result, it’s fairer to look at Wisconsin’s ranking on the ACT, which was taken by 67 percent of graduates in 2009. And that ranking was 13th in the nation -- not bad, but well short of the 2nd place finish cited in the Facebook post.

Meanwhile, in the five non-collective-bargaining states, the SAT was the more widely taken test, and in those rankings, the non-union states placed between 34th and 49th nationally. Meanwhile, for the ACT -- where participation ranged from 15 percent to 50 percent -- the rankings in the non-union states ranged from 22nd to 46th.

So, on neither test did the five non-collective bargaining states perform as well as Wisconsin did, and in general those five states clustered in the bottom half of the national rankings. Given these statistics, it’s reasonable to say that Wisconsin outperformed the other five states significantly -- but not as overwhelmingly as the blog and Facebook posts suggest.

After we contacted the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, Melissa Baldauff, the party’s research director, wrote us to say that ""after further investigation, we determined that the data was not the most up-to-date. Accordingly, we have removed the post from our Facebook page.""

We should add another key question: What does SAT and ACT data actually tell us about the connection between collective bargaining rights and student achievement? The answer is a little -- but not very much.

Looking only at these six states, there’s a suggestion that lack of collective bargaining rights for teachers is mildly correlated with test scores, even though the linkage is a lot less striking than the Facebook post suggests. Still, it’s impossible to know whether collective bargaining has any role in causing test scores to rise. That’s because countless other demographic, economic and cultural factors play a role in shaping a state’s test scores.

""Most of the states that don’t have teachers’ unions are poorer than Wisconsin and have more English Language Learners in their schools, and rank higher for other demographic factors that make strong academic performance less likely,"" Johnston wrote. ""Rich kids in a school with a teacher’s union will do better than poor kids in a school without one, generally, but that doesn’t have much to do with the union itself.""

Consider just one statistic -- the percentage of residents living below the poverty line. Wisconsin ranked 38th in the nation, similar to Virginia (39th), and well below Texas (8th), South Carolina (9th), Georgia (13th) and North Carolina (15th). The fact that many fewer Wisconsin residents, proportionally, were impoverished almost certainly had an impact in shaping the states’ comparative test results.

Matthew Di Carlo, a senior fellow at the Albert Shanker Institute, which studies education policy, added in a recent blog post that there’s ""tremendous variation within and between states in the strength of individual locals (there are thousands) and in the terms of the contracts they have negotiated, to say nothing of all the other factors that might influence achievement,"" such as school-level policies, student characteristics and resource availability.

In general, Di Carlo notes that, according to the available evidence, there may be some overall benefit from unions on student test scores, but due to all the complex factors involved, there is little basis for drawing strong causal conclusions. He also pointed out that unions confer other benefits, such as improved communication between teachers and administrators.

However, that’s all beyond the scope of our item. Ultimately, the Facebook post uses outdated data based on a questionable methodology. A review using current data finds that Wisconsin does perform better on test scores than the non-union states, but not as dramatically as suggested in the Facebook post. And there is at best limited evidence that unionization played a causal role in shaping differences in test scores. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/23/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/labor-union-supporters-say-wisconsin-test-scores-v/

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says Democratic senators “rammed through” repair bill without hearings in 2009
","
The Badger State’s old tourism slogan, ""Escape to Wisconsin,"" is a come-hither aimed largely at the Land of Lincoln.

But when the political temperature got too hot in Madison on Feb. 17, 2011, 14 Democratic senators escaped to Illinois and helped put Wisconsin somewhere near the center of the political universe.

The absence of the 14 made it impossible for the Senate to get a quorum for a vote on Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill. The senators said they fled because the bill -- which would strip away most collective bargaining rights from most public employees -- was being rushed to a vote.

Two days later, Walker called on them to return, suggesting in a statement that they were being hypocritical.

""These are many of the same senators who, two years ago, rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input,"" Walker declared.

Walker repeated the call for the Senate Democrats to return in his televised ""fireside chat"" on Feb. 22, 2011, about the budget stalemate. And numerous readers have asked us to sort out this piece of the debate.

So we will.

We asked Walker’s spokesman, Cullen Werwie, to explain the governor’s charge. He said the reference was to a budget-repair bill introduced by Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, in 2009.

The content of Doyle’s and Walker’s repair bills -- which were needed midyear to balance the state budget -- are different, but the scenarios are similar.

The Doyle bill was approved by a Democratic-controlled Legislature under a Democratic governor. Conversely, Republican Walker introduced his bill to an Assembly and Senate that are controlled by the GOP.

(Ironically, the Wisconsin 14 fled two years to the day after the Doyle bill was introduced.)

Walker’s statement has three major points:

Who was involved

Walker is correct in saying ""many of the same senators"" who retreated to Illinois voted for Doyle’s 2009 budget-repair bill. Indeed, 12 of the 14 did; the only two who didn’t, Tim Cullen of Janesville and Chris Larson of Milwaukee, weren’t elected until November 2010.

What the bill involved

Was the Doyle bill ""a billion-dollar tax hike""?

We found in a previous PolitiFact Wisconsin item that assessed the bill and how it was adopted that taxes, per se, would only be raised by an estimated $290 million.

However, if a new fee on hospital revenue was included -- and news reports often referred to the fee as a tax -- the take would be an estimated $1.2 billion over three years. Doyle and Democrats argued the change was welcomed by hospitals and allowed the hospitals  to bring in a greater amount in federal money. But it was real money filling a real hole.

So, Walker’s claim of a billion-dollar tax hike is essentially accurate.

How it was adopted

Was Doyle’s bill ""rammed through"" in ""24 hours with no public input""?

Again, Walker is essentially correct. No public hearing was held on Doyle’s bill, which was approved by the Legislature the day after it was introduced.

As Walker suggested, the Senate vote was strictly along party lines, with all Democrats voting for the bill and all Republicans voting against it.

(In the Assembly, all but two Democrats voted yes and all Republicans voted no.)

This is one budget-repair bill debate we can bring swiftly to a close.

Accused by Senate Democrats of rushing a vote on his repair bill, Walker fired back with his own charge. He said that two years earlier, many of those senators had rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike contained in a Democratic repair bill -- in 24 hours and without public input. The record is clear.

Fox Business Network's Eric Bolling says Wisconsin teachers get compensated nearly double those in private sector
","In an interview on Feb. 21. 2011, Fox Business Network anchor Eric Bolling sparred with U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-NY, over the contentious teachers union battle in Wisconsin that has captured the attention of the entire nation.

Rangel argued that ""the benefits we enjoy as working people and our standard of living is due, in no small part, to the trade union movement,"" and ""the whole idea that they got to tell these people that they have decided that they're against collective bargaining, you talk about democracy? You never heard anything like this...""

Bolling responded by citing statistics about pay and benefits enjoyed by Wisconsin teachers compared to the rest of the working public.

""We got blackboard, here it is, Wisconsin teachers make a salary of $51,000...Benefits $38,000 per year, that comes to a whopping 89,000 bucks, while the rest of us, all workers in the United States, union, non-union, etc., $38,000 is your average salary...there, $10,000 in benefits, a quarter of what you make, that you would make if you were a Wisconsin teacher, to 48 grand, almost half the amount. Yet collective bargaining says that is OK. That's not anti-free market?""

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s budget proposal asks state workers to pay more for their pensions and health insurance, which reduces take-home pay. Union leaders have largely conceded to the salary and pension cuts, but Walker's plan also sets significant limits on collective bargaining power for most public sector unions, which has enraged union members and sparked protests at the state capital. Still, much of the political chatter about the Wisconsin showdown has continued to focus on salary and benefit issues, so we decided to check Bolling's numbers.

Bolling was pretty close on the average salary figure for Wisconsin teachers. The latest figures from the National Education Association actually put the average salary for a Wisconsin teacher at $51,264.

The $51,000 salary figure is further substantiated by district-by-district data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.

However, according to a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the Fox figure for Wisconsin teacher benefits -- $39,000 -- is way too high. Average benefits amount to about $25,000 a year, said Marlena Deutsch, a spokeswoman for WEAC. In total compensation, Wisconsin ranks 23rd in the nation.

We couldn't find a definitive, independent state average for benefits in Wisconsin, but the data  from the state Department of Public Instruction lists ""fringe benefits"" by district in Wisconsin. None were as high as $39,000. The median was about $25,800.

OK, now to the Average Joe or Jane who works in the private sector.

According to a national compensation survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total cost of compensation to private industry employees last year came to about $58,000 ($41,000 for salary; $17,000 for benefits).

So Bolling's total compensation number for Wisconsin teachers is high, and for private sector employees, it's is low.

On his show the following night (Feb. 22) Bolling said in the numbers he had posted the night before, ""our math was off a bit."" A new graphic, he said, showed the unweighted average for Wisconsin teachers for the 2010 school year: a $51,000 salary, plus $30,000 worth of benefits (for a total of $81,000 worth of compensation). For an average private sector worker, he said, the salary in 2010 was $46,000 with $20,000 worth of benefits (total compensation $66,000).

Those revised numbers are much closer to the ones we found.

But many statisticians have a more fundamental issue with Bolling's comparison. In order to be a teacher in Wisconsin, you've got to have a 4-year college degree. And 52 percent of Wisconsin teachers also have a master's degree. That's much, much higher than the average education level for workers in the private sector. People with higher degrees in education typically get paid more.

We found two studies that factored in such things as education level, years of experience, race, gender, etc. and found that public employees tend to make a little less than people with similar backgrounds in the private sector.

A report titled ""Out of Balance"" by two University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professors for the National Institute of Retirement Security, whose board is largely composed of representatives of public employee pensions, found that when ""comparable earning determinants,"" such as education, are considered, state employees typically earn salaries 11 percent lower than their private sector counterparts. When you consider total compensation -- salary plus benefits -- the deficit dropped to 6.8 percent (because public employees generally get better benefits packages than those in the private sector).

One of the study authors, Keith A. Bender, an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, said that message has largely been lost in the Wisconsin debate.

As for Bollings' comparison, Bender said, ""I guess you can do that if you don't want to compare like with like. But you are comparing less educated people with more educated people.""

Another report, by the liberal Economic Policy Institute, found that Wisconsin public employees earn 4.8 percent less in total compensation than comparable private-sector workers.

The study's author, Jeff Keefe, issued a policy memo on Feb. 15, 2011, titled ""Wisconsin public versus private employee costs: Why compare apples to oranges?""
 
""Inaccurate comparisons of national and Wisconsin public employee compensation with private sector compensation are circulating in Wisconsin,"" Keefe wrote. ""These faulty comparisons, showing that public employees in Wisconsin are dramatically overpaid, seem to support legislative efforts to increase benefit contributions by public employees.""

""But when we compare apples to apples, we find that Wisconsin public employees earn 4.8% less in total compensation than comparable private sector workers,"" Keefe wrote. ""The comparisons—controlling for education, experience, hours of work, organizational size, gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship, and disability—demonstrate that full-time state and local public employees earn lower wages and receive less in total compensation (including all benefits) than comparable private sector employees.

""Why does it appear otherwise?  Both nationally and within Wisconsin, public sector workers are significantly more educated than their private sector counterparts."" The Center for Union Facts, a self-described ""union watchdog,""  said Keefe's study made two assumptions ""both of which bias the results in its preferred direction."" The first assumption was that state employees would otherwise be working in a large private sector business  with 1,000 employees or more, the group said. And, it argues, Keefe excluded full-time, part-year workers like certain teachers. According to an analysis released by the Center for Union Facts on Feb. 22, 2011, public sector employees, on average, earn five percent more in wages and benefits than their counterparts in the private sector. We don't want to get too far into the weeds on the many ways data can be sliced to make comparisons between public and private sector compensation. We don't take too much issue with the raw numbers provided by Bolling (the clarified ones). They're pretty close to the numbers we found as well. But the comparison of compensation for Wisconsin teachers to the compensation for all private sector employees is misleading. On average, Wisconsin teachers are far more highly educated than the average worker. People with higher levels of education tend to make more. And so we rate Bollings' comparison Barely True.

Rep. Bill Posey criticizes Obama for underfunding NASA projects
","
President Barack Obama dubbed this period ""our generation’s Sputnik moment"" in his 2011 State of the Union address when he called for job-creating investments in high-tech areas. But when it comes to the space race, one Florida congressman is blasting the president as ""ceding American leadership in space to China and Russia.""

In a press release responding to Obama's $3.8 trillion budget proposal unveiled on Feb. 14, 2011, Republican Rep. Bill Posey, whose district covers a portion of Florida's Space Coast, decried cuts to certain portions of NASA's budget, even though the agency's budget has remained pretty much unchanged from 2010.

Obama's budget allots $18.7 billion to NASA for the 2012 fiscal year, the same amount received this fiscal year. However, Obama's plan shifts the money around, increasing funding for projects like climate change research and reducing the budget for other space projects. (A description of the administration’s NASA budget summary can be read here.)

""After the administration let NASA flounder for the past two years, a flawed NASA authorization bill was finally agreed to and signed into law,"" Posey wrote in a press release. ""Now the administration is proposing to ignore this law, placing a higher priority on global warming research and making cuts to the next-generation launch vehicle.""

Posey's press release went on: ""Over two years ago, the president promised to close the space gap, but now he seems intent on repeating the events that created the space gap in the first place -- putting in place a new rocket design and then trying to underfund the effort, ensuring that it will never happen and ceding American leadership in space to China and Russia.""

With the final flight of shuttle Discovery scheduled for Feb. 24 and only two more shuttle flights left after that, we decided to check the facts of the last portion of Posey’s statement. Did Obama promise two years ago ""to close the space gap?"" Has a new rocket design been put into place, and is it properly funded?

Obama on space

During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama made a stop in Titusville, just west of the Kennedy Space Center, where he spoke to an animated crowd about his goals for NASA.

""Let me be clear we cannot cede our leadership in space,"" Obama said. ""That's why I'm going to close the gap and ensure that our space program doesn't suffer when the shuttle goes out of service. We may extend an additional shuttle launch. We’re going to work with Sen. Bill Nelson to fund at least one more flight beyond 2010 ... by continuing to support NASA funding by speeding the development of the shuttle's successor, by making sure that all those who work in the industry in Florida do not lose their jobs because we cannot afford to lose their expertise."" (A video of the speech can be found here.)

The president returned to the area on April 15, 2010, giving a speech at the Kennedy Space Center where he expanded on his plans for NASA.

""The bottom line is, nobody is more committed to manned spaceflight, to human exploration of space than I am,"" Obama told the crowd, according to a New York Times report. 
He added: ""Step by step, we will push the boundaries, not only of where we can go, but what we can do. In short, 50 years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time.""

So, Posey is right about Obama's campaign pledge to ""close the space gap,"" and the president himself has talked of his desire for American astronauts to aim for travel to Mars by the mid 2030s.

Constellation project

Posey press secretary George Cacela said the congressman's statements about funding for a new rocket-design were based on the troubled Constellation project. The law that Posey is citing is the 2010 NASA Authorization Act, which mandated that the space agency build a heavy-lift rocket called Ares by 2016 with an $11.5 billion budget.

Constellation started in 2005 under former President George W. Bush's administration. With the space shuttle being phased out after 30 years, Constellation's goal was to return to the moon by 2020 and set up a base camp there in future years.  A series of Ares rockets and the Orion crew capsule were part of the original Constellation plan. However, the project, as described in this Jan. 14, 2004, speech by Bush, never received the full $100 billion funding it was originally promised, resulting in delayed work and mounting costs.

A 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office, before Obama was elected, also criticized the way funding was being handled for the Constellation project and other goals outlined in Bush’s 2004 space policy.

""The need for NASA to implement the vision in a fiscally prudent and effective manner cannot be overemphasized given the competing fiscal demands facing the federal government and an already troubling funding profile projected for human spaceflight activities,"" the report notes. ""We have issued a number of reports that touch on various aspects of retiring the space shuttle and transitioning its assets and people to exploration activities. These reports have questioned the affordability of the exploration program, NASA’s acquisition strategy for the development of new space vehicles, agency-wide contract management and workforce planning for current and future agency needs.""

What was Obama's role?

In May 2009, Obama convened a panel headed by Norman Augustine, a former Lockheed Martin executive, to review the feasibility of current and future NASA projects like Constellation. In an October 2009 report, the committee deemed that Constellation would need an additional $45 billion to get back on track.

In addition, an August 2009 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, ""Constellation Program Cost and Schedule Will Remain Uncertain Until a Sound Business Case Is Established,"" also found flaws in previous funding for the Orion and Ares projects.

""While the agency has already obligated more than $10 billion in contracts, at this point NASA does not know how much Ares I and Orion will ultimately cost, and will not know until technical and design challenges have been addressed,"" the report states.

The Obama administration pulled the plug on the back-to-the-moon project by eliminating funding for it from the president’s 2011 fiscal year budget proposal. Instead, Obama recommended that NASA reconfigure the Constellation's Orion crew capsule to serve as a reserve spacecraft for the International Space Station.

""This Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep-space missions,"" Obama said in his April 2010 speech at the Kennedy Space Center.

In 2010, when Congress passed the NASA Authorization Act, $2.6 billion was appropriated for the Ares heavy lift-rocket, and $1.4 billion for the Orion crew capsule. Under Obama's current budget proposal the projects would receive less money -- $1.8 billion for the rocket and $1 billion for the Orion project.

Even before Obama released his latest budget proposal, NASA administrators stated in a January 2011 report that the timeline and budget in the 2010 NASA Authorization Act were not sufficient to complete the Orion crew capsule and the Ares heavy-lift rocket projects by their 2016 targets.

The 22-page report stated:

• ""It is important to note that the (Orion) project will be operating in a cost-constrained environment. The three-year authorized funding level represents a significant reduction.""

• ""While NASA will work as expeditiously as possible to meet the 2016 goal, NASA does not believe this goal is achievable based on a combination of the current funding profile estimate...""

Our ruling

So back to our questions: Did Obama promise two years ago ""to close the space gap?"" Has a new rocket design been put into place, and is it properly funded?

Posey is correct that Obama said he intended to close the space gap, and he supported man living and working in space. But, the Obama administration has decreased funding for the space-flight vessels in favor of increasing funding for climate research projects.

However, NASA's funding issues did not suddenly emerge under the Obama administration. A 2007 report from the GAO projected an ""already troubling funding profile projected for human spaceflight activities."" Even NASA has said it can't complete the projects with the current budget constraints. So while Obama has reduced spending, the projects in question have long been struggling to get adequate support to move forward. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/23/bill-posey/rep-bill-posey-criticizes-obama-underfunding-nasa-/

Garnet Coleman says unemployment is still 10 and 20 percent in some places of Texas
","
While the Texas unemployment rate trails the national one, that doesn’t mean every part of the state is faring well, says Democratic state Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston.

In a Dallas Morning News article posted online Feb. 15, Coleman praises the state’s unemployment rate, which as of December ran about a percentage point less than the national average. But, he adds, ""in some (Texas) communities, our unemployment rate is still at 10 and 20 percent. It depends on where you’re sitting and standing in Texas as to what your quality of life is."" The quotation was removed when we later reviewed the article, though the original remained intact in a Coleman blog post.

Get outta here--jobless rates of 10 and 20 percent in Gawd-Blessed Texas?

After leaving a message for Coleman, we fetched the latest jobless statistics from the Texas Workforce Commission’s website. For December, the Texas rate was 8 percent, the national rate 9.1 percent. That’s seasonally unadjusted, meaning it doesn’t take into account perennial changes such as those associated with teaching school or working during holiday shopping seasons.

A commission chart shows that the December rates for approximately 25 metropolitan statistical areas ranged from 4.9 percent in the Midland area to 12.1 percent in McAllen-Edinburg-Mission. Three other areas had jobless rates of 10 percent or more: El Paso (10 percent), Beaumont-Port Arthur (11 percent) and Brownsville-Harlingen (11 percent). 
At our request, TWC spokeswoman Lisa Givens isolated Texas cities with December unemployment rates of 10 percent or more. The city with the highest rate was Port Arthur, 16.8 percent, followed by Eagle Pass, 14.3 percent; San Juan, 13 percent; Baytown, 12.6 percent; Brownsville, 12.3 percent; Weslaco, 12.3 percent; Texas City, 11.3 percent; Socorro, 11.2 percent; Pharr, 10.9 percent; Lancaster, 10.6 percent; Pasadena, 10.5 percent; San Benito, 10.4 percent and Paris, 10.2 percent. Beaumont and La Porte had rates that we rounded up to 10 percent.

Drawing from commission data, we sorted city-by-city unemployment data and identified several additional cities that for at least one month in 2010 experienced an unemployment rate of 10 percent or more: Beaumont, Corsicana, Mission, La Porte and Duncanville.

By e-mail, Givens told us that since 2007, no Texas county has had an average annual unemployment rate greater than 18 percent, though monthly rates occasionally exceeded that. She sent a spreadsheet for 2007 through 2010 showing unemployment peaking at 20.4 percent in Starr County in January 2010. Presidio County experienced 18 percent unemployment for most of 2010, while Zavala County reached 18.7 percent unemployment in August.. Over all, 29 of the state’s 254 counties had average 2010 unemployment rates of 10 percent or more, according to the commission.

Coleman’s office, responding to our inquiry, pointed to online descriptions of seven towns, with July 2007 populations ranging from 305 to 1,053, which had unemployment rates exceeding 20 percent for adults 25 or older, according to entries posted at city-date.com, which describes itself as a multi-faceted collector of information on cities. The entries do not say where the unemployment information originated or the time period the rates cover, though Cheryl Abbot, an economist with the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us it appears the figures originated in the 2000 U.S. census. The towns, in Hidalgo or Starr counties near the Texas-Mexico border, are Granjeno (20.9 percent); Faysville (23.3 percent); Los Ebanos (27.6 percent); Los Villareales (28.5 percent); Alto Bonito (29.2 percent); Havana (29.3 percent); and Salineno (31.3 percent).

Joseph Madden, Coleman’s chief of staff, also noted information posted on the Texas Secretary of State’s website attributed to a publication by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. We found the ""thumbnail"" report on the reserve’s website; it says the unemployment rate in colonias -- defined by the Texas Secretary of State as border communities near Mexico that ""may lack basic living necessities, such as potable water and sewer systems, electricity, paved roads, and safe and sanitary housing"" -- can be more than eight times the state rate. Similarly, Madden said, a web post by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas says most studies agree that colonia unemployment sometimes reaches five or six times the state average. Jim Henson, who directs the project, told us the material was written by Henry Dietz, a UT Distinguished Teaching Professor of Government, in 2009.

Next, Coleman’s office shared information from the TWC indicating that in December, 29 of the state’s 254 counties had unemployment rates of 10 percent or more, topped by the 18.7 percent rate in Starr County. We confirmed that count in our own online search, also identifying six other counties with rates that rounded up to 10 percent.

Our takeaway: 14 percent of Texas counties had unemployment rates of nearly 10 to nearly 19 percent in December and more than a dozen cities had rates from nearly 10 to nearly 17 percent.

In an interview, Coleman said that when he made his statement he meant to say Texas still has places with unemployment rates of 10 to 20 percent--not 10 and 20 percent. ""If I had meant counties, I would have said counties. If I had meant cities, I would have said particular cities,"" Coleman said. ""Some communities, some pockets, are experiencing high unemployment."" 
All told, parts of Texas experienced jobless rates of 10 percent or more in December, including one county where unemployment approached 19 percent. We didn’t confirm any with 20 percent unemployment. 
Coleman’s statement is solid at the low end, teetery at the top. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/23/garnet-coleman/garnet-coleman-says-unemployment-still-10-and-20-p/

Georgia Chamber says E-Verify has accuracy problems
","
Backers of bills before the General Assembly argue that stopping illegal immigrants from working in Georgia can be as simple as pushing a few buttons.

Just type a new employee’s name into the website of the federal program E-Verify, which confirms whether he or she can work legally in the U.S. Some employers already use it, but Georgia should make it mandatory, backers argue.

Not so fast, critics say.

""There are some inaccuracies that exist within pilot programs such as E-Verify,"" cautioned David Raynor, a lobbyist for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, on Feb. 8 in a legislative committee meeting on one of the bills.

How bad is the error rate? State Rep. Rich Golick, R-Smyrna, a co-sponsor of the bill, asked Raynor.   

""I don’t have it, Mr. Chairman, in front of me today. I know we’ve seen quotes from different reports that have shown anywhere from 50 percent all the way up to in excess of 80,"" Raynor replied.

That same day, Gov. Nathan Deal noted ""there are questions being raised"" about E-Verify’s accuracy.

Sounds bad, we thought. So, are there inaccuracies in E-Verify?

House Bill 87 and Senate Bill 40 would require many businesses to use E-Verify, which handled more than 16 million queries during fiscal year 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. SB 40 exempts farmers and other employers who participate in federal programs that allow noncitizens to work here legally.

An employer enters a new hire’s information, which E-Verify tries to match with records from the Social Security Administration and the DHS. If there’s a match and the worker is authorized, the employee stays.

If there’s no match, the system issues a ""tentative nonconfirmation,"" which the employee can contest. If that challenge is unsuccessful, E-Verify issues a ""final nonconfirmation,"" and the employee can be fired.  

E-Verify, which was originally named the ""Basic Pilot Program,"" is mandatory for federal contractors and employers in Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina and Utah. In Georgia, public agencies and employers with public contracts must use it.  

Now, on to our analysis. A chamber spokeswoman referred us to Kim Thompson, an Atlanta labor attorney who advises the chamber on E-Verify.

""I wouldn’t say the problems are necessarily significant, but there are problems,"" Thompson said. She said she has handled cases in which E-Verify failed to confirm legal workers, but the program’s accuracy has recently improved.  

Thompson referred PolitiFact Georgia to the federal Government Accountability Office, which issued a report on the program in December, plus an audit of the program by independent contractor Westat, a research company.

Indeed, the GAO and experts for and against making E-Verify mandatory agree that the program has improved. It’s overwhelmingly accurate for authorized workers, but it fails to catch a large percentage of illegal ones.  

The most current data says that overall, it was inaccurate between 2.3 and 5.7 percent of the time, according to Westat.  

For legal workers, its error rate was between 0.6 percent and 1 percent, Westat found. But of the workers it thought may be unauthorized, 22 percent were actually legal.

E-Verify mistook legal, foreign-born workers for illegal ones 20 percent more often than it did for their U.S.-born counterparts, according to Westat. The system especially struggled with workers with Hispanic and Arab surnames, which means ""increased potential exists for an adverse impact on individuals’ civil rights and civil liberties,"" the GAO warned.

Los Angeles County, which used the program, had a harder time with E-Verify. There, it was wrong 2 percent of the time, and 95 percent of the people it thought may be illegal workers turned out to be legal, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank that thinks mandating E-Verify may do more harm than good.

E-Verify’s biggest shortcoming was catching illegal workers. It cleared them to work an estimated 37 to 64 percent of the time. Illegal workers and shady employers often use fraudulent documents that E-Verify can’t detect, the GAO said.

Whether E-Verify is accurate enough to be mandated is up for debate.

""I would say that if it’s not ready now, it’s on the cusp of being ready,"" said Janice Kephart, an expert with the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels.  

Marc Rosenblum, an immigration expert with the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact Georgia that E-Verify does little for employers since it fails to catch so many unauthorized workers. He concluded in a report this month that ""E-Verify remains vulnerable to identity fraud and employer misuse, and offers no ability to detect off-the-books employment.""

To sum up:

E-Verify is overwhelmingly accurate with legal workers but fails to identify a large percentage of illegal ones.

Indeed, as Raynor said, ""there are some inaccuracies that exist"" in E-Verify. But his suggestion the error rate ranges between 50 and 80 percent was too high.

E-Verify’s worst error rate -- for illegal workers --  is high, but it’s still well below what Raynor suggested. For all workers, it shrinks to 2.3 to 5.7 percent.

While Raynor’s main point was correct, he was wrong on important details about E-Verify’s overall accuracy. We therefore rule his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/23/david-raynor/Georgia-Chamber-E-Verify-accuracy-problems/
"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says he campaigned on his budget repair plan, including curtailing collective bargaining
","
In the turbulent wake of his controversial plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has faced criticism that he gave no warning of such a dramatic plan during the long 2010 governor’s race.

Walker has forcefully challenged that contention, most bluntly at a Feb. 21, 2011 news conference. A reporter asked if the move to limit union power was payback for pro-union moves made by Democrats in the past.

""It’s not a tit for tat,"" Walker responded. ""The simple matter is I campaigned on this all throughout the election. Anybody who says they are shocked on this has been asleep for the past two years.""

The statement echoed one at Feb. 17 news conference, in which Walker was even more emphatic that he campaigned on all the changes included in the entire budget-repair measure -- not just forcing employees to pay more for health and pension costs.

Asked if he was ""ramming through"" the budget-repair bill, Walker said:

""We introduced a measure last week, a measure I ran on during the campaign, a measure I talked about in November during the transition, a measure I talked about in December when we fought off the employee contracts, an idea I talked about in the inauguration, an idea I talked about in the state of the state. If anyone doesn't know what's coming, they've been asleep for the past two years.""

Now, we thought we were following the campaign pretty closely.

It seemed to us like the first public hint Walker gave that he was considering eliminating many union bargaining rights was at a Dec. 7, 2010 Milwaukee Press Club forum, some four weeks after the election.

So Walker’s claim he campaigned on all of this caught our attention -- and that of many readers, who have been e-mailing us asking us to check it out.

There is no dispute that Walker campaigned on getting concessions on health and pension benefits from state employees. And, to be sure, that is an important part of the measure.

But for Walker to be right, he has to be correct on the entirety of the plan. So we’ll look more deeply at the collective bargaining side of the equation, which has caused the ongoing firestorm in Madison.

Here is a summary of the changes:

For public employee unions except those covering public safety workers, the measure would narrow collective bargaining to wage issues, and only then within specific limits. It would end bargaining on such things as health care costs, pensions and working conditions -- rights granted to the public unions more than 50 years ago.  

Additionally: Wage increases would be limited to inflation or less. Employees would be able to opt out of paying union dues. An annual certification vote on the existence of each union would be required. And public employers would be barred from withholding union dues from worker’s paychecks.

Walker’s proposal also repeals all rights to collective bargaining for more than 30,000 University of Wisconsin employees, something granted in 2009.

For this item, we reviewed dozens of news accounts and various proposals on Walker’s campaign website to determine what he said about collective bargaining during the campaign. We talked to both campaigns in the governor’s race, and union officials.

During the campaign, Walker prided himself on presenting many specific proposals to voters. Our Walk-O-Meter includes 60-plus specific promises. Indeed, his plans for the state Department of Natural Resources include at least seven specific elements, including appointment of a ""whitetail deer trustee"" to review deer counts.

But nowhere in our search did we find any such detailed discussion of collective bargaining changes as sweeping as Walker proposed.

We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to provide evidence that Walker raised those issues during the campaign.

""During the campaign he ran on giving local units of government the flexibility to manage their own budgets,"" Werwie said. ""That is what he is continuing to say and do right now.""

He gave one example: a Walker proposal in July, 2010 to allow local units of government to switch from health plans that have high premiums to the state’s lower cost employee health plan.

Walker’s camp said at the time that the switch would not have to be negotiated with unions; Walker would move to take the choice out of the collective bargaining process, they said. Labor officials disagreed and said they would fight attempts to change the collective bargaining law.

Werwie also pointed to a campaign flier circulated by the American Federation of Teachers-Wisconsin, a union representing 17,000 public employees in the state.

In addition to criticizing Walker comments on benefit cuts, the AFT flier notes a Walker comment about freeing up local governments from being ""strangled"" by mediation. And it points out his comment on the health plan switch he proposed in July -- the one that would take the choice of health plans off the table for unions.

Both of those are part of collective bargaining and were discussed.

But they are a far cry from what was proposed.

For instance, during the campaign Walker talked about who controls the choice of health care providers. After the election he proposed eliminating any negotiations on the subject of health care.

Walker’s campaign proposal on mediation and arbitration offers a similar contrast:

He told the Appleton Post-Crescent in a lengthy question and answer session in 2009 that ""you've got to free up local government officials to not be strangled by things like mediation and arbitration."" As his website made clear, he was talking about a specific, significant change in teacher’s union arbitration -- not the dramatic changes on the table now.

His current plan would largely eliminate the dispute-settling function of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission for all but public safety employees, according to Peter Davis, WERC’s general counsel.

When it comes to the arbitration process, Davis characterized the changes Walker proposed in the campaign as a ""hand grenade"" and his proposal now as an ""atom bomb.""

Another example:

As the campaign rolled near a close, in late October 2010, Walker told the Oshkosh Northwestern that he would ""ask all state workers"" for wage and benefit concessions in the collective bargaining process.

After the election, he proposed imposing concessions without negotiating and eliminating benefits as a topic of collective bargaining.

Walker told the Oshkosh newspaper that if unions don’t give in on concessions, he would turn to furloughs to get cost savings.

The use of furloughs was the approach taken by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a fairly typical cost-savings tactic. After the election, Walker said he wanted to avoid furloughs in favor of the concessions on health and pension costs, and wanted to limit bargaining to wages.

Before the election Walker talked about seeking concessions in the context of face-to-face negotiations -- as in the Oshkosh Northwestern interview. He is moving to impose health and pension cost-sharing through legislation, without having taken his proposal to the unions.

He once talked about expanding a statewide cost control system -- using collective bargaining -- beyond teachers to all state employees. But now he proposes an approach that would let individual municipalities set their own benefit levels -- with little input from unions.

A reminder: We are not evaluating the merits of the proposal. Just what was discussed in the campaign.

In October, as Walker held a steady lead in opinion polls over his Democratic opponent,   Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, rumors circulated in union circles about Walker favoring a major power grab from unions.

That’s according to Richard Abelson, who heads District Council 48 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, which had negotiated with Walker for eight years in his position as Milwaukee County executive.

Abelson, whose union endorsed Barrett, said: ""We heard rumors he would remove pension and health as mandatory subjects of bargaining.""

But at that time, nothing so direct was publicly stated.

Jeff Stone, a Republican state representative from Greendale, was the source of the notion, Abelson said. The two had a meeting as Stone laid the groundwork for a run for Walker’s soon-to-be-vacant county job.

Stone confirmed for us that he told Abelson before the election he thought Walker might propose the bolder course. He said Walker told him nothing; he guessed it from Walker’s emphasis on cost cutting and the deficits plaguing the state budget.

""This was the only way I could see he could do it,"" Stone said about balancing the state budget.

But the sweep of Walker’s eventual proposal caught even Stone off guard.

""Yeah, I was a little surprised (he put it all in),"" Stone said. ""But I also understand if you don’t control those things you will have trouble controlling costs.""

Abelson, the union leader, said Walker’s February announcement of his plan ""went far beyond what anybody thought he would do. He didn’t talk about it during the campaign. If he had said that, some people who supported him would have had some second thoughts.""

Barrett’s campaign aide Gillian Morris also said they heard nothing in the campaign to suggest Walker would back sharp limits on union power -- and the repeal of all union rights for tens of thousands -- in his proposal.

Bryan Kennedy, president of AFT-Wisconsin, the union that distributed the flier warning about Walker’s labor record, said he figured Walker would try to weaken collective bargaining and privatize a lot of state jobs.

""But we were actually quite surprised by this,"" he said.

Immediately after the election, in mid-November, Walker successfully lobbied lawmakers not to approve labor contracts negotiated under the Jim Doyle administration.

Walker did not say he wanted to renegotiate them, nor did he say at that time that he had plans to lay aside those deals and impose changes without bargaining.

Let’s sum up our research.

Walker contends he clearly ""campaigned on"" his union bargaining plan.

But Walker, who offered many specific proposals during the campaign, did not go public with even the bare-bones of his multi-faceted plans to sharply curb collective bargaining rights. He could not point to any statements where he did. We could find none either.

While Walker often talked about employees paying more for pensions and health care, in his budget-repair bill he connected it to collective bargaining changes that were far different from his campaign rhetoric in terms of how far his plan goes and the way it would be accomplished.

We rate his statement False. 
(Editor’s note: After this item was posted, a conversation surfaced between Walker and a person impersonating Walker campaign contributor and industrialist David Koch. In an audiotape released Feb. 23, 2011, Walker compares his union plan to a history-making act and portrayed his union plan as a ""bomb.""

Walker aides acknowledge the tape is real, but say Walker simply was saying privately what he has said publicly about his budget-repair bill.

Of a meeting with his cabinet, Walker in the tape says: We talked about what we were going to do, how we were going to do it. We had already built plans up. This was kind of the last hurrah before we dropped the bomb."")",/factchecks/2011/feb/23/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-he-campaigned-his-/

Donna Brazile said that the Wisconsin governor proposes tax breaks for business
","The budget crisis in Wisconsin has spurred a national discussion on spending priorities, including among the commentators on  ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

Amanpour asked her guests if the plans in Wisconsin were ""shared sacrifice.""

""Where is the sacrifice going to be borne the most? And is it equitable?"" Amanpour asked.

Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist, said it wasn’t.

""Just like the tea party went out there and grabbed the microphone, what you have is grassroots people out there saying, ‘No more,’ no more budget cuts on the back of working people,"" Brazile said. ""The governor has proposed tax giveaways to corporations.""

""We're trying to balance the budgets on the backs of the poor and the middle class, and that's why workers are standing up for their rights,"" she said a little later in the program.

The word ""giveaway"" is a loaded term for tax cuts, but we feel it’s fair to fact-check whether Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has proposed tax breaks for corporations while advocating budget cuts for public workers.

Walker’s budget proposal asks state workers to pay more for their pensions and health insurance, which reduces take-home pay. But it also sets significant limits on collective bargaining power for most public sector unions, which has enraged union members and sparked protests at the state capitol.

We next looked to see if Walker has proposed tax cuts for corporations.

We found Walker has already signed bills that cut taxes for corporations.

Walker signed a law on Jan. 31 that says that companies that relocate to Wisconsin will not have to pay corporate taxes for two years. The law stipulates that the company must move at least 51 percent of the workers on its payroll or at least those who account for $200,000 in wages. Walker also signed into law a bill that gives small tax breaks to companies that create jobs. It’s debatable whether these could fairly be considered ""giveaways,"" since they are intended to reward companies for creating jobs.

But Walker proposed additional tax breaks for business during the campaign for governor. PolitiFact Wisconsin documented those promises on PolitiFact’s Walk-O-Meter, a database of Walker’s campaign promises. That includes reducing taxes on employers and repealing the ""combined reporting"" requirement for business taxes, a measure that increased tax revenues and was approved in 2009.

""If you elect me as your next governor, I’ll get government out of the way and lower the tax burden so Wisconsin business owners and factories can create 250,000 jobs and 10,000 businesses in our state by 2015,"" said Walker during the campaign.

We also found that Walker told the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce during the campaign that he supported efforts to repeal the corporate income tax. Though it’s a fine distinction, we should note that we were not able to find statements from Walker proposing a repeal, so it’s not a promise listed in the Walk-O-Meter database.

Brazile said, ""The (Wisconsin) governor has proposed tax giveaways to corporations."" The tax breaks he signed into law were linked to job growth, which means they were not necessarily ""giveaways."" But he has proposed lower taxes for all businesses. And he’s supported those tax cuts even in the face of a tight budget, saying they would lead to job growth. Because Brazile gets Walker’s basic position on business taxes right -- he wants them lower -- we rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/22/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-said-wisconsin-governor-proposes-tax/
"['National', 'Guns', 'Doug Jones']","
Yes, waiting periods on gun purchases have been linked to suicide reduction
","In his first speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., waded into the nation’s fraught debate over gun violence. Jones, who defeated Roy Moore in Alabama’s December 2017 special Senate election, voiced support for steps to reduce the rate of gun-related deaths in America, including a federal measure to impose mandatory waiting periods on the purchase of firearms. ""States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides,"" Jones said in a March 21 speech that sought to balance Second Amendment rights with gun control measures. Suicides accounted for just over 60 percent of the United States’ roughly 36,000 gun-related deaths in 2015, according to the most recent available government data. We decided to take a closer look at the research into waiting periods and suicide reduction. A waiting period is a mandatory delay that requires gun purchasers to wait — typically between two and seven days — before obtaining their weapons. Nine states and the District of Columbia have laws that require a waiting period for purchases of at least some types of guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. There is currently no federal waiting period for gun sales. Congress previously established a nationwide waiting period and background check for handgun sales through the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The federal wait period was in effect for just under 5 years before the provision expired. Jones’ office pointed us to a 2000 study that looked at the effect of the Brady Law on gun violence and suicide. That study found waiting periods were associated with reductions in the firearm suicide rate for people age 55 and older. However, waiting periods were not linked to lower suicide rates overall, which suggests some opted for alternative means of suicide. We reached out to Philip Cook, one of the authors of the Brady Law study, who pointed us to more recent research focused on waiting times and gun violence.  One gun control expert told us the 2017 study, ""Handgun waiting periods reduce gun deaths,"" represented the best research on the relationship between waiting periods and suicides. (Note: Cook is listed as the study's editor.) Researchers studied every change to waiting period laws in the United States from 1970 and 2014, and compared the laws with changes in the government’s annual data on gun-related deaths. (Forty-three states plus the District of Columbia had a waiting period for at least some time between 1970 and 2014; researchers also looked at the federal Brady Law.) The study noted that delaying the purchase of a gun could create a ""cooling off"" period to allow a ""visceral state"" — including suicidal impulses — to subside before the gun buyer took possession of a firearm. Michael Luca, a professor at Harvard Business School and one of the study’s authors, pointed us to the key passage for purposes of checking Jones’ claim: ""Waiting periods lead to a 7–11 percent reduction in gun suicides (depending on the control variables used in the specification), which is equivalent to 22–35 fewer gun suicides per year for the average state."" ""Jones is on solid ground here,"" Luca said. Daniel W. Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, described the study by Luca and his colleagues as ""the best research I can point to on the effects of waiting periods for gun purchases."" However, David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute and author of several books on gun control, said the study ""has somewhat less certitude than Sen. Jones suggests."" He noted the findings’ statistical significance depended on which model was used.  In an October 2017 CNN article, Deepak Malhotra, a professor of negotiation and conflict resolution at Harvard Business School and Luca’s co-author, was somewhat measured when describing the study’s conclusions on suicide reduction. ""There seems to be a lot of evidence to suggest that suicides also are reduced, but further research might be necessary on that issue,"" Malhotra said. (We reached out to Malhotra but did not hear back.) Jones said, ""States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides."" A 2017 study on the relationship between waiting periods and suicides — which was cited by some foremost gun control experts — found waiting periods led to a 7–11 percent reduction in gun suicides. That’s the equivalent of 22–35 fewer gun suicides per year for the average state. That said, one expert said the statistical significance of the study’s findings depended on which model was used, and one of the study’s coathors was somewhat measured in describing the study’s conclusions with respect to the effect of waiting periods on suicide reduction.

Have other housing authorities in NY been given money like NYCHA?
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo called public housing in New York City ""disgusting"" when he visited a unit earlier this month. He blamed the New York City Housing Authority for neglecting maintenance on the aging system, which houses one of every 14 city residents. The state has done its part by footing part of the bill, Cuomo said. ""The only housing authority in the state that we have actually given money to is NYCHA,"" Cuomo said. There are about 160 housing authorities in the state. New York City’s authority provides housing to more than 147,000 families, more than any other authority. Most authorities receive almost all of their funding from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Is Cuomo right that the state doesn’t give any money to housing authorities outside New York City? In the budget A state Division of Budget spokesperson, on behalf of the Cuomo administration, defended the governor's statement, saying the New York City Housing Authority is the only housing authority in the state to have a direct funding line in the state budget.  State lawmakers approved $100 million for the authority in 2015 to replace roofs across the public housing system over a three-year period. Also, $200 million was approved in last year’s state budget for more roof maintenance and other repairs, like new boilers. Cuomo has recently proposed an additional $250 million for NYCHA in this year’s budget. Other housing authorities have access to state funds, but they have to either apply for funding from a statewide program or compete for grants. ""The governor is correct that the only housing authority that got direct grants to their housing authority was NYCHA,"" said William Simmons, president of the New York State Public Housing Authority Directors Association, which represents the majority of housing authorities in the state. ""Any dollars that go toward housing authorities in upstate New York, these are dollars that they compete for or apply for. It’s not a direct allocation,"" Simmons continued. Other funds Authorities can compete for funds from the Public Housing Preservation Program. The program awards funds to improve the long-term sustainability of existing public housing units. Authorities compete for the money through a bidding process with New York State Homes and Community Renewal, the state housing agency. Six authorities have received a total of $125 million from this program in the past two state budgets.  Authorities can also apply for funding from the Public Housing Modernization Program. The money is used by housing developments where rental income and other funding isn’t enough to pay for regular maintenance. About $6.4 million goes to 13 state-supervised public housing authorities in New York state each year through this program, according to the Division of Budget. State tax credits are also available for authorities that develop public housing for low-income residents. Our ruling ""The only housing authority in the state that we have actually given money to is NYCHA,"" Cuomo said. The New York City Housing Authority is the only public housing agency that has a line item in the budget. But other housing authorities have received money from the state through competitive grant programs. So the New York City Housing Authority is not the only housing authority to receive money from the state.

Cynthia Nixon claims Cuomo has helped corporations and the rich
","Actress Cynthia Nixon quickly went on the attack against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo when she announced she would run against him in a primary for governor. Nixon, a Democrat, portrayed the incumbent as a career politician who has spent his time in office pandering to corporations and the wealthy and passing legislation for their benefit, Nixon said. ""Since taking office, Andrew Cuomo has given massive tax breaks to corporations and the super rich,"" Nixon said. Nixon’s campaign staff said she was talking about cuts to the state’s corporate tax rate and changes to the state’s tax code that favored wealthy filers. Cuomo and state lawmakers have reduced income tax rates for middle-class earners. PolitiFact New York checked Cuomo's claim that middle-class New York State residents will have the ""lowest tax rate in 70 years"" and found his statement to be Mostly True.  Cuomo has also said ""taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started."" PolitiFact New York ruled that it’s true income taxes for individuals, corporations, and manufacturers are lower than when he took office in 2011. But it ruled that statement Half True because property taxes are higher. But has he given ""massive tax breaks"" to corporations and high-income earners? Corporate taxes The state tax rate on corporations when Cuomo took office was 7.1 percent. State lawmakers struck a deal with Cuomo during the 2014 state budget that cut the rate to 6.5 percent, the lowest in almost half a century. The corporate tax rate for manufacturers was eliminated altogether. The deal also affected the estate tax -- a tax on one’s property and assets after death before inheritance. The tax applied to anyone with an estate worth more than $1 million before the deal. The state now only taxes estates worth more than about $5.2 million. The 'super rich’ Cutting corporate tax rates can help wealthy earners. As we have reported before, lower corporate taxes benefit wealthy shareholders of those companies. But aside from the higher estate tax threshold, Cuomo has not provided any ""massive tax breaks"" to super-rich earners. Even the estate tax benefit is questionable, said E.J. McMahon, research director at the Empire Center, a state fiscal watchdog group. ""The estate tax reform did not save a penny for the super-rich,"" McMahon said. ""The rate and scope of the tax on the largest estates is unchanged from before 2014."" In 2011, Cuomo wanted to let the state’s so-called ""millionaires tax"" expire. Filers who reported more than $500,000 in state income would have seen their state tax rate fall from 8.97 percent to 6.85 percent if the tax expired. Democrats in the Assembly wanted to keep the ""millionaires tax."" In the end, Cuomo agreed to keep the tax but lowered the rate from 8.97 percent to 8.82 percent for the state’s highest earners. ""By no stretch of the imagination is this a massive tax break for the super-rich,"" McMahon said. ""In fact, in the dictionary definition of the term, there hasn’t been a ‘massive’ tax cut for anyone."" One group did see a tax cut. The millionaires tax now only applies to single filers who earn more than about $1 million and married couples whose combined income exceeds about $2 million. The previous law imposed the millionaires tax on couples when their income was more than $500,000. Other tax cuts Nixon’s campaign also pointed to tax breaks for banks and real estate developers. Lawmakers repealed part of the tax law that determined how much state tax banks had to pay in 2014. Banks were instead added to the corporate tax code, which changed how much of their income was subject to state tax. That meant lower taxes for banks headquartered in New York state. Cuomo also approved legislation that gave tax breaks to five major real estate developers in New York City. A provision to waive property taxes for five projects over a decade was tucked into an omnibus housing bill in 2012. One developer was expected to save $35 million on a luxury apartment tower in Manhattan, for example. Cuomo was criticized for accepting campaign donations from the developers shortly before the bill was signed. Our ruling ""Since taking office, Andrew Cuomo has given massive tax breaks to corporations and the super rich,"" Nixon said in a speech announcing her candidacy. Cuomo has approved a tax cut for corporations since taking office, and the new rates will be the lowest in decades. Some wealthy earners also have lower state income tax rates today than when Cuomo took office. But the tax breaks hven't been huge and, with one exception, hven't been for the ""super rich.""  A higher tax rate for the wealthiest earners has continued under Cuomo and no other major tax breaks for those filers are apparent.

Sean Hannity says 642,000 crimes recently committed against Texans by illegal immigrants
","Four years ago, then-Gov. Rick Perry misrepresented state-posted numbers and inaccurately claimed that thousands of Texas murders had lately been committed by unauthorized immigrants. More recently, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity drew our attention when he dipped into the same pool of figures on his March 7, 2018 program, saying to a guest: ""I went down to the border--I’ll give you facts--because I was on horseback, all-terrain vehicle, I was in helicopters, I was in boats and I sat through a security briefing in Texas with Rick Perry -- 642,000 crimes committed by illegal immigrants against Texans alone. ""Here’s my question: Putting all those issues aside,"" Hannity said, ""those that commit crimes in America, including some violent crimes, even murder, those criminal aliens, do you support having them removed from this country?"" ""Absolutely, I have no problem with that,"" news broadcaster Jorge Ramos replied. ""I’m not here to defend real criminals."" Hannity then showed a video clip from a July 2014 Texas presentation on 642,000 ""criminal offenses"" committed by ""criminal immigrants"" that Hannity saw alongside Perry during a visit to McAllen on the Texas-Mexico border. Hannity said next to Ramos: ""Are you literally saying to me that they’re lying? Because they’re not."" Hannity subsequently asked: ""You sound like you don’t care about the Americans who are victims of crime. … You’re not answering my question; 642,000 crimes committed against Texans alone in a seven-year period; that’s not your family, Jorge. Where’s your sympathy for those victims of crime and why shouldn’t we take those that are committing crimes and get rid of them tomorrow?"" Hannity closed the segment by asking Ramos to come to Texas for a program devoted to the 642,000 crime victims. We decided to fact-check Hannity’s claim that criminal immigrants committed 642,000 crimes against Texans in recent years. Hannity relies on 2014 presentation In the portion of the Texas presentation shown by Hannity, two state officials and Hannity face a slide headlined ""Criminal Alien Offenses, October 2008 to July 2014,"" as an unidentified presenter says that more than 200,000 criminal immigrants are responsible for about 642,000 criminal offenses. Perry then tells Hannity: ""That’s the cost of not securing the border.""  SOURCE: Excerpt from YouTube video showing Sean Hannity interview of Jorge Ramos, Hannity, Fox News Network, March 7, 2018 (3:30 mark) To our inquiry, Carly Shanahan, a Fox News spokeswoman, said by email that Hannity relied on the presentation for his claim. Shanahan provided this transcript of the excerpted presentation: UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ""Criminal aliens have been responsible for about 642,000 offenses, criminal offenses. You look up there in the top left, sexual assaults, there's close to 8,000 victims."" HANNITY: ""Six hundred and forty-two thousand crimes since --"" UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ""In 2008.""

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ""That's the cost of not securing the border."" Fact-checking Perry in 2014 In gauging Hannity’s tally, it’s worth revisiting our 2014 fact-check of Perry. Perry, we found, had recapped arrests, not convictions, encompassing the lifetimes of individuals arrested over a recent period. Also, it looked to us like not all the arrested people were necessarily living here illegally. When we inquired into the figures aired by Perry, Tom Vinger of the Texas Department of Public Safety pointed us to an agency web page, ""Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" that said: ""From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults."" We didn’t spot any breakout of convictions. Vinger told us generally that the agency didn’t have additional information. Criminologists commented A couple of outside criminologists who reviewed the DPS-posted information at our request told us the presented tally of charges--not convictions--did not support Perry’s attribution of homicides to immigrants. Michael Walker, an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, said by phone that the DPS presentation telescoped the arrest histories of the 203,685 individuals put in county jails in the 69 months that were reviewed. ""Where did they offend--Texas? Oklahoma? Mississippi?"" Walker said, his point being that such information wasn’t on the web page. Walker and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixed together recent charges with those that might have been leveled decades before. Checking afresh in 2018 So, what of Hannity’s statement attributing 642,000 crimes against Texans to immigrants over a recent period? After Hannity spoke, we reached out afresh to the DPS. By email, Vinger pointed us to an updated agency web page stating that some 245,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into local Texas jails from June 2011 through February 2018 had together through their ""criminal careers"" been charged with more than 650,000 offenses. Those charges, the department says, resulted in more than 291,000 convictions ""including 566 homicide convictions; 29,164 assault convictions; 9,060 burglary convictions; 38,287 drug convictions; 274 kidnapping convictions; 20,082 theft convictions; 24,451 obstructing police convictions; 2,202 robbery convictions; 3,244 sexual assault convictions; and 4,036 weapon convictions."" Also, according to the agency’s post, some 66 percent of the convictions--over 193,000--were associated with individuals identified by their Homeland Security status as being in the U.S. illegally at the time of their latest arrest. Upshot: The DPS says that some 245,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into Texas jails over 81 recent months had in their lifetimes accumulated 291,000-plus convictions with nearly 7 in 10 of the convictions tied to 193,000 individuals identified as living in the country without legal permission at their latest arrest. These tallies, we otherwise noticed, roll in many nonviolent offenses. An accompanying chart shows that 358,996 of the criminal-career charges (66 percent of them) and 159,951 of the convictions (55 percent) were for offenses other than the agency’s specific listed categories of homicide, assault, burglary, kidnapping, drug or weapons violations, sexual assault, robbery, obstructing police or theft. The web page doesn’t say what those other offenses are. Criminologists revisited We also circled back to the criminologists who helped us analyze Perry’s claim. Neither saw substance to Hannity’s claim attributing 642,000 crimes to criminal immigrants over recent years. Walker noted that the Texas chart cited by Hannity tallies ""offenses,"" not ""crimes."" Offenses, Walker said, refer to misdeeds drawing no more than six months in jail meaning the 642,000 figure aired by Hannity conflates crimes and lesser offenses. A finer sort of the DPS-posted counts might deliver meaningful information, Walker suggested. As it is, he said by phone, the tallied ""drug offenses could be for having a joint or trafficking heroin. Weapon offenses"" could involve a knife or gun or other weapon. Walker added by email that the category titled ""All Other Offenses"" on the DPS chart could refer to ""such low-level acts as being a runaway, public intoxication and minor drug use charges."" Also, the inclusion of many lesser offenses might leave a misimpression, Walker said. ""A person could conceivably be a lifetime serial shoplifter,"" Walker speculated, or repeatedly charged with vagrancy. By email, Martinez similarly advised that it’s hard to discern what the DPS figures mean without specific definitions of each listed crime category. Martinez said: ""What is ‘obstructing police?’ ‘Weapons?’"" Generally, he wrote, the DPS tallies reflect what’s known about most U.S. crime--a ""sea of minor drug and property crimes."" Our ruling Hannity told Ramos that 642,000 crimes were committed against Texans by criminal immigrants in a recent seven-year period. This claim misrepresents a 2014 state presentation indicating that more than 200,000 immigrants jailed in the state over a recent 69-month period had accumulated in their lifetimes 642,000 charges--not convictions. Not all the immigrants were living in the state illegally at the time of their latest arrest. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Mike Collier']","
Mike Collier says pending Robin Hood funds won't fund public education
","For the sake of equity, state law since the 1990s has required Texas school districts with lucrative property-tax bases to share revenue with the state to help balance funding for less fortunate districts. In 2018, according to the state, the so-called Robin Hood or ""recapture"" system resulted in 185 districts sending $2 billion to the state. In raw dollars, the biggest givers were the Austin, Houston and Plano districts; the Austin district’s contribution exceeded $544 million. And that money gets spent on education, right? Not so in the state’s next budget year, Mike Collier of Houston, the 2018 Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, declared. In a March 18, 2018 tweet that made us wonder, Collier said: ""The state is set to recapture an additional $500 million in Robin Hood payments from taxpayers and not one penny of it will go to public education in Texas. Instead, the state government is confiscating our property tax dollars to pay its own bills."" That $500 million figure, Collier later told us by email, ties to how much more the state budget written by the 2017 Legislature takes from wealthy districts in the budget year beginning Sept. 1, 2019 compared to the amount so budgeted for the previous year. In fact, the budget shows the upcoming recapture total of $2,521,000,000 running $471.1 million ahead of the $2,049,900,000 budgeted for the previous 12 months. Money coming to the state from that increase ""does not go to any school,"" Collier said in a statement emailed by Scott Spiegel of his campaign. Collier further noted that the state budget shows education aid drawn from state tax collections decreasing by $1.6 billion, from $19.1 billion in fiscal 2018 to nearly $17.5 billion through August 2019. ""So despite higher recapture payments, overall funding is down,"" Collier said. ""The only way anyone could argue that $500 million increase in recapture payments was staying in schools would be to show an overall increase in school funding by $500 million,"" he said. Checking figures, state law Collier overlooked some spending; the education part of the budget lists more than a dozen revenue sources including proceeds from the state’s lottery and federal aid. All told, the budget shows, lawmakers voted to spend $28.2 billion on public education in fiscal 2018 with that commitment dropping to $27.2 billion the next year. Meantime, experts including R.J. DeSilva, staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on fiscal matters, indicated it’s not legally possible for recapture funds not to support education. State law specifies that recapture ""receipts shall be deposited in the state treasury and may be used only for foundation school program purposes,"" meaning the state’s primary way of funding schools. To our inquiries, school advocates said Collier made a solid point about local property values reducing pressure to spend state revenue on education. By email, Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency official who lobbies for districts, called Collier’s tweet ""false to the extent that it implies recapture funds are directly spent on functions of state government other than public education."" Yet Wisnoski and Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials each noted that any escalation in recapture amounts, influenced by increases in local property values, enables lawmakers to pony up less state revenue toward delivering each district the aid it’s entitled to receive based on state formulas rooted in changes in enrollment and its mix of students. Wisnoski wrote: ""State aid earned by school districts is based on formulas set in statute, and the amount of recapture in and of itself does not impact those formulas directly. Recapture is a method of finance for the appropriation for the Foundation School Program, so increased recapture means the state needs to draw less money from other sources to total up to the amount of Foundation School Program state aid, like state general revenue."" By phone, Josh Sanderson of the Equity Center, which says it advocates for ""chronically underfunded"" districts, similarly agreed that by law all recaptured dollars go to fund education. But when local property values are expected to increase, the state can budget fewer state tax dollars to fulfill its commitments, Sanderson said. He pointed out that the 2018-19 state budget presumes that local property values, and related tax collections, will increase 7.04 percent through August 2018 and by 6.77 percent the next tax year. ""Any property value increases essentially serve to offset the state’s share"" of formula-set funding, Sanderson said. He called Collier’s statement sort of correct and sort of incorrect, elaborating: ""He’s incorrect in saying that Robin Hood payments don’t go to benefit public education. However, he’s correct in saying it’s effectively reducing what the state puts in."" We also asked the Texas Education Agency to appraise Collier’s claim; we didn’t hear back. Our ruling Collier said Texas state government is set to take $500 million more from taxpayers in certain school districts ""and not one penny of it will go to public education in Texas."" This claim waves at a general truth that lawmakers can spend less state revenue on education provided local property values escalate. But by law, the $471 million more in recapture funds set to flow from districts to the state this next budget year must be deposited in the state treasury to be used only to fund education. This statutory reality makes Collier’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Ohio TV ad misleads in attack on Mike DeWine about immigration
","A TV ad portrays Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a Republican candidate for governor, as out of step with President Donald Trump on immigration. Onward Ohio, a political action committee, launched a statewide TV ad on March 20. ""If you like President Trump then you won’t like Mike DeWine,"" states the narrator. ""In the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses."" DeWine’s May 8 primary opponent, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, is a former chair of the PAC and echoed the attack on Twitter. The ad attacks DeWine’s position on other topics including his grade from the NRA, which we have previously fact-checked. We found that the ad doesn’t accurately explain DeWine’s Senate vote related to Social Security and requires some context to explain why as Attorney General he concluded that some undocumented immigrants should receive driver’s licenses. We emailed Onward Ohio and did not get a reply. The ad makes it sound as if DeWine wanted to provide a new entitlement for undocumented immigrants by allowing them to qualify for Social Security -- an attack we have seen before against Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Harry Reid, D-Nev. In reality, the 2006 vote concerned a much narrower issue -- the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by former undocumented immigrants who would have become legal under an immigration overhaul bill that included border security, a new temporary worker visa and a path to legal status. At the time, undocumented immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number. During a Senate debate over the broader bill, then-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number. On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted 50-49 to table the amendment, effectively killing it. DeWine and Clinton, then a New York senator, were among those who voted in favor of tabling it. DeWine’s campaign spokesman Ryan Stubenrauch said that DeWine ""voted to table the amendment because he believed that people should keep what they had earned if they could meet the steep requirements to become legal residents."" DeWine had expressed support for the overall bill because it included border security and also addressed the 12 million undocumented immigrants. ""It's a dangerous thing to have them in the underground. We have to put some paper on them and document them,"" he said several weeks before the bill passed. The House passed its own version, and the two chambers didn’t work out a compromise, so the bills died. This part of the ad could leave viewers with the misleading impression that DeWine took actions to allow all undocumented immigrants to get drivers’ licenses. DeWine’s recommendation while he was Ohio attorney general pertained only to a narrow slice of immigrants. In 2013, Ohio lacked a uniform policy regarding whether to grant driver’s licenses to immigrants who had temporary status through the 2012 program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which began under President Barack Obama. Some state officials issued driver’s licenses, while others refused. On March 29, 2013, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles announced that Ohio would allow the issuance of temporary licenses to qualified participants in DACA. The bureau reached a decision after reviewing guidance by DeWine ""that DACA grantees are eligible for temporary driver licenses under Ohio law."" DeWine wrote in a March 19 letter to the Ohio Latino Affairs Commission that DACA recipients could get a Social Security number and work permit. ""With these documents and any other documents normally required by the BMV, an individual can provide the BMV with the information necessary to receive a driver’s license,"" he wrote. ""I encourage any citizen who is concerned about the law or policy to contact their legislators and voice that concern. As Attorney General, I do not have the authority to introduce or vote on legislation."" DeWine’s campaign said he didn’t issue a formal advisory opinion -- he only expressed his view in a letter, and then it was up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to issue driver’s licenses. The TV ad cites a Cleveland Plain Dealer article that mentioned DeWine’s conclusion. David Leopold, an immigration lawyer at Ulmer & Berne in Ohio and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, worked in an advocacy capacity closely with Jose Mendez, a DACA recipient who pushed the issue at the time in Ohio.   Leopold told PolitiFact that it wasn’t a case of DeWine allowing undocumented immigrants to receive driver’s licenses. He was simply interpreting the DACA policy under Ohio law. Since DACA holders were considered ""lawfully present,"" they were able to provide the necessary information to apply for a driver’s license. There were around 1,900 immigrants with DACA status in Ohio by the end of May 2013 when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service first started tracking state data. Overall, there were 95,000 undocumented immigrants in Ohio. As of 2013, the majority of states already gave driver’s licenses to DACA recipients. Two states, Arizona and Nebraska, implemented policies that excluded DACA grantees from driver’s license eligibility, but as a result of litigation or legislative action, both states later issued driver’s licenses, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Trump announced in 2017 he would rescind DACA. While a federal judge ordered his administration to continue renewals they are not required to process new applications. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take it up and Congress hasn’t been able to reach any agreement on DACA. Onward Ohio said in a TV ad that ""in the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses."" On both of these attacks, the ad makes a sweeping statement without filling in viewers about the scope of what a bill and a policy actually said. The Social Security provision was more narrow than the ad suggests, because it addressed the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by people who at one time had been undocumented immigrants. While attorney general, DeWine concluded that undocumented immigrants who had temporary status through the federal DACA program were entitled to driver’s licenses, but that didn’t apply to all undocumented immigrants. There are kernels of truth here, but the ad fails to provide a complete picture of DeWine’s actions.

Rick Scott says K-12, state university funding is highest in last six years
","Gov. Rick Scott bragged that his final state budget continues a trend of record funding for education. ""For the sixth straight year, we have secured record funding for K-12 and state universities to ensure every student has the opportunity to receive a world-class education in Florida,"" Scott wrote in a letter to Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner on March 16. Scott’s claim is at odds with Democrats and state educators who say the education budget doesn’t go far enough to cover classroom needs. The 2018-19 budget includes specific allotments for school safety and mental health programs in response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Given the heated debate, we wanted to take a closer look at Scott’s claim. As we’ve concluded in similar fact-checks, the state’s total K-12 education budget has indeed increased in raw dollars every year for the last six years. However, Scott is overstating the value of those dollars. The K-12 education budget has not topped pre-recession levels when adjusted for inflation. The main source of money for K-12 education is the Florida Education Finance Program, or FEFP. By law, it’s a combination of state and local funding that is sometimes tweaked based on tax receipts and enrollment counts. Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said the ""record funding"" for K-12 education is only in reference to the state contribution, not the total funds that factor in local contributions. But that was not clear from Scott’s comment. For the 2018-19 school year, the K-12 total budget is about $21.1 billion, or about $7,408 per student. (The state’s share is a little more than half of the total at $11.9 billion.) That’s the highest it’s ever been, and a jump of almost $500 million from the previous year. School officials around the state have not been pleased, however, because their hands are tied about how to spend most of it.   A good chunk of the increase is dedicated for school safety and mental health initiatives. ""The Legislature is touting ‘record’ funding for schools by counting money slated for safety and mental health, not for education,"" said superintendents from some of Florida’s largest school districts in a joint column for the Tampa Bay Times. ""Their ‘record’ funding is all funneled into categorical funds and can only be used for certain purposes."" With that point in mind, we dove into the budget and per-pupil spending trends (the past six years are in bold): Fiscal year Total K-12 state share Total K-12 funds K-12 enrollment Per-pupil spending 2007-08 $9.7 billion $18.7 billion 2.63 million $7,126 2008-09 $8.6 billion $17.9 billion 2.62 million $6,846 2009-10 $8.1 billion $18 billion 2.63 million $6,846 2010-11 $8.91 billion $18.2 billion 2.64 million $6,897 2011-12* $8.71 billion $16.6 billion 2.67 million $6,217 2012-13 $9.5 billion $17.2 billion 2.7 million $6,376 2013-14 $10.5 billion $18.3 billion 2.705 million $6,769 2014-15 $10.7 billion $18.9 billion 2.74 million $6,915 2015-16 $10.93 billion $19.7 billion 2.77 million $7,105 2016-17 $11.3 billion $20.2 billion 2.8 million $7,196 2017-18 $11.6 billion $20.6 billion 2.82 million $7,307 2018-19 $11.9 billion $21.1 billion 2.9 million $7,408 * Scott’s first budget. In sheer dollars, Scott’s claim about K-12 schools is accurate.  Overall, state and per-pupil funding has increased every year since fiscal year 2013-14 in K-12 schools. Per-pupil spending is a crucial measure, because it shows how much is spent on each student. It would be expected, then, that overall spending would increase with the number of students. There are approximately 200,000 more K-12 students today then six years ago in fiscal year 2013-14. Scott’s boast of record funding, however, does not hold up when adjusted for inflation. Using the federal Consumer Price Index calculator, we found per-pupil spending is not as high as it was before the recession crippled state tax revenues. K-12 per-pupil spending would have to be more than $8,726 in 2018-19 to match the 2007-08 level. Instead it is more than $1,000 short. Scott’s boasts of education spending over the years have not usually included state funding for universities. Scott’s office provided the total operating budgets for state universities in the six years he mentioned, but we were unable to find per-pupil and enrollment totals for the more recent school years. The university budgets grew each year, from $3.48 billion in 2013-14 to $4.37 billion from 2018-19. During that time, the system also added more students. The Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System, offered enrollment totals and per-pupil spending for this period, using a slightly different methodology to calculate the overall operating funds. The spending totals reported by the board are slightly less than the figures cited by Scott. (One explanation could be that the governor’s data includes tuition assistance.) Still, they speak to the trend of increased record spending. The same caveats we found with K-12 education also apply: Per-pupil spending in 2018-19 would have to be roughly $14,346 to match the 2007-08 level. We did not find a per-pupil spending for 2018-19, but it’s safe to say that the per-pupil amount would be very close to the spending power in 2007-08. Fiscal year General revenue and lottery subtotal Enrollment Per-pupil spending 2007-08 $3.04 billion 259,528 $11,716 2008-09 $2.9 billion 259,972 $11,407 2009-10 $2.9 billion 268,052 $11,015 2010-11 $3.1 billion 276,376 $11,324 2011-12* $2.9 billion 293,660 $10,162 2012-13 $2.9 billion 294,005 $9,906 2013-14 $3.5 billion 293,517 $11,957 2014-15 $3.8 billion 294,785 $12,764 2015-16 $3.9 billion 299,486 $13,047 2016-17 $4.1 billion 305,690 $13,459 2017-18 $4.28 billion 311,430 $13,752 2018-19 $4.3 billion* No data No data Scott said, ""For the sixth straight year, we have secured record funding for K-12 and state universities."" Scott has a point in terms of sheer dollars. However, Florida's K-12 education funding hasn’t kept up with pre-recession numbers. We don't have a complete view of state university spending, but it's likely per-pupil spending is roughly the same as pre-recession numbers.  And the bulk of this year’s K-12 education budget increase is strictly for school safety and mental health, which won’t leave a lot of money left over for classroom needs.

NRA says violent radicals are behind the March For Our Lives
","As the National Rifle Association sees it, the March For Our Lives taking place in Washington and in cities and communities nationwide, is a ploy to destroy the Second Amendment. On NRATV, host Grant Stinchfield said he is ""committed to exposing the violent, even deadly history of these people behind this weekend’s March For Our Lives, anti-gun fraud of a protest."" ""March For Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions,"" Stinchfield said March 21. The key evidence behind that claim? Stinchfield argued that the Women’s March, the massive protest the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, is ""a major force behind"" the March For Our Lives. He further argued that the Women’s March organization is run by radicals with violent tendencies. Stinchfield’s first example: Singer Madonna telling a crowd that she felt so frustrated after the election that she ""thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House."" (""But I know that this won't change anything,"" she quickly added.) We explored the facts behind each link in that chain of association. The organization behind the March For Our Lives defies easy description, but one thing is clear: As an organization, the Women’s March is not a big player. The NRA broadcast mentioned Tamika Mallory, a Women’s March national co-chair. ""She has nothing to do with this,"" said Allan Mayer, co-CEO of 42West, the public relations firm for March For Our Lives. The NRA listed another Women’s March co-chair, Linda Sarsour. ""Absolutely no connection to what we’re doing,"" Mayer said. NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pointed to an article on Bustle, a news, entertainment and beauty website, describing how the youth engagement arm of the Women’s March was promoting gun control activism. That’s true. The youth organizers have posted a detailed gun control policy including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They promoted the National School Walkout protest in mid March and provided a toolkit for young organizers who wanted to hold their own local events. But their website has only a single mention of the March For Our Lives. It is the 14th point on a page about the school walkout and says ""We will be at #March4OurLives too!"" It adds, ""It will take sustained action to end gun violence and we stand in solidarity with our peers who are also organizing around gun violence prevention."" The clearest link to the Women’s March comes in the person of Deena Katz, a producer of Dancing With the Stars and a co-executive director of the Women’s March Los Angeles Foundation. Through a personal connection to a family in Parkland, Fla., the site of the deadly school shooting, Katz stepped in early to work with the student activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Katz applied as an individual for the permits to march in Washington. She is the president of the March For Our Lives Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit established to fund the march and future lobbying on gun control. But Mayer at 42West said Katz is doing this on her own, separate from the Los Angeles Women’s March group. A spokesperson for the LA group told Buzzfeed in February that the organization itself was not involved. The march has been a magnet for the many advocacy organizations that have pressed for gun control over many years. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Sandy Hook Promise all promote the march. Two organizations, Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage to Fight, are playing a prominent role in organizing sibling marches around the country and providing logistical muscle for the main march in Washington. Everytown — along with its grassroots organizing arm Moms Demand Action — has funded local marches, and maintains an interactive map showing where they are taking place. Everytown for Gun Safety receives significant support from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Giffords Courage to Fight emerged after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and is the project of gun victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband Mark Kelly. The liberal activist group MoveOn and Planned Parenthood also actively support the march. Planned Parenthood lists 14 local marches on its website. The Episcopal Diocese of Washington is coordinating housing and meals for out-of-town visitors. March For Our Lives has had no trouble securing hefty donations from Hollywood stars, companies and philanthropists. George and Amal Clooney pledged $500,000, a sum that was quickly matched by Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, and others. The Italian fashion company Gucci gave $500,000, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff pledged $1 million, as did billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad. The march also raised more than $3 million online through a GoFundMe campaign. The NRA said that the March For Our Lives is ""backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions."" That allegation rested on the idea that the Women’s March played a major role in the march, and the NRA host mentioned two co-chairs by name. We found no evidence that either the organization or those people are directly involved in the march. The Women’s March website doesn’t even list the gun control march as an upcoming event. The only significant tie between the marches is a producer who leads the Los Angeles chapter of the Women’s March. But the chapter said it is not involved, and the producer has acted on her own to apply for permits and establish the March For Our Lives’ nonprofit support fund. Major organizational muscle behind the march, both in Washington and in cities nationwide, comes from two well-known gun control advocacy groups, neither of which has a history of violent behavior. A number of related organizations have lent their support, including the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and celebrity donors have given millions of dollars. The NRA claim is without merit. We rate it Pants on Fire. Correction: After we published, a reader noted that the Youth Empowerment FAQ page on National School Walkout included a reference to the March For Our Lives. The fact-check has been corrected to reflect that reference. We also updated the story to reflect Madonna's full quote from the 2017 Women's March.",/factchecks/2018/mar/23/national-rifle-association/nra-says-violent-radicals-are-behind-march-our-liv/

Does West Virginia lead the nation in overdose drug death rate? Yes
","As he runs for a U.S. Senate seat, Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., is seeking targeted funding for states grappling with opioid addiction. Jenkins co-sponsored the Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act with Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and several other lawmakers, including fellow West Virginia Republican Rep. David McKinley. The legislation, which awaits action in a House committee, would clarify that per capita overdose deaths should be a factor in distributing funding from the 21st Century Cures Act, a law passed in 2016 by overwhelming majorities in Congress and then signed into law by President Barack Obama. In a March 20, 2018, press release to promote the bill, Jenkins wrote, ""The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration announced on Monday that West Virginia will be receiving $330,000 in additional funding, as our state has the highest overdose death rate in the nation."" Is Jenkins correct that West Virginia has ""the highest overdose death rate in the nation""? Yes, according to official statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the most recent full year for which data is available, 2016, the CDC reported that West Virginia had the highest death rate due to drug overdoses. Here’s a list of the top five states, which also include Kuster’s home state of New Hampshire.

Rebecca Dallet says Michael Screnock imposed 8-month jail sentence and probation in sex-crime cases
","Less than two weeks before the April 3, 2018, election for Wisconsin Supreme Court, the candidate backed by liberals attacked the candidate backed by conservatives in something of an unexpected way: As being lenient in two sex crime cases. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet made the attack against Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock in a TV ad released March 19, 2018. Dallet alleges in the ad that Screnock ""let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence."" Let’s review both cases. Child predator claim The first case referenced in the ad involves Axel R. Conrad of Wisconsin Dells. He was charged in February 2015 with felony repeated sexual assault of the same child, according to online court records. The incidents occurred over roughly a two-year period starting when Conrad was 17 and the victim was 14.   Conrad pleaded no contest to the charge and Screnock sentenced him to five years of probation. In a written statement, the girl told Screnock before the sentencing that she agreed with the probation sentence and said: ""I knew what I was doing. I was a willing participant.""

An important point to note is that the prosecutor and the defense attorney agreed with the probation recommendation of the probation department,   although judges are not bound by such recommendations. We’ll also note that the use of the ""predator"" in the ad can be understood as an older person preying on a younger person, but this was not a case involving a violent sex offender, according to state law. So, it’s correct to say Screnock didn’t sentence Conrad to any ""time"" -- as in, time behind bars -- though Conrad was put on probation. Rapist claim The other case involved Aldo Eder Ruiz-Velazquez of Sauk City. He was initially charged in March 2016 with third-degree sexual assault, a felony that carries a maximum prison term of 10 years; and with sex with a child age 16 or older, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. In a plea bargain, Ruiz-Velazquez, who was 24 at the time he was charged, pleaded no contest to fourth-degree sexual assault of a child, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. That charge is defined as having sexual contact with a person without the consent of that person. Screnock sentenced Ruiz-Velazquez to two years of probation, including eight months in jail, nearly the maximum time of nine months in jail allowed on the reduced charge. According to a Baraboo News-Republic news article, two underage females said Ruiz-Velazquez bought alcohol for them and took them to a house where they drank together. One of the girls, who was 16, told police that when she went to the bathroom, Ruiz-Velazquez followed her inside and locked the door and had sex with her, even though she repeatedly told him no. The article said the prosecutor agreed to reduce the felony to the misdemeanor in exchange for Ruiz-Velazquez pleading no contest to that charge. The prosecutor and the defense attorney recommended the sentence that Screnock ultimately imposed, the article said. It was unclear whether the victim would have been willing to testify in a trial. According to the news article, the prosecutor said the sentence balanced the victim’s wishes with the needs of society. Screnock, the article said, said that while the charge was serious, the need to protect the public was minimal because Ruiz-Velazquez did not have a history of prior criminal activity. So, the sentence in this case was eight months, but that was nearly the maximum allowed by law under the plea bargain that had been made. Our rating Dallet says Screnock ""let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence."" In the first case, an older male teen repeatedly had sex with a younger female teen, who told authorities the relationship was consensual. He was sentenced to five years of probation, but no time behind bars. In the second case, a 16-year-old said a 24-year-old man forced her to have intercourse and he was sentenced two years of probation, including eight months in jail, after pleading no contest to a reduced sexual assault charge. The maximum possible jail sentence for the misdemeanor, the result of a plea bargain, was nine months.

Hoax claims that Barack Obama broke the law to reclaim the presidency from Donald Trump
","Former President Barack Obama didn’t break any federal laws to reclaim the Oval Office from President Donald Trump, despite internet hoaxes. ""We got him: Obama just broke federal law in attempt to take over presidency from Trump,"" said the headline on March 18, 2018, on Universal News Portal, a blog promoting sensational headlines. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Obama tried to  overthrow the current president. In the article, Obama is falsely accused of being obsessed with taking Trump down by establishing a shadow government outside the White House that recruits active members to protest Trump’s every move. While there have been protests against policy decisions made by the Trump administration, there is no evidence to suggest that Obama influenced or administered them in any way. There is also no proof of an established shadow government, which has been referred to as a conspiracy theory by several news outlets. Obama is also accused of urging senators not to repeal Obamacare without Trump’s knowledge and of following Trump to the G20 Summit in Germany in 2017, which PolitiFact already debunked last year. Obama’s spokesperson told us that he did not attend the event, nor was he in Germany at the time it took place. There have also been no reports of Obama meeting with senators to discuss fighting the repeal of Obamacare.   The alleged crime in the fake news story  is that Obama is supposedly held secret meetings with world leaders. Since Obama is now out of office, doing so would be considered illegal under the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States or foreign governments. While Obama has met with some world leaders, such as President Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, it was part of a longstanding tradition of former presidents traveling overseas after leaving office to try and attract donations and support for their foundations, libraries and presidential centers. Obama has also leisurely traveled and made speeches abroad since he has left his presidency. We found no evidence of any illegal action taken by Obama since he has been out of office or any attempts to illegitimately take over the presidency.

Cynthia Nixon says she had more small donors in one day than Cuomo in seven years
","Cynthia Nixon says she received more donations from small donors on the first day of her campaign than Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has in seven years. ""In one day of fundraising I received more small donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years,’’ Nixon said in an exclusive interview with The Buffalo News. Cuomo has a financial advantage over Nixon going into his third election for governor. He has a campaign war chest of more than $30 million. Nixon is starting from scratch, and she says she will not accept campaign money from corporate political action committees as Cuomo has. Her campaign said she received 2,214 campaign contributions of under $200 in her first 24 hours as a candidate for governor. Cuomo, the campaign said, has received only 1,369 such donations since he took office in 2011. Nixon points to filings at the state Board of Elections to support her claim. We wanted to know if she was right. Since 2011 Nixon’s claim includes an important caveat: She counts only donations given to Cuomo after he first took office in 2011. She does not count donations Cuomo received when he first ran for governor in 2010. If you limit the analysis to her time frame, Nixon is right. Cuomo has received 1,369 donations under $200 since Jan. 1, 2011, according to a query of the Board of Elections database. That count includes only donations through  the middle of January 2018, the latest campaign filing available. We don’t know how many donations Cuomo has received since then. It’s possible he has collected 845 small donations that would make Nixon’s claim wrong. But filings show Cuomo has taken only 644 contributions of under $200 since his last inauguration in 2015. Before 2011 Nixon would be wrong if she included donations from Cuomo’s 2010 campaign for governor. Since the start of his first campaign for governor in May 2010, Cuomo has collected 2,898 campaign contributions of under $200, according to campaign finance filings. Cuomo received 1,529 such donations before 2011, filings show. That’s fewer than Nixon received on her campaign’s first day. Our ruling ""In one day of fundraising I received more small-donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years,"" Nixon said. She’s right. If you include the small-donor contributions he took during his first run for governor, Cuomo’s small-donor contributions have (so far) outpaced Nixon’s. But that's not what she said.

Comparing Facebook data use by Obama, Cambridge Analytica
","As news reports surfaced of Cambridge Analytica and the Donald Trump campaign, conservatives pointed to what seemed a double-standard. On ABC’s The View, co-host Meghan McCain said former President Barack Obama was met with praise when he used similar Facebook data for his campaign, whereas Trump was met with outrage. ""It happened under Obama and it was lauded by the media as being genius,"" McCain said. ""And now under the Trump campaign — it’s the Cambridge Analytica scandal."" ""Was it the same thing?"" co-host Joy Behar asked. ""Yeah,"" McCain said. ""It was micro-targeting and data mining."" ""I think it’s different, though,"" said co-host Sunny Hostin. ""It’s not different, though!"" McCain exclaimed. So, was it the same thing? While the data the two campaigns had access to was largely the same, the way they accessed it, and for what purpose, was very different. ""She was making the point that the Obama re-election campaign used a similar tactic through Facebook to gain access to the personal information of millions of voters,"" ABC spokeswoman Lauri Hogan clarified. Under the way Facebook allowed its apps to operate between 2010 and 2015, Obama’s 2012 re-election app and the survey app used by Cambridge Analytica had access not only to their users’ profiles but their friends’ list and their biographical information. When the user approved it, these apps could access details such as users’ and their friends’ tags, likes and demographics. Over a million people downloaded the Obama for America app. Around 300,000 people downloaded the personality survey app that ended up sending their data to Cambridge Analytica. The number of users’ data the firm reportedly gained access to (50 million) is much higher because it includes the users’ friends. The number of user data, it follows, was much higher for the Obama campaign, too. The real divergence is in the way each campaign accessed the data. The Obama campaign created a Facebook app for supporters to donate, learn of voting requirements, and find nearby houses to canvass. The app asked users’ permission to scan their photos, friends lists, and news feeds. Most users complied. The people signing up knew the data they were handing over would be used to support a political campaign. Their friends, however, did not. The people who downloaded the app used by Cambridge Analytica did not know their data would be used to aid any political campaigns. The app was billed as a personality quiz that would be used by Cambridge University researchers. Aleksandr Kogan, one of the Cambridge researchers involved in the project, sold the data to the upstart political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company then sold its services not only to the Trump campaign, but to the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz and the senatorial campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., among others. When Facebook discovered a developer had shared users’ data without their consent in 2015, it asked both the original app and the consultancy to delete the data. That didn’t happen. ""The thing that is true is that every Facebook app you downloaded back then was getting access to your entire friends list,"" said David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. ""When tech people were trying to raise outrage about it they were being ignored. Now, everyone is outraged. But what (McCain) is wrong about this is that Kogan then sold it, and for a much creepier purpose."" Obama operatives used Facebook data to get users to send their messaging for them, according to Eitan Hersh, a Tufts professor who wrote Hacking the Electorate, a book on Obama’s microtargeting strategies. Facebook friends lists, tags and photos allowed Obama operatives to identify a person’s close friends, which they then matched with offline public records. (Was this person likely to vote for Obama, but unlikely to get out to vote?) They then told the app users which of their friends they should send campaign messages to. Cambridge Analytica dialed up what Karpf called the creepiness factor. They combined the survey results with the Facebook data to create psychological profiles they then sold to campaigns. The idea was, if the firm could discover how these people thought, they could target ads toward them. Cambridge Analytica then sent targeted ads to the users on their database as well as users with similar profiles, identified by Facebook’s Lookalike tool. The friends of the app users weren’t being targeted by their friends, but by the campaign itself. In other words, the consenting middle man was gone. In his research, Hersh found that neither tactic was greatly effective at persuading people to vote. McCain said that there was a strong equivalence between how the Obama and Trump campaigns accessed user data on Facebook.  The Obama campaign and Cambridge Analytica both gained access to huge amounts of information about Facebook users and their friends, and in neither case did the friends of app users consent. But in Obama’s case, direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign. In the Cambridge Analytica case, users only knew were taking a personality quiz for academic purposes. The Obama campaign used the data to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends. Cambridge Analytica targeted users, friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads. Whereas the data gathering and the uses were very different, the data each campaign gained access to was similar. We rate this statement Half True.

"['Congress', 'Pennsylvania', 'Donald Trump']","
Did Conor Lamb say very nice things about Trump? No
","Looking to put a positive spin on a stunning political upset, President Donald Trump said Democrat Conor Lamb — the yet-to-be-declared winner of last week’s closely watched special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district — ""ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me."" Trump made the comment at a private fundraiser for Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley a day after the March 13 election, The Washington Post reported. But did Lamb’s campaign actually say ""very nice things"" about the president, or was this an attempt to minimize a looming Republican loss in a reliably red district? What Lamb said about Trump Lamb said very little about the president during the expedited campaign to fill a seat vacated late last year by disgraced former U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy who held the spot for more than a decade. But Lamb also held off on criticizing the commander-in-chief at a time when many Democrats have made the president the focus of their calls to action. Lamb was careful not to alienate voters in the traditionally conservative district, said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll and professor of Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College. ""Lamb did not want to arouse the Trump supporters in a district [Trump] won by 20 points,"" Madonna said. ""He wanted the election to be local, where he could focus on his strengths."" Asked if she agreed that the Lamb campaign had praise for Trump around points of agreement, campaign manager Abby Murphy said ""No, I don't think it was ever that specific."" She added: ""What was important to the voters of this district were things like jobs and the heroin epidemic and infrastructure. I think the congressman-elect made it very clear that he’s willing to work with whomever to make those things happen. I think it’s very clear that that’s what his intent was."" Lamb is the projected winner of the 18th District seat, with just a few hundred votes separating him and Republican candidate Rick Saccone, who conceded to Lamb on Wednesday. Votes were still being tallied and reviewed as of Wednesday, and the results remained unofficial. Republicans previously said they were considering challenging the results, alleging the vote was tainted by irregularities and other issues. On Tuesday, Trump said Saccone had narrowly lost the race, CNN reported. ""It was really close,"" Trump told the crowd at a Republican fundraising event. ""We went in there. They were down. Good man, Rick Saccone. Good man. And didn't quite make it. But lost, think of it, lost by about 300 votes out of all of those votes. So, it's pretty incredible. But we can't let it happen. We have to win. There's nothing like winning. We have to win."" During the campaign, Lamb did express support for Trump’s plan to apply stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He also told The Atlantic, ""We need the office of the presidency to succeed if we’re gonna make any progress on these issues,"" when asked what he thought of Trump. But experts argue that even if you judge those comments as charitable by 2018 political standards, Trump’s ""very nice things"" claim remains misleading. ""I think the closest thing [Lamb] said to something complimentary about Trump was his endorsement of the [metals] tariffs,"" said Dave Weigel, a reporter who covered the District 18 campaign for The Washington Post. Weigel added, ""What Lamb did instead, as you probably saw, was not mention the president and make the election more about the Republicans who run Congress."" Lamb did criticize the tax cuts bill shepherded through Congress by Republicans and signed into law by the president last year. White House representatives declined to comment for this story. In an interview with Lamb for The Atlantic, assistant editor Elaine Godfrey wrote that Lamb was ""careful not to present his candidacy as a way to oppose Trump,"" adding, ""Yes, Trump is a historically unpopular leader, and Lamb is running against a Republican who once bragged that he was ‘Trump before Trump was Trump.’ But as members of the campaign team reminded me repeatedly, Lamb wants to focus solely on local issues, and doesn’t want the race to become a tribal contest."" When asked about Trump directly, Godfrey wrote that Lamb offered this response: ""We need the office of the presidency to succeed if we’re gonna make any progress on these issues. The number-one thing people talk about is wanting to get someone down there who’s actually gonna attack the problem, not attack the other side."" Godfrey wrote that Lamb ""never mentioned the president by name"" in the course of their conversation. What Trump said about Lamb While Lamb remained largely silent on the subject of the White House, Trump didn’t always return the favor. At a March 10 rally for Saccone in Moon Township, the president referred to Lamb as ""Lamb the sham"" and said ""I hear he’s nice looking. I think I'm better looking than him. I do. I do. I do."" On CNN’s New Day program, host Alisyn Camerota asked Lamb about the ""Lamb the sham"" comment, but Lamb quickly pivoted back to the campaign. ""Apart from that, there was a lot of foolishness in this election and a lot of cartoonish campaigning, and by the time of the president’s visit last weekend, people were kind of tired of that approach,"" he said. Asked about Trump saying he was ""better looking,"" Lamb laughed. ""I really have no opinion on that one."" Our ruling Trump said Lamb said ""very nice things"" about him during the recent special election campaign in southwestern Pennsylvania. Lamb ran as a moderate Democrat in a conservative district and avoided openly criticizing the president. At times Lamb showed himself to be in agreement with Trump on certain policy points. But Trump equating this with high praise goes too far in interpreting and exaggerating what Lamb actually said. We found no evidence of Lamb lavishing praise on the president and instead found evidence of Lamb repeatedly pivoting away from the subject on the campaign trail.

Bruce Rauner cites own remarks as proof of outside support for election night claim
","Incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner struck a number of familiar notes in his speech Tuesday night as he claimed a narrow primary victory over insurgent Republican challenger Jeanne Ives, talking about tax cuts, job growth and term limits for elected leaders. But the multi-millionaire Rauner also sought to frame his coming general election battle against Democratic nominee J.B. Pritzker as one pitting the interests of the little guy against entrenched political insiders allied with the billionaire Pritzker. Then Rauner threw in a new wrinkle to his standard line of attack. ""Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia,"" he told the applauding crowd. ""But it’s really the people versus the Illinois mafia."" Rauner has long been free with tossing around incendiary terms to describe rivals, in particularly Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, whom the governor frequently lambastes as ""corrupt."" But this latest turn of phrase, which Rauner attributed not to himself but ""newspapers,"" got us to wondering. Which newspapers? So we reached out to his campaign for an answer. A spokesman quickly responded by emailing a link to a single opinion column published a few weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal titled, ""Bruce Rauner vs. the Illinois ‘Mafia.’"" In the piece, which represents the views of a single columnist and not the paper’s editorial board, Rauner pins Illinois’ problems squarely on Madigan. The Journal quotes Rauner referring to his archrival as ""the mafia kingpin of Illinois"" and then taking an additional swipe at Madigan for simultaneously serving as a powerful lawmaker and as a partner in a law firm specializing in property tax appeals. ""It’s a mafia protection racket,"" Rauner said of Madigan’s dual roles. But the ‘mafia’ references in the headline and column come from Rauner’s own mouth, not from the impressions of the writer, who also goes on to note that: ""Mr. Rauner sounds confident and plans to spend whatever it takes to make the election a referendum on reform versus the Madigan Mafia."" Rauner campaign aides did not respond to our follow-up email asking whether they believed other newspapers had framed the election in similar terms. After barely squeaking out a victory over a primary challenger, Gov. Bruce Rauner declared to supporters that, ""Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia."" Incendiary rhetoric has been a staple of Rauner speeches for years, but in upping the ante even more in his fight against Pritzker it appears the governor is also projecting his own words onto the thoughts of others. Newspapers, or more precisely one column in the Wall Street Journal, did not frame Rauner’s re-election fight in terms of a struggle with a mafia-like force. That is Rauner’s own characterization and he is simply quoting himself while seeking to attribute the observation to others. This dizzying feedback loop earns Rauner’s primary night claim a False.",/factchecks/2018/mar/21/bruce-rauner/rauner-cites-own-remarks-proof-outside-support-ele/

Fact-checking Donald Trump's claims about Democrats on Robert Mueller's team
","During a weekend tweetstorm, President Donald Trump took aim at Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of investigators. ""Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!"" he tweeted on March 18. Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION! Here, we’re going to take a closer look at Trump’s assertion that Mueller’s team has 13 ""hardened Democrats,"" some ""big"" supporters of Hillary Clinton, and no Republicans. (The White House did not respond to inquiry for this article.) The Special Counsel’s office had made public the identities of 17 attorney staff members through March 21. Their backgrounds are summarized here. Through public records, we were able to independently confirm that at least 12 people on Mueller’s staff are registered Democrats. They ones we confirmed are Greg Andres, Rush Atkinson, Ryan Dickey, Michael Dreeben, Kyle Freeny, Andrew Goldstein, Adam Jed, Elizabeth Prelogar, James Quarles, Jeannie Rhee, Brandon Van Grack, and Andrew Weissmann. Another member of Mueller’s team -- Aaron Zelinsky -- has been reported to be a registered Democrat by both the Washington Post and the Daily Caller. The Daily Caller also reported that Zelinsky wrote, ""I’m a Democrat,"" in a Huffington Post column supporting same-sex marriage in November 2012. In the meantime, we were able to independently confirm that two other members of Mueller’s staff -- Scott Meisler and Aaron Zebley -- are registered to vote but have not chosen a party affiliation. We were unable to independently confirm the status of two other staff members, Zainab Ahmad and Brian M. Richardson. According to the Daily Caller, Ahmad ""appears to have registered as a Republican at the age of 18, but has since changed her registration status to unaffiliated."" We’ll also note that in the jurisdictions in which the Mueller lawyers live -- primarily the District of Columbia, Maryland and New York -- the Democrats are the dominant party, meaning that many races are effectively decided in Democratic primaries rather than in the general election.  However, Trump’s assertion that there are no Republicans on the team is undercut by the fact that its leader is Mueller, who is registered as a Republican in the District of Columbia. Mueller was appointed to offices by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as by Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. In addition, Mueller was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, who was nominated for deputy attorney general by Trump himself, and who previously was appointed as a U.S. Attorney by George W. Bush (and later kept on by Obama). The Daily Caller has also reported that Mueller has occasionally donated to Republicans in both statewide and national races. Fox News has referred to Mueller as the ""only known Republican"" on the team. It’s worth noting the importance of the word ""known,"" since other FBI or Justice Department personnel are assisting the investigation in certain capacities. The names of investigative and office support personnel have not been made public, the Special Counsel’s office told PolitiFact. James D. Robenalt, a Cleveland lawyer who runs a continuing legal education class on Watergate and its lessons, said that FBI agents in particular are likely helping gather evidence. Agents ""come in all political stripes, though most are not active politically,"" Robenalt said. ""FBI agents, as most law enforcement, tend to be conservative, law-and-order types, so my guess is most would tend to be Republicans or conservative Democrats or just plain Independents."" So Trump is using some sleight-of-hand to say that there are ""zero Republicans"" on Mueller’s team. The team is led by a registered Republican, and there may be other registered Republicans working with Mueller whose identities the public simply doesn’t know about. Trump has a point here, too, but it’s worth keeping the scale of the donations in context. Two of the 13 publicly known Mueller staffers donated what might be characterized as ""big"" sums to Clinton’s 2016 campaign -- Quarles, with $2,700, and Rhee, with $5,400. During the 2016 campaign cycle, $2,700 was the maximum donation an individual could make to a campaign. Such a donation could be made twice -- once for the primary campaign and then again for the general election. A third member of the team, Weissmann, donated $2,300 to Clinton, but that was in 2007, when she was making her first presidential run. (The Daily Caller separately reported that he attended Clinton’s election-night party in 2016.) Three other team members donated smaller amounts: $250 by Freeny and Prelogar, and $200 by Atkinson. How you define ""hardened"" is a judgment call. But if you measure by campaign donations, the point is overblown. Seven of the registered Democrats have no record of writing checks to federal candidates. Based on federal disclosure data, Quarles is easily the most generous donor on the team, giving in excess of $35,000 over the better part of two decades. Most of these donations went to Democratic candidates or entities, but it’s worth noting that Quarles also made two donations totaling $2,750 to Republicans -- former Virginia Gov. George Allen and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz. He was the only team member to give donations to federal Republican candidates. The second-most generous team member was Rhee, who gave $11,950 to Democrats in federal races. Weissman ranked third, with $6,600, followed by Andres and Goldstein, both of whom gave in the mid-$3,000 range. Freeny, Prelogar, Van Grack and Atkinson also gave money in federal races, with donations from $200 to $800. The Daily Caller found additional donations totaling a little less than $12,000 in state and local races by eight of the staff members. These donations were to Democrats. So the donor on the team who gave the most money is also the only one to donate to Republican candidates as well. Four other staff members gave between $3,000 and $12,000 over a span of several years, four more gave donations only in the hundreds of dollars, and seven more didn’t give any money at all in federal races. Mueller’s team has the legal right to register to vote with a party or by making personal donations. Such activities are protected under the Hatch Act, originally passed in 1939. It’s also important to note that Mueller was prevented from considering political affiliation when putting together his team. Both Justice Department policy and the Civil Service Reform Act ""prohibit using political affiliation and may also prohibit using certain ideological affiliations in hiring and taking other personnel actions with regard to career attorneys,"" the department’s inspector general has written. Moreover, the career attorneys on the Mueller team are bound by professional codes to pursue justice and rise above partisanship. Every federal employee swears an oath to ""support and defend the Constitution of the United States"" and ""bear true faith and allegiance to the same."" Lawyers practicing in the federal courts swear a separate oath ""that as an attorney and as a counselor of this court, I will conduct myself uprightly and according to law, and that I will support the Constitution of the United States."" Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in political law and government ethics at the firm Akerman LLP, said that in his experience, ""Justice Department lawyers tend to skew towards the Democrats while FBI agents are overwhelmingly Republican. Both of them take an oath to dispense justice without fear or favor with regard to political party, and I’ve never seen anyone from either group act in a partisan way."" ""I don’t think one should ever ask about party affiliation when it comes to prosecutors,"" Robenalt added. ""They come in all stripes. The question is whether they are qualified — and as I understand it, the team assembled is highly qualified."" Robenalt said he wouldn’t advise young Justice Department lawyers to voluntarily eschew all political activity today for fear of getting attacked if they one day join a politically charged investigation. ""It is a First Amendment right and crucial to our democracy,"" he said. ""My guess is most will stay away from politics, but our country was built on the idea of freedom of belief and expression."" One final point worth remembering is Trump's own history of donations to Clinton's U.S. Senate campaign (five, worth $4,100) and first presidential campaign (two, worth $2,300, though they were refunded in 2009.) Trump tweeted that Mueller’s team has ""13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans."" Mueller’s team does have 13 registered Democrats and no registered Republicans, and several team members made donations to Clinton’s campaign in various amounts. However, Trump leaves out a crucial registered Republican — Mueller himself — and glosses over the fact that we don’t know the identities, or the partisan affiliation, of other Justice Department or FBI staff who are working with the investigation. It’s also questionable to say that the multiple non-donors are ""hardened"" Democrats. We rate the statement Half True. CORRECTION, March 22, 2018: The article has been changed to reflect that Rosenstein was ""kept on"" in his existing job by Obama.",/factchecks/2018/mar/21/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claims-about-Mueller/

Did Brian Kemp fight Obama twice 'to stop illegal immigrants from voting'?
","Georgia Republican Brian Kemp is trying to win over Trump voters in his race for governor by saying he successfully fought the Obama administration to keep immigrants in the country illegally from voting in the state. Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state since 2010, posted a campaign video on his Facebook page March 5 that invoked the deaths of Kate Steinle, Edwin Jackson and a Georgia family killed by a drunk driver in the country illegally, saying ""we must secure the border and end sanctuary cities."" Over black and white photos of Kemp and former President Barack Obama, a narrator then says: ""As Secretary of State, Brian Kemp fought Obama twice and won to stop illegal immigrants from voting."" Text under Obama’s photo said: ""Fought Obama. Citizenship check. Photo ID."" Is that true? Kemp’s video stretched the facts. Courts dismissed lawsuits filed by Kemp to change voting procedures in Georgia — after the Obama administration allowed the voting changes. Also, there’s no indication that Obama wanted immigrants in the country illegally voting. Kemp’s campaign pointed to preclearance lawsuits filed on Georgia’s behalf in June and November of 2010 against then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Because of its history of voter discrimination, Georgia was one of several states whose voting changes were required to be precleared by either a federal court or the U.S. Justice Department. Per Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, in judicial reviews, jurisdictions must establish that proposed voting changes do not deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. If jurisdictions seek administrative preclearance from the Justice Department, they can implement voting changes if the Attorney General affirmatively indicates no objection, or if at the expiration of 60 days, no objection to the submitted change has been interposed by the Attorney General. Both of Georgia’s lawsuits dealt with new rules to prevent people in the country illegally from casting votes. The first lawsuit concerned a voter verification process that required information on voter registration applications to match data kept by Georgia’s Department of Drivers Services and the Social Security Administration. The other lawsuit stemmed from a Georgia law requiring proof of citizenship from individuals registering to vote. In the end, both lawsuits were dismissed because the Justice Department approved the changes through the administrative process. The Justice Department did oppose one of the changes Georgia sought, but later found no objection after the state revised it. So, Kemp and the Justice Department eventually were on the same side. ""As secretary of state, Brian Kemp sued the Obama Justice Department twice — and won — to implement Georgia's common sense citizenship check and Photo ID laws,"" said Ryan Mahoney, Kemp's campaign spokesman.  New voter verification procedures were initially sought by former Secretary of State Karen Handel, who attempted to implement them before the 2008 general election. (She resigned in 2009 and is now in the U.S. House.) The Justice Department in 2008, under Republican President George W. Bush, ""first questioned"" the voter verification process, saying federal law requires states to verify a voter's identity, but not citizenship, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. ""The state largely acted as it was required to by the Voting Rights Act, as has been necessary since the law was signed into law in 1965,"" said Barry C. Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""In both of the Georgia cases, the Department of Justice precleared the changes after reviewing them."" Michael S. Kang, a law professor at Emory University School of Law, said ""it’s odd"" to claim that Kemp ""fought Obama twice"" on the basis of the 2010 lawsuits, since the Justice Department ultimately chose to preclear both voting changes. ""In fact, many election law experts were surprised that the Justice Department under President Obama didn’t maintain an objection to these laws,"" Kang said. Finally, the ad creates the wrong impression that Obama wanted people in the country illegally to vote.  But ""there is zero evidence to support the implication that the Obama administration wanted to see illegal immigrants voting,"" Burden said. Kang said he is unaware of any serious evidence that ""illegal immigrants"" were voting in Georgia at the time. ""I also do not believe that President Obama has supported voting by ‘illegal immigrants,’ "" he said. Kemp said he ""fought Obama twice and won to stop illegal immigrants from voting."" The facts don't suppport Kemp's assertion. The Obama administration allowed Georgia’s changes to stop noncitizens from voting to happen. As secretary of state, Kemp was required to seek approval for the changes from the Justice Department or a federal court. He got it from the Justice Department, so the lawsuits were dismissed. Experts described the process as routine under the law. The ad is flat-wrong to suggest that the Obama administration wanted immigrants in the country illegally to cast votes in elections.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2018/mar/21/brian-kemp/Did-Brian-Kemp-fight-Obama-twice-to-stop-illegal/
