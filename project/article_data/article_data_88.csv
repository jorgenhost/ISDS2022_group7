No, this photo doesn’t show the White House dark after Biden was sworn in
","Ten days after President Joe Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, an image started to spread on Facebook suggesting that the commander-in-chief was MIA.  ""10th night in a row no body home,"" reads the description on an image showing a dark White House, nary a lamp shining in the windows.

Tom Cotton wrong that there’s “no way” to screen immigrants
","Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., arguing against President Joe Biden’s immigration agenda, claimed that there’s no screening process for people coming into the United States. While millions of Americans are out of work, Cotton said in a Feb. 1 Fox News interview, Biden wants to give ""amnesty to 15 million"" people living illegally in the country, invite more guest workers, and give people ""with bogus claims of asylum"" an opportunity to come into the country to work. ""And we are in a pandemic, good job,"" Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade responded sarcastically. Cotton continued: ""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security."" He praised former President Donald Trump’s ""Remain in Mexico"" policy to keep asylum seekers in Mexico, ""as opposed to being released into our country"" pending a hearing. During his presidential campaign, Biden promised a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people illegally in the country, and spoke out against the Remain in Mexico program, saying he would allow people seeking asylum to stay in the U.S. while their cases were under review. Biden’s administration stopped enrolling people in the program, but has not revoked it. We asked Cotton’s press office for more information about his claim that there’s ""no way to screen"" migrants. ""Relying on the honor system for security and health background checks is not a sufficient screen,"" said Caroline Tabler, a spokesperson for Cotton. But U.S. officials don’t have to rely on an ""honor system."" U.S. Customs and Border Protection has tools and processes to screen immigrants who are apprehended at the border for health and security issues, even if the people aren’t fully upfront or don’t have medical records or documentation on hand proving they have a clean background. CBP told PolitiFact that it does initial inspections for symptoms or risk factors associated with COVID-19, and ""pursuant to longstanding infectious disease protocols,"" refers immigrants who might have an infectious disease to local clinics or hospitals ""for appropriate medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment."" Procedures for COVID-19 have been in place since the beginning of the pandemic, said Matthew Dyman, a spokesperson for the CBP. In late April, CBP said that a 31-year-old Indian man was the first person in its custody to test positive for COVID-19. The oversight office within the Department of Homeland Security surveyed CBP personnel from April 22 to May 1. Ninety percent of the Border Patrol stations and ports of entry offices that responded to the survey said they conducted risk assessments to determine if people in CBP custody were exposed to COVID-19. Protocols included ""screening individuals for COVID-19 symptoms when they are initially processed at a facility, and continued monitoring for potential COVID-19 symptoms for as long as they remain in CBP custody,"" said the September 2020 inspector general report. The report said, however, that it was rare for facilities to be able to administer COVID-19 tests on site. As of July 13, 58 migrants across all Border Patrol stations had tested positive for COVID-19, the report said. CBP in late 2019 issued a directive to improve the medical screening of people in its custody  after several children died while in CBP care. The three-phase approach called forCBP personnel to observe people for potential medical issues, conduct health interviews on all people under 18 years old, ""at a minimim""; and ""subject to availability of resources and operational requirements,"" perform a medical assessment on children age 12 and younger and people with a known or reported medical concern. Implementation of the directive was contingent upon funding and resources, the CBP acting commissioner said in 2019. Whether CBP’s health screening procedures are sufficient and effective can be debated, but it’s inaccurate to say there’s ""no way to screen"" people. The Texas Tribune and ProPublica reported in August that a different immigration agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was testing unaccompanied children for COVID-19 and deporting those who tested negative. The news organizations said that ICE had agreements with 10 countries requiring that children test negative for COVID-19 before being sent back to their home countries. The Washington Post reported in early December that 1,061 minors in U.S. immigration custody had tested positive for COVID-19 since March. In March 2020, the Trump administration invoked Title 42, a section of federal law that allows the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to deny entry to immigrants coming from countries with infectious disease outbreaks. So far, Biden’s administration has kept that directive, allowing quick expulsion of people arriving at the border. CBP has access to international databases through TECS, an information-sharing platform that allows the agency to obtain the criminal history of a person who attempts to enter the United States, said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. A 2016 DHS report said that the purpose of TECS was ""to track individuals who have violated or are suspected of violating a law or regulation that is enforced or administered by CBP, to provide a record of any inspections conducted at the border by CBP, to determine admissibility into the United States, and to record information regarding individuals, firms, and organizations to whom DHS/CBP has issued detentions and warnings."" CBP statistics on the number of ""criminal aliens"" identified at the border prove that CBP regularly identifies individuals with criminal histories before they enter the United States, Hallett said. If a person poses a threat to national security, they can’t get asylum, said Lynn Marcus, director of the Community Immigration Law Placement Clinic at the University of Arizona. ""There is a process for screening all of this,"" she said. Cotton said, ""A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or security."" A CBP database allows personnel to run criminal background checks on people apprehended at the border and access records collected by U.S. and foreign authorities. CBP routinely publishes data on immigrants who attempted to enter the country and have a criminal record.  CBP might not always have access to a person’s full medical records, but the agency says it screens people for COVID-19 and other health issues.  It’s fair to question whether existing protocols are sufficient, but it’s inaccurate to say ""we have no way to screen"" immigrants. We rate Cotton’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A47AB40>],/factchecks/2021/feb/03/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-wrong-theres-no-way-screen-immigrants/

Biden administration did not dictate specific changes to sports
","President Joe Biden issued a flurry of executive orders in his first days in office, and claims quickly followed about the results of those actions.  One Facebook post read, ""In 36 hours Biden has disgraced our National Guard, allowed males to compete in girls’ sports, opened our border, and has crushed our oil production.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) For this fact-check, we focused on the claim about sports. PolitiFact has checked claims related to the other issues and found them all to be false or mostly false. That includes this claim that Democrats forced the National Guard to sleep in a parking garage; a claim that Biden questioned the National Guard’s loyalty; a claim that Biden sparked a migrant caravan from Honduras because of his immigration policies; and a claim that Biden has banned fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from the ground.  The claim that Biden ""allowed males to compete in girls sports"" likely stems from  an executive order from the Biden administration titled ""Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.""  Shortly after the order was issued, Twitter users began discussing its potential effect on women in sports, and the hashtag #BidenErasedWomen was trending, Newsweek reported. But the idea that the order will allow transgender females — whose sex at birth was male but whose gender identity is female — to compete in women’s sports is misguided. The Biden executive order does not impose any new guidelines that would immediately bring changes to school sports, and it only mentions sports once: ""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports."" Instead, it requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Education Department, to review existing policies and programs to determine whether they are in line with the new guidance prohibiting discrimination based on gender and sexuality, and to implement changes if needed. The Jan. 20 executive order extends protections from a 2020 Supreme Court case that addressed employment law to other federal laws, including those that cover education and school-related activities. In that case, Bostock v. Clayton County, the court ruled that employers cannot fire a person for being gay or transgender because it violates Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. ""Because Title VII is limited to employment discrimination, it was unclear how the Supreme Court’s decision would be applied to other federal discrimination statutes that prohibit sex discrimination in other contexts,"" according to the National Law Review. ""The Biden administration has now stated its view that Bostock applies with equal force.""  That’s a departure from the Trump administration, which had narrowly interpreted the Bostock case and determined it did not apply to education-related discrimination policies. It’s possible that the executive order could result in changes that affect transgender participation in sports, the National Law Review reports: ""The current administration will likely implement major changes related to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or transgender status. This may include requiring schools to allow students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that are consistent with their gender identity, and to play on athletic teams that are consistent with their gender identity. ""  The publication also notes, though, that the executive order ""is a high level policy statement and does not, in and of itself, immediately change any practices for public school districts."" A Facebook post says Biden has ""allowed males to compete in girls’ sports."" The claim seems to be based on an executive order Biden issued that prohibits discrimination based on gender and sexuality in education, but that opponents say will allow transgender females to compete in women’s sports. The executive order does not propose changes to policies or include details about specific programs such as sports. It mandates that federal agencies review programs and policies to be sure they do not discriminate, and to make changes if needed.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D49180>],/factchecks/2021/feb/02/facebook-posts/biden-administration-did-not-dictate-specific-chan/

Donald Trump Jr. distorts his father's war record as president
","When President Donald Trump came into office, the U.S. was still struggling to extricate itself from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that had begun more than a decade earlier.  When he left, U.S. troop levels in both countries were sharply lower. And some of Trump’s supporters praised him for not starting any new wars. His son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted Jan. 22 that ""Donald Trump is the first president in modern history (who) did not start a new war."" Trump himself echoed this claim in his last address at the White House, saying that he was the first president ""in decades"" not to start a war.  After Trump Jr. made his post, many users pushed back on his claim by citing Jimmy Carter, who was president from 1977 to 1981, didn’t start any wars and is still alive. We tried to contact Donald Trump Jr. through the Trump Organization to find out what he meant, but didn’t get a response. We also reached out to six experts on U.S. military and foreign policy and asked them whether the former president deserves such a distinction. They said the answer depends on which presidents are considered ""modern,"" and how you define war.  But all of them agreed that the claim leaves out key context and paints a misleading portrait of the Trump administration’s use of military force.  The United States has formally declared war in only five conflicts: the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II. A definition of war that rested on a formal declaration by Congress would leave out conflicts such as the Vietnam War, the Korean War and the Iraq War, said Joseph DeThomas, a professor at the Penn State School of International Affairs.  These later conflicts began under an ""authorization of military force"" from Congress, giving the president powers to prosecute the war abroad. Trump never asked for such an authorization during his administration. However, neither did his predecessor, Barack Obama, who nonetheless oversaw sustained armed conflict in Afghanistan and spearheaded a NATO-backed intervention in Libya, for which he was criticized for not seeking congressional approval.  Another approach, put forth by the Correlates of War Project, classifies a war as a conflict involving two organized armed forces that results in at least 1,000 battle-related casualties. By this definition, Trump did not start any wars, but neither did presidents Carter and Gerald Ford, said Robert Gulotty, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Chicago.  Several experts we spoke with brought up Carter as the clearest example contradicting Trump Jr.’s claim. Carter did not formally declare war on another country or seek authorization to use force from Congress. Nor did Carter engage U.S. armed forces in a new sustained armed conflict with another foreign power.  Carter did oversee the U.S. response to the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis, and ordered a raid to try to free 52 American hostages held at the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The raid was aborted, though, and a helicopter that was to be part of the operation later crashed, killing eight U.S. servicemen.  Carter ""was proud of claiming that there were no combat casualties on his watch until the aborted Iran rescue mission set him back,"" said Richard Betts, a professor of war and peace studies at Columbia University. ""But few would count that covert operation as starting a war.""  Historians differ on where to draw the boundaries of the modern era, but for this check involving both military and presidential history, we focus on the period since the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975 under Gerald Ford’s presidency. Here’s a look at some of the significant military actions initiated by U.S. presidents since that time: Ronald Reagan (1981-89): Under Reagan, 7,600 U.S. troops invaded Grenada and occupied the island within a few days; 19 American troops were killed during the operation. Reagan also sent soldiers into Lebanon in 1982 to participate in a temporary peacekeeping force, and later persuaded Congress to authorize an operation for 18 months. Around 250 Americans were killed before the U.S. withdrew its forces, most from a terrorist attack on U.S. marine barracks in Beirut.  George H.W. Bush (1989-93): Bush initiated the Gulf War to expel the Iraqi army from Kuwait. More than 2 million U.S. service members served during the conflict, and 147 U.S. troops were killed in battle.  Bill Clinton (1993-2001): Clinton dramatically increased the scope of a NATO intervention in the long-running civil war in Yugoslavia. After a series of NATO airstrikes in 1994, 60,000 U.S. and allied troops were deployed to Bosnia in 1995 as part of a ""peacekeeping mission."" According to a 2016 retrospective from the military newspaper Stars & Stripes, no U.S. soldiers were killed in combat in Bosnia but several died from other causes. Under Clinton in 1999, NATO also participated in an intervention in Kosovo, during which two U.S. pilots died. Human Rights Watch estimated that as many as 527 civilians were killed in NATO airstrikes.  George W. Bush (2001-09): After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan after the Taliban declined to extradite Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In 2003, U.S. forces invaded Iraq and ousted Saddam Hussein from power. According to the Defense Department, over 4,000 U.S. troops were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2010, and over 2,000 were killed in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. The Iraq Body Count Project has estimated that over 200,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed so far. American troops have remained stationed in both countries.  Barack Obama (2009-17): Obama oversaw a NATO-backed intervention in Libya and a surge of troops into Afghanistan. After withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, Obama redeployed them in 2014 to combat territorial expansion by the Islamic State militia group.  Trump didn’t enter the U.S. into a fresh, sustained armed conflict with another state, or seek a new congressional authorization for use of force. He frequently criticized American involvement in the Middle East, and he took steps to withdraw U.S. troops from Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan before he left office.  But Trump has used military force in other foreign countries under the broad authorization to use force granted after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  His administration has ordered airstrikes and drone attacks, supplemented allied militaries with U.S. troops, deployed special operations forces in the Middle East and beyond, and ordered the killing of Iran’s Gen. Qassem Soleimani, which critics claim nearly triggered an armed conflict.  ""With that authorization in place, I am not sure it is possible to start a new war these days,"" said DeThomas. ""They all fit under the legal umbrella of the old one.""  Stephanie Savell, a researcher at Brown University’s Costs of War Project, developed a map showing the scope of U.S. counterterrorism operations, including combat operations in the Middle East and across Africa. Many of these operations, Savell said, are carried out under Section 127e, a legal authority that allows U.S. special operations teams to organize and participate in raids on militant groups with foreign allies.  The extent of the Trump administration’s 127e programs, Politico has said, in effect constituted a secret U.S. war in African countries such as Kenya, Somalia, Mali and Niger.  Donald Trump Jr. said in a tweet that ""Donald Trump is the first president in modern history (who) did not start a new war."" Trump did not seek authorization from Congress for use of military force, or a formal declaration of war against any other country. He did not engage the U.S. in any new protracted conflicts during his four years in office. But Trump did order and oversee new military operations under existing authorizations, including counterterrorism raids that have spread to several countries in the Middle East and Africa. The claim also ignores the record of Carter, who did not start any new wars under the definitions put forward by military and foreign policy experts. As Carter is still alive, we consider him to be part of modern presidential and military history. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. ​",[<zip object at 0x00000280972B8D00>],/factchecks/2021/feb/02/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-distorts-trumps-war-record/

No, Facebook Didn’t Try To ‘Shut Down’ Gavin Newsom Recall Effort
","A conservative blog falsely claimed Facebook tried to ""shut down"" the campaign to recall Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom when the social media company stopped running political advertisements.  In reality, Facebook stopped accepting political ads regardless of party affiliation last fall to curb misinformation. No one campaign was singled out.  In mid-December, the company made an exception to the ban when it allowed ads in the three weeks leading up to the U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia and then resumed the ban last month.  Still, RedState.org published an article Jan. 28 with the headline: ""Facebook Says No More Ads for Movement To Recall Gavin Newsom."" The Newsom recall campaign shared the blog on its Instagram account early this week. Randy Economy, a spokesperson for the recall campaign, said he would review the post but did not respond to questions about why the campaign shared it.  The article in question includes a subheadline visible on social media that claims Facebook is ""Attempting to shut down a fully legal recall effort because … cronyism?"" It offers no evidence for that allegation.  A screen shot of the RedState.com article and claim. This post was flagged as part of PolitiFact's partnership with Facebook to fact-check false news on the social media platform. However, Facebook played no role in selecting the fact check or its rating. Our Research Along with making the claim about shutting down the recall, the RedState.com article goes on to allege Mark Zukerberg, Facebook’s chief executive officer, ""has sought out to silence dissent against his comrades in the Democrat party,"" following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by Trump extremists.  Following the insurrection, Facebook blocked content posted to the #StormTheCapitol hashtag, according to a TechCrunch article. The article went on to say that Facebook representatives pledged to remove content praising the Trump supporters who infiltrated the U.S. Capitol as well as any other ""incitement or encouragement"" of the events, including photos and videos from the individuals’ perspectives. Still, Devon Kearns, a Facebook spokesperson, wrote in an email that last year’s decision to pause political ads had nothing to do with the Newsom recall campaign.  ""If they are unable to run ads relating to recalling Newsom, it is because of the ban on ads about social issues, elections or politics that has now been in place for over two months,"" he wrote.  The ban does not prevent political campaigns from publishing ""organic"" posts, or non-paid content. It means they can’t pay to post advertisements which are boosted by Facebook’s advertising algorithms and shared across the platform, including to those who do not follow the recall campaign. Here’s how Zuckerberg explained his decision to stop running ads last year. ""It's important that campaigns can run get out the vote campaigns, and I generally believe the best antidote to bad speech is more speech, but in the final days of an election there may not be enough time to contest new claims,"" he wrote in a September 2020 Facebook post.  Despite the pause on Facebook ads, the recall campaign maintains a strong presence on the social media platform, including a public group where nearly 21,000 members share information about upcoming recall drives along with news and opinion articles about the governor.  It has another 16,000 followers on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and more than 10,000 followers on Twitter.  In recent months, the recall effort has gained momentum as Newsom’s administration has struggled to control numerous health and economic crises, most recently the slow distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.  More than one-third of California voters, or 36%, support recalling Newsom, while 45% are opposed, according to a UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies survey released this week.  To qualify the recall for a future ballot, the campaign must submit approximately 1.5 million signatures of registered voters to county elections officials by March 17, all of which must be verified. Proponents say they have gathered more than 1.3 million signatures.  Last month, California Democratic Party Chairman Rusty Hicks described the effort to recall Newsom as ""the California coup."" We rated that ridiculous claim Pants on Fire. A coup is a violent overthrow of a government. A recall is a legally sanctioned effort to vote an elected official out of office midway through their term. It’s been part of California’s constitution for more than a century.  Conservatives have expressed distrust in Facebook and other social media companies, alleging they censor or diminish right-wing political speech.  Facebook, Twitter and a host of other companies banned President Donald Trump from their platforms last month after he encouraged his supporters to ""fight like hell"" and to march to the Capitol. Shortly after, a mob of extremists assaulted police officers and breached the building in a riot that left five people dead, including one U.S. Capitol police officer. Our Ruling A conservative blog alleged Facebook tried to ""shut down"" the campaign to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom by refusing to run its advertisements.  That’s not what happened. Facebook stopped accepting political ads regardless of party last fall to slow false information on its platform, though it made an exception by allowing ads to run in the U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia before resuming the ban. It did not single out the recall campaign, which maintains a strong presence on Facebook and has gained momentum in recent months.  The blog misleads with the headline, ""Facebook Says No More Ads for Movement To Recall Gavin Newsom.""

Facebook post misrepresents Pelosi stock trade, Biden policy on electric vehicles
","Implying that Nancy Pelosi used insider information for personal gain, a post widely shared on Facebook claims that the House speaker bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before President Joe Biden signed an executive order for all federal vehicles to be electric. We looked at the substance and implications of the broadside against the California Democrat and found that it paints a misleading picture of the timing and nature of Pelosi’s and Biden’s actions. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post gets several facts wrong. In short:  The purchase — by Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi — was not of stock in Tesla, the California-based maker of electric cars, but of options to buy Tesla stock.  The options were bought more than a month before Biden announced his goal to eventually make the federal fleet electric, not the day before. Biden has not ordered that the entire federal fleet be electric. He has directed federal agencies to move toward buying zero-emission vehicles. And Biden’s intent to steer the government toward zero-emission vehicles was not inside information. It was among his campaign promises and a matter of public record well before he took office. The post shows photos of Pelosi and Biden, along with captions that use abbreviations for executive order and electric vehicles.  The caption to the Pelosi photo is: ""1/24/21 Nancy buys $1.25M in Tesla stock.""  The Biden photo caption says: ""1/25/21 Joe signs EO for all fed vehicles to be EV!"" The headline above the images reads: ""Wow! What are the odds of that? Talk about luck!! What are the odds?"" The poster wrote: ""Wake up, realizing that it’s all about them making money, well (sic) restricting us."" The post misstates the timing of both the securities transaction and the executive order.  Under the Ethics in Government Act, members of Congress must file periodic transaction reports when they buy or sell stock or other securities for any transaction that exceeds $1,000. (The requirement also covers transactions by a lawmaker’s spouse and dependent children.) Only a range of the value of a transaction must be disclosed. The reports must be filed within 30 days of when the member was notified of the transaction, and no later than 45 days after the transaction occurred. Nancy Pelosi filed a report with the House dated Jan. 21 listing her husband’s securities transactions involving Tesla and a few other companies. ""The Speaker has no involvement or prior knowledge of these transactions,"" said her spokesman, Drew Hammill. According to the report, on Dec. 22, Paul Pelosi bought 25 call options of Tesla stock for between $500,001 and $1 million. The options had a strike price of $500 and an expiration date of March 18, 2022.  In other words, Paul Pelosi purchased the right to buy Tesla stock at $500 per share prior to the expiration date. On Dec. 22, Tesla stock was trading at around $650, having climbed from less than $90 at the start of 2020, on a split-adjusted basis. At the time of this writing on Feb. 2, Tesla’s stock was trading at about $878 a share  Nancy Pelosi’s report appears to be in line with what members of Congress are required to disclose. During his run for president, Biden pledged to ""make a major federal commitment to purchase clean vehicles for federal, state, tribal, postal, and local fleets."" So his intent to steer the government toward an electric fleet was a matter of public record, though it didn’t take the form of an executive order until Jan. 27, a week after he took office.  The post we’re checking alludes to an executive order Biden signed Jan. 25. That ""Buy American"" order does not mention any federal government purchases of electric vehicles. But in signing the order, Biden announced that he plans to eventually replace the government’s fleet of cars and trucks with electric vehicles assembled in the United States. He did not state a timeline, or mention any specific manufacturer.  The Jan. 27 order, on climate, included a ""federal clean electricity and vehicle procurement strategy."" It directed ""all available procurement authorities to achieve or facilitate … clean and zero-emission vehicles for Federal, State, local, and Tribal government fleets, including vehicles of the United States Postal Service."" The order specifically calls for ""spurring the creation of union jobs"" in the manufacture of those new vehicles. Tesla’s assembly workers in California are not unionized.  No manufacturer of electric vehicles in the United States complies with the new ""Buy American"" and unionized labor provisions, according to Wired. Replacing the federal fleet with American-produced EVs will be costly and take time, as only a handful of all-electric vehicle models are assembled in the United States, CNBC reported.  An image shared on Facebook claims that Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Biden signed an order ""for all federal vehicles"" to be electric, implying that she sought to profit from inside information about new government policies. The House speaker did report transactions involving Tesla stock, but the post misrepresented the purchases and Biden’s policies to create the false impression that the transactions represented improper insider trading in Tesla shares. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts would give a different impression — our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096A95E40>],/factchecks/2021/feb/02/facebook-posts/facebook-post-misrepresents-pelosi-stock-trade-bid/

No, H&M didn’t advertise a KKK sweatshirt
","In what looks like an online advertisement for the clothes retailer H&M, a boy is smiling with his hands stuffed in the pocket of a white hooded sweatshirt. The shirt reads: ""Koolest Kid in the Klan."" Most of the text is white and black while each of the three Ks is red so that ""KKK"" pops out. The sweatshirt appears to sell for $24.99. But the ad, which is being shared on Facebook, isn’t authentic.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Why are insulin prices going up? Chuck Grassley explains it
","More than 7 million Americans require insulin to treat their diabetes but some people struggle to afford the cost. On Jan. 14, 2021, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tweeted, ""2day Sen Wyden & I released Finance Cmte report on INSULIN costs Prices hv gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices They make $$ as % of ballooning list price so no incentive to lower price on 100 yr old drug."" Grassley has a history of attempting through proposed legislation to lower the cost of the drug, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, worked with him as the ranking minority member on the Senate Finance Committee when Republicans controlled the Senate. Is Grassley right when he tweets about why insulin costs so much? To answer that question, we look, first, at those costs. Insulin costs the people who use it a lot, as we have reported on in the past. Between 2012 and 2016, the drug’s cost nearly doubled, although some prices have declined slightly in the past few years. Goodrx.com, an online company that reports on drug prices as part of a discounting business, reportsthat, in 2020, consumers could buy a generic insulin lispro KwikPen for $60, compared to the name-brand Humalog KwikPen for $140. Insulin remains expensive even when its price drops. Although a Humalog 50/50 vial has decreased slightly in price, one vial still costs an average of $390.23, the Goodrx web listing shows. Depending on the pharmacy and any savings found online, customers could end up paying more or less than that average.  David Tridgell, a Minneapolis endocrinologist who has had Type 1 diabetes since he was 15, wrote in The Washington Post in 2017 that patients with Type 1 diabetes tend to use two or three vials of insulin per month. At the current cost of one vial of Humalog 50/50, these patients would spend $780 to $1,170 on their insulin every month. Type 2 Diabetes patients can require even more insulin per month, sometimes requiring six or more vials, Tridgell wrote. This would add up to $2,341 or more every month. Grassley claims that the increase is tied to the business practices of manufacturers, health plans and PBMs, or pharmacy benefit managers. An April 10, 2019, House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing titled, ""Priced Out of a Lifesaving Drug: Getting Answers on the Rising Cost of Insulin,"" featured testimony from CVS Health, Express Scripts, OptumRx, Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi. They couldn’t lower the prices of insulin, the company representatives claimed, because of how PBMs and health insurance companies operate. PBMs serve as a liaison between drug companies and health insurance companies, negotiating what insurance companies, pharmacies and patients pay for a drug. PBMs and insurance companies help to determine on which tier of the formulary the drug will be placed. They can negotiate rebates, discounts, and other services. These rebates and other benefits are passed on to the health plans. Medicare, the government funded insurance program for seniors, is barred from participating in these negotiations.  A study published by the American Diabetes Association in 2018 showed that these negotiations encourage high list prices. As these list prices increase, ""profits of the intermediaries in the insulin supply chain, such as wholesalers, PBMs and pharmacies, increase because each may receive a rebate, discount or fee calculated as a percentage of the list price.""  The study also reported that, because transparency is lacking within the insulin supply chain, ""it is unclear precisely how the dollars flow and how much each intermediary profits."" Some insulin producers blame insulin’s prices on the cost of innovation. However, Mayo Clinic hematologist S. Vincent Rajkumar dismissed this claim in a paper published by Mayo Clinic in January 2020. Rajkumar wrote that limited innovation exists when it comes to insulin, and that what matters more is affordability. This sentiment was echoed in the April 2019 House hearing when Rep. Mckinley (R-West Virginia) said, ""Innovation is supposed to drive prices down, not up."" The bipartisan United States Senate Finance Committee staff report, ""Insulin: Examining the Factors Driving the Rising Cost of a Century Old Drug,"" that was released Jan. 14, 2021, stated, ""Eli Lilly reported spending $395 million on R&D costs for Humalog, Humulin, and Basaglar between 2014 and 2018, during which time the company spent nearly $1.5 billion on sales and marketing expenses for its insulins.""  The report also cited instances of 100-year-old drugs still going up in price. Every time a pharmacy dispenses therapeutic insulin, manufacturers pay PBMs administrative fees as high as 5 percent of the drug’s wholesale acquisition cost, the Senate staff report states. ""These fees are a significant revenue stream for PBMs and likely act as a countervailing force against lower list prices—PBMs may be reluctant to push for lower WAC prices since it would reduce their administrative fee-based revenue,"" the report stated. Grassley said that insulin prices have dramatically increased because of manufacturer, health plan, and pharmacy benefit manager practices. He’s right. Innovations alone aren’t enough to justify the extreme increases in price that have raised insulin costs over the years. PBMs, with their complicated discount negotiations; and manufacturers, with their continuing drive to increase earnings, both play a role. So do drug stores, pharmacies, and other suppliers who want to be competitive in the marketplace by offering consumers discounts. But the discounts don’t go to everyone with diabetes, and when they do, they vary from vendor to vendor. Multiple studies in recent years, testimony in public hearings, the drug’s pricing history, and sourcing in federal government reports show examples of complicated procedures related in large part to negotiated discounts for some vendors adding to overall insulin costs. We rate Grassley’s statement True.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the acronym PBM stood for pharmacy business manager; it is pharmacy benefit manager.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F69C00>],/factchecks/2021/feb/02/chuck-grassley/why-are-insulin-prices-going-chuck-grassley-explai/
"['Economy', 'Families', 'Jobs', 'States', 'Wisconsin', 'Tony Evers']","
Evers right that unemployment benefits harder to access, but multiple factors involved in delays.
","Wisconsin has faced a host of issues with unemployment payments during the coronavirus pandemic.  First, the outdated system for managing claims was overwhelmed, creating a backlog that persisted for most of 2020. The Department of Workforce Development also saw an influx of calls about unclear questions, mistakes on applications and general confusion about unemployment benefits, of which only a small percentage were answered.  Some people have waited nearly a year for their benefits to arrive, living on the edge of losing homes, cars and the ability to feed families.  Gov. Tony Evers has faced backlash over how his administration has handled the issue. He, in turn, has said the GOP-controlled Legislature carries much of the blame. Here is how Evers phrased it Jan. 12, 2021 during his annual State of the State address:  ""The fact of the matter is that previous administrations and more than a decades’ worth of legislators have known this system was outdated and couldn’t handle an economic crisis like the one this pandemic presented, and they never took the time to fix it. And to make matters worse, the Legislature spent the last decade passing laws deliberately making it even harder for people to access these critical supports when they need it most, exacerbating the problems with our already-outdated system.""  That’s a lot. For this fact check, we are focusing on the end of the claim. Did actions by the Legislature -- which the GOP has held outright since 2010 -- deliberately make it harder to get benefits and exacerbate problems? When asked for backup, Britt Cudabeck, deputy communications director for Evers, cited a series of laws passed since 2011 related to unemployment. Many were outlined in a May 26, 2020 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  Here’s a look at some of the laws:  In 2011, the Legislature passed a law creating a one-week waiting period before anyone who lost a job could claim benefits. Then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, signed the measure. Evers and Republican lawmakers agreed to suspend the waiting period, but the law is expected to go back into effect in the coming months.  In 2012, Republicans approved a law that prevented claimants from receiving benefits if they didn’t search for work, worked more than 32 hours in a week or got more than $500 in sick pay, holiday pay, vacation pay or termination pay.  In 2013, among other changes, Republicans expanded the work search requirement and established more instances in which benefits could be cut off for ""misconduct,"" which previously had to be decided on a case-by-case basis. In 2015, they passed a law requiring people seeking unemployment benefits to take a drug test, but that measure has not yet been implemented because the federal government did not sign off on the measure until 2019. During the same year, Republicans increased the number of situations in which someone can be denied benefits for refusing a job offer.  Most recently, in 2018, just before Evers took office, Republican lawmakers approved lame-duck laws that limited the governor’s power in many ways, including by restricting the ability of the administration to waive many criteria for receiving benefits.  A 2017 study by the National Employment Law Project found that Wisconsin had one of the steepest increases in unemployment denials between 2012 and 2016, the time in which most of the above measures were passed. The denial rate for those five years was 10%, up from 1% from 2007 to 2011.  So, there is no question Republicans passed a series of changes that made receiving unemployment benefits more difficult. That said, there are other elements to the claim. Part of Evers’ claim was the GOP-backed changes were ""exacerbating the problems with our already-outdated system.""  Adam Gibbs, communications director for Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said the intent of the bills was to help close a deficit. Meanwhile, Adam King, director of social media for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said in an email that the changes in state law were ""consistent with many other states and federal guidance"" and that the changes have not been the cause of slower benefit payments. Neither directly addressed whether the changes in the law made the problems being experienced today worse. The Evers administration has said the outdated unemployment computer system, which is nearly 50 years old, is hard to program, causes delays and makes applying for unemployment hard for Wisconsinites.  Yet, after the backlog developed, amid a public outcry, Evers replaced the head of the department and under new leadership (and a partnership with Google Cloud), the backlog of claims has nearly disappeared.   So, the backlog was cleared using the same system, which undermines Evers’ point. Evers claimed the Legislature has made it harder for people to access unemployment insurance over the last decade. The changes made to the unemployment system by Republicans over the past decade is well documented. And the changes have been grafted into an outdated computer system. But those changes are not entirely to blame for the problems getting the system functioning smoothly today. We rate this claim Half True.

Elaine Marshall has won more statewide races than anyone alive in North Carolina
","Former North Carolina agriculture commissioner candidate Jenna Wadsworth says Secretary of State Elaine Marshall has an unparalleled political record. ""Sec. Marshall has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive in NC at this point or is damn close,"" Wadsworth tweeted. Wadsworth tweeted the claim as part of a message urging Democrats to consider the strength of female candidates before moving ahead with another white male nominee for U.S. Senate. The current seat holder, Republican Richard Burr, says he won’t seek reelection in 2022. The same day as her tweet, state Sen. Jeff Jackson announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate. We wondered: Is it true that Secretary of State Elaine Marshall has won more statewide races in North Carolina than anyone alive? Wadsworth said she was thinking of not only general elections but also primaries when she tweeted her claim about Marshall.  However, we’ll focus on general elections for a couple reasons. For one, in North Carolina, primaries aren’t open to every voter. We also found it difficult to find official primary records dating back several decades.  So we scrolled through internet archives, reached out to the state’s political parties and consulted UNC School of Government Librarian Alex Hess. It appears Wadsworth is right. The ""statewide"" part means we’re only looking at U.S. senators, governors, Council of State members, and judges. And the ""alive"" part is key.  If you consider all candidates living or dead, Marshall does not hold the record for winning the most statewide elections in North Carolina. That record likely belongs to the late Thad Eure, who was elected secretary of state 13 times and served for 53 years. The late former agriculture commissioner Jim Graham, who won nine times, appears to have won the second-most statewide races. Marshall, 75, has been elected secretary of state seven times dating back to 1996. She ran for U.S. Senate twice, losing the Democratic primary in 2002, and then winning a primary runoff in 2010 but losing to Burr in the general election. When it comes to statewide races won, Marshall’s closest competitor appears to be Gov. Roy Cooper. Cooper has won six statewide races dating back to 2000. Before winning gubernatorial races in 2020 and 2016, voters elected Cooper attorney general four times. If we consider primaries, Marshall appears to be tied for winning the most races for statewide office.  When we include the three primaries Marshall has won, her tally comes to 10 victories for statewide election. When Cooper’s four primaries are counted, he also lands at 10 statewide wins. Former Gov. Jim Hunt has also won 10, if you count each of the primaries he won prior to winning four terms as governor and one as lieutenant governor.  Before Hunt’s tenure, governors could only serve one term and were not allowed to run for reelection.  Incumbency has served top North Carolinians well through the years. Here’s a brief rundown of notable current and former politicians who have won multiple statewide races. U.S. Senators: The late Jesse Helms was elected to Senate five times and served for 40 years. Burr won three terms and Thom Tillis has won two terms in the U.S. Senate. Prior to running for Senate, neither ran a statewide race.  Other recent senators -- Kay Hagan, Elizabeth Dole, John Edwards, Lauch Faircloth -- each one a single term. Governors: Of North Carolina’s other living former governors, Mike Easley won the most statewide races. He won two terms for governor and two for attorney general. Former Gov. Jim Martin won two terms, while Pat McCrory and Bev Perdue each served a single term. Perdue, for her part, also won two terms as lieutenant governor. Council of State: Several commissioners and Council of State members have won five or more statewide races.  The late Jim Long won six terms as insurance commissioner. Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler has won five terms in a row dating back to 2004. Cherie Berry won five terms as labor commissioner before retiring in 2020. Rufus Edmisten won three races for attorney general and two for secretary of state. Judges: North Carolina judges are unlikely to ever reach Eure’s record — or even Marshall’s mark — because they serve eight-year terms and are legally blocked from working full-time beyond age 72. Linda McGee last month retired as the longest serving Court of Appeals judge in state history, winning three races after being appointed in 1995. Wadsworth said Marshall ""has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive in NC at this point."" It appears she’s right.

Joe Biden wrongly claims Trump could’ve prevented every COVID-19 death
","Speaking about the coronavirus during a CNN town hall less than two months away from Election Day, former Vice President Joe Biden said every one of the nearly 200,000 COVID-19 deaths recorded in the U.S. can be laid at President Donald Trump’s feet. ""If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive,"" Biden said at the CNN town hall in Moosic, Pa. ""All the people. I'm not making this up. Just look at the data. Look at the data."" The Democratic presidential nominee’s remark came as Trump faces criticism for downplaying the threat of the coronavirus early on and admitting on tape that he did so. The U.S. leads the world in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, and experts say a fall surge in cases could put fatalities at more than double their current number by the year’s end. A more robust handling of the pandemic would likely have seen the country’s death count significantly reduced, experts said. But Biden’s claim that a different response from Trump would have prevented every coronavirus death goes too far. ""I think it’s impossible to say every life could have been saved,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. Keeping COVID-19 at zero deaths would have been a difficult achievement ""regardless of who is in charge,"" said Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University.  ""If we had developed testing capacity as soon as we knew of the pathogen, and could rapidly test every one arriving from abroad, then I suppose it’s theoretically possible, but unlikely,"" Nichols said. Even countries that have found relative success managing the coronavirus — such as South Korea and New Zealand — have seen some deaths.  Experts said that faster, more robust measures taken by the federal government could have put the U.S. on par with those countries and others that responded similarly.  The right actions in January, February and March would likely have prevented ""a substantial number"" of deaths, Adalja said, and could have put the U.S. on ""a trajectory more like Taiwan,"" which has recorded just 503 confirmed cases and seven deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Those actions might have included a national coordinated strategy across state lines, rapidly scaled up testing, the ramped up production and mobilization of resources, and more clear communications of what was known about the virus and how to prevent it, experts said. ""Obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told CNN in April. ""Obviously, no one is going to deny that."" RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic One May study from Columbia University estimated that the U.S. could have averted roughly 36,000 COVID-19 deaths before May if sweeping mitigation measures imposed on March 15 had instead gone into effect a week earlier.  Almost 54,000 deaths would have been avoided in that timeframe had the same interventions started two weeks earlier, the study said. ""Had we mustered the political and public will to act as we did two weeks earlier, 90% of deaths through the beginning of May would have been averted,"" said study author Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences.  But the study ""doesn’t blame Trump,"" Shaman said, although he added that ""the country has witnessed a complete lack of federal leadership."" Other experts have also made estimates. A pair of epidemiologists wrote in an April op-ed for the New York Times that ""an estimated 90% of deaths"" from the first wave of U.S. cases ""might have been prevented by putting social distancing policies into effect two weeks earlier.""  Op-ed co-author Nicholas Jewell, a professor of biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said it would be ""magical thinking"" to suggest 100% of COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented. ""I haven’t seen any country really succeed to that extent,"" Jewell said. In a June op-ed for Stat, researchers compared the U.S. response to similar nations. Accounting for differences in population and the different timings of the outbreaks in each country, they concluded that the U.S. could have prevented many deaths.  If, for example, the U.S. ""had acted as effectively as Germany, 70% of U.S. coronavirus deaths might have been prevented"" in the four months after the U.S. recorded its first 15 cases of the coronavirus, the researchers wrote. More lives would have been saved had the U.S. mirrored the responses of other countries such as South Korea, they said. The picture hasn’t been much rosier of late. ""If you look at May and June 1, since then, we’ve done dreadfully in the U.S.,"" Jewell said. Still, Biden’s claim that ""all the people would still be alive"" had Trump responded differently is an overstatement. ""I don’t see how there is any truth to that,"" Nichols said. The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Biden said, ""If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. All the people. I'm not making this up. Just look at the data."" Experts disagreed with that assessment. A stronger U.S. response could have saved many lives, experts said, but not every one.

Post misleads about COVID-19 using tuberculosis data
","The World Health Organization has published a global tuberculosis report every year since 1997. But in 2020, the global TB report isn’t just being used for educational purposes; it’s also being used to mislead social media users about the severity of COVID-19. One Facebook post employs accurate global tuberculosis numbers in an attempt to play down the need for coronavirus safety precautions like mask wearing. ""Almost 4500 people lose their lives to tuberculosis EVERY SINGLE DAY. 30,000 people fall ill with tuberculosis EVERY SINGLE DAY. Last year alone, 10 million fell ill from TB and 1.5 million died,"" the post reads, pointing to the World Health Organization as a source. ""Why don’t we wear masks for TB? Because CNN hasn’t instructed you to."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Are the numbers right? Yes, for the most part. But the post’s conclusions are misleading. TB isn’t prevalent in the United States, but in countries where it is prevalent, mask wearing actually is recommended.  The post correctly references data provided on the World Health Organization’s tuberculosis webpage for some of its facts. ""Every year, 10 million people fall ill with tuberculosis (TB). Despite being a preventable and curable disease, 1.5 million people die from TB each year – making it the world’s top infectious killer,"" the website reads, providing the same numbers as the post.  As for the number of people who die each day of TB, the post again pulls numbers directly from the WHO.  ""Each day, nearly 4500 people lose their lives to TB and close to 30,000 people fall ill with this preventable and curable disease,"" reads a WHO press release about World Tuberculosis Day 2019.  However, the post misleads when it suggests that people don’t wear masks to prevent the spread of tuberculosis. They do. Tuberculosis and COVID-19 ""are both infectious diseases that attack primarily the lungs,"" reads a WHO site that examines the two diseases. Both the coronavirus and TB bacteria can spread through the air from one person to another, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It’s possible the coronavirus can also be spread by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth or nose. The CDC explains on its website that we are still learning about how the virus spreads. The WHO guidelines on preventing and controlling TB infections recommend wearing masks as a type of respiratory hygiene measure that can help prevent the spread of the disease. But because TB is less prominent in the U.S. and TB has been around far longer, the suggestion has not been given much media attention.  The Union, an international organization that aims to help countries develop, implement and assess ""anti-tuberculosis, lung health and non-communicable disease programmes,"" created a frequently asked questions document about COVID-19 and TB.  In response to the question, ""Should I wear a mask?"" the document says: ""Wearing a mask presents a barrier for the spread of both TB and COVID-19 as masks stop them from being distributed into the air if being worn by someone who has symptoms or being inhaled by or touched by others in the immediate environment."" If the diseases’ transmission is similar and masks help slow the spread, why has the response to COVID-19 in the U.S. looked so different from the response to TB each year? Because COVID-19 is much more prevalent in the U.S. than tuberculosis. The WHO reports that most of the people who contract TB live in ""low- and middle-income countries,"" and about half of all people with the disease can be found in the following eight countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines and South Africa. Since Jan. 21, 2020, the CDC has reported more than 6.6 million total cases of COVID-19. The last daily update increased the total by 41,464 cases — meaning that in one day, the U.S. alone reported more COVID-19 cases than the average global increase of TB cases (close to 30,000) each day. According to the CDC’s most recent available data, there were 9,025 cases of TB in the U.S. in 2018 and 9,088 in 2017. Provisional data for 2019 suggests there were 8,920 TB cases last year. With fewer than 10,000 cases of TB in the U.S. in every year since 2012, TB is not the same as COVID-19, in terms of its threat to Americans. What’s more, there’s a vaccine to protect against TB that the CDC website says is not widely used in the U.S., but is ""often given to infants and small children in other countries where TB is common."" A vaccine for COVID-19 does not exist yet. The CDC, WHO, doctors and public health officials all across the country now urge people to wear masks while the coronavirus pandemic continues. The spread of COVID-19 remains a large, ongoing problem in the U.S. This has resulted in American news organizations emphasizing experts’ calls for people to wear masks and reporting on mask mandates. (Examples of this seen here, here and here).  Nearly 200,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. The most recent CDC data indicates that in 2017, 515 people died of TB. COVID-19 has not existed for a full year, but even comparing current numbers to yearly totals of TB cases and deaths, it is clear that COVID-19 is a more serious threat to Americans. A Facebook post claims, ""Last year alone, 10 million fell ill from TB and 1.5 million died. … Why don’t we wear masks for TB? Because CNN hasn’t instructed you to."" The numbers in the claim are based on global data from the WHO. However, the post leaves out important context when it fails to mention that COVID-19 is far more prevalent in the U.S. than TB. As a result, experts recommend wearing masks to slow the spread of COVID-19. Mask wearing is also recommended to prevent the spread of TB in places where it is common.

","A TV ad attacking U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., uses images, a narrator’s voice and words on the screen to invoke the coronavirus pandemic. Then it shows Garcia saying: ""Everyone should have to figure out how to fend for themselves."" Garcia’s remark was about food stamps, and it was made half a year before the outbreak hit California, though he has expressed opposition generally to federal safety nets. The ad is from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House. Democrat Christy Smith, a California assemblywoman elected in 2018, is running against Garcia on Nov. 3 for the 25th District congressional seat, north of Los Angeles.  The race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It is rated a tossup by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Garcia, a former military pilot, defeated Smith in a special election for the seat in May. That election was held to replace Democrat Katie Hill after she resigned. The committee’s 30-second spot opens with the narrator saying: ""Thousands of Californians dead."" What appears to be a headline pops on the screen and says: ""Los Angeles Death Toll is High."" Those words are from an Aug. 22 news story about COVID-19. The narrator continues: ""Schools and businesses closed. How do we help people in need?"" A woman and child are shown wearing disposable face masks commonly worn to protect against the virus.  Then the narrator says: ""Well, according to millionaire Congressman Mike Garcia ..."" — at that point, Garcia is shown in a video clip saying: ""Everyone should have to figure out how to fend for themselves."" Small print on the screen indicates Garcia’s comment is from an interview he did on ""The Talk of Santa Clarita"" podcast in August 2019, months before COVID-19 struck California.  The ad then attacks Garcia claiming he supported tax breaks for millionaires while working families got higher taxes. It closes returning to its original theme, with the narrator saying: ""Millionaire Mike Garcia — leaving us to fend for ourselves.""  Here was the exchange with host Stephen Daniels in which Garcia made the remark used in the ad: Host: ""Should there be a social safety net? Do you believe in that?""  Garcia: ""I believe in Social Security, for sure."" Host: ""What about food stamps?"" Garcia: ""Food stamps at a low level I think is — as a purist, I would say no, everyone should have to figure out how to fend for themselves.""  He added: ""I do understand that people will get on hard times. Here’s where I land on all the programs: There should be safety nets, but I don’t want the federal government to be the safety net. I want the churches, I want the local community nonprofits, I want our neighbors to be the safety nets."" One of the rotating headlines on the homepage of Garcia’s campaign website says: ""I believe in the Constitution, Capitalism, Competition and Charity."" Garcia has expressed support for providing federal aid to small businesses and their workers affected by COVID-19.  Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Cole Leiter told PolitiFact that ""Garcia was crystal clear when he was asked whether he supported the social safety net."" Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps ""are the very same social safety net programs that have proved essential to families in California who have been severely impacted by the economic fallout from the pandemic.""  Garcia’s campaign did not reply to our requests for information. An ad using strong imagery on COVID-19 said Garcia said: ""Everyone should have to figure out how to fend for themselves."" Garcia made the remark about food stamps and other government programs, though the ad gives no indication of that, and that was months before the outbreak. Garcia has expressed opposition to federal safety net programs generally, saying he prefers private sector assistance. We rate the statement Mostly False.

No, AARP isn’t sending money to the Democratic Party
","You already know the AARP lobbies for the interests of Americans over age 50. But does it also send money to the Democratic Party? That’s what a popular (and previously debunked) Facebook post claims:  ""Are you aware that a portion of everything you pay A.A.R.P Goes directly to the Democratic Party,"" a Facebook post asks. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post’s claim is untrue. AARP as an organization does not support the Democratic Party, and the claim has been debunked by fact-checkers before.  An AARP spokesperson, Jason Young, confirmed that AARP is strictly nonpartisan.  Young said AARP is a tax-exempt social welfare organization in good standing with the IRS, and pointed PolitiFact to the IRS’ description of social welfare organizations.  On its website, the IRS says that a tax-exempt social welfare organization is ""an organization must not be organized for profit and must be operated exclusively to promote social welfare."" The website further explains: ""The promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office."" Chief operating officer Scott Frisch signed AARP’s most recent tax filing, confirming that ""AARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization empowering people to choose how they live as they age."" AARP has a policy ""against endorsing — or giving the appearance of endorsing — political parties, government officials or candidates for office,"" Young said. (The full policy can be found here.)  He also said much of AARP’s leadership doesn’t donate to political candidates or campaigns.  ""Most of our board doesn’t give to candidates or campaigns,"" Young said. ""Our CEO doesn’t give to candidates or campaigns. And most of our executive team does not give. Rank-and-file employees have the right to give, of course, but they don’t direct the organization or its policies.""  PolitiFact used Federal Election Commission data to confirm that the majority of AARP board members and the majority of AARP executive team members haven’t made recent political campaign contributions. Individual donors associated with AARP have donated primarily to Democratic candidates in most election cycles including 2016, 2018 and 2020, according to an Open Secrets campaign contribution database.  But when surveyed, about a third of AARP members report that their political leanings are conservative, a third report their leanings are liberal and a third consider themselves independent or in between, according to Young.  So what does AARP do with the money it receives from donations or from its $16 per year membership fee? The AARP lobbies for policies such as protecting Medicare, fighting high drug prices, protecting Social Security, combating fraud targeted at older people and addressing senior poverty.  A Facebook post asks, ""Are you aware that a portion of everything you pay A.A.R.P Goes directly to the Democratic Party.""  AARP is a tax-exempt social welfare nonprofit that is not permitted to participate in political campaigns. People who work for AARP can make individual political contributions, but those donations do not come from the organization as a whole.

Facebook post conflates Epstein’s suicide and recent deaths
","Conspiracy theories about the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and sex offender who officials say killed himself in jail, have spilled into into the world he orbited.  ""Epstein dies while in custody, his private banker is found dead, a judge had a trial regarding Epstein and the Deutsche Bank,"" reads a recent Facebook post. ""Her son has been killed now and her husband has been shot. The shooter who shot the son and shot the judge’s husband has now also been found dead. Why is this not news?!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Epstein’s ""private banker"" who was found dead seems to be a reference to Thomas Bowers, who committed suicide in November 2019, according to the Los Angeles County medical examiner.   Bowers was a former Deutsche Bank executive who ""reportedly signed off on some of the institution’s unorthodox loans to Donald Trump,"" Los Angeles Magazine reported. Bowers was once the head of the bank’s American wealth-management division, where he oversaw Trump’s private banker. The article doesn’t mention Epstein.  But Epstein, a financier, has close ties to Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank recently agreed to pay a $150 million fine for its dealings with Epstein, the New York Times reported in a July article titled: ""These are the Deutsche Bank executives responsible for serving Jeffrey Epstein."" The bank itself hasn’t publicly identified the individuals who worked with Epstein but based on descriptions of the employees in a consent order with the New York Department of Financial Services, and interviews with current and former bank officials, the Times identified nearly everyone in the legal document, according to the story.  Paul Morris, who had previously helped Epstein manage an account at JPMorgan, brought Epstein to Deutsche Bank, the Times reported. Because Morris needed approval for a client who carried a reputational risk — Epstein had been convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from a minor — he sent a memo to Charles Packard, then the head of the bank’s American wealth-management division that detailed Epstein’s past.  Other bank officials are mentioned in the article but not Bowers.  We found no credible sources corroborating the Facebook post’s claim that Bowers was Epstein’s ""private banker.""  Deutsche Bank also connects Epstein to Judge Esther Salas, a federal judge whose son was killed and her husband injured in a shooting at their New Jersey home in July.  Salas has presided over a class action lawsuit brought against the bank by investors who claim it made false and misleading statements about its anti-money laundering policies, according to the Associated Press, and because it failed to monitor ""high-risk"" customers like Epstein. The lawyer suspected in the shooting at Salas’ home was Roy Den Hollander, a self-described ""anti-feminist"" who had compiled a dossier on her and her family and arrived at their home that morning carrying a FedEx package.  ""He was apparently angry at Judge Salas for not moving quickly enough on a lawsuit he had brought challenging the constitutionality of the male-only draft,"" according to the Times.  Days before the shooting at Salas’ residence, Hollander had traveled to San Bernardino County, Calif., where authorities say he shot and killed a rival men’s rights lawyer at his home.

Joe Biden wrong about Donald Trump holding Bible upside-down
","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden had many criticisms of President Donald Trump during a CNN town hall near Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pa. One of them revived an attack shared on social media earlier in the summer. Biden referenced Trump’s walk from the White House to the historic St. John’s Church on Lafayette Square. It came on June 1, when downtown Washington, D.C., was full of protesters following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police days earlier.  Critics mostly blasted Trump for using tear gas to clear nonviolent protesters just before his walk to the church for a photo-op. But some on social media took aim at how Trump held the Bible. For instance, novelist Stephen King tweeted, ""Dear fundamentalist Christian Trump supporters: If Obama had held the Bible backwards and upside down, you would immediately have called him the Antichrist."" The tweet attracted more than 164,000 likes. Dear fundamentalist Christian Trump supporters: If Obama had held the Bible backwards and upside down, you would immediately have called him the Antichrist.   At the CNN town hall, Biden said that forces physically moved people out of Trump’s way ""so he can walk across to a Protestant church and hold a Bible upside down."" Biden has made the claim about the upside-down Bible before, even though fact-checkers had debunked it. The claim has also appeared in various news accounts about the church photo-op and social media posts. Trump himself has previously denied that he held the Bible upside down.  A @FoxNews commentator just ripped me with lies, with nobody defending. They talked about the “friendly” protesters (they set the Church on fire the day before. They were anything but friendly), and how I stood and held the Bible upside down - it wasn’t upside down. @edhenry   What does the evidence show? We scrutinized a series of images from the Associated Press as well as raw video from NBC News, and the truth is clear: Trump held the Bible right-side up. The Bible he held up had no writing on the front cover, so to viewers who couldn’t see the spine, it may have looked like he was holding it upside down and backwards. But here are several AP images that clearly show the spine right-side up.     In the following images, perhaps the most iconic ones taken of the event, it is a little harder to read the spine, but the free end of the ribbon bookmark clearly dangles below the Bible, which is how it was when the Bible was oriented correctly in the other images.   We also reviewed the video of the event and confirmed that Trump consistently held the Bible right-side up. In fact, at several points he appears to look down on it to make sure that he’s holding it correctly. The Biden campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Biden said that after Trump walked across Lafayette Square to a church, he held a Bible upside down. This false claim spread on social media earlier this summer, without evidence, and made it into several news reports and opinion pieces.  But fact-checkers debunked it as early as June, and a review of still images and video from that day show clearly that it is inaccurate.

YouTube video takes Bill Gates out of context on coronavirus vaccinations
","According to the internet, Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates thinks you don’t have a choice about being vaccinated. A YouTube video even shows him saying so in his very own words. Here’s why you shouldn’t believe this claim: The video, titled ""Bill Gates says you don't have a choice to be vaccinated or not,"" takes Gates’ comments during an interview with the Financial Times out of context by eliminating the question he was answering and the first part of his response.  ""You don’t have a choice,"" Gates says in the clip, which has been viewed almost 100,000 times. ""People act like you have a choice. People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected. You know, it's not the government who's saying OK, just ignore this disease, and people are deeply affected by seeing these deaths, by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain, and old people, their parents, their grandparents could be affected by this. And so you don't get to say, ignore what's going on here. There will be the ability, particularly in rich countries, to open up if things are done well over the next few months. But for the world at large, normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.""  The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That's because the video ignores the fact that Gates was responding to a question about how he would weigh the economic costs of lockdown with the public health risks of reopening businesses during the early months of the pandemic.  Here’s a transcript of the relevant passage from the Financial Times interview, complete with the question that Gates was answering when he made his ""you won’t have a choice"" comment.  Interviewer: ""And what about that trade-off? You just mentioned, obviously, the economic pain. What do you think the right balance is between the trade-off of protecting people's lives and the economic hit? Do you see a situation where the global economy could be virtually at a standstill for a year or even more?""  Gates: ""Well, it won't go to zero, but it will shrink. Global GDP is going to take probably the biggest hit ever. Maybe the Depression was worse or 1873, I don't know. But in my lifetime this will be the greatest economic hit. But you don't have a choice. People act like you have a choice. People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected. You know, it's not the government who's saying OK, just ignore this disease, and people are deeply affected by seeing these deaths, by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain, and old people, their parents, their grandparents could be affected by this. And so you don't get to say, ignore what's going on here. There will be the ability, particularly in rich countries, to open up if things are done well over the next few months. But for the world at large, normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population. And so although there's a lot of work on testing, a lot of work on drugs that we’re involved with, trying to achieve that ambitious goal, which has never been done for the vaccine, that rises to the top of the list."" In context, Gates is saying that governments won’t be able to avoid taking an economic hit from the pandemic, because he believes that people won’t want to frequent businesses when there’s a chance that they’ll become ""part of the transmission chain.""  Gates does say that he believes that normalcy will only return after the entire global population is vaccinated from the coronavirus. But at no point does he say that people ""won’t have a choice"" about whether or not they’ll be vaccinated.  We reached out to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, asking whether Gates believes that coronavirus vaccinations should be mandatory. In reply, spokespeople from the foundation wrote that ""national governments will make the ultimate decision about how vaccines will be distributed in their own borders."" We should note that Gates has become a frequent target for disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Conspiracy theorists have falsely claimed he is planning to use coronavirus vaccines to implant tracking devices in people, that he and Dr. Anthony Fauci are colluding to ruin the economy, and that he stands to reap enormous profits from the virus.   A YouTube video appears to show Bill Gates saying that people ""don’t have a choice"" about whether they’ll receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The video takes Gates out of context. He was actually saying that governments won’t be able to escape the economic impacts of the pandemic, even if they decide to reopen businesses before a vaccine is available.  We rate this video False. ​",[<zip object at 0x00000280975AD600>],/factchecks/2020/sep/18/youtube-videos/youtube-video-takes-bill-gates-out-context-coronav/

No, Netflix’s CEO wasn’t charged with 15 counts of child pornography.
","If you’ve been binge-watching Netflix shows to get through the lows of the coronavirus pandemic, you might have been shocked to see online claims about the alleged criminal behavior of the company’s CEO. ""Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography and 31,000 files have been found on his personal computers for child porn from ages 8 and as young as toddlers,"" reads the text of a post that has been copied numerous times on different social media platforms. ""So, I think the investigation was needed. #SaveOurChildren."" The text often accompanies a link to a story titled: ""Sen. Ted Cruz calls for a criminal investigation into Netflix film 'Cuties.'""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Netflix’s CEO has not been charged with these crimes. The claims have been debunked several times, but some social media users continue to spread the misinformation.  First, the claim incorrectly identifies Netflix’s CEO. Reed Hastings is the CEO and co-founder of Netflix. PolitiFact searched news archives and found no evidence that Hastings had been charged with any crime. It’s not clear where the name ‘Kim Martin Morrow’ originated; our searches find it solely used with these inaccurate claims. Not one of Netflix’s eight senior officers or 12 directors is named Kim Martin Morrow. So why are social media users falsely linking a fake Netflix CEO to child pornography charges? That’s a bit complicated. The child pornography claims come after Netflix’s release of the French film ‘Cuties’ was met with criticism from subscribers and other internet users.  Many say the film inappropriately sexualizes girls as young as 11, leading internet users to call for subscribers to #CancelNetflix. Netflix has defended the film.  ""‘Cuties’ is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children,"" a spokesperson said in a statement to Variety. ""It’s an award-winning film and a powerful story about the pressure young girls face on social media and from society more generally growing up — and we’d encourage anyone who cares about these important issues to watch the movie."" Film director Maïmouna Doucouré, who won a directing award at Sundance for ‘Cuties,’ maintains that her film criticizes, rather than promotes, hypsersexualization of children.  ""I’m eager to see their reaction when they realize that we’re both on the same side of this fight against young children’s hypersexualization,"" Doucouré said of critics during an interview.  The Instagram post we’re checking also uses the ""SaveOurChildren"" hashtag, which is linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. QAnon followers promote the belief that President Donald Trump is working covertly to bring down a child trafficking ring organized by popular celebrities and prominent Democrats. The FBI considers QAnon a potential domestic terrorism threat. But airing a controversial film is not a crime, and Netflix’s CEO hasn’t been charged with any, as the post claims. Social media posts claim, ""Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography."" Netflix’s CEO is Reed Hastings, and he has not been charged with any crime. The claims appear to be the result of backlash over a Netflix film that many say hypersexualizes young children.

Gardner’s bill has as much to do with politics as preexisting conditions
","Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican running in a tight race for reelection in Colorado, says he wants to protect people with medical conditions. In a mid-September tweet released by his campaign, he promoted legislation he introduced in August that he says will do just that. ""People like my mother who battle chronic diseases are heroes,"" read the tweet. ""I authored the bill to guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions — no matter what happens to Obamacare — because some things matter more than politics."" Gardner has voted repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the first federal law to guarantee people with health problems that they could buy insurance when shopping for their own coverage — at the same cost as for healthier consumers. Polls show broad public support for keeping the ACA’s preexisting condition protections, while also indicating a consistent, if narrow, majority favoring the overall law. The popularity of those protections has led Gardner, as well as other GOP candidates facing tough challengers, to swear their allegiance to protecting people with medical conditions, despite their records. In previous fact checks, we found Sen. Martha McSally’s promise always to protect preexisting conditions to be False. President Donald Trump also has made related statements, which have ranged from False to Pants on Fire. That got us thinking: Would Gardner’s legislation, dubbed ""The Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act,"" actually guarantee these protections if the ACA didn’t exist? We decided to investigate. The bill, which was introduced in August, still has no co-sponsors. It’s very short, only 117 words in total. The main section is a single very long sentence: ""A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion with respect to such plan or coverage, factor health status into premiums or charges, exclude benefits relating to pre-existing conditions from coverage, or otherwise exclude benefits, set limits, or increase charges based on any pre-existing condition or health status."" We reached out to the Gardner campaign to ask for more information. A campaign spokesperson reiterated in an email that Gardner’s goal is ""to guarantee coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions and ensure they cannot be charged more as a result of their underlying medical conditions."" Thomas Miller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., quipped that the main goal might be something else entirely. ""It’s probably about 100 words too long,"" Miller said. ""It could have said, ‘I’m running for election. I’ll do whatever is necessary.’"" Proponents of the ACA emphasized that the law would help people with medical conditions as they worked to get it passed by Congress, which happened in 2010 following a yearlong failed effort by Democrats to win Republican support. Among a host of other provisions, the law bars insurers from rejecting applicants with medical conditions, as they routinely did when considering individual applicants before the law passed. Nor can insurers charge the sick more than the healthy. Since the law went into effect in 2014, it has faced many efforts by Republicans in Congress, including Gardner, to repeal it. It has also faced three Supreme Court challenges. It survived the first two, although one ruling allowed states to opt out of its expansion of Medicaid programs for the poor. The still-pending case was first brought in 2018 by 20 states and is supported by the Trump administration. That case could overturn the entire law, although the court won’t hear arguments on the issue before the election. And that brings us back to Gardner’s bill. An obvious difference between that proposal and the ACA is length. Gardner’s bill is one page, while the ACA runs to several hundred. And Gardner’s claim seems pegged to the legislative language that says insurers can’t impose a ""pre-existing condition exclusion,"" which sounds fairly straightforward. But it’s not, experts say. ""It’s an adorable little bill but does not address any of the main issues,"" said Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the nonprofit Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center. ""You need a package of policies working together in order to create real protections for people to have coverage to meet their health care needs."" For instance, the bill does not explicitly bar insurers from outright rejecting applicants with medical conditions, something known as ""guaranteed issue."" ""‘Guaranteed issue’ is not in the language of the bill,"" said Miller at AEI. Instead, the language may simply prohibit insurers from restricting services related to a medical condition only if they choose to sell an individual insurance in the first place, he said. Compare that with the ACA, which says every insurer selling individual or group coverage ""must accept every employer and individual in the State that applies."" Also needed in legislation aiming to protect people with medical problems, said Blumberg, are provisions for subsidies to help people of low and moderate income afford their premiums. The ACA has those, along with specific enrollment periods, so that people don’t wait until they are sick to sign up. Without them, mainly those with medical conditions might sign up, driving up costs and premiums. That, in turn, can price people, especially the sick, out of future coverage. Another way Gardner’s bill differs from the ACA is that it does not list benefits that must be included in a health insurance policy. The ACA requires insurers to cover 10 broad categories of care, including hospitalization, prescription drugs, childbirth, substance abuse treatment and mental health care. ""Without that, insurers could sell products that don’t cover very much, which is what we had prior to 2014,"" Blumberg added, which is one way to discourage those who are sick from even applying. ""It was difficult to find a product that covered prescription drugs, and we even saw policies that didn’t cover chemotherapy."" Gardner’s legislation says insurers can’t ""factor health status into premiums or charges."" So insurers could not charge people more simply because they have diabetes, say, or cancer. Still, that leaves open a whole lot of other things that insurers could consider when setting premiums for individuals, such as such as gender or occupation, which could stand in as a proxy for health. Unlike the ACA, it does not bar insurers from setting annual or lifetime dollar limits on coverage, which could disproportionately affect people with costly medical conditions. The ACA allows insurers to vary premiums for only three reasons: where people live, their age and whether they use tobacco. It sets upper limits, such as charging older folks no more than three times what younger enrollees pay. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, who wrote a blog post cited by the Gardner campaign, said the proposed legislation is a starting point — a place holder, if you will. His piece mentioned it near the end of a broader look at the Trump administration’s health platform going into the election. Responding to questions about Gardner’s legislation, Holtz-Eakin said that if the ACA were to be struck down, Gardner would likely add provisions to it. ""I don’t think it’s intended to be a replacement bill but a provision to make sure people can get coverage,"" said Holtz-Eakin. ""It’s quite clear on the aim to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can get insurance, but it doesn’t address every single policy issue that’s out there."" Health law professor Mark Hall at Wake Forest University said Gardner’s legislation could survive if the ACA were struck down by the Supreme Court, but he noted that Congress would be unlikely to adopt the Gardner bill as written. ""A freestanding protection of pre-existing conditions without any supporting provisions to keep insurance affordable or encourage people to purchase it before they become sick, is almost certain to cause serious harms to the market,"" Hall wrote in an email. ""Therefore, a lot more is needed to overcome legitimate objections that almost certainly will be made from both sides of the political aisle."" Because protecting people with medical conditions requires many moving parts, the brevity of Gardner’s proposal makes it appear to be a fig leaf for a political problem rather than a means to guarantee protections for people with preexisting conditions. The legislation is unclear on whether it guarantees that people with health problems will be able to buy insurance in the first place. And, even if they can, they may well find it priced out of reach because the legislation does not bar insurers from varying premiums widely on the basis of age, gender or occupation. Viewed in its most favorable light, Gardner’s 117-word proposal would only serve as a place holder for larger legislation, upon which more protections would have to be layered to bolster the effectiveness of its guarantee. We rate this statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280967BB040>],/factchecks/2020/sep/18/cory-gardner/gardners-bill-has-more-do-politics-preexisting-con/

The false claim took off on Twitter and Facebook with an assist from the conservative news and opinion website the Gateway Pundit, which published an article with the headline, ""Fake news CBS caught using photo from Latinos for Trump event in Phoenix and tagged it as Biden’s Florida event!"" ""CBS stole a photo from Latinos for Trump in Phoenix and tagged it as a Biden event,"" said the text on one Sept. 17 Facebook post shared thousands of times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The program did not try to pass off a photo of Trump supporters as an event for Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee. The picture of the ""CBS Evening News"" broadcast was snapped during a segment that aired on Sept. 15. In the segment, CBS News correspondent Ed O’Keefe reported on a Biden campaign stop in Florida and the former vice president’s efforts to court Latino voters. The full segment, complete with audio, shows that the photo of Trump supporters at a Latinos for Trump event in Phoenix was displayed on screen while O’Keefe was speaking in a voiceover about Trump’s support among Latino voters. (The photo pops up at the 3:45 mark.)  ""The president has cut into Biden’s advantage by wooing conservative Latinos with ominous warnings about a Biden presidency,"" O’Keefe said as the photo in question, taken by Associated Press photographer Andrew Harnik on Sept. 14, flashed on screen.  Supporters react as President Donald Trump speaks at a Latinos for Trump event at Arizona Grand Resort & Spa, on Sept. 14, 2020, in Phoenix. (AP) The segment cut next to another photo of a Latina Trump supporter, followed by footage from a Trump event and then footage of the president speaking. The chyron — which read, ""Biden pitches crucial Latino voters during Florida campaign stop — remained on screen for more than a minute and a half. The full clip can be viewed here. Fact-checkers at Snopes, FactCheck.org, the Dispatch and the Associated Press have debunked the false claims about the ""CBS Evening News"" broadcast.

CDC director says healthy people should wear masks
","Testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Sept. 16, Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that face masks are the ""best defense"" against COVID-19.  ""This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine, because the immunogenicity may be 70%, and if I don’t get an immune response, the vaccine’s not going to protect me,"" he said, holding a mask. ""This face mask will.""  But an Instagram post published on the social media platform the same day shared an old video of the CDC director with this message: ""CDC Director Robert Redfield says healthy people should NOT wear masks."" In the video, U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., asks during a hearing of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, ""Should you wear a mask if you’re healthy?"" Redfield pushes the microphone toward his face and says, ""No."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The clip of the video in the Instagram post is authentic, but it says ""Today"" in the corner. In reality, this exchange happened in February 2020. You can hear it about 56 minutes and 30 seconds into the hearing on the country’s coronavirus response. This was before President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency, and before the CDC changed its recommendations to encourage nearly everyone to wear a face covering when out in public and when social distancing is difficult.  Early in the coronavirus outbreak, the CDC did discourage people from wearing face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. But that changed on April 3, when the CDC said it was revising its guidance based on continuing studies that found the virus could be transmitted by people who were asymptomatic.  The CDC’s website now says that everyone 2 years of age and older should wear a mask in public and when around people who don’t live in your household, especially when it’s hard to physically distance. On July 14, the CDC released a news release calling on ""Americans to wear masks to prevent COVID-19 spread.""  ""All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities,"" the release said.  Redfield was the co-author of an editorial that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It was titled, ""Universal masking to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission—the time is now,"" and made the case that ""broad adoption of cloth face coverings is a civic duty, a small sacrifice reliant on highly effective low-tech solutions that can help turn the tide favorably in national and global efforts against COVID-19.""  Our ruling While Redfield did say in February that healthy people should not wear masks, the CDC reversed course months ago and since early April has recommended that healthy people wear face coverings. This Instagram post wrongly frames his comments from February as if he currently believes that healthy people shouldn’t wear masks.  This was published online the same day that Redfield said masks are the most effective tool Americans have in the fight against COVID-19 — muddying the waters for people seeking clear, current information.  Redfield says that healthy people should wear face coverings.  We rate this Instagram post False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967975C0>],/factchecks/2020/sep/18/instagram-posts/cdc-director-says-healthy-people-should-wear-masks/

Rowden’s right: CARES Act funds weren’t paid out
","State Sen. Caleb Rowden is disappointed with how Boone County has handled $21.2 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds.  ""Boone County’s online CARES relief portal has fallen behind,"" he wrote Sept. 4 on Medium.com. ""Over three months after receiving CARES Act relief funds from the State, the county has still not made those dollars available to help struggling Mid-Missourians.""  County Commissioner Janet Thompson took issue with his statement. She said over $2 million was sent to two organizations: the Boone County Department of Health and Columbia Public Schools.  ""Perhaps Sen. Rowden should actually contact the Boone County Commission to find out exactly what we’re doing,"" she said.  A dispute over facts? That’s our specialty.  After digging into the question, we found that the county had not actually given out any CARES funds by Sept. 4, although some of the money has been promised. So when did Boone County receive the money, and what happened to it? When reached for comment, Rowden pointed to a variety of sources to back his claim, including news articles published by the Columbia Missourian, a press release issued by the Missouri Governor’s office, and a summary of House bill 2014, which Rowden voted for in the Missouri Senate. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act on March 27. It gave money to states and Missouri, in turn, gave some of those funds to every county plus St. Louis City to help offset economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The state bill that authorized disbursement of CARES money, HB 2014, was signed into law by Gov. Mike Parson on April 10. Boone County received $21.2 million, which must be completely spent by Dec. 31 or the entire amount will be returned to the state. Parson announced May 4 that the money had been sent. Two days later, Boone County received the money. On July 16, Boone County commissioners said they were looking at buying software to build a portal for relief applications from organizations and the general public. The commissioners said it would likely be ready within a month, according to reporting in the Columbia Missourian. On Aug. 28, the Missourian reported Thompson’s announcement that the online portal would be ready for applications within a few weeks.  At the time that state Sen. Rowden made his statement on Sept. 4, the portal was not online. By Sept. 9, the portal had been made available. In an email, Thompson said the commission had spent $2.1 million on requests from the Boone County Department of Health, and to Columbia Public Schools as a proxy to the other five school districts in Boone County.  What did Thompson mean by spent? ""If by ‘spent,’ you mean out the door/in another entity’s hands, that is what was ‘spent’ as of September 6, 2020,"" Thompson wrote. But was it? Not according to the Boone County Department of Health and county records.  On Aug. 11, The Columbia/Boone County Department of Health and Human Services was approved to receive $1.8 million to hire 40 full-time employees through December. These employees included disease investigators, contact tracers, health educators, data analysts, and communicable disease specialists. The money was also to pay for additional COVID-19 testing, especially for uninsured and under-insured individuals. Health Department Assistant Director Scott Clardy said in a Sept. 11 interview that money had not yet been received from the county, as the Health Department had to submit an invoice to the county and later get reimbursed. Meanwhile, all six Boone County school districts requested $322,800 for 1,345 Wi-Fi hotspots. The county commission approved the request on Aug. 20. The $322,800 was to be pre-paid by CPS and reimbursed by the county.  According to district spokesperson Michelle Baumstark, the Board of Education approved the purchase agreement for the hotspots, using CARES funding, on Sept. 14.  The CARES Act money is designated to be sent out as reimbursements, upon ""provision…. of adequate documentation showing appropriately incurred expenses,"" according to the county orders that approved the money to both Columbia Public Schools and the Department of Health. Thompson said there were ""at least three requests in the works"" that, if fully funded, would exceed $11 million. But, that’s anticipated money — not money spent, which was the basis of Rowden’s complaint. Caleb Rowden said: ""Over three months after receiving CARES Act relief funds from the state, the county has still not made those dollars available to help struggling Mid-Missourians.""  Evidence from the Boone County Department of Health and county records back that up. We found that $2.1 million had been approved for two organizations that requested CARES Act funds. But that money had not been sent by the Boone County Commission at the time of Rowden’s post. Although it was promised, the money had not hit the bank accounts of either organization.

People have died of COVID-19 at home
","A recent Facebook post wrongly claims that people don’t die of COVID-19 at home, suggesting, perhaps, that the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people are due to poor medical care, or that the disease that has shuttered so much of the world is a hoax.  ""Nobody is found dead of corona in their homes.. They all die at the hospital,"" the post says. ""Let that sink in.""   The majority of COVID-19 deaths in the United States occur in an in-patient health care setting or at a nursing home or long-term care facility, according to a provisional death count kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But as of Sept. 17, nearly 10,000 people had died at home, too.  A July ProPublica article about home deaths from COVID-19 in Houston describes a woman who died at home while her daughter was calling 911. An autopsy revealed the primary cause of death was COVID-19. They hadn’t realized that she had the disease, but as cases then surged in the Houston area, a rapidly growing number of residents died of COVID-19 at home, according to a review of Houston Fire Department data by ProPublica and NBC News. While many people who die at home aren’t tested for COVID-19, an ""increasing number"" of at-home deaths have been confirmed to show they were caused by the disease, the story says.

No, antifa activists aren’t disguising themselves as Trump supporters to riot
","Recent news reports have discussed the possibility of violence and unrest following the results of the upcoming presidential election, but there’s no evidence that a flyer circulating on social media is associated with antifa activists.  ""Election Day nears Comrades!!!"" reads the description a a flyer posted on the Facebook. ""Prepare to defend your rights!!"" The flyer itself says: ""Antifa comrades! On Nov. 4, don’t forget to disguise yourselves as patriots/Trump supporters: wear MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias, a convincing police uniform is even better! This way police and patriots responding to us won’t know who their enemies are and onlookers and the media will think there are Trump supporters rioting so it’s hard to turn popular opinion against us!"" An image of this Facebook post is now being shared on the social media platform. But the flyer that appears in the post has been online since at least 2017, when online rumors claimed that antifa activists were planning a revolution that would begin on Nov. 4.  This image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Antifa stands for ""anti-fascist."" It’s a broad, loose coalition of left-wing activists including communists, socialists and anarchists who protest white supremacy and other far-right causes. Sometimes antifa activists are violent, but experts say that most of the activity that happens under the antifa banner is nonviolent.  The image that’s being shared online appears to be a picture of a Facebook post sharing the flyer in a Facebook group called ""Hickman County Antifa."" The user who originally posted it there, Katy Krasnow, has told fact-checkers that she shared it as a joke.   ""Hickman County Antifa was a satire page,"" she told Snopes. ""I deleted soon after it got shared because it made a lot of people freak out more than I expected. Nobody in the group was really actually connected. We were just sharing dumb antifa memes."" On Sept. 4, Law Enforcement Today, which ""unapologetically supports those who hold the Thin Blue Line,"" published a story about the flyer being shared on Facebook. ""While I personally loathe the likes of Antifa and their tactics,"" the author wrote, ""I can assure you that this is simply a hoax.""  In 2017, Will Sommer, a politics reporter for the Daily Beast who covers conservative media, described the flyer in a Medium post as one of several ""fabricated ‘planning documents’ that urge antifa guerillas to commit violence while posing as police or Trump supporters.""  In June, a Twitter account — @ANTIFA_US — appeared to call for violence, rallying ""comrades"" to move into residential areas and ""take what’s ours."" But the account wasn’t actually affiliated with antifa activists; rather, it was created by a known white supremacist group, according to Twitter.  We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FEC00>],/factchecks/2020/sep/18/viral-image/no-antifa-activists-arent-disguising-themselves-tr/

Nearly all arrests in Kenosha protests were from the area
","When protesters gathered in Kenosha after Jacob Blake was shot by a police officer on Aug. 23, 2020, an array of online claims surfaced about who exactly was protesting. These questions only increased after news that federal law enforcement had stopped at least one vehicle on Aug. 26 with out-of-state plates and arrested the occupants, suspecting them of planning criminal activity related to the protests. Was that proof of a larger trend? Weeks after the protest, one Facebook post’s claim on this point continues to be widely shared. ""So far, out of 175 arrested in Kenosha, 102 were not from Kenosha,"" says a post from Sept. 1, 2020. ""Rioting has become its own industry. Who’s paying these monsters?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Let’s review what we know about the protest arrests. The numbers in the post come from an Aug. 30 news release issued by Kenosha police. The department reported 175 people were arrested from Aug. 24 (when the first protests started) to 12:30 p.m. on Aug. 30. Of those, 102 listed addresses outside Kenosha. The release also noted 69 of those people were arrested for curfew violations, while 34 were arrested for violating curfew as well as other charges such as carrying concealed weapons, burglary and drug possession. The implication from the Facebook post is that the people arrested from outside Kenosha were an organized ""industry,"" or for some other reason weren’t people who naturally assembled. Police booking data tells a different story. Online booking data doesn’t line up precisely with the police report. But it shows 165 people were arrested from Aug. 24 to 12:30 p.m. on Aug. 30, which gives us insight into how those protest arrests broke down. Among the 165: 59 were from Kenosha (roughly in line with the ratio in the post and news release) 60 were from elsewhere in Wisconsin, mostly Milwaukee (23) and Racine (14) 28 were from Illinois, the border of which is about 6 miles from the heart of the protests 11 were from Washington and Oregon 7 were from elsewhere (Kentucky, Minnesota, Indiana and California, as well as three listed by police as homeless) The Washington and Oregon residents are largely related to a Seattle-based group called Riot Kitchen, which provides meals for protesters and homeless people. A widely shared video showed police forcibly removing people from a minivan with Oregon plates at a Kenosha gas station Aug. 26. Police said the group had several vehicles and had been filling gas cans there. Authorities suspected ""the occupants of these vehicles were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest,"" police said in a statement. But a Riot Kitchen board member told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the gas was to run a generator they use for making food. The group had detoured to feed people in Kenosha during a planned trip to Washington, D.C., they told a New York Times reporter. A Facebook post says ""out of 175 arrested in Kenosha, 102 were not from Kenosha. Rioting has become its own industry."" The numbers are correct, but the implication connected to them is not. The majority of those arrested were from outside the city of Kenosha, but about 90% were from either Wisconsin or nearby Illinois. In other words, people one would expect to organically gather for a local protest spurred by a local event. And most of those from farthest away can be traced to a single group that drove from the West Coast. Our definition of Mostly False is a claim that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3C9400>],/factchecks/2020/sep/18/facebook-posts/nearly-all-arrests-kenosha-protests-were-local/

Trump credited with saving 1995 Veterans Day parade in NYC with contribution, but didn’t fund event
","A post circulating on Facebook claims that when President Donald Trump was a real estate developer, he paid for the 1995 Veterans Day parade in New York City after the city refused to fund the event. The post reads: ""Almost 26 years ago, NYC refused to fund the Veterans Day parade. Donald Trump financed it!"" This is somewhat accurate, but it exaggerates Trump’s contribution and misstates the city’s role.  Trump has been credited by organizers for saving the parade, but the post exaggerates the extent of Trump’s monetary contribution and appears to misstate the city’s role.  We found no evidence that the city of New York refused to pay for the event, which was put on by a private, nonprofit organization. A search of news archives and databases turned up no dispute between the city and parade organizers over funds for the event, and then-mayor Rudy Giuliani expressed dismay over the lack of support for the parade. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  News stories at the time reported that Trump donated $200,000 to the event and helped raise another $300,000. We reached out to the United War Veterans Council, the organization that hosted the event, for more details but did not hear back. In a 2016 interview with CNN, the organization’s parade organizer, Vincent McGowan, put Trump’s donation amount somewhere between $325,000 and $375,000, but said it wasn’t $1 million, which is what Trump’s campaign website said. In 1995, Tom Fox, the parade director at the time, credited Trump with the parade’s success. ""Donald Trump saved the parade,"" Fox was quoted saying. ""We had asked for donations from 200 corporations, and none of them came through."" Before the event, the New York Times reported that Trump was given the honor of serving as grand marshal for the event in exchange for his contributions, and put the total cost of the parade at about $2.4 million. (McGowan told CNN in that same 2016 interview that Trump was never grand marshal because he’s not a veteran, but the Times reported that he was in a follow-up story published a day after the parade.)  Trump didn’t fund the entire event. And while the post seems to be wrong on the city’s involvement, it does appear that Trump’s contribution and efforts enabled the parade to go on as planned. We rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097711D40>],/factchecks/2020/sep/17/facebook-posts/rump-credited-saving-1995-veterans-day-parade-nyc-/
