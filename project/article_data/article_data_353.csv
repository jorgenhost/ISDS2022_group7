Medicare ‘flex cards’ are not as advertised
","A social media post hawking a card that provides free groceries and prescriptions for senior citizens is evidence of the old adage: When something seems too good to be true, it probably is. The Facebook post says, ""​​As an American over 65, I qualified for the ‘Elderly Spend Card,’ which pays for my groceries, my dental, and my prescription refills. All I did to qualify, was tap the image below, entered my zip and I got my flex card in the mail a week later!"" The post includes a photo of a large pile of groceries. Clicking the link on the post brings users to a website that says, ""Seniors can get their ‘Medicare Flex Card’ for a limited time,"" with a photo of a debit card. ""Qualify (sic) seniors can spend up to $2,880 each year for medical appointments, prescriptions and more."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Without more context, this is misleading. Though the post implies that anyone over 65 is eligible for such a card, Medicare — the federal health insurance program for senior citizens and those with disabilities — does not provide the cards. Private insurance companies that sell certain plans, called Medicare Advantage, are allowed to offer customers a prepaid debit card, sometimes referred to as flex cards. The cards are available only in some areas, the monetary limits are often much lower than social media advertisement indicates, and what can be purchased with them is also limited. ""Medicare Advantage plans may utilize a debit card as a tool in administering supplemental benefits and/or to reduce enrollee cost sharing on covered benefits,"" a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said. ""Plans sometimes refer to these debit cards as ‘FlexCards.’ Plan enrollees may use a plan provided debit card with a set dollar limit to pay for covered supplemental benefits and/or out-of-pocket expenses, such as copays or coinsurance."" One insurance brokerage that sells Medicare plans wrote in a blog post, ""Truthfully, Medicare is not distributing flex cards. Thus, it is not a government-run program for seniors."" The blog notes that the cards are distributed by private Medicare Advantage plans and says they ""are not available in every state and are not available with every carrier."" Beginning in 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services allowed private insurers to add a ""new benefit facilitated through a debit card that would allow enrollees to use a dollar amount for specific primarily health related services (e.g., copays, OTC drugs, eyeglasses),"" according to guidance from the agency. Contrary to the Facebook post’s claim about using the debit card to purchase groceries, the agency’s guidance indicates that only the chronically ill qualify to use the cards for items such as food and produce. Media coverage has indicated that the cards usually offer much lower monetary limits than the post suggests, and are available to a limited group of people. For example, Aetna offers a flex card with a maximum annual benefit for $400, and it’s available only to ""select"" plans in Pennsylvania and Minnesota, according to a press release. Similarly, Humana is offering a $250 debit card ""to members of some Florida plans,"" according to a press release. A Facebook post says that senior citizens can get a Medicare ""flex card"" that pays for groceries and prescriptions. The cards are not provided by Medicare. They are offered as a benefit to some customers by private insurance companies that sell Medicare Advantage plans. The cards are available in limited geographic areas. They cannot be used by everyone to purchase groceries; the scope of what can be purchased by whom is limited.

No evidence that AOC said all young people want to be socialists
","From his campaign ad, you’d think Tim Baxter is running for a U.S. House seat against New York City Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — even though Baxter is a small-town Republican from New Hampshire.  ""AOC is a liar, liar. Her $60,000 Tesla must be on fire,"" Baxter says to open the 90-second video, before an image of a white Tesla surrounded by animated flames and photos of Ocasio-Cortez are shown.  Then Baxter makes this claim in the Facebook and Instagram ad: ""She says that all young people want to be socialists; another lie."" Baxter, a first-term state House representative, is running in the Sept. 13 primary for the GOP nomination to challenge U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., who is running for a third-term. We found no evidence for his claim. Republicans have used the socialist label to attack Democrats and their policies for decades, including over programs such as Medicare or Social Security that ultimately became popular on both sides of the aisle. Some are using the label in their 2022 campaigns, including an ad by Kalena Bruce, a House candidate from Missouri, that calls Ocasio-Cortez a socialist. The most narrow definition of socialism refers to, as Merriam-Webster puts it, the""governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods."" ​When Ocasio-Cortez, who was elected to the House in 2018, speaks of socialism, it is often about expanding social programs. She supports a single-payer health care system, tuition-free college and banning private prisons, and has advocated abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. She has described herself as a democratic socialist, expressing support for free markets, but with more power for workers. In her own ads, she said her first run was ""people versus money,"" and she has called for Medicare for All and a federal jobs guarantee. At the same, Ocasio-Cortez has said some democratic-socialists can also be capitalists. Our searches of Google, Bing and Nexis found no instance in which she said that all young people want to be socialists, as Baxter’s ad says.  We also searched for any mention of young people and socialists on her personal and official Twitter accounts. Had Ocasio-Cortez flatly stated that all young people want to be socialists, it’s likely news coverage would have quickly followed. Baxter’s campaign did not reply to our requests for information to back his statement. A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment on the claim and on whether she has owned a Tesla, which is an American brand of electric cars. A number of reports have speculated that Ocasio-Cortez drives a Tesla, including the conservative Washington Free Beacon, which reported in May that according to unnamed sources, her Tesla was seen parked illegally in Washington, D.C.  While Baxter is not running against Ocasio-Cortez, his ad makes it clear that, at 24, he wants to be ""the youngest elected congressman."" Ocasio-Cortez is now 32 but in 2018 was the youngest person in modern history to be elected to Congress until Madison Cawthorn, a North Carolina Republican, was elected in 2020 at 25, the minimum age to serve in the House under the Constitution. There is evidence that young people in the U.S. react favorably to the term ""socialism"" — and show support for more progressive ideas about government programs, if not government ownership of the means of production. For example, this question was asked in an Axios/Momentive poll in June: ""Do you have a positive or negative reaction to the word socialism?""  Among adults ages 18 to 24, 52% said positive and among those 25 to 35, 50% said positive. But there’s a lot of distance between those findings and the claim that Ocasio-Cortez said ""all young people want to be socialists."" We rate that claim False.

No, Washington state isn’t considering involuntary COVID-19 quarantines
","The Washington State Board of Health has a meeting scheduled for Jan. 12, and social media users warned that officials were planning to discuss changes that would allow authorities to detain unvaccinated people in quarantine facilities, and also to require COVID-19 vaccines for children to attend school. Fears residents had about being taken against their will to an isolation site are unfounded, however. And any decision about whether to require vaccines for students is a long way off. A Facebook post shares a flyer that reads: ""The WA State Board of Health will discuss applying current infectious disease WAC codes to include COVID-19 for all WA state residents."" It goes on to say the changes will allow health officials to use law enforcement to detain individuals or families in an isolation facility if they don’t comply with requests for testing, treatment and vaccination. It also says the board will discuss adding COVID-19 vaccines to school immunization requirements. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) After getting more than 25,000 emails about the meeting agenda, the board posted an article saying it wanted ""to clarify some misinformation that has circulated online regarding two topics on the agenda."" First, the board said that item nine on its agenda is related to rulemaking, but that it is not voting to change isolation or quarantine policies at the meeting, ""nor does it suggest law enforcement be used to enforce any vaccination requirements."" It is continuing a November rules hearing on proposed changes to the Washington Administrative Code to bring it in line with a state law that went into effect in June 2020. That bill was intended to modernize state’s laws on the control of communicable diseases ""by ending statutory HIV/AIDS exceptionalism, reducing HIV-related stigma, defelonizing HIV exposure, and removing barriers to HIV testing,"" according to the board. The changes being discussed at the hearing are related solely to HIV language and have zero overlap with COVID-19, said Keith Grellner, chairperson of the State Board of Health, in an interview with PolitiFact. Grellner said this chapter has been in place since before 1988. It was updated in 2003 with a section geared toward HIV, but also to other highly contagious diseases.  One of the many sections of that code relates to the procedures health officials could use to forcibly put a person into isolation or quarantine. In short, Grellner said, a health officer does not have the authority to quarantine someone against their will — only a judge could make such an order.  ""The only communicable disease I'm aware that it's ever been used for is tuberculosis,"" said Grellner. Regardless, it is not something the board is discussing or considering, he said. ""It's never been talked about. There's no plans to use that for COVID. There are no plans or resources or locations to set up involuntary isolation or quarantine camps,"" Grellner added. ""That's a complete falsehood. It doesn't exist. It's never been discussed."" Grellner blamed the confusion on social media users who ""willfully and intentionally put out misinformation."" As far as vaccine requirements for schools, there is no action being taken by the board at this meeting. However, the board is expected to receive an update on the progress of a technical advisory group that’s evaluating whether to include a COVID-19 vaccine in the list of vaccines required for schoolchildren. Currently, children attending schools in the state must be vaccinated against 11 diseases, including measles and whooping cough, but not COVID-19. The group will make a recommendation at a future hearing, which the board would then vote on. If they do require a COVID-19 vaccine, the board said, there would be exemptions for medical, religious or personal reasons. ""There's nothing imminent as far as a possible recommendation"" from the advisory group, Grellner said. Grellner said there is a limit to how many people can register to watch the meeting on Zoom, but those who can’t get in can follow a live broadcast of it on tvw.org. A Facebook post shared a flyer warning that Washington’s State Board of Health in a Jan. 12 meeting was going to discuss changes that would allow for the forced quarantines of unvaccinated families and require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend school. The board is discussing rules changes to the state’s administrative Code to bring it in line with a state law (ESHB 1551) that went into effect in June 2020. The changes are related to language about HIV and not at all related to quarantine or isolation policies, nor do they discuss using law enforcement to enforce quarantines. The board is not taking any action about vaccine requirements for students, but is expected to hear a status update from an advisory group tasked with making a recommendation.

No, high tech refrigerators at Walgreens aren’t scanning for ‘the mark of the beast’
","At some Walgreens locations, shoppers are being monitored by the refrigerator doors as they browse the aisles. The retail pharmacy chain has started using Cooler Screens technology at thousands of Walgreens stores across the U.S. The technology relies on cameras and sensors to determine some of a shopper’s general behaviors and characteristics, which are then used to provide targeted advertising, according to the Wall Street Journal and Fast Company. If a shopper grabs a six-pack of beer near dinner time, the cooler doors might display a promotion on frozen pizzas, for example, Cooler Screens’ CEO Arsen Avakian told Fast Company.  ""So I’m here at Walgreens,"" said one TikTok user, whose video was shared on Facebook. He turned the camera to show a line of refrigerators along one wall of the store. ""They look like normal shelves, but they’re not normal shelves. Every single one of them has infrared scanning sensors for your forehead, right? The mark of the beast on your right hand or your forehead.""  The person narrating the video continues, saying that the refrigerator doors are made out of ""super thick metal.""  ""If you don’t have the mark later on, you won’t be able to buy,"" he said. In the full-length version of the TikTok, which appears to have been removed from TikTok but is posted on Reddit, his claim continues. In the future, he said, the refrigerator doors will be locked unless shoppers scan their hands or foreheads. ""Without the mark of the beast, you won’t be able to use these in the future,"" he said. ""These lock. Right now they’re not locked, but they do lock."" A few seconds later, he clarified: ""This is all just the beginning — certificate of vaccine ID. COVID. You won’t be able to buy or sell unless you can prove that you’re fully vaccinated. They’re going to collapse the economies and then bring in digital currency."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This TikTok user is not the first person to refer to COVID-19 vaccines — or proof of vaccinations — as ""the mark of the beast,"" a religious term referenced in Revelation, the last book of the New Testament. Evangelical Christians have cited this text throughout history as a sign of the antichrist. (Both credit cards and social security numbers have been theorized to be the long-feared mark. In the 1970s, grocery store UPC bar codes became suspect.) But while the question of whether COVID-19 vaccines are the ""mark of the beast"" may be open to religious interpretation, another question remains. Are the Cooler Screens at Walgreens meant to detect markings and prevent people who lack those markings from shopping? No. Quite the opposite: Cooler Screens freezer and refrigerator doors are designed to provide targeted advertisements to shoppers — with the ultimate hope that they will buy. It’s not clear how the speaker in the video arrived at this conclusion, but the belief also appears to be rooted in an interpretation of the biblical text. Revelation 13:16-17 reads: ""It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.""  The whole point of a company advertising something is so that consumers will purchase.  The Cooler Screens doors are ""equipped with a camera, motion sensors, and eye tracking,"" according to a 2019 Fast Company article. ""The doors can discern your gender, your general age range, what products you’re looking at, how long you’re standing there, and even what your emotional response is to a particular product."" The Cooler Screens FAQ page addresses the cameras and sensors the doors rely on. Three ""internally facing cameras"" are used to track product inventory while ""front-facing optical sensors"" are used to ""anonymously track consumer presence and interaction with the platform.""   ""These optical sensors never capture or store images or any other data that at any time cloud [sic] be linked back to an individual consumer,"" Cooler Screens wrote. A more recent article from last year contradicted some of the claims the Fast Company story made about the Cooler Screens doors.  ""Though the sensors don’t use facial-recognition technology and can’t tell gender or other identifiable data, they can give advertisers a sense of how their ads are actually leading to in-store purchases,"" according to a Marketing Brew piece.  Regardless, the screens on the doors will display advertisements and promotions that are believed to be relevant to particular shoppers based on the information gathered by the sensors.  According to Cooler Screens, the data it collects is anonymous, meaning it is not tied to a particular individual, as, say, Facebook and Instagram are.  ""Cooler Screens never seeks to identify individuals and never gathers or uses personally identifiable or linkable information,"" the company wrote on its FAQ page. ""Our technology does not support it. Our business model does not require it."" PolitiFact reached out to Cooler Screens, Walgreens and Microsoft — another one of Cooler Screens’ partners.  A spokesperson for Cooler Screens described its technology as ""identity-blind and privacy-centric,"" and said the company had adopted the ""Privacy by Design"" framework, which ensures privacy safeguards are always a consideration. ""Our external facing sensor simply detects motion — nothing more,"" the spokesperson said, reiterating that Cooler Screens does not gather or use personally identifiable information. A spokesperson for Microsoft said Cooler Screens does not use Microsoft AI to power its technology. Cooler Screens uses some Microsoft cloud services and data visualization tools.  Walgreens did not respond to our requests for comment. A video shared on Facebook claims Walgreens refrigerators are scanning shoppers’ hands and foreheads looking for ""the mark of the beast,"" which is supposedly sported by those who are vaccinated against COVID-19. The video also claims that ""if you don’t have the mark later on, you won’t be able to buy.""

Iowa broadband touted by Republicans was funded by Democratic votes for American Rescue Plan
","More than $210 million was awarded to 160 applicants for new broadband infrastructure in Iowa as part of the state’s Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant Program, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced in a press release on Tuesday, Jan. 4.  Reynolds also tweeted on Jan. 4:  ""These grants will bring more than $526 million of new broadband infrastructure investment to Iowa, serving over 39,000 homes, schools, and businesses."" In response, Democrats ranging from state legislators, running for the Legislature and party activists said on Facebook and social media that Reynolds is giving herself credit where credit is not due, and accused her of neglecting to tell Iowans that the grants she was announcing were funded Iowa’s allocation of the American Rescue Plan that, they noted, Reynolds and other Iowa Republicans opposed.  ""Governor Reynolds is doing it again, claiming credit she doesn't deserve,"" Iowa Senate Democrats posted on Facebook Jan. 5. ""Yesterday's Reynolds press release touting $210 million in broadband help for Iowa failed to mention these are actually federal funds approved by Rep Cindy Axne and signed into law by President Joe Biden."" They are correct about Reynolds announcing the grants from a program she opposed, although Iowa has provided some of its own funding for broadband improvements in rural Iowa and Reynolds has made broadband expansion a state priority. When contacted by PolitiFact Iowa, Reynold’s communications director, Alex Murphy, wrote in an email that the entire $210 million in new money was from the American Rescue Plan. The Empower Rural Iowa Broadband Grant is part of the Empower Rural Iowa initiative, which Reynolds established by an executive order in 2018. In that year, the state allocated $1.3 million to the program. Since 2018, the goals of the grant program have been to reduce the amount of areas in Iowa unserved or underserved by broadband service by providing funds to organizations installing broadband infrastructure.  Reynolds renewed another round of grants on April 28, 2021, after the bill passed unanimously in the Republican-led Legislature earlier that year. Iowa’s state budget allocated $100 million for the program in fiscal 2022, which started July 1, 2021. Reynolds originally had asked for $150 million annually for each of the next three years, but agreed to $100 million, saying she could get federal funds to supplement the remaining cost.  On Oct. 11, after applications were received, Reynolds announced in a press release that due to an overwhelming need and interest in the program, the state would spend about $200 million from American Rescue Plan funding for the program. The state had received 178 applications requesting a total of $300 million in funds.  Reynolds announced the recipients of nearly $100 million using state funds in September. Eventually, the American Rescue Plan amount for Iowa rose to $210 million. Democrats were quick to respond in October because Reynolds advocated against the passage of the American Rescue Plan before President Biden signed the bill in March. In February, she had signed a joint statement with 21 other governors opposing the plan. The statement criticized the plan because it allocates funds according to each state’s unemployed population rather than its total population, which Reynolds said punished states that kept unemployment levels low in the pandemic. Iowa’s unemployment rate ranged from 3.6% to 4.1% in 2021. ""A state’s ability to keep businesses open and people employed should not be a penalizing factor when distributing funds. If Congress is going to provide aid to states, it should be on an equitable population basis,"" said Reynolds in the press release. Reynolds was not the only Iowa Republican to advocate against the American Rescue Plan. No Iowa GOP Congress member voted for the plan. The only Iowa congresswoman to vote for it was Democrat U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne.  Beyond the American Rescue Plan, a bipartisan $1.2 billion infrastructure bill that passed Congress and was signed into law in November included $65 billion for broadband improvements nationally. Grassley was the only Republican in Iowa’s congressional delegation to vote with Democrat Rep. Cindy Axne for the plan. Overall, around $310 million eventually was provided to applicants for broadband infrastructure in Iowa in 2021, nearly triple the original $100 million.  Iowa Senate Democrats said on Facebook on Jan. 5 that Reynolds failed to mention in a Jan. 4 press release that new funding for broadband expansion in Iowa came from the American Rescue Plan that Democrats supported and President Biden signed into law.  A look at the state grant program shows $210 million of the funding announced in January 2022 is from the American Rescue Plan. And, while another $100 million for broadband expansion in Iowa this fiscal year came from a state contribution that Reynolds supported, she declined to identify that the new $210 million in broadband money was from the American Rescue Plan that she opposed.  We rate this claim to be True.",/factchecks/2022/jan/11/iowa-senate-democrats/iowa-broadband-touted-republicans-was-funded-democ/

New Zealand didn’t OK euthanasia for COVID-19 patients. Voters passed a law for the terminally ill
","As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the headline on a blog post claims New Zealand decided to approve euthanasia for COVID-19 patients.

""‘Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can die by euthanasia if doctors decide they might not survive, the New Zealand government has declared,’"" said one tweet that drew a quote from the Catholic Herald article before offering commentary: ""That’ll certainly increase the numbers. There’s evil afoot."" “Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can die by euthanasia if doctors decide they might not survive, the New Zealand government has declared.”That’ll certainly increase the numbers.There’s evil afoot. https://t.co/ffGi5egSpL But the headline is a misrepresentation of an assisted dying program that recently went into effect in New Zealand — and social media posts referencing the news leave out significant context. Passed in a referendum by New Zealanders in 2020, the End of Life Choice Act of 2019 has strict eligibility requirements and is only meant for terminally ill people. It wasn’t introduced for COVID-19 patients. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The law took effect in November 2021 about a year after the vote. In December, an anti-euthansia website called The Defender published an article that seemed to ignite the claims now circulating online. According to the article, the New Zealand Health Ministry told The Defender that, in some circumstances, a person with COVID-19 may be eligible for assisted dying, and suggested that the law could be used as a tool if COVID-19 hospitalizations were to spiral out of control. But New Zealand health officials said that the story and others like it are taking the law out of context and omitting its eligibility requirements and rules. ""There is no truth"" to claims that suggest the law was introduced for COVID-19, said Blair Cunningham, a spokesperson for the health agency.  To be eligible for the program, a person must be 18 years or older and meet all of the following criteria: a citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand suffering from a terminal illness that is likely to end their life within six months in an advanced state of irreversible decline in physical capability experiencing unbearable suffering that cannot be relieved in a manner that the person considers tolerable competent to make an informed decision about assisted dying. Two doctors and, in some cases, a psychiatrist must assess whether a patient is eligible and whether the person is competent to make an informed decision. The legislation says that doctors can’t suggest euthanasia as an option to the patient or make the decision for them. The patient alone must be the one to raise assisted dying with someone in their health care team. The services, Cunningham said, are most likely to be provided in a person’s home or other community settings, rather than in hospital settings. The health agency added that a terminal illness is most often a prolonged disease where treatment is not effective and that, in some circumstances, a person with COVID-19 may be eligible for assisted dying. But because eligibility is determined case by case, the agency ""cannot make definitive statements about who is eligible.""  Blog posts and social media posts claim that New Zealand has approved euthansia for COVID-19 patients, with suggestions that it could be used as a tool if COVID-19 hospitalizations rise dramatically.  An assisted-dying law was passed by New Zealand voters in 2020. But while some COVID-19 patients may be eligible under the law, the legislation was not introduced for COVID-19. The law has strict eligibility requirements, including that the person must have a terminal illness that is likely to end their life within six months and causes them unbearable suffering. It requires multiple doctors to determine whether the person is eligible and competent, and doctors cannot suggest euthanasia as an option or make the decision for patients.

Trump says Democrats are trying to 'ban voter ID.' That’s misleading.
","As Democrats renew their efforts to pass federal voting rights legislation, former President Donald Trump suggested that Democrats want to erase state laws that require identification in order to cast a ballot. ""They are trying to BAN voter ID and other basic measures that can ensure the sacred integrity of the vote,"" Trump said Jan. 7 in an email from his Save America PAC. Trump accused Democrats of trying to ""pass a radical federal takeover of state election law.""  Trump didn’t name any specific bills, and a spokesperson Liz Harrington told us he was ""not referring to any legislation."" But Harrington pointed to the House Democrats’ support for the HEROES Act in May 2020. It was a $3 trillion proposal by House Democrats that focused on aid to governments and businesses and included stimulus checks. Tucked into that legislation was a provision that said voters could meet a state’s voter ID requirement by signing a sworn written statement attesting to their identity. The provision did not apply to certain first-time voters who registered by mail. The voter ID proposal drew criticism from Republicans at the time, but the focus of discussions was about the main provisions of the bill, which aimed to help Americans get through the pandemic. The legislation passed the Democratic-led House mostly along party lines but didn’t pass the Senate.  Democrats tried to pass a similar voter ID proposal within an expansive voting rights bill, H.R. 1, but the bill never made it into law. The latest comprehensive bill that addresses voter ID is the Senate Democrats’ Freedom to Vote Act. Senate Republicans blocked the bill last fall. The Freedom to Vote Act also includes a requirement that states offer a workaround for voters who lack IDs, but it doesn’t broadly ""ban"" ID requirements. Rather, it would set an expansive and uniform policy for what counts as an acceptable ID; it wouldn’t have to be one with a photo such as a driver’s license. It does contain a provision, however, that would prohibit states from requiring voters present an ID in order to get an absentee ballot. ""I don’t know that ban is the right word, but it certainly makes it hard to put in place strict voter identification rules, especially those that make it harder for minority voters to vote,"" said Rick Hasen, a University of California, Irvine, law professor who specializes in election law. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that he wants to create a path forward for federal voting rights legislation by Jan. 17. To proceed on the Freedom to Vote Act or other voting rights legislation, Democrats would have to persuade Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to support changes to the filibuster, and would need every Democratic vote in the evenly split chamber. Thirty-five states have laws asking voters to show some form of identification at the polls, while the remaining states use other identifying information when voters cast ballots, such as a signature, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  Polls show most people support a voter ID requirement, but voting rights advocates say that these polls may not grasp the issue’s nuances — such as safeguards that are already in place — and that the trend toward stricter ID rules could make it harder for a small group of voters to cast ballots. This leaves Democrats seeking to stem the tide of increasingly strict rules, without proposing a total ban on voter ID requirements. What bothers some voting rights advocates is what’s in the mix of allowable options for acceptable IDs. In Texas and Tennessee, for example, gun permits are considered valid voter IDs, but student IDs are not. Critics say this makes it easy for gun owners, a heavily Republican group, to vote but harder for students, a predominantly Democratic group.  Also, voters who lack government-issued IDs tend to be nonwhite, and that includes in places where elections are settled by slim margins such as Georgia. Republicans who want stricter voter ID rules argue that they are needed to prevent voter fraud. But voter fraud is rare. An AP investigation in December found fewer than 475 potential cases in six battleground states in the 2020 election, not nearly enough to affect the outcome. ""Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast additional ballots,"" the AP reported. The Freedom to Vote Act doesn’t ban a state from having a voter ID law. Instead, the bill says if a state has a voter ID requirement, then there must be more than a dozen acceptable forms of voter ID for casting ballots in person, including gun and fishing licenses, bank cards, utility bills, Social Security cards and student IDs. (The bill specifies that the rules are for federal elections, but it would be impractical for a state to have separate ID rules for state races.) Under the bill, if the voter lacks an applicable ID, they could present a sworn statement by an adult who attests to their identity. Other workarounds include if the election official has known the voter for at least six months or if an employee of a state-licensed care facility confirms the individual’s identity. Many states already have workarounds for voters who lack IDs, including the sworn oath or asking them to recite their date of birth and address. Voters who can’t meet any of those three conditions in the bill would have to cast a provisional ballot. The bill also requires states with an ID requirement to provide a free ID to registered voters. A separate part of the bill prohibits states from requiring voters to submit IDs to obtain or cast  absentee ballots. States can still require voters to sign the ballot envelope, a key security measure used to verify voters’ identities. It is this measure that at least one group opposing the Freedom to Vote Act says amounts to a ban on voter ID for absentee ballots. ""I consider the Freedom to Vote Act to be as close as one can come to banning identification requirements without actually doing it,"" said Jason Snead, executive director of the Honest Elections Project, a conservative group that opposes the legislation. Snead said about six states currently require ID — typically a driver’s license, state ID or last four digits of a Social Security number — to vote by mail. Regarding Freedom to Vote Act’s provisions for  in person voting, the Honest Elections Project uses softer language, saying the bill ""undermines existing voter ID laws nationwide."" Voting rights advocates who favor looser ID rules say calling the legislation a ban on voter ID goes too far. ""It is a requirement that the form of identification required, including a sworn statement, is one that everyone can access,"" said Danielle Lang, senior director of voting rights at the Campaign Legal Center, which supports the bill. Trump said in an email that Democrats ""are trying to ban voter ID."" His spokesperson cited a Democratic-backed bill in 2020 that would have eased voter ID requirements. That bill was not enacted. In recent years, Democrats have proposed multiple bills that would set a federal standard for acceptable voter ID and provide workarounds for people who didn’t have one, but wouldn’t ban ID requirements.  The Freedom to Vote Act, now under consideration, also sets expansive standards for allowable IDs and workarounds, and it bars states from requiring voters to submit an ID to obtain or cast an absentee ballot. But the bill allows states to have voter ID requirements as long as they include a lot of options for what counts as an ID. We rate this statement Mostly False.

There’s no evidence Ginni Thomas organized Jan. 6 events
","On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, a conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, took to her Facebook page to cheer on supporters of Donald Trump who were attending a rally in Washington, D.C., that day. Two days after that rally devolved into a violent attack on the Capitol building, she amended her posts to clarify that they were written before the violence, according to Slate. Shortly after, unsubstantiated claims that Thomas paid for 80 buses to charter people to the rally began to surface on social media.  They were debunked by fact-checkers, as well as The New York Times and Washington Post, but a similar claim is showing up on social media again this week, shortly after the one-year anniversary of the attack. A Facebook post features a screenshot of a tweet that reads, ""The fact that Clarence Thomas’s wife was one of the organizers of Jan 6th should be mentioned every time SCOTUS is in the news, IMHO."" The original tweet came from an account belonging to a comedian and podcaster Noel Casler and garnered more than 50,000 likes. We reached out to Casler on Twitter for the source of his claim but he has not responded. There’s no evidence that Thomas was an organizer of Jan. 6 events or that she did anything more than express her support for Trump and rallygoers. ""LOVE MAGA PEOPLE,"" she wrote in one post that morning and ""GOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP OR PRAYING,"" in another. Her Facebook page is no longer visible, but reporting by Slate, the Washington Post and Law & Crime confirmed those posts were made in the morning hours of Jan. 6. The New York Times in January 2021 debunked assertions that Thomas paid for buses to send people to the Jan. 6 rally in DC through Turning Point USA, a conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk. The Times wrote the claim was likely sparked by a tweet from a writer named Anne Nelson, who said Turning Point USA was sending 80 buses to the rally and noted that Thomas was on the group’s advisory council. A spokesperson for Turning Point at the time said that Thomas did not provide any funding for the seven buses that were ultimately chartered. The spokesperson also clarified that Thomas hadn’t been on the group’s advisory board for years. The House select committee investigating the attack has so far subpoenaed several dozen people, including many involved in organizing rallies that day. Thomas was not among them as of Jan. 10. There is also no indication from the committee that she has been asked to voluntarily testify. Thomas wrote a letter shortly after the Jan. 6 attack to her husband’s former law clerks in a private email list, apologizing after a rift developed over her outspoken advocacy for the former president before and after the election, the Washington Post reported. A Facebook post claims that Thomas was one of the organizers of Jan. 6. Though Thomas did signal support for ""MAGA people"" the morning of Jan. 6, she later clarified that those posts were made before Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. There’s no evidence that Thomas was involved in organizing the events that unfolded on Jan. 6. She has not been subpoenaed by the House select committee investigating the attack and rumors that she helped organize busing for Trump supporters that day have not been supported.

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

Part of this response includes President Biden's Sept. 9, 2021 executive order requiring COVID-19 vaccination for federal employees, with a Nov. 22 deadline for full vaccination. In the clip, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., asks Walensky what percentage of CDC employees are vaccinated. Walensky responded that her agency is ""actively encouraging vaccination"" and ""doing a lot of education and outreach"" to get employees fully vaccinated, but said she does not have the figure available. Nowhere in the clip, or in the broader hearing, does Walensky state or imply that CDC employees are not getting vaccinated — only that she does not have the numbers with her. Data made available since the hearing show that nearly all employees of the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the CDC, have complied with Biden’s order.  A White House update noted that as of Nov. 23, 96.4% of HHS employees had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. When including pending or approved exemption requests, the department’s compliance rate with Biden’s order rose to 98.8%. And as of Dec. 8, 97.1% of HHS employees had received at least one dose, with a compliance rate of 99.6%. Overall, 92.5% of over 3.5 million employees in federal agencies included under the executive order had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose by Dec. 8, with a compliance rate of 97.2%. Those figures were announced by the White House on Dec. 9, weeks before the Facebook post.

Conway's claim of a diverse department true
","Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway recently said publicly that the racial and ethnic makeup of his department mirrors the large and diverse north metro county it serves. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. But first a little context. The shooting of black teen Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 prompted protests that roiled the Ferguson-St. Louis area for weeks. Anti-police rhetoric has been on the rise since Brown’s death and other highly publicized police-involved shootings. Conway, who has been Gwinnett’s sheriff for 19 years, weighed in on what some have labeled a ""war on police"" earlier this month, penning an op-ed piece for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that denounced senseless violence against police officers. It also described those making allegations of police racism as ‘hate groups’ and ""domestic terrorists with an agenda."" At a press conference on Sept. 16, Conway responded to critics of the piece and said he planned to meet with some who disagreed with his viewpoint or accused him of ""burying his head in the sand"" to racism in policing today. It was at that time that Conway also said that the racial and ethnic makeup of his department mirrors Gwinnett, the state’s second largest county. So what do the numbers show? We contacted Shannon Volkodav, a spokeswoman for the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office, to request supporting data on all department staff, as well as its leadership. She provided a racial/ethnic breakdown of the department’s current staff, which we compared with estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau on the population of Gwinnett County in 2014, the latest year for which information is available. The Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office, with a 706-member staff, is 55.81 percent white, 35.55 percent African-American, 5.95 percent  Hispanic, 2.27 percent Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.42 percent Native American/Alaskan. And the department serves an estimated 877,922 Gwinnett County residents, 58.1 percent of whom are white, 27 percent of whom are African-American, 20.5 percent of whom are Hispanic, 11.6 percent of whom are Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.8 percent of whom are Native American/Alaskan, according to the data we reviewed. Conway said in a telephone interview that a diverse department has been something he’s worked to achieve since first being elected sheriff in 1996. He said the administration is not as racially and ethnically diverse as he would like. But he said that’s a byproduct of the department and county having been predominately white well into the 1990s and senior administrators, most of whom have 20 to 25 years of experience, having risen through the ranks. (Whites make up 74 percent of front-line supervisors -- lieutenants, sergeants and corporals, according to department data.) Ronald Weitzer, a professor of sociology at George Washington University who specializes in police and minority relations, said the situation is not unusual. ""It takes time for minority officers to move up through the hierarchy,"" Weitzer said. ""It is also important that -- from the perspective of citizens who have contact with officers --  what matters is how diverse the department is on the ground."" ""Average residents may never encounter the top leadership or know what their demographics are,"" he said. The exception would be the chief of police, whose racial background would be known to the public, Weitzer said. We wondered how the Sheriff’s Office compared with Gwinnett County government as a whole. Joe Sorenson, the communications director for the county, provided data showing that 73.96 percent of the county’s workforce is white, 18.69 percent is black; 4.6 percent is Hispanic and 2.43 percent is Asian or Pacific Islander. The county is working to increase its diversity, but it’s not a quick process, Sorenson said. Some of its efforts include recruiting police officers at historically black colleges and universities, including Florida A&M University, Bethune-Cookman and Albany State, Sorenson said. Our ruling. Conway said his department mirrors the community it serves in racial and ethnic diversity. Data we reviewed show the department is more diverse than Gwinnett County government as a whole. African-Americans and other major ethnic and racial groups are represented in the department -- some groups are more proportionally represented in the department than others. But Conway’s overarching point stands up. We rate his statement as True.    ",/factchecks/2015/sep/29/butch-conway/conways-claim-diverse-department-true/

Huckabee says six of the 10 wealthiest U.S. counties surround D.C.
","Mike Huckabee says he’s found the road to riches, and it’s called the Capital Beltway. ""Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C.,"" the GOP presidential candidate said during a Sept. 24 interview on ""The John Fredericks Show,"" a Hampton Roads-based radio program. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, cited the statistic while contending that federal power brokers have set up a system that shields them from economic hard times. We emailed Huckabee’s campaign asking for the source of his numbers and didn’t hear back. But PolitiFact has examined variations of his statement that have been uttered by three other Republicans: Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and, most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The six-of-10 figure is a reference to the counties with the highest median household income, a widely used measure of county-wide wealth. The U.S. Census Bureau compiles the income data each year. Here are the 10 counties with the highest median income in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available: Loudoun County, Va. -- $117,680 Falls Church, Va. -- $117,452 Los Alamos County, N.M. -- $110,930 Fairfax County, Va. -- $110,658 Howard County, Md. -- $108,503 Hunterdon County, N.J -- $107,203 Douglas County, Colo. -- $105,192 Arlington County, Va. -- $101,533 Morris County, N.J. -- $99,950 Montgomery County, Md. -- $97,873 That list includes six counties -- four in Virginia and two in Maryland -- that are located outside Washington. Although Falls Church is a city, it’s treated as a county by the Census Bureau. We looked at the annual Census Bureau figures going back to 2009. In each of those years, there also were a half-dozen D.C. suburban counties that made the top 10 list of the highest median household income. It’s no secret that the federal government is the major seed of affluence in the D.C. area, sprouting high-paying government and contracting jobs. The suburbs have some of the highest education levels in the nation, according to Terry Rephann, a regional economist at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. We should make a statistical note here. Median household income is the midrange point where half of the county’s households make more than the median and the other half makes less. For example, if only five families lived in a county, the median income would be that of the third highest-earning household. Not all measures rank the D.C. suburbs among the 10 richest counties. Money magazine, for example, looked at average income -- the total income in a county divided by its residents. Based on that data from 2012, none of the counties near Washington made a Money list of the 10 richest counties published last year. If you’re wondering, No. 1 in was Teton County in  Wyoming. Rephann, however, told us that average income can easily be thrown off by a few extremely wealthy people living in a less populous rural county. Median income is a better way to measure the richest counties, he said. We’ll also note that while median incomes are high around Washington, that doesn’t mean everything is rosy there. Economists told us for a recent fact-check that the Virginia economy has taken a hit in recent years amid federal budget-cutting in D.C. Our ruling Huckabee said six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C. Judged by median household income -- a standard way for tracking a county’s wealth -- his statement is correct.

Men named William outnumber women in Florida politics, group says
","A pro-Democratic group has sent out the call that 2016 is the year Florida voters need to choose a female candidate. Ruth’s List Florida, which supports female political candidates, sent out an email that made its point by offering an unusual comparison: ""Did you know that fewer women have been elected to statewide office than men named William?"" read the email that reached our desk on Sept. 22, 2015. The email went on, ""This isn’t right. More women than men vote in Florida, but 26 men named William have been elected to statewide office and only 7 women have had the honor. We have to fix this in 2016."" Is it possible that in Florida’s 170-year history, only seven women have filled statewide office? And did voters pick 26 men named William? Get ready for a state civics lesson. The Williams Ruth’s List did not respond to our repeated inquiries by phone, email and even Twitter about how they came up with their tally, so we don’t know exactly what they counted. What we do know is that things can get considerably convoluted. Depending on whom you count and how, we found 30 men named William  -- or possibly more -- who have held statewide office. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they were elected. We’re not going to go through every single one, but if you’d like to see all the ones we found, we’ve provided our list here. Keep in mind that a number of the Williams on our list were appointed to their post, rather than elected, as Ruth's List Florida said. We could confirm 14 different Williams were actually elected to office, although there could be more. While we know some were appointed, historical records for a few simply didn’t give enough detail about how they won office, especially during the state’s early history. Those men certainly could have won via election, but we just can’t tell. If we counted all the unknowns as being elected, that would total 22 Williams. Increasingly in recent years, Florida has moved toward appointments rather than direct elections. The state had six elected cabinet positions until 2003, at which point the roster was whittled to three. To give you a sense of how difficult counting Williams can be, consider Florida’s roster of U.S. senators: Depending on how wide you cast a net, there have been between zero and four Williams in the U.S. Senate. William James Bryan was appointed in 1907 to succeed a man who died, but then died himself less than three months later at age 31. He was succeeded in 1908 by another appointee, William Hall Milton, who served a year and did not run for re-election. Also appointed as a successor to a dead senator was William Luther Hill, who served four months in 1936 before leaving office without running for a full term. Finally, there’s current Sen. Bill Nelson, who has been in office since 2001 and was also state treasurer back when it was an elected position. But Nelson’s full name is Clarence William Nelson. Should we count him as a William just because he goes by Bill?   There are other twists, such as two appointed and two elected Supreme Court justices, one of whom went by the middle name Glenn. Also, lieutenant governors are now elected as members of a party ticket, but were elected independently until 1889, so you can add two more Williams there. It’s entirely possible we’re missing some details here, such as a William who was elected state grapefruit juicer or state dog walker or some such. But we will concede that even if the total you come up with isn’t 26, it’s still way more than the number of women we counted. The women We counted eight different women who were actually elected to office, but we had to do some digging to reach that total. The Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University keeps tabs on women in statewide executive elections, providing a list for each state. The school said that in Florida, those women are: Name (Party) Office Years served Pam Bondi (R) Attorney general 2011-present Jennifer Carroll (R) Lieutenant governor 2011-2013 Alex Sink (D) Chief financial officer 2007-2011 Toni Jennings (R) Lieutenant governor 2003-2007 Katherine Harris (R) Secretary of state 1999-2003 Sandra Mortham (R) Secretary of state 1995-1999 Betty Castor (D) Education commissioner 1987-1993 Paula Hawkins (R) U.S. senator 1981-1987 Paula Hawkins (R) Public service commissioner 1973-1979 Mamie Eaton Greene Railroad commissioner 1927-1934 That appears to be nine — with Hawkins, the state’s only female senator, counted once — but remember a couple of points we’ve mentioned before. First is that there are fewer offices available, so some women have been elected to positions no one can seek today. Secretaries of state and education commissioners have been appointed since 2003, when the cabinet was cut in half to three spots. The Florida Public Service Commission chose three members by statewide election until 1979 (three were named William, by the way), but those positions are now appointed, too. Next is the caveat that lieutenant governors are elected on a party ticket, not independently. When Gov. Rick Scott won, Carroll won with him. For argument’s sake, we’ll count that as winning an election, but it’s worth noting the difference. Although she was the first female lieutenant governor, Jennings did not win by election and therefore doesn’t count for our purposes. She was chosen by then-Gov. Jeb Bush to succeed Frank Brogan, and took over in March 2003 right after Bush’s second term began. There have been other women in Florida’s offices, but very few were elected. Dorothy Glisson, for example, doesn’t make this tally even though she was the first woman to serve in a Florida Cabinet position. The longtime elections supervisor was appointed secretary of state by Gov. Reubin Askew in 1974 when her predecessor ran for Senate. And finally, keep in mind that women couldn’t run for office or even vote until 1920, so there are fewer decades from which to compile the list. Greene, who first got her seat as railroad commissioner because her husband died in 1927, became the first woman in Florida to win a state office when she ran for re-election in 1928. It’s hard to discern if a single-digit total, however you count it, means Florida is really lagging behind other states, though. Kathy Kleeman, the communications director at the Rutgers center, said because every state organizes differently, there’s no baseline for everyone to follow. Maine’s governor, for instance, is the state’s only statewide executive position. Georgia and North Dakota, meanwhile, have 13 positions that the center counts on its list. ""All of this makes comparing numbers almost meaningless and percentages not a whole lot better,"" Kleeman said. ""Still, seven — or even nine, as we show on our website — isn't very many in all those years, any way you cut it."" Our ruling Ruth’s List Florida said that ""26 men named William have been elected to statewide office and only seven women have had the honor."" Because of changes in state government and elections, plus how officeholders came by their positions, it’s difficult to parse the exact count the group came up with. The total of officials we could confirm were elected and not appointed was 14 Williams (although there could be more) and eight women. That’s off from the numbers in the email, but the gist of the statement is still defensible. There have been many more men named William than women holding major elected offices in Florida.

Scott Walker: Obamacare doesn’t require members of Congress to abide by the rules others do
","When he was a presidential candidate, Gov. Scott Walker was the first top-tier Republican contender to release a plan to replace Obamacare and has chastised GOP members of Congress who ran on repealing the Affordable Care Act only to delay a vote this year. His comments included areas that are still relevant to the debate. For example, in a Sept. 1, 2015 interview, CNBC Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood pressed Walker  on what he would do as president if he couldn’t garner enough votes to repeal Obamacare. ""What are you going to say when you’re president of the United States and you can’t get 60 votes in the Senate to repeal Obamacare and it’s too hard and your people say ‘Hey, Scott Walker you said you were gonna get rid of Obamacare’?"" ""We are going to do it,"" Walker replied. Then he followed up with a claim worthy of the Truth-O-Meter: ""Day One, I’m going to sign an executive order that gets rid of the special carve out that President Obama gave to the Congress that doesn’t require them to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do in terms of Obamacare."" (Walker made a similar pledge in the Sept. 16 presidential debate, days before he dropped out of the race.) So, are member of Congress playing by different rules? Congress and Obamacare U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, suggested back in 2009 that members of Congress experience the effects of the Affordable Care Act and be put in the same position as other Americans. He proposed an amendment, which was accepted by the Senate Finance Committee, that required members of Congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance through the exchanges established by the legislation. Here’s what the law said: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law … the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are -- (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)."" So, in a way, Congress does play by different rules -- but not in the way Walker suggests. They are required to use the Obamacare marketplaces while no one else is. Members of Congress and their staffs were previously insured through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which offers a range of plans with similar subsidies for premiums that nearly all large employers in the United States provide. That is, employees and their employers share in the cost. The switch to using the Affordable Care Act exchanges was scheduled for 2014. But vague language in the law left confusion about government (as the employer) contributions to health care plans. If members of Congress, along with their staffs, used the exchanges, they would no longer receive any assistance in paying for health care. What’s more, the salaries of staffers were too high to receive any level of the subsidies available to people in the insurance exchanges. So, congressional staffers would have paid full health care premiums out of pocket -- and Obamacare did not say employees were mandated to lose such benefits. What came next The health care reforms also established a marketplace for small businesses to sponsor health care coverage for their employees. In order to maintain the employer-sponsored coverage for Congress members and staffers, it was determined that the exchanges for small businesses would be a better fit. This led to some asserting that Congress was exempt from Obamacare. In August 2013, PolitiFact National rated False a claim by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that ""President Obama just granted all of Congress an exception"" to Obamacare. The claim was included in PolitiFact’s list of the Top 16 myths about the health care law. Walker used similar logic in his claim that Obamacare doesn’t require members of Congress ""to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do."" Walker’s team called the move to allow members of Congress and Congressional staffers to get care through the small business exchange ""legal gymnastics."" But Congressional offices do act like small businesses in many respects. Mark Peterson, a professor of public policy at UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs, said the parallel between small businesses and congressional offices became the foundation for allowing Congress and staffers to use the small business exchanges. ""Yes, those employed by them are federal employees,"" Peterson said. ""But unlike non-congressional employees, they are hired and fired by their sole boss -- the senator or representative -- not the government per se."" The law says businesses with fewer than 100 employees are eligible to use the exchange. Beginning in 2017, states can also allow large businesses to also use those marketplaces. Our rating Walker said Obamacare doesn’t require members of Congress ""to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do."" Members of Congress and their staffs use the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act just like their constituents would. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-obamacare-doesnt-require-members-cong/

Gilmore says prime-time GOP presidential debaters never served in military
","Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was not in a charitable mood Sept. 16 when he watched from afar as his 15 major rivals for the Republican presidential nomination debated on CNN. Gilmore was excluded because his polling numbers did not meet the 1 percent threshold for participation. He viewed the action from his campaign office in Alexandria -- first, the 90-minute ""undercard"" debate between the bottom four candidates, and then the three-hour main event among the top 11 that drew about 22.9 million viewers. Gilmore live-tweeted through it all, accusing his colleagues of misunderstanding issues, ducking questions and exhibiting facial expressions that were unpresidential. And then, there was this tweet, made during the 11-candidate debate: ""Not one candidate on the stage has military experience, and it shows,"" Gilmore wrote. We decided to check whether any of the prime-time debaters ever wore the uniform. Gilmore, it should be noted, has served in the military. Faced with a low draft number when he graduated from the University of Virginia in 1971, he enlisted in the Army for three years and served in the intelligence corps at NATO headquarters in Germany -- an experience he usually mentions in citing his qualifications for the White House. He rose to the rank of sergeant. As for the 11 debaters, we pored through biographies on their campaign websites and a variety of other authoritative sources for their resumes and backgrounds. No evidence of military service turned up for any of them. Three were old enough to be drafted during the Vietnam War -- Donald Trump, Ben Carson and John Kasich -- but managed to avoid conscription during an era when many college students received deferments from military service and draft numbers were determined by lottery drawings of birth dates. The draft effectively ended in December 1972, and the U.S. shifted to an all-volunteer military, but none of the candidates claims to have stepped forward either in the active military or the reserves. Participating in the main debate -- in addition to three candidates mentioned above -- were Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker (who since has dropped out of the race). The B Team What about the four Republicans who participated in the undercard debate? Although they were not included in Gilmore’s statement, we thought it would be interesting also to look at their records. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., served as an Air Force prosecutor from 1982 to 1988 and then spent 27 years as a reservist, first in the South Carolina Air National Guard and then transferring to the Air Reserve. Graham, who was not deployed for combat, retired as a colonel in June. His three debate partners -- Bobby Jindal, George Pataki and Rick Santorum -- list no military service in their resumes. The Democrats While we’re on the subject, let’s look at the military records of the five most prominent Democratic candidates. Nothing is listed for four of them: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley and Lincoln Chafee. Former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia served in the Marine Corps from 1969 to 1972, including a 13-month stint as a rifle platoon and company commander in Vietnam. Webb, a recipient of the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts, achieved the rank of captain.

No openly gay man elected to Legislature? True
","Just months after a historic U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, an Atlanta newspaper that focuses on LGBT news says Georgia may be poised to make history of its own. If elected, two announced candidates for seats in the Georgia House of Representatives would become the first gay men elected to the state Legislature, according to the Georgia Voice. ""Roughly a dozen have tried and failed in the last decade,"" Patrick Saunders wrote in the piece examining the campaigns of Rafer Johnson and Josh Noblitt. But gay lawmakers, and allies, led the unsuccessful fight against Georgia’s 2004 ban on same-sex marriage and were part of the effort to kill state religious freedom bills for the past two years. So with lawmakers pledging to bring back, for the third, time, the religious freedom bill, PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Did voters never send an openly gay man ever to the 236-member General Assembly? The relatively short history of gay lawmakers Openly gay state lawmakers are a somewhat new phenomenon, and not just in Georgia. The first such official appears to be now-U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, an open lesbian who was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 1992. She was one of just six openly gay political candidates to win a general election that year nationwide. A lesbian was also the first openly gay state lawmaker in Georgia. Democrat Karla Drenner was elected to the state House in 2000 and has since represented the District 85 in the Avondale Estates area. We reached out to Saunders for his source about openly gay men in the Legislature. He cited the paper’s own archives, including a story last year that highlighted three openly gay men running for the state House. All three of those candidates – Republican Christopher Deraney for House District 78 representing parts of Clayton County; Democrat Bob Gibeling for House District 54 in Buckhead; and Democrat Timothy Swiney for Senate District 9 in Gwinnett – lost. In the news The Atlanta Journal-Constitution archives turned up a record year in 2006, when four openly gay candidates ran in the primary election. Drenner won her first opposed election since her first win. The late Allen Thornell, a gay activist running for a district representing Cabbagetown in Atlanta, narrowly lost what was then described as the opportunity to be the first openly gay man elected as a legislator. The other two candidates lost. But what about the other gay lawmakers cited in news articles about the religious liberty bill and other issues since? Two lesbians, both Democrats, have been elected after Drenner. Simone Bell was elected to represent east Atlanta area neighborhoods in House Distict 58, the one that Thornell almost won previously, in 2009. Keisha Waites took office in 2012 representing House District 60, covering southeast Atlanta, Hapeville and parts of Clayton and DeKalb counties. And, one gay man has served. At 27, Rashad Taylor was the youngest member of the General Assembly when he was elected in 2008. But he was not elected as a gay man. He came out as gay in 2011, after an anonymous accuser sent an email to media accusing him of misconduct. Taylor lost re-election in 2012 after being placed in the same district as another Democrat by Republican lawmakers during a legislative redistricting. Saunders cited Taylor in his answer to us – and subsequently updated his story – to note that while Taylor had served, he had not been elected as an openly gay man. Outside groups There is little doubt that an openly gay elected state lawmaker would make the news. But Politifact Georgia also reached out to some advocacy groups that keep varying track of openly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people elected officials. The Victory Fund, which works to elect those candidates, is likely the best known on the national scene. However, officials from the Washington, D.C. group did not respond to emails and phone calls. A list of openly gay officials on the Victory Fund website was down, making their records unavailable for review. Jeff Graham of Georgia Equality, a nonpartisan LGBT advocacy group, said there wouldn’t have been any openly gay men on those lists anyway. Graham’s group follows elections in Georgia and has long been concerned with what he calls viable openly gay candidates. ""They need to be good quality candidates who can run a race and be feasible to win,"" Graham said. ""That takes financial resources, a good ground game to reach the voters and a good grasp of all issues. The last couple election cycles we’ve had openly gay men run but not run what I would consider viable campaigns."" That may, in fact, change in 2016. Johnson is a somewhat known community advocate who would represent a Democratic stronghold in House District 62, which includes portions of College Park, Douglasville, East Point and parts of Fulton and Douglas counties. Noblitt is a minister at Saint Mark United Methodist Church and close with state Rep. Margaret Kaiser, who is stepping down to make a run for mayor. The Democratic district includes several Atlanta neighborhoods such as Inman Park, Reynoldstown and Poncey-Highland. ""A lot of it has to do with a particular district, and I suspect the Ponce district is more amenable than others would be,"" said Kerwin Swint, the director of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. ""Things like this are going to happen very quickly and it could very quickly have an impact on the discussion at the Capitol,"" he added. Our ruling A newspaper focused LGBT news recently said that no gay man has ever been elected to the Georgia Legislature.

Ben Carson claimed program that led to 97% illegal immigration drop has been 'abolished'
","With a new poll showing him in a virtual tie with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, Ben Carson went on the Sunday news shows to talk politics. On ABC’s This Week, host Martha Raddatz grilled Carson about some of his comments on immigration. Carson, a resident of West Palm Beach, Fla., said he gets his information on immigration from local sheriffs and that he doesn’t trust figures from the federal government. ""You know, a lot of these people who are captured, it's ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) who comes along and says, you must release these people. And that's not helpful to the American people. They need to be working for the American people, not against them,"" Carson said. ""We've had examples like in Yuma County where we've been able to stop 97 percent of the illegal flow, and those programs, they abolish,"" Carson added. ""They don't want that. What is wrong with them?"" We too wondered why the government would abolish programs as effective as Carson said. So we checked it out, and found a lot more to the story of what was going on in Yuma County, Ariz. 97 percent The first thing we noticed about Carson’s statement was that it didn’t include a time frame. As we reviewed statistics about border apprehensions, we did find a precipitous drop in immigration for Yuma County, but it took place over at least a decade. And the drop matched the movement of the U.S. economy as it went from economic good times to deep recession. The U.S. Border Patrol reported that total illegal alien apprehensions in the Yuma area went from 138,438 in 2005 to 5,902 in 2014, a decline of 96 percent. (The entire Southwest border saw a decline of 59 percent during the same time period.)                     A report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, documented the decreases at Yuma and in other places since 1986; it noted that pinning down the precise causes of the decline in illegal immigration are difficult. ""The only significant decrease in unauthorized migration appears to have occurred since 2007, and it is unclear how much of the drop-off is due to increased enforcement and how much is a result of the U.S. economic downturn and other systemic factors,"" the report noted. A 2014 report in the Yuma Sun noted the low number of apprehensions in the Yuma sector, but credited it primarily to increased funding for border security, specifically more money for border fencing with special technology and more agents. Abolished program Carson made reference to effective programs that had been ""abolished."" The closest thing we could find was a federal program aimed at prosecuting illegal immigrants that was scaled back, but not abolished.  The program, called Operation Streamline, aimed to aggressively prosecute all those who attempted to illegally cross the border, including nonviolent, first-time offenders. Yuma County Sheriff Larry Leon Wilmot said he received notice from the U.S. attorney’s office that the program was being scaled back to focus on repeat offenders and those engaged in criminal activities. Wilmot notified members of the Arizona congressional delegation of the change, complaining it would undermine efforts at border control and would cause border patrol agents ""to feel betrayed by the very government that they serve.""                             ""This practice undermines everything that we have worked hard to achieve over the years for the citizens of Yuma County,"" Wilmot wrote. Others saw the program differently, with the main criticism being it was creating backlogs in federal courts for questionable reasons. ""The program, which mainly targets migrant workers with no criminal history, has caused skyrocketing caseloads in many federal district courts along the border,"" argued a 2010 policy brief from the Berkeley Law School’s Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity & Diversity. The Carson campaign told us that he wasn't singling out a single factor for what caused the drop in Yuma, and that the campaign stood by his statement.  Our ruling Carson said that Yuma County has been able to reduce illegal immigration by 97 percent, but that the federal programs that allowed them to do that had been ""abolished."" Carson didn’t mention the time frame on the reduction in Yuma County -- those numbers dropped from 2005 to 2014, and experts have credited the reduction to several factors, including a U.S. economic recession. Other factors receiving a share of were fencing construction and the number of border agents As for the federal programs that have been abolished, we found one program involving prosecutions that fit the bill, but it had been scaled back rather than eliminated, and it was, at most, one factor among many that are believed to have led to the drop. So while Carson has a point that illegal immigration has fallen significantly in Yuma County, he glosses over the time frame and incorrectly credits a program that was scaled back but not abolished. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/27/ben-carson/ben-carson-claimed-program-let-97-illegal-immigrat/

Jeb Bush says tax policies of George W. Bush 'created a dynamic effect of high growth'
","During his 2016 Republican presidential bid, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has periodically had to answer for the record of his brother, George W. Bush, and he had to do it again on a recent edition of Fox News Sunday. Host Chris Wallace asked Bush, ""Whether it was Ronald Reagan's tax cuts or your brother's tax cuts, they did add greatly to the deficit."" Bush responded, ""They didn't (add to the deficit) as greatly as the static thinkers on the left think. They created a dynamic effect of high growth. And that's what we need."" We didn’t recall rapid economic growth under Bush, so we thought we’d look at the past five presidents’ records in order to gauge Jeb Bush’s comments. We’ll start by noting that boiling down a president’s policies over one or two terms is tricky. For instance, in Reagan’s case, he is generally thought of as an aggressive tax-cutter, and it’s certainly true that he cut taxes sharply early in his term. But he also raised taxes. We gave a Mostly True rating to a recent claim by TV host Stephen Colbert that Reagan ""raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations."" For this reason, we’ll focus here on the most straightforward measure -- overall growth rates under each president. A look at the numbers We chose three measurements for comparing the five presidents. The most important statistic is the broadest one: the average annual increase in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product. Here’s a rundown of how the past five presidents have done on that score: Rank President Average annual GDP increase, inflation-adjusted 1 Clinton 3.9 2 Reagan 3.5 3 George H.W. Bush 2.3 4 George W. Bush 2.1 5 Obama 1.4 So by this measure, George W. Bush ranks second to last, undercutting Bush’s argument. What about the other yardsticks we checked? Bush did a bit better on these, though generally in the middle of the pack. Here’s how the presidents compare when measured by their single best year of inflation-adjusted GDP growth: Rank President Best year of inflation-adjusted GDP growth 1 Reagan 7.3 2 Clinton 4.7 3 George W. Bush 3.8 4 George H.W. Bush 3.7 5 Obama 2.5 And here’s how the five presidents compare on the number of years the economy exceeded 3 percent growth on their watch. Rank President Number of years of inflation-adjusted GDP growth of 3 percent or more 1 (tie) Clinton 6 1 (tie) Reagan 6 3 (tie) George W. Bush 2 3 (tie) George H.W. Bush 2 5 Obama 0 So Bush fares better on these other two measurements, but he still trails the two clear frontrunners in economic growth, Clinton and Reagan. Comparing Bush and Obama We should note that George W. Bush’s record on GDP growth does outpace Obama’s on each score, so to the extent that Jeb Bush was using Obama -- the president Bush hopes to succeed -- as a foil, he has a point. Still, it’s an exaggeration to tout George W. Bush’s economic record as one of ""high growth"" when compared to the records of Clinton and Reagan, and even to Bush’s father. As for Obama’s record, we’ll note that -- as low as it is on our rankings -- it’s still a work in progress. To calculate Obama’s record, we included the first two quarters of 2015. (Data for the third quarter is set to be released in October.) Given that Obama came into office in the midst of the Great Recession and that the recovery on his watch has been accelerating since 2010 -- albeit slowly -- Obama may ultimately overtake Bush when his final tally is available. Second-quarter growth for 2015 was 3.9 percent, which could suggest continued economic improvement in the months ahead. The Bush campaign’s response When we checked with Jeb Bush’s campaign, they made the point that because Wallace’s question referred to both Reagan and George W. Bush, Jeb Bush’s response was intended to refer to both presidents. But Reagan’s record on tax cuts was far more mixed than Bush’s; Reagan signed off on several significant tax increases. The Bush campaign also told PolitiFact that George W. Bush’s record is hampered by beginning with the economic impact of the 9/11 attacks and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. However, the same argument could be made -- and made even more strongly -- with the Great Recession inherited by Obama. Allocating credit and blame Finally, we will raise an issue that’s always relevant when comparing presidents on economic growth: It’s hard to determine credit or blame for economic performance on a president’s watch, because factors outside their control, from energy-price shocks to technological changes to pure luck, can have a significant impact. In addition, it’s unclear how much a president can influence the broader economy during their first year or two in office; for that early period, the legacy of their predecessor may have a greater impact. ""The economics research is mixed as to how much federal tax policies can affect economic growth,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed. Our ruling Jeb Bush said the tax policies of George W. Bush ""created a dynamic effect of high growth."" The definition of ""high,"" of course, is relative, but if you look at the most directly comparable examples -- the past five presidents’ records in average, annual, inflation-adjusted growth in gross domestic product -- George W. Bush ranked fourth among the five presidents, and trailed the two strongest presidents in this regard, Clinton and Reagan, by a particularly wide margin. (Reagan’s policies included both tax cuts and tax increases.) Bush has so far maintained a lead over Obama, although Obama’s tenure is not finished yet. Still, it’s always worth noting that a president’s impact on the economy is not all-encompassing. Overall, though, the evidence doesn’t show that high growth occurred in the wake of the Bush tax cuts. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/27/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-tax-policies-george-w-bush-created-d/

Ben Carson: Do any Muslim countries have women's rights, gay rights or religious freedom?
","Muslim values are inconsistent with American values, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said recently. Carson has been on the defense for saying he doesn’t believe a Muslim should be president. A couple of days later, in a Sept. 22 interview with Fox’s Megyn Kelly, the former neurosurgeon justified his position by criticizing the governments of Muslim countries for their human rights records. ""If you look throughout the world at Muslim government, I see discrimination against women, discrimination against gays, subjugation of other religious beliefs,"" said Carson, a resident of West Palm Beach, Fla. ""And I would be very interested in somebody showing me one of the Muslim nations where that is not occurring. I haven't seen it."" We decided to help Carson out and look into whether there are Muslim countries -- that is, those with a majority-Muslim population -- with governments that don’t discriminate against women, members of the LGBT community and religious minorities. Carson does have a point that a majority of the 50-odd Muslim countries do have poor records in all three categories. However, he overlooks some important exceptions. Women’s rights To assess women’s rights in these countries, we turned to the World Economic Forum’s 2014 Global Gender Gap Index, as well as the 2014 Social Institutions and Gender Index report published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. The Gender Gap Index ranks 142 countries based on gender disparities within each nation, including economic opportunity, educational attainment, political empowerment and health. The United States is No. 20, while Iceland is No. 1. By this measure, the 34 Muslim countries on this list don’t have a solid record on gender equality. Just eight crack the top 100 -- Kazakhstan (43), Kyrgyzstan (67), Bangladesh (68), Senegal (77), Albania (83), Azerbaijan (94), Indonesia (97) and Brunei (98). The OECD index instead measures how much gender discrimination a country’s institutions project. Although it isn’t ranked on the overall index list, the United States is listed as ""low"" or ""very low"" discrimination in all categories except ""civil liberties,"" for which it is labeled ""medium"" discrimination -- for reasons such as low numbers of female elected leaders and no national paid maternity or paternity leave. Of the 43 Muslim countries included in the report, most have ""high"" to ""very high"" levels of institutional discrimination in most categories. Just three are categorized as ""low"" discrimination across the board -- Kazakhstan, Morocco and Turkey. Labeled ""medium"" are Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Senegal and Indonesia. It’s also worth noting that multiple Muslim countries have had female heads of government or heads of state, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Turkey, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan and Senegal. Zakia Salime, an expert in gender and Islam at Rutgers University, also pointed out that numerous Muslim countries signed the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, while the United States did not. She added that abortion is legal in some Muslim countries, including Turkey. LGBT rights We had a little more trouble pinning down which, if any, Muslim countries have little institutional discrimination against the LGBT community. We did, at least, figure out which ones criminalize homosexuality, according to the Human Rights Campaign and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, both advocacy groups. Of 48 majority-Muslim countries, homosexual relations are legal in 13: Albania, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Mali, Tajikistan and Turkey. In some of these countries where homosexual activity is legal, there is still some institutional discrimination against LGBT people -- such as a ban on cross-dressing in Bahrain. In some other Muslim nations, homosexuality is legal in parts of the country. As for same-sex marriage, it is not legal in any majority-Muslim nation. Religious freedom As far as institutional challenges to religious freedom, we looked at democracy advocacy group Freedom House’s 2015 Freedom in the World report. In coming up with their overall freedom index, Freedom House scored each of the countries it assessed based on ""freedom of expression and belief."" The United States scored a 15 out of 16 in this category. Of the 47 Muslim countries included in the study, nine got a score higher than 10 out of 16 in ""freedom of expression and belief"": Tunisia (13), Sierra Leone (12), Senegal (15), Niger (11), Mali (11), Lebanon (11), Indonesia (12), Burkina Faso (13) and Albania (13). Notably, Senegal received the same score as the United States. But many Muslim countries got low scores in this category -- including seven nations that scored just a one or two. We also looked at Muslim countries in the State Department’s 2013 Religious Freedom Report. The department reported a vast majority of these countries as having some institutional restrictions on religious freedom. But the report said several Muslim countries had no significant restrictions -- mostly overlapping with the countries that received high scores on the Freedom House list. In sum While there are many majority-Muslim nations that do have a record of institutional discrimination against women, members of the LGBT community and religious groups, there are plenty of exceptions. These exceptions are enough to call into question Carson’s implication that none of the nearly 50 Muslim countries -- and by extension the world’s 1.7 billion Muslims -- respect these rights. Many Muslim countries have a longstanding tradition of democratic rule, particularly in the Far East, such as Bangladesh, said Ahmed Souaiaia, a professor of Islamic law and human rights at the University of Iowa. Souaiaia said he has conducted research in Tunisia, where religious minorities and women’s rights are protected in the country’s constitution. ""To reduce the actions, beliefs and views of 1.7 billion people to a stereotype is stunning,"" Souaiaia said. Our ruling Ben Carson said there is not ""one of the Muslim nations"" that doesn't have ""discrimination against women, discrimination against gays, subjugation of other religious beliefs."" Carson has a point that many countries with a majority-Muslim population do have poor records on institutional discrimination against women, members of the LGBT community and religious minorities. However, his broad-brush statement glosses over the fact that such policies are not universal. Numerous Muslim countries offer freedoms in each category. We rate the claim Mostly False. CLARIFICATION, Nov. 24, 2015: We've updated this article in response to a reader's suggestion, clarifying that the list of Muslim countries that have had female leaders includes both heads of state and heads of government.",/factchecks/2015/sep/25/ben-carson/ben-carson-do-any-muslim-countries-have-womens-rig/

The university said it would be subject to an excise tax of $36,500 per year per student employee if it continued its subsidies program, which was specifically designed to help graduate students pay for health insurance. To make up for the subsidies, MU announced it would give a one-time fellowship to all eligible graduate students. By law, the university couldn’t tell students the fellowships funds had to be used to purchase health insurance. On Aug. 21, after significant student pressure, MU announced it would ""defer implementation of its decision regarding graduate student health insurance,"" according to a letter by MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. In other words, the university reinstated graduate student health insurance subsidies — at least for the time being. Even after the university restored the subsidies, it wasn’t clear if MU’s initial withdrawal of the funds could be blamed on the Affordable Care Act, or if MU had actually broken the law by reinstating the benefits. We decided to take a look. ‘#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare’ MU student employees aren’t eligible for the group health plan the university offers to other workers. And, unlike other universities, MU doesn’t provide a student group health insurance plan. Instead, students — graduate and undergraduate — can opt to sign up for an individual health plan offered through Aetna Health. Some graduate students are eligible to receive subsidies from MU to pay for their insurance, according to the MU Office of Graduate Studies website.  To get the money, graduate students have to sign up for a student individual health plan provided by Aetna. Then, students must email the Office of Graduate Studies, which verifies enrollment in the plan and eligibility for subsidies. Students then receive a reimbursement for the insurance plan’s partial or total cost. Subsidy levels depend on, among other factors, the number of hours students work per week.  By asking students to enroll in an individual health plan to receive money, MU requires its student employees to use the subsidies to purchase insurance, said Sidney Watson, a health law professor at St. Louis University School of Law. That’s a big no-no, according to IRS regulations created to enforce the Affordable Care Act. According to the IRS, employers are allowed to give money to their employees that could go toward purchasing individual health insurance. But employers can’t require workers to use the cash specifically for that purpose, Watson said. To comply with the health care law, employers can provide subsidies — and require that the money be used to purchase health insurance — only to employees enrolled in a group plans.   And as we said, MU graduate students aren’t part of a group health plan. Hence the problem. In July, MU realized the potential implications of not complying with the law. The university pulled the subsidies to avoid penalties and legal trouble. Technically speaking, MU’s withdrawal of health insurance subsidies for graduate students is ""the result of the interpretation of the Affordable Care Act by the Treasury Department, because the Affordable Care Act itself doesn’t address this question,"" said Timothy Jost, a professor of health care law at Washington and Lee University. So, it’s not just the Affordable Care Act that caused the problem. But, the idea that the removal of benefits is a ""direct result of"" the Affordable Care Act isn’t too far from reality. Absent the Affordable Care Act, Jost said, it’s likely MU would still be able to legally provide subsidies for graduate students to purchase individual health plans. ""The basic problem with the statement is that it greatly oversimplifies a very complicated situation,"" Jost said. ‘#MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing’ By ""the right thing,"" Rowden meant ""give graduate students health insurance,"" Rowden’s legislative assistant Stuart Murray told PolitiFact Missouri.   By that measure it’s not correct to say MU broke the law, several experts who spoke to PolitiFact Missouri said. ""The university has other options; they do NOT have to break the law,"" said Gerald Kominski, a professor of health policy and management at University of California Los Angeles, in an email interview. MU could dodge legal trouble by adopting UCLA’s model, Kominski said. Health insurance is a mandatory for all UCLA students and it’s a condition of enrollment, according to the university’s website. UCLA automatically signs up all students in a student group health plan, which they’re all then billed for.  This effectively requires all graduate students who’ve received increased stipends to use the money to pay for insurance unless they can prove they have insurance from another source, Kominski said. Jost, the Washington and Lee law professor, came up with another alternative. ""(MU) could simply add (graduate students) to its employer plan as employees and give them employee coverage,"" he said. A comprehensive student group health plan would also solve the issue, said Philip G. Peters, Jr., MU health law professor emeritus. He also said this solution would be expensive for MU. The university’s original solution — providing stipends to all students that weren’t specifically earmarked for health insurance — was also within the framework of the law, said Watson, the SLU law professor.   Overall, the experts we spoke to offered at least five alternatives to the graduate health insurance ordeal. On balance, ""Rep. Rowden is partially correct and partially very wrong,"" Peters said. Our ruling Rowden tweeted: ""#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing."" Without the Affordable Care Act, MU wouldn’t have had to remove subsidies for graduate students. But MU can still provide health insurance for its student employees — all without breaking the law. The university could, for example, create a student group health plan for graduate its graduate student employees. The first part of Rowden’s tweet is accurate but takes things out context. The second part of the statement isn’t accurate. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/sep/25/caleb-rowden/columbia-lawmaker-says-mizzou-broke-obamacare-law-/

Sen. Jennifer Shilling says closed voucher school received $5.4 million
","Less than two weeks into the 2015-16 school year, Milwaukee voucher school Daughters of the Father Christian Academy closed its doors, sending the families of about 150 kids on a scramble to find a new school. In the wake of the closing -- triggered by a state Department of Public Instruction order questioning the qualifications of school administrators -- Democratic opponents of vouchers cited it as evidence that the program needed better oversight. Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) tweeted: ""GOP voucher school that closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening."" Is she right? About the program Voucher schools are private schools, usually religiously affiliated, that receive taxpayer dollars to pay for the tuition of lower-income students. As part of the 2015-’17 state budget, the Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Scott Walker raised the limit on how many students statewide can participate in the program. The program, which began in Milwaukee, had been extended statewide two years earlier. About 26,900 Milwaukee students are enrolled in voucher schools, according to the Department of Public Instruction and the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. In addition, there are about 1,700 students in Racine and 1,000 statewide who were part of the program in the 2014-15 school year. The Milwaukee program cost about $191 million. Other schools statewide cost an additional $22 million Supporters say voucher schools give parents a valuable choice of where to send their children, particularly where local public schools may be low-performing. Critics say the voucher program is a drain on public school budgets and the private schools do not always adhere to the same educational standards. What about Daughters of the Father? Shilling’s claim seems pretty straightforward. But her tweet can read as saying the school had received the money and then quickly closed. In other words, that the school was new and the $5.4 million was immediately lost to taxpayers. But that’s not exactly what happened. Daughters of the Father first opened its doors in 2007-08 and had just begun its ninth year. Records show it had 153 students in 2014-15 and through the state’s voucher program received about $7,200 that year for each student. That tallies out to more than $1.1 million. The school ran into financial trouble that led to canceled bus service at the end of the school year. In a May 14, 2015 press release executive director Doris Pinkley blamed lower-than-expected enrollment. After a change in the school’s leadership, the state Department of Public Instruction determined the school had failed to comply with statutory and administrative rules governing participation in the voucher program. The department issued an order Aug. 4, 2015 banning the school from participating in the voucher program because the school did not have a qualified administrator on staff. The principal had only an expired substitute teacher's license. The $5.4 million represents the total the school has received since its inception. In all, the state has terminated 57 schools from the voucher program since the 2003-04 academic year, although some of them were schools that ceased operating on their own. Those schools had been paid a total of $176 million. Our rating Shilling tweeted that the Daughters of the Father Christian Academy ""closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening."" The school did not just open its doors, receive $5.4 million and quickly close. The school had operated for eight years. The money represents the amount received since it opened.

Stephen Colbert brings up Ronald Reagan's tax-raising record in Ted Cruz interview
","Stephen Colbert has interviewed a slew of presidential candidates in the first weeks of his new job hosting CBS’ The Late Show, including Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. His time with Cruz on Sept. 21 stood out for a fact-filled back and forth about a major Republican role model, President Ronald Reagan. Colbert asked Cruz if he could agree with Reagan’s support of amnesty for undocumented immigrants and record of raising taxes amid budget shortfalls. Cruz said ""of course not"" before pivoting to Reagan’s most conservative accomplishments, one being that he ""signed the largest tax cut in history"" and spurred economic growth. ""You know, when Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There’s only one other four-year period where that’s true. That’s true from 2008 to 2012,"" Cruz said. Colbert jumped in, saying ""But when conditions changed in the country, he reversed his world’s ‘largest tax cut’ and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations. So it’s a matter of compromising."" PolitiFact explored Cruz’s point about economic growth in another fact-check. We wondered if Colbert’s retort was on the money or overstated. (It’s our first fact-check of Colbert in his new role — and the first one in five years, period.) Did Reagan really shift course on tax cuts when the growth stopped? A CBS press contact did not return an email for comment. Reagan’s tax cut As Cruz said, the Gipper really did cut taxes — with the help of Congress — in his first year as president. The ""largest tax cut in history"" that Cruz mentioned is in reference to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, a $38 billion phased-in cut ($99 billion in 2015 dollars). Put in the way that economists prefer to discuss tax cuts, it represented 1.91 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. This law included across-the-board cuts of about 30 percent to statutory income tax rates.   As Colbert said, Reagan raised taxes, too. Two laws, one in 1982 and another in 1984, were especially dramatic. These laws generally raised taxes by removing tax loopholes, not by raising the tax rate, said Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Still, Baker said, ""the loopholes were big ones."" Reagan’s tax increases 1982: The most significant tax increase Reagan signed was also the first. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (yes, another law with a very sexy name) increased taxes by almost 1 percent of GDP. The 1982 tax increase was ""probably the largest peacetime tax increase in American history,"" said economist Bruce Bartlett, who advised Reagan on domestic policy and then worked as Treasury deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the George H.W. Bush administration. (An analysis by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, agrees.) This law was driven by pressure to attack the federal budget deficit, as well as the impression that Reagan’s tax-cutting was partially responsible for lower-than-expected tax revenues. Bartlett, who reviewed Reagan’s tax record for Tax Notes in 2011, cited a Treasury estimate that the 1982 law raised taxes by almost 1 percent of GDP, or about $150 billion in modern dollars. Specifically, it rolled back some but not all of the 1981 tax cut for writing off equipment, and it repealed 1981 ""safe harbor"" leasing provisions, said Stephen J. Entin, senior fellow at the Tax Foundation and former deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the Reagan administration. 1983: A law Reagan signed in 1983 aimed to keep Social Security afloat by increasing payroll taxes and taxing Social Security benefits for some high-earners. This cost $24.6 billion, or almost $50 billion in 2015 dollars, through 1988, according to an administration estimate. 1984: The Deficit Reduction Act that Reagan signed rolled back part of the 1981 cut on buildings, Entin said, with the idea that Congress would enact spending cuts. ""But many of those cuts were either never enacted or were later restored,"" Entin said. This led to $25 billion in tax receipts. Reagan also signed tax increases in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 (as well as a couple other laws with revenue reductions). So where does that leave Reagan’s tax record on the whole? It’s mixed. On one hand, revenues were lower as a share of GDP in his last year in office (17.6 percent of GDP in 1988) compared to the year before he took office (18.5 percent of GDP in 1980), according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. However, the thrust of the 1981 tax cut that Cruz touted on Colbert’s show didn’t prove to have lasting effects on the whole. A 2006 Treasury Department analysis offers another view of the plunge after the 1981 law and the subsequent changes that wound it back.  Reagan’s staff tallied up the effect of major legislation on tax receipts over his tenure for his final budget proposal (page 4-4). The 1981 tax cuts comprised most of the total $275 billion in tax relief, but the other side of the ledger listed $133 billion in cumulative tax increases.   ""Thus, Reagan took back about half the 1981 tax cut with subsequent tax increases,"" Bartlett wrote. Our ruling Responding to Cruz’s assertion that Reagan ""signed the largest tax cut in history,"" Colbert said he ""reversed"" it and ""raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations."" Legislation that Reagan signed over his time in office and raised taxes did not completely reverse the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act. But the broader point Colbert makes is on point. Reagan agreed to raise taxes to deal with budget deficits, even if he wasn’t enthusiastic about it.

Ted Cruz says slow economic growth under Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama stands apart
","Newly installed CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert tangled, politely, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on his Sept. 21 show regarding the legacy of President Ronald Reagan. Colbert asked Cruz, who’s running for the Republican presidential nomination, whether he could agree with Reagan’s support of ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants and the late president’s willingness to raise some taxes amid budget shortfalls. Cruz said ""of course not"" before pivoting to Reagan’s most conservative accomplishments, one being that he ""signed the largest tax cut in history"" and spurred economic growth. ""When (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year,"" Cruz said. ""There’s only one other four-year period where that’s true. That’s true from 2008 to 2012."" His point was that Reagan rescued the U.S. economy from the ravages it suffered under his Democratic predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, and that the only other equivalent economic distress occurred under Carter’s fellow Democrat, Barack Obama. Colbert responded, ""But when conditions changed in the country, he reversed his world’s ‘largest tax cut’ and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations. So it’s a matter of compromising."" We wondered if Cruz was correct about the periods of low GDP growth. (In a separate fact-check, we explore Colbert’s rejoinder.) Excepting the unusual post-World War II period of 1945 through 1949 -- when the nation was demobilizing from an all-encompassing war -- Cruz has put his finger correctly on the two general periods in which the annual average growth of gross domestic product over four-year periods has sunk below 1 percent. They are the late 1970s era of ""stagflation"" (that is, stagnant growth combined with rapid inflation) and the aftermath of the Great Recession. The full annual data can be found here. But there were actually three distinct four-year periods during and after the Great Recession that fit Cruz’s criteria, rather than one -- that is, the four-year periods starting with 2006, 2007 and 2008. (With every four-year period beginning after 2009, average annual GDP growth has exceeded 1 percent.) Here’s the rundown of the four post-World War II periods that fit Cruz’s criteria: First year Second year Third year Fourth year Average annual GDP growth 1979 1980 1981 1982 0.2 percent 2006 2007 2008 2009 0.3 percent 2007 2008 2009 2010 0.4 percent 2008 2009 2010 2011 0.4 percent So Cruz overlooked two additional four-year periods. Also, the implication of his comment -- that Democrats bear the primary responsibility for these periods of poor economic growth -- is not so clear. For starters, as we’ve discussed previously, economists say it’s hard to determine how much credit or blame a president deserves for successes or shortcomings in the economy at large on their watch. Factors outside their control, from energy-price shocks to technological changes to pure luck, can have a significant impact on the nation’s economic record. In addition, Cruz’s groupings suggest some contradictory standard-setting. For the 1979-1982 period, Carter was in office for the first two years and Reagan was in office for the third and fourth years. But in the next two periods -- 2006-2009 and  2007-2010 -- George W. Bush, a Republican, was president for at least half of the time. In fact, Bush was in charge for the first three years in 2006-2009, and the first two years in 2007-2010. If Carter, Democrat, is to take blame for the slow growth in the first period, then logically Bush, a Republican, should shoulder the same blame in the next two four-year periods. By the same token, if Reagan, a Republican, escapes blame in the first example, then so too should Obama in the second and third four-year periods. And the 2005-2008 period -- which occurred entirely on Bush’s watch -- barely escapes inclusion on this list, with an average annual growth rate of 1.13 percent. (During the 2008-2011 period, Obama was president for the final three of those years.) Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said he doesn’t blame either Reagan or Obama for the economic shortcomings early in their tenures that fall under Cruz’s statistical claim. Still, he sees a logical inconsistency in Cruz’s comparison as stated on Colbert’s show. ""It seems doubtful whether poor economic performance early in any president's term can be attributed to the impact of his administration's policies,"" Burtless said. ""If you take office when economic output is plunging, it does not seem legitimate to attribute the economic plunge to the person who just took office."" He added a footnote: Unlike Obama, who unquestionably inherited a recession already under way, the economy actually grew through the first couple of months of Reagan’s first term. GDP grew in the third and fourth quarters of 1980, right before he was elected, and continued to grow during the first quarter of 1981 after he was in office, before a ""double-dip"" recession hit. Cruz spokesman Phil Novack told PolitiFact that our analysis misses the point. ""The focus on who exactly held office in each of those individual time periods is not as important as the contrast between the two periods in terms of how quickly the economy was growing before and after those identified time periods, which is the point Cruz was making,"" Novack said. ""His point was obviously referring to policy results, and we know the results of the policies that followed those slow-growth years of below 1 percent growth that Sen. Cruz identified. Reagan's policies brought us a boom, and Obama's policies have been a bust."" For what it’s worth, we also compared Carter and Reagan on their economic records and found them more similar than one might expect. During Carter’s four years in office, the growth rate averaged 3.23 percent a year. If you take the first four years of Reagan’s presidency, it averaged 3.34 percent. Essentially, each president had two good years and two bad years, which more or less averaged out. Our ruling Cruz said that ""when (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There’s only one other four-year period where that’s true. That’s true from 2008 to 2012."" Cruz missed two other four-year periods that fit the criteria. In addition, his implication -- that Democrats are largely to blame for those conditions -- doesn’t stand up to logical consistency, particularly when he excluded the period beginning in 2006 (which included three years solely under Bush) and 2007 (which included two years solely under Bush). This goes on top of general uncertainty about how much blame to assign presidents for poor economic conditions.

Don Zimmerman says non-city workers haven't seen 3 percent salary increases the past several years
","The salaries of Austin residents who don't work for city government ""have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years."" Austin City Council Member Don Zimmerman objected to a 3 percent pay raise for Austin city employees partly by saying other Austin residents haven’t landed similar hikes. An Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Sept. 1, 2015, quoted Zimmerman, the District 6 Austin City Council member, telling colleagues that Austin residents who aren’t city employees face the same taxes, fees and utility bills that employees confront. ""And,"" Zimmerman said, ""their salaries have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years."" In recent years, city employees actually fielded raises ranging from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent; the council gave no raises in the 2009-10 budget year. Days after Zimmerman piped up, the council voted 9-2, with Zimmerman voting ""no,"" for a 2015-16 budget that includes 3 percent raises for the city’s 12,000 workers. Brian Kelsey, principal of Civic Analytics, an Austin economic consulting firm, urged us to check Zimmerman’s 3-percent analysis, saying on Twitter the declaration seemed like a candidate for our Truth-O-Meter. We embarked on this fact check with some wariness. Outside of government, which is subject to open-records laws, who knows about anyone else’s pay? With guidance from expert number-crunchers, we landed several federal estimates for average changes in overall wages paid Austin-area workers, though we didn’t identify data strictly limited to people working in Austin. Zimmerman’s backup To get started, we asked Zimmerman how he reached his conclusion. He put us in touch with his chief of staff, Joe Petronis, who emailed a spreadsheet drawing on Occupational Employment Statistics collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that include wage estimates for over 800 occupations nationally and, closer to home, metropolitan statistical areas. The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos MSA takes in Travis County, home to the capital, plus nearby Hays, Bastrop, Caldwell and Williamson counties. Petronis focused on changes in median hourly wages across all occupations (including city workers) in the region from May 2010 to May 2014. These data suggest the 2012 hourly median of $17.12 in the Austin region was down 0.5 percent from the 2011 median of $17.20. In 2013, per the Occupational Employment Statistics, the $17.48 in median hourly wages was up 2.1 percent from the year before and the 2014 median hourly wage of $17.62 was up 0.8 percent from the 2013 median, all figures we confirmed on a BLS website. That’s one way of ballparking wage changes. Then again, Beverly Kerr, a lead researcher for the Austin Chamber of Commerce, pointed out by email that the government counsels against using OES data to compare figures from different years. ""This is not the best dataset to use to compare the changes in wages over time,"" Kerr wrote. The bureau’s explanation/warning (question F. 1. here) runs nearly 1,100 words, a lot of that about how definitions of jobs and industries and even geographical classifications change. Yet Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based BLS spokeswoman, replied to us by email that while the OES and another bureau data set, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, aren’t intended for use as ""a time series,"" topline pay-change comparisons we were considering made the caveats less worrisome. Other analyses It turned out there are many ways to attempt wage-change comparisons. Kerr and Abbot each said the bureau’s quarterly census would be the most comprehensive way to gauge pay changes among workers not employed by the city. The census, which launched in the 1930s, tracks employment and wages of establishments which report to the federal government’s unemployment insurance programs, hence representing about 97 percent of the nation’s civilian wage and salary civilian employment. Abbot sent us a chart showing, per the quarterly census, 10 years of changes in average weekly wages for people working in Travis County, enabling us to calculate that wages for individuals employed in the county, including city employees, escalated an average of nearly 3 percent a year from 2010 through 2014. This figure rolled in changes in wages for city employees and other government workers. But it’s also possible to isolate changes in wages solely for local government workers, including city employees, which the census indicates increased an average of nearly 2 percent a year. According to the chart, average wages for private-sector workers employed in the county rose an average 2.7 percent a year over the five years. And, in keeping with Zimmerman’s claim, what of the last several years? Wages for all workers in the county escalated an average 3.1 percent in 2012, 1.1 percent in 2013 and 4.2 percent in 2014, according to the bureau’s census. Meantime, private-sector wages went up 3.3 percent on average in 2012; decreased 0.2 percent in 2012; and increased 3.9 percent in 2014, Abbot’s chart indicated. BLS analyst suggests regional focus We pressed Abbot on how best to gauge pay raises for Austin residents not working for the city. She suggested we look at changes in private industry average weekly wages per the quarterly census across the five-county Austin MSA rather than in the county alone. ""This QCEW measure is as close as the bureau can come to average annual pay raises for Austin workers, excluding city employees,"" Abbot emailed, though she noted that her run through the data excluded all government workers, leaving out workers at every level from the city, county, state and federal offices. According to the quarterly census, the average weekly wage in the five-county region across private industries escalated 3 percent in 2012 to $1,023, decreased 0.5 percent in 2013 to $1,018 and increased 3.6 percent to $1,055 in 2014. YEAR AVG WEEKLY WAGE, ALL PRIVATE INDUSTRIES, AUSTIN MSA CHANGE (%) 2012 1023 3.0 2013 1018 -0.5 2014 1055 3.6 SOURCE: Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, U.S. Bureau of Labor (chart received by email from Cheryl Abbot, regional economist, BLS, Sept. 22, 2015) Kerr offered up another data source overseen by the bureau, its Current Employment Statistics, which Kerr tapped to find that annual private industry wages increased in the five-county region by an average 2.2 percent from 2008 through 2014 with average annual raises ranging from 1.3 percent to 4.8 percent. Most recently, average wages were up 1.1 percent in 2012; increased 3.2 percent in 2013; and rose 4.1 percent in 2014, Kerr’s chart indicates. When we asked, Abbot called the survey-based CES a ""perfectly valid choice"" for gauging wage changes. But we couldn’t make a run at checking changes in median wages per the quarterly census or CES. Abbot told those data sets don’t produce median figures. Next, we spotted data posted by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis indicating that the average wage per job in the Austin region escalated 3.6 percent from 2010 to 2011; 3 percent from 2011 to 2012--and a scant 0.1 percent from 2012 to 2013, the latest period analyzed. Our ruling Zimmerman said the salaries of Austin residents who don't work for city government ""have not been going up 3 percent a year for the last several years."" By various indicators, wages of Austin-area workers have not gone up 3 percent every year, as Zimmerman said. Yet some measures suggest there were some 3 percent (or better) average increases though we also found evidence of an average wage decline one recent year.

Claim about Atlanta's affordable housing hits the mark
","For somewhere between $1,400 and $4,000 a month, you can rent in the luxury apartment complex Inman Quarter in Atlanta’s Old Fourth Ward. But you’ll also need to earn at least $48,000 – and up to $160,000 – a year to afford skyline views without spending more than 30 percent of your income on a (fancy) roof over your head. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Census Bureau both consider those who pay more than that to be ""cost burdened,"" since they may have difficulty paying for other necessities such as food and medical care. Housing advocates, including Atlanta Progressive News CEO Matthew Charles Cardinale, worry that those people are getting lost in the newly energized Atlanta housing market. ""Tens of thousands of Atlanta households are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent,"" Cardinale recently wrote in the Saporta Report. ""This includes more than 25,000 cost-burdened renter households subsisting on $20,000 or less per year,"" he continued. In a market of gleaming new developments targeting high-end renters, do that many people needed less pricey options? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. Housing in Atlanta We reached out to Cardinale to ask his source, and he pointed us to a 2015 update of last year’s Atlanta’s housing strategy report. A chart on page 10 of the report, shows about 27,000 households that make $20,000 or less and another 13,000 households with incomes between $20,000 and $35,000 spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2012. Cardinale said that shows the city’s own data back up his proposal, to require new developments list how much of their complexes will be at or below 30 percent of the city’s median income, as well as how many will fall between 30 and 50 percent, between 50 and 80 percent and more than 80 percent. ""It would basically be an affordable housing scorecard, not requiring projects to include affordable housing but to provide information on what’s being done,"" Cardinale said. The recommendation has been pending in a City Council committee since November. Yet Mayor Kasim Reed has, under the housing strategy, pledged to cut by 10 percent the number of residents who are cost burdened on rent by 2020, according to an opinion piece this summer by his deputy planning commissioner. The Census estimates The city may have its work cut out for it on that front. To verify the strategy report, we looked at the Census data cited in the chart. The 2012 American Community Survey estimates that of 103,219 households in Atlanta in 2012, 50,509 of them spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing. That’s 49 percent of city households – and 10,000 more than plotted in the city’s chart. The survey for 2014, released just last week, isn’t even that rosy. Of 105,999 households now estimated in the city, 52,787 of them paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent in the past 12 months. That’s just a hair under half of households. The only improvement? Those scrambling the most to keep up with rent – households spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing – dipped by 574 households, to 27,100 in 2014. That’s a full percentage drop – but still 26 percent out of city households. How does Atlanta stack up? For context, PolitiFact Georgia tried to find out if one out of every four households spending half of their income for a place to sleep was unusual. Sadly, not really. Renters are on the rise in the 11 most populous American metro areas, Atlanta included. A May report by New York University's Furman Center, which studies real estate and urban policy, and Capital One bank, found each of those cities saw the amount of rental housing grow faster than any increase in owner-occupied homes in 2013. Yet despite that growth, renters everywhere struggled to keep up with increasing rents and shrinking vacancies. Atlanta, for instance, saw the vacancy rate drop from 16 percent to 9.9 percent between 2006 and 2013. Median monthly rents, meanwhile, jumped 8 percent in that period, from $888 to $963. And in Atlanta and the other 10 cities, more than three out of every five low-income renters were severely rent burdened – paying more than half of their income on rent. Our ruling A left-leaning housing advocate championed a scorecard of new housing development in Atlanta by claiming that ""tens of thousands"" of households in the city paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent. They do, whether looking at the city’s housing strategy plan or the 2012 U.S. Census estimates that shaped the report. By 2014, those estimates had grown even worse. And, Matthew Charles Cardinale would have been on target with an even more dramatic claim: More than a quarter of Atlanta households spent more than half of their incomes on housing. Atlanta faces the same challenges as other large cities in serving a growing rental population. To do so will require the right data. And Cardinale hits the mark with his claim about affordable housing in Atlanta.

Do Donald Trump, Pope Francis and Tammy Baldwin all agree on eliminating a tax break?
","U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin was interviewed on ""The Devil's Advocates"" radio program on Sept. 23, 2015, the day before Pope Francis made his historic appearance before a joint session of Congress. The hosts of the Madison-based talk show asked Baldwin, a Democrat, about her expectations for the address. Then they shifted to a bill introduced by Baldwin to get rid of ""carried interest,"" which she describes as a tax loophole that unfairly benefits Wall Street investment managers. Host Mike Crute said: ""Tammy, I never thought I would find the day where Donald Trump, the pope and you all agree that the carried interest loophole should be closed. This is contributing to the income inequality we have here in our nation."" Baldwin replied by asking, with a chuckle: ""So which of those three people surprise you the most, in terms of supporting that?"" Crute said: ""I would say Donald Trump, quite frankly. I think he sort of let out the secret."" Then Baldwin said: ""I’m teasing you, I’m teasing you,"" and Crute continued with serious questions about her proposal. A few minutes later, after Baldwin discussed carried interest in detail, host Dominic Salvia asked Baldwin if anyone opposes her proposal. Baldwin said: ""Yes, there are people who oppose this change, otherwise it would have probably been law by now. But I do have to just say that I agree with you that when the pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree on an important tax change, maybe it should be getting swifter consideration than it has gotten to date."" As one wag put it on Twitter: ""That’s one heck of a hot tub."" A spokesman in Baldwin’s office told us the senator was not saying that the pope has endorsed the legislation, and that the conversation was about closing the carried interest loophole and the larger issue of income inequality. But she did state that both Trump and the pope agree with her proposal. Do they? ""Carried interest"" ""Carried interest,"" as described by The Wall Street Journal, is a ""much-criticized"" tax break that allows investment managers to treat much of their income as capital gains. That means the money typically is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary wage income. The current capital gains rate for high earners is 23.8 percent, while the top ordinary income tax rate is 39.6 percent. Some praise the tax break as a contributor to the growth of the investment management, private equity, real estate and energy industries, and as having had a positive effect on the overall economy and increasing tax revenues. Bills to end, or limit, carried interest have passed the House of Representatives four times, most recently in 2010, but died in the Senate, according to the publication Pensions & Investments. In June 2015, Baldwin and another Democrat, U.S. Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, introduced a bill to end carried interest, with Levin saying it was unfair that such higher-income earners paid lower income tax rates than other Americans. The measure would increase tax collections by $15.6 billion over 10 years, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. The effort for repeal got a boost in September 2015, when Obama called for ending carried interest. But a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee -- where the bill has been referred -- has said the issue should be considered only in the context of comprehensive tax reform. So, Baldwin is among a number of Democrats seeking to repeal carried interest. But what about Trump – and the pope? The Donald and the pontiff It turns out that Trump -- as well as another leading GOP presidential contender, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – have called for ending carried interest. Indeed, Democrats have celebrated their remarks. In one interview, Trump said: ""I would take carried interest out, and I would let people that are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because right now they’re paying very little tax, and I think it’s outrageous."" OK. But has Pope Francis stated a position on a tax loophole that most Americans have never heard of? Indeed, it would be rare for the pope to comment on any piece of legislation, much less one dealing with an arcane tax provision. Perhaps Baldwin was assuming his support, based on statements that Francis -- who promotes a Catholic church that ""is poor and for the poor"" -- has made about economic inequality. For example, in 2013, in the first major work he authored as pope, Francis said: ""We can no longer trust in the unseen forces and the invisible hand of the market. Growth in justice requires more than economic growth, while presupposing such growth: it requires decisions, programs, mechanisms and processes specifically geared to a better distribution of income, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality."" But we could not find any instances of the pope speaking about carried interest, let alone Baldwin’s specific proposal. Moreover, his practice is to make broad statements, aimed at global audience, not to comment on one bill in one country. Simply put, there is no way to know based on his general statements whether the pontiff would support any particular legislation. Our rating Baldwin said: ""The pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree"" on eliminating the ""carried-interest"" tax break. Trump has called for ending the tax break for investment managers that Baldwin is seeking to repeal with a bill she introduced. But while Pope Francis has called for helping the poor and addressing economic inequality, we could not find that has spoken out on this particular tax break. And his practice is to make broad policy statements, not to comment on an individual piece of legislation. If it turns out the pope has spoken about carried interest, we will review this item, but for now we rate Baldwin's statement Half True.

Jay Nixon says Missouri is No. 1 in nation for 'holding down tuition increases'
","In August, Gov. Jay Nixon visited colleges throughout the state to announce that the schools would be receiving funding for renovations and improvements to their campuses, as part of Missouri’s Building Affordability initiative. The initiative aims to invest $200 million in higher education in the state as a means of reducing tuition hikes.   As part of the promotion for this initiative, Nixon tweeted on Aug. 12 ""#BuildingAffordability will help ensure #MO remains #1 in the nation for holding down tuition increases at public universities"" Nixon made a similar statement during an Aug. 24 appearance at Southeast Missouri State University. Samantha Rinehart of the Southeast Missourian reported that Nixon said ""Missouri has held down tuition costs in its public four-year institutions to the lowest level in the nation."" Missouri is the nation’s leader in holding back tuition increases? We were curious to see if this was the case. We contacted the governor's press secretary, Scott Holste, to find out where Nixon was getting his information. Holste cited a study called Trends in College Pricing published by the College Board, a not-for-profit organization that, among other things, conducts research on college institutions. Holste also provided us with a spreadsheet of data from the study supporting the governor's assertion. The percentile change of the average in-state tuition and fees for public four-year institutions between the 2008-09 school year and the 2014-15 school year was only 7.08 percent. That’s indeed best in the nation. Maine was in second place. We pulled our own copy of the College Board's data from their website to verify the governor's information. It checks out. Here’s the top 10, by percentage. Rank State Tuition increase between 2008-09 and 2014-15 school years (by pct.) 10 Nebraska 14.77% 9 North Dakota 13.59% 8 Oklahoma 12.84% 7 Iowa 12.76% 6 New Jersey 11.69% 5 Ohio 10.04% 4 Maryland 8.96% 3 Montana 8.64% 2 Maine 7.69% 1 Missouri 7.08% Source: The College Board There are a few caveats worth noting. 1. The College Board data for the six years cited by the governor show that among states, districts and territories included in the data, Puerto Rico has kept tuition increases in check more than Missouri, with a change of 4.7 percent. However, among the 50 states, Missouri is the leader. 2. Judging purely by tuition hikes fails to show the complete picture. For the 2014-15 semester, College Board reported that in-state tuition and fees at public four-year institutions in Missouri averaged $8,383. If we were ranking the states from lowest average tuition to highest, Missouri would rank 22nd in the country. Louisiana, for instance, has had sharper tuition increases than many of its peers in recent years. But it still has a lower average tuition than Missouri. Looking at the average cost of tuition puts Missouri in a different light. Sandy Baum, co-author of the College Board study and professor at George Washington University, noted that while the scale of time may be arbitrary, Missouri is still doing quite well as far as tuition hikes are concerned. Over the last 10 years, the tuition average for Missouri has only increased 12.31 percent, while the national average for tuition increases over the last 10 years is nearly 42 percent. Our ruling Nixon tweeted that Missouri is ""#1 in the nation for holding down tuition increases at public universities."" When looking at the period between 2008-09 and today, Nixon is accurate, College Board information shows. But that doesn’t mean tuition is cheap in Missouri. The state ranks 22nd in its tuition rate. Nixon’s statement lacks that caveat. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/sep/24/jay-nixon/jay-nixon-says-missouri-no-1-nation-holding-down-t/
