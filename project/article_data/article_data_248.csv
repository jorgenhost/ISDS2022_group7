President Obama says Gov. Perry used stimulus fund to help balance budget, then started 'blaming' federal lawmakers who voted for legislation
","
Asked by a Dallas television reporter whether he agreed with Texas leaders that the federal government should take some governing cues from the Lone Star State, President Barack Obama said he saw ""a little inconsistency"" in that position. 
""Keep in mind, Gov. (Rick) Perry helped balance his budget with about $6 billion worth of federal help, which he happily took, and then started blaming the members of Congress who had offered that help,"" Obama said during an April 18 interview with WFAA reporter Brad Watson at the White House. 
That so? 
We started our fact-check with Obama’s budget claim. 
Adam Abrams, a White House spokesman, told us that Obama was referring to stimulus funds when he said Perry plugged the budget with federal aid. 
The roughly $800 billion federal stimulus package, named the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by Congress, became law in February 2009 after receiving only three Republican votes, all in the Senate. State governments were the primary recipients of the money, although funds have also gone directly to entities such as schools, hospitals and utilities. 
The law specified that governors had 45 days after its passage to certify that their state would ""request and use"" the offered funds. On Feb. 18, 2009, Perry sent Obama the requisite letter of certification, assuring the president that the state would accept the funds and use them ""in the best interest of Texas taxpayers."" 
According to a February 2009 PBS News Hour online post, some stimulus money was meant ""to help states avoid slashing funding for education and other programs that lawmakers could trim to offset shortfalls."" 
Abrams, asked for backup for the president’s statement, pointed us to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which in turn sent us its July 2009 report on state budgets. According to the report, state budget-writing Texas lawmakers in 2009 were short $6.6 billion in revenue for 2010-11 and relied heavily on stimulus funds for a solution. 
We did our own budget research, finding that lawmakers agreed to spend $80.6 billion in state general revenue on basic expenses over the two-year period, according to a report by the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. 
However, the stimulus aid let legislators put an additional $6.4 billion toward programs, primarily Medicaid and education, historically financed with general revenue, according to a July 2009 House Research Organization report. Another $5.7 billion in stimulus money went to programs such as highway and bridge construction, child care development programs and weatherization assistance. 
Counting all funding sources, including the $12.1 billion in stimulus aid, the 2010-11 state budget totaled $182 billion. 
So, Obama’s dollar figure holds up. 
What about his claim that after accepting the stimulus money, Perry started blaming members of Congress who voted for the bill — almost all of them Democrats? 
We searched news archives and websites for such jabs.

For the record, Perry has long aired anti-Washington, anti-spending rhetoric. A December 2007 Austin American-Statesman story reported that Perry, while campaigning in Iowa for presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani, said President George W. Bush ""is not and he never was"" a fiscal conservative. 
Back to the stimulus: On Feb. 18, 2009, the same day Perry accepted the federal funds, the governor slammed the legislation as being ""full of pork and special interest handouts."" On his campaign website, Perry wrote: ""The Democrats think this bill will change our country's financial fortunes, but you and I know better. … This administration is saddling future generations with an increasingly unbearable debt."" He then urged readers to sign an online petition telling ""Washington"" that they are ""fed up with bailouts."" 
In his letter to Obama accepting the aid, Perry said: ""As you know, I have been vocal in my opposition to this legislation because I believe there are better ways to reinvigorate our economy and believe (the stimulus plan) will burden future generations with unprecedented levels of debt."" 
Perry also wrote that he opposed using ""these funds to expand existing government programs"" because the state would be burdened ""with ongoing expenditures long after the funding has dried up."" (Elsewhere, Perry was quoted as saying that he welcomed federal dollars that could be used for one-time expenses.) 
During a Feb. 26, 2009, interview with conservative radio host Mike Gallagher, Perry criticized those members of Congress who had supported both the stimulus plan and the earlier $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, which helped shore up struggling banks during the financial crisis. He said: ""Voting for the TARP in my opinion is even worse than voting for the stimulus; and they’re both very bad. ... At least some of the stimulus money may actually get into the hands of people where it might accidentally do some good."" 
There’s more. 
In an April 7, 2009, video posted on his campaign website, Perry urged ""fellow patriots"" to attend tea party rallies planned for April 15 to let Washington know ""what you think about the bailouts, all this stimulus, all this runaway spending that’s going on."" And during speeches at tea party rallies that day, Perry said the attendees were sending Washington a message that ""we will not stand for our pockets being picked, our children’s future being mortgaged, our rights being taken away."" 
Perry’s criticism of Washington’s policies was not limited to Democrats. Running against U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in the last Republican gubernatorial primary, Perry frequently attacked her by calling out Washington. According to a Sept. 25, 2009, Statesman article, Perry wrote in a fundraising letter, ""If Washington Republicans hadn't spent like Democrats for 12 years, they might have maintained enough votes to actually kill Obamacare."" 
More recently, during a January 2010 speech in favor of a proposal to require Congress to balance the federal budget, Perry said that ""leaders in Washington … pour out your tax dollars on every challenge, blissfully ignoring the consequences of their largesse while they consign our children, our grandchildren to a life of unprecedented, unmanageable debt."" 
We asked the White House for examples of Perry ""blaming the members of Congress"" who supported the stimulus plan. Abrams didn’t offer any but told us that the president was pointing out ""the well-documented habit of those who criticize Recovery Act assistance while using those funds to balance a state's budget."" 
Summing up: Obama said Perry ""happily"" took federal stimulus funds that helped balance the state’s 2010-11 state budget. Perry hardly sounded happy about it, but Obama is correct that he accepted stimulus money that was used to help balance the budget. 
As to whether Perry then started ""blaming"" members of Congress who had supported the stimulus legislation — well, not in so many words. And as we noted, Perry’s criticism of the federal government had started long before. 
But Perry criticized the plan specifically and the policies of Washington in general, using rhetoric that painted Congress and the White House with the same big-spending brush.

"['Rhode Island', 'Poverty', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Colleen Conley']","
R.I. Tea Party founder says Rhode Island is the most generous state in New England when it comes to welfare
","
In the ongoing debate over how and where to cut the state budget, social services -- particularly welfare -- are popular targets. After all, social service spending costs residents nearly $1.1 billion a year and makes up nearly 40 percent of the general revenue budget.

So when Colleen Conley, founder and president of the Rhode Island Tea Party said on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show on April 13 that welfare recipients in Rhode Island are treated to the ""most generous"" benefits in New England, that caught our attention.

Conley made the comment following an appearance by state Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican, who said that the state's health and human services budget has increased by 73 percent since 2002.

Conley moved to the welfare issue after criticizing Gov. Chafee's assertion that he wasn't hearing any viable alternatives to his proposal to raise taxes.

""If he would sit down and meet with us we could give him 10 HUGE concrete ideas that could spread the difficulty, the pain, around a little bit,"" Conley commented. ""But as Brian was saying, health and human services -- huge in this state. If we brought it in line with just the other New England states it would save millions and millions of dollars. That is just one component right there. We are the most generous in New England and New England is known for its generosity toward its welfare recipients.""

When we contacted Conley, she said her source was a study by the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council.

Do welfare recipients really have it that good in Rhode Island? We decided to check.

The simple answer: When it comes to how folks commonly define welfare -- cash assistance to poor people -- they don’t.

The RIPEC report, released in 2010 using data from 2008, doesn't have a state-by-state comparison of cash payments.

Instead, it examines them by two different measures. And both show we’re far from the most generous in New England.

First, to gauge how we compare with other states, it divided the amount spent on cash assistance by the Rhode Island population. The cash assistance program cost each resident, on average, $53.

Rhode Island ranked fifth out of the six New England states. Only residents of New Hampshire spent less -- $44 per capita.

Second, to compare how much Rhode Islanders could afford to pay, RIPEC divided the amount spent on cash assistance by the amount of personal income Rhode Island residents had that year.

By that measure, the state spent $1.30 per $1,000 of personal income and Rhode Island ranked third in New England, behind Maine ($4.08 per $1,000) and Vermont ($2.63 per $1,000).

And how do we compare in actual dollars paid to recipients?

The RIPEC report didn’t have those figures, but the liberal Poverty Institute did. Rhode Island is fifth in New England, with payments of $554 per month for a family of three. Only Maine pays less - $485 per month. Rhode Island’s hasn't increased its welfare payments in more than 20 years, said Rachel Flum, a  Poverty Institute policy analyst.

Up to this point, Conley's ""most generous in New England"" assessment doesn’t hold up.

When we questioned her, Conley directed us to the welfare ""vendor payments"" section of the RIPEC report, noting, as RIPEC did, that ""per capita vendor payments almost tripled in Rhode Island, growing by 178.9 percent between FY 1998 and FY 2008.""

When we asked Conley what the payments were and how those payments might be cut back to bring us in line with everyone else, she said it's up to the state to look into that. ""I'm not a policy wonk nor do I head a 501c3 think tank,"" she added.

So what is a vendor payment? We went to RIPEC.

""Those are not welfare recipients. Let's be very clear,"" said Ashley Denault, RIPEC's research director. They represent payments to doctors, nursing homes and organizations that charge the state for health- or mental health-related services for the poor.

Vendor payments soak up a whopping 88 percent of public welfare expenditures, according to RIPEC's ranking. The state paid $1,785 per capita to vendors in 2008, more than any other state in the United States. Massachusetts ranked second at $1,667.

""The rapid increase in vendor payments is not just a Rhode Island issue,"" she said. ""It's the medical inflation rate, which has been very high over the last decade. You can't look at it and say Rhode Island is a welfare magnet, or we have tons of people on Medicaid.""

""It could be we could have more people who qualify for these programs. It could be wider eligibility. It could be we're not providing services in the most efficient manner. It could be how we set our reimbursement rate, which might be out of line with the rest of the country,"" Denault said.

She said Chafee's budget includes proposals to try to bring these costs into line, including changes in nursing home reimbursements expected to save $6.1 million in the coming fiscal year and outpatient hospital reimbursements that could save $2.7 million.

To sum up, Conley is right when she asserts that Rhode Island’s overall social services spending -- and particularly the amount paid to vendors for health services -- ranks high, both in New England and nationally.

But when she said Rhode Island is the ""most generous in New England . . . toward its welfare recipients,""  that invoked the image of single mothers receiving the biggest welfare checks in New England. That's simply not true, no matter how you measure it.

She may not have intended to give that impression, but her words clearly conveyed that.

So we’ll split the difference and give her a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A5FB40>],/factchecks/2011/apr/24/colleen-conley/ri-tea-party-founder-says-rhode-island-most-genero/

 Portland Public Schools paints picture of declining state funding over past few years
","
  
Come May 17, Portland voters will decide whether to OK a $548 million bond measure for upgrading city schools and where to increase the district’s operating levy from $1.25 to $1.99 per $1,000 of assessed property value).

Naturally, Portland Public Schools is hoping they’ll vote ""yes"" twice -- and to help make their case, they’ve sent out a comprehensive mailer to some 230,000 residents outlining funding, student performance and a wide range of other facts and figures.

As we thumbed through the report, one graph caught our eye: a yellow bar chart that showed ""Per-student school funding in Oregon (State School Fund formula)"" for the current and past three school years.

The graph shows the funding down 6.5 percent this year as compared to the 2007-2008 school year. (Here’s how the pamphlet says the dollars break down: $6,036 in 2007-08; $5,989 in 2008-09; $5,834 in 2009-10; and $5,644 in 2010-11.)

That 6.5 percent drop in state funding seemed a little suspicious, especially since we’ve heard for the past couple years  that federal stimulus dollars helped keep funding relatively flat.

What we really wanted to know was this: Has state school funding per student really dropped from $6,036 in 2007-08 to $5,644 to 2010-11?

After phone calls to Portland Public Schools, the Oregon Department of Education and the Legislative Fiscal (Revenue) Office -- and winding up with different figures from each -- our collective head was spinning with numbers. So, we threw out the numbers we’d collected and started from scratch. Scratch being the Oregon Department of Education’s website.

The Department of Education makes publica wealth of PDFs that lay out the amount of state funding distributed via the school fund formula -- the pot of money the graph addresses. We collected the most recent calculations for the years in question.

We noticed right away that the numbers in the brochure were probably referring to Portland Public Schools funding and not Oregon funding generally. Spokesman Matt Shelby confirmed this. The graph had been mislabeled.

That’s not ideal, but, while the mistake was sloppy, it wasn’t a definitive answer to our question. We still wondered if that decline had, indeed, occurred. So we adjusted our search and began calculating state funding for Portland Public over the past few years.

We were looking for two numbers: The amount of funding the district received via the state school fund formula and number of students in the district.

Both numbers can be a little elusive. On the first figure, the funding numbers the Oregon Department of Education keeps do not include the stimulus funding. On the second, there are actually two ways to count students.

There’s the resident number -- the number of actual students being instructed -- and the weighted number -- students with certain needs count as more than one student because their education tends to cost more. There’s a pretty big gulf between the two figures.

Take the current school year, for instance. Portland Public Schools is home to about 43,300 students; that’s ""students"" in the literal, you-could-do-a-head-count sense. Under the weighted number, it’s home to nearly 53,000.

We asked Shelby which combination of the figures his district has used in creating the chart. Shelby said the district went with the weighted figure for student population and the state funds minus the stimulus dollars.

When we used the same figures, we got slightly different numbers than what Portland Public had published. Try as we might, we could not find the discrepancy. That said, the overall decrease since 2007-08 was about 5 percent. No, that’s not the 6.5 percent from the brochure, but it’s pretty close.

Next, we checked to see if anything much changed if we calculated per-student spending based on the actual number of physical students. When readers of the brochure saw the term ""per student,"" that’s probably more along the lines of what they thought the district meant -- not an internal weighting system that suggests the district has 10,000 more students than it really does.

That gave us a considerably higher per-student spending figure: $7,699 in 2007-08; $7,415 in 2008-09; $7,440 in 2009-10; and $7,234 in 2010-11. In no year did the district get less than $6,000 per student, as the brochure suggests is now the case.

Still, if you do the math, you’ll notice the figure has dropped about 6 percent -- closer to the amount presented in the graph.

Then, we added back in the stimulus dollars. That made a world of difference. With the stimulus, state funding actually dropped only 2 percent since 2007-08, from roughly $7,700 to $7,560 per ""resident"" student.

Shelby pushed back on the calculation. ""We're not going to give credit to the state for federal stimulus dollars,"" he said. The graph is ""an effort to show our community that state support as gone down over the past few years.""

He has a point -- state funding, in the strict sense, has gone down. That said, the federal government came in to help backfill a hole that represented a decline in the economy -- not a conscious decision to roll back investment in public education. Had the feds not offered a bailout to Oregon schools, the Legislature would have likely made up at least part of that difference with cuts elsewhere so that schools didn't take that large a hit.

Before we made our ruling, we had one lingering thought: What does the overall Portland Public Schools budget look like? Well, according to their website, their total funds budget is actually up:  $636 million this year compared to $617 million in 2007-08. That said the budget this year is lower than last year’s $664 million pot. Meanwhile, the cost of education -- everything from supplies to teacher benefits -- keeps climbing year after year.

Now, back to the case at hand. Has per-student spending in Portland really dropped from roughly $6,036 in the 2007-2008 school year to $5,644 in the 2010-2011 school year? Sort of.

Clearly per-student funding has gone down, while inflation has been going up. Still, it’d probably be most accurate to say it’s dropped from approximately $7,700 to $7,230 -- if we’re talking strictly state dollars. And it’d be even more honest to point out that the state got an assist during bad times in the form of the stimulus, especially given those federal dollars were disbursed via the state school fund formula, which is what the graph claims to show.

All things considered, this seems like a statement that is partially accurate but in need of some context. We’ll rate it Half True.

Herman Cain says China holds 26 percent of U.S. debt
","
Here's one thing many Republicans and Democrats agree on: concern about the amount of our debt held by China.

The issue has been raised recently by President Barack Obama and seemingly every Democratic and Republican leader. It's been a key talking point for possible GOP candidate Donald Trump.

So how much of the U.S. debt, exactly, does China hold? In a speech at a tea party event in Iowa on April 16, 2011, potential Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said it's 26 percent.

""If we don't begin to grow with the potential that we have in this country, we will have another national security crisis, and that national security crisis is that China will be as big as we are,"" Cain said. ""They'll start to develop a military as big and as good as ours and they've got a billion more people and they're holding 26 percent of our debt. And you think we're going to be able to sing Kumbaya with them?""

We e-mailed a spokeswoman at Friends of Herman Cain to substantiate the figure and did not hear back, but it appears Cain was referring to a U.S. Treasury report on the major foreign holders of treasury security. According to the report, as of February of this year, China held $1.15 trillion worth of U.S. treasury securities. Together, all foreign holders came to $4.47 trillion. So China's share of that comes to about 26 percent. China, incidentally, tops the list of foreign holders of U.S. debt, followed by Japan and then, with a much smaller share, countries such as the United Kingdom and Brazil.

But that's just the foreign holders of treasury securities. More than two-thirds of the debt is held by U.S. residents and institutions. When you look at everyone who holds U.S. treasury security, China's share drops to 8.1 percent ($1.15 trillion out of $14 trillion).

Of course, there are lots of ways to slice debt statistics.

For example, instead of gross federal debt (the figure cited above), some people prefer to use a figure for ""debt held by the public."" That's the gross federal debt minus the share of the debt held by the U.S. government itself. That was $9.4 trillion at the end of 2010. Which would put the portion held by China at about 12.3 percent.

There are also Chinese holdings of debt outside of Treasuries, said Derek Scissors of the conservative Heritage Foundation. But that doesn't get Cain anywhere near his 26 percent figure.

""Even stretching, you can't get past 15.6 percent of our debt as held by China and I would not use that number,"" Scissors said.

The number cited by Cain is ""misleadingly large,"" Scissors said. ""He's not talking about our debt, he's talking about the foreign share of our debt. If you are going to use that number, you really have to explain it.""

In other words, Cain should have dropped in some qualifiers to make his statement accurate. For example, he could have said ""among the foreign holders of U.S. debt, China ranks first and holds 26 percent."" But he didn't. Cain said simply that China ""is holding 26 percent of our debt."" There are a couple ways to consider debt, but using the two most common, Cain is either off by more than double or more than triple. We rate Cain's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972C8800>],/factchecks/2011/apr/22/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-china-holds-26-percent-us-debt/

Mark Warner says federal spending is near all-time high, relative to GDP
","
In the coming weeks, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and a bipartisan group of five colleagues are expected to introduce a tough-love plan for lowering debt that they promise will make everyone angry.

Warner says his ""Gang of Six"" will propose an array of tax increases and spending reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that would slice the national debt by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. He has been laying out the case for more taxes and less spending for months, calling the debt ""a ticking time bomb.""

Warner appeared on ""Face the Nation"" on April 17 and told CBS newsman Bob Schieffer: ""Right now we are spending at an all-time high; close to 25 percent of our GDP [is] being spent on the federal government. But our revenues are at an almost all-time low of about 15 percent [of GDP].""

We wondered if he was right.

GDP, or gross domestic product, is the measure of the total size of the U.S. economy during a given year. The Department of the Commerce has been tracking GDP since 1929.

The Department of Treasury has been computing the size of government spending and revenues relative to GDP since 1940. It’s data backs up Warner’s contention. Rarely has government revenue been such a small portion of GDP, and rarely has spending been such a large chunk of the total economy.


Let’s start with revenue. Ninety-three percent of federal receipts come from taxes on personal income, corporate income and payrolls.

Uncle Sam took in $2.16 trillion during fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30. Revenues equaled 14.9 percent of GDP. In 2009 revenue was $2.11 trillion, again 14.9 percent of GDP.
 
So both of those figures are close to the 15 percent mentioned by Warner. How do they compare to the past 70 years?

The average since 1940 is 17.4 percent, and the average during the past 30 years is 18 percent. We found that revenue has not been below 15 percent of GDP since 1949 and 1950, when it checked in at 14.5 percent and 14.4 percent.

During those post-World War II years, taxes were cut and the nation enjoyed rapid economic expansion. Medicare and Medicaid did not exist. There were 16 workers for each Social Security recipient, as compared to 2.9 workers per recipient today.

The only other time where revenue was below the 15 percent level was 1940 through 1943, when the U.S. ran massive budget deficits to fund World War II.

So Warner’s right when he says federal revenues ""are at an almost all-time low."" The revenue totals for 2009 and 2010 were the lowest percentage of GDP in 60 years.

Now let’s look at spending.

The federal government spent $3.46 trillion in fiscal 2010 fiscal year, down slightly from $3.52 trillion in the 2009 budget year. The 2010 figure was 23.8 percent of GDP, and the 2009 figure was 25 percent of GDP.

Those numbers are above historical averages. Since 1940, federal spending has averaged 20.5 percent of GDP, and since 1981 the average is 21 percent.

Spending under George W. Bush ranged from 18.2 percent in 2001 to a high of 20.7 percent in 2008.  From 1980 through 2000, spending mostly ranged between 20 percent and 22 percent of GDP.

Only during World War II did expenditures climb above Warner’s 25 percent threshold. It peaked at 43.6 percent in 1943 and 1944 as the U.S. financed much of its global war efforts with debt. By 1946 the figure was down to 24.8 percent, and in 1948, spending fell to 11.6 percent of GDP.

Let’s wrap up.  

Mark Warner said government revenue is close to an all-time low at 15 percent of gross domestic product, while spending is at 25 percent of GDP, which Warner says is an all-time high.

Revenue levels -- 93 percent of which come from taxes -- haven’t been this low in 60 years. So Warner is right.

He also aces the spending side. The U.S. has only seen government outlays chew up this much of GDP once in history, at the height of World War II.

Adam Putnam's big catch got away because he had no choice
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott and members of the Cabinet returned from a two-day tour of the Panhandle in which the four Republicans participated in a fishing tournament to help promote Florida's seafood industry.

And fishing, naturally, means fishing stories.

""I caught a 40-inch redfish, and I caught 26 of them in all, and we took them back to a restaurant and cooked and ate them. It's great here,"" Scott told reporters after the fishing expedition off Panama City on April 20, 2011.

You can almost hear ""... THIS BIG,"" right?

Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, who caught a 7.6-pound redfish, was the official winner of the tournament.

Scott came in second by catching a redfish that weighed in at 6.5 pounds, Attorney General Pam Bondi finished third with a 2.05-pound redfish and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam wound up last with a fish that weighed in at 1.9 pounds, according to the Palm Beach Post's Dara Kam.

The results produced a flurry of activity on Twitter.

""Congrats to @JeffAtwater. For the record, I caught the most variety--6 reds and a blue fish :),"" Bondi posted on her Twitter account, @PamBondi.

Putnam's poor showing prompted a question from St. Petersburg Times reporter Katie Sanders. Via Twitter, she wrote Putnam, ""@adamputnam, what happened?""

He responded a few minutes later. ""@KatieLSanders I caught one that was 42 inches but had to toss it back, because it was over the size limit."" Later, he tweeted again, with a link to a photo: ""If they let me bring this one in, I could have won the Cabinet fishing tournament.""

Many Floridians like to eat redfish, but we're not sure all have caught one before. So we wanted to see if Putnam had his fish regulations right.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, a group controlled by the governor, approves fishing rules for the state. The commission has rules in place for the fishing of redfish, which are also called red drum fish or red bass.

Putnam has it right. Fishermen can only harvest (or keep) redfish that are at least 18 inches long, but no more than 27 inches long. Fishermen can keep only one redfish each day.

The rules are in place to prevent the overfishing of redfish. The maximum is in place specifically to protect spawning redfish.

If you're following this, that means that Scott -- based on what he told reporters -- broke the fishing rules. But the Governor's Office later told Orlando's WESH-TV that Scott misspoke. Each angler brought back one fish, and Scott's 40-inch monster was tossed back into the Gulf of Mexico, a spokesman said.

And that means Putnam was right when he said he couldn't keep his 42-inch redfish because state fishing rules prohibit it. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D86840>],/factchecks/2011/apr/22/adam-putnam/adam-putnams-big-catch-got-away-because-he-had-no-/

Democratic Party of Wisconsin calls state Sen. Randy Hopper already “recalled”
","
He may not be widely known, but state Sen. Randy Hopper’s political fate could help write the final chapter in the historic Wisconsin legislative battle over the future of public employee unions.

The Republican is one of eight GOP senators targeted by state Democrats for removal from office as part of a coordinated series of recall campaigns that aim to reclaim the chamber for the Democrats.

As residents gathered signatures in an attempt to force him into a recall election, the state Democratic Party focused on casting Hopper in a negative light.

The party issued a news release highlighting an embarrassing flub in which a Hopper constituent newsletter included a phone number that directed callers to a sex chat line promising access to nasty talk with hundreds of hot, horny girls. Hopper said it was an inadvertent mistake.

Ahem.

The party’s press release caught our eye -- but only for professional reasons, we assure you.

This was the headline on the party’s release, which quoted party chairman Mike Tate:  ""Recalled Randy Hopper Directing Constituents to Adult Chat Line.""

Recalled already? That struck us as an unusual claim.

With recall fever hitting the state -- eight Democrats are also the target of recall attempts -- we thought we’d look at whether the ""recalled"" label is appropriate at this point in the process.

In the case of Hopper, the senator from Fond du Lac, recall advocates filed petitions on April 7 seeking an election. A review of the signatures on the petitions -- by the state’s Government Accountability Board -- is pending.

We asked Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski to explain the ""recalled"" label. He called our request a waste of time and our questions ""an act of pedantry.""

With the party offering no clear rationale, we turned to some election experts.

They noted the term ""recall"" has inspired much confusion among the public. And legal and political professionals disagree over the point in time when it is appropriate to label an elected official ""recalled.""

John Coleman, a political scientist at UW-Madison, said you can make a case for two points in time.

One: When the state certifies the need for an election after confirming the validity of signatures on recall petitions.

Two:  When the incumbent loses the election.

The term recall ""suggests an official who is being brought back to stand before the people,"" Coleman told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""This has some historical resonance along the lines that in days gone by, transportation and communication were difficult, and the elected official was in some far off place remote from his or her constituents. The recall election was a way to bring them back to the constituents.""

Coleman said that in everyday conversation, ""when people say ‘Legislator X has been recalled,’ they’ll probably mean the legislator has to face a recall election. It’s a handy shorthand term.""

Coleman, who has a national perspective on elections, said he personally leans toward ""recall"" meaning removal from office.  

By either measure, though, the state Democratic Party’s depiction of Hopper’s status would be wrong.

We asked Hopper’s campaign manager, Jeff Harvey, when he would consider his candidate ""recalled."" He said it would be after state elections officials certify the request for a recall election -- and only after a Hopper defeat in the contest.

""If he wins that means he was never recalled,"" Harvey said.

OK, so that’s the other end of the spectrum from the Democrats.

Let’s go to Kevin Kennedy, the state’s lead elections official as director of the Government Accountability Board. Through a spokesman, Kennedy said an incumbent is ""recalled once they have to stand for election.""

Here’s what the state’s official recall manual says about it: ""Recall gives voters the right to reconsider their choice of an elected official. However, it does not automatically result in removal of an official from office.""

Where exactly does the Hopper case stand in the process?

Pro-recall workers on April 7, 2011 turned in signatures to the Government Accountability Board seeking to force an election. Hopper’s side filed a challenge to some signatures on April 21. The GAB will take weeks to review the signatures and decide whether a sufficient number are valid.

At that point, either Hopper or the recall forces could appeal the GAB’s decision to court.

So there is a long way to go before an election is set to proceed -- the trigger point for the ""recall"" label being accurate. Coleman, the UW political scientist, said the notion that somebody is ""recalled"" at the point when signatures are turned in is a ""non-starter.""

It strikes us that the Democrats’ labeling of Hopper is akin to calling a criminal suspect ""charged"" at the point at which police have turned over evidence to the district attorney -- but before prosecutors have decided whether to file charges.

Let’s return to the statement:

The state Democratic Party issued a statement that labeled Hopper as already ""recalled."" There is some disagreement among experts about when it’s accurate to use the term ""recalled.""

But there is no dispute that the party jumped the gun by at least several weeks. Hopper might be recalled sometime this spring, but we are not there yet.

We rate the party’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978FFE00>],/factchecks/2011/apr/22/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-wisconsin-calls-state-sen-randy-h/
"['Federal Budget', 'Pundits', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Rachel Maddow']","
MSNBC host Rachel Maddow says Texas routinely receives more federal dollars than Texans pay in federal taxes
","After playing a 2009 video clip in which Republican Gov. Rick Perry touts states’ rights, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow suggested secession could hurt the Lone Star state’s bottom line.

""Many of these states flexing their 10th Amendment muscle, flexing their state sovereignty, even flirting with secession, states like Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina and Utah, one of these things about the states is that they all routinely get a lot more federal spending than they pay in taxes,"" she said on the April 12 edition of her weeknight show. A reader brought her comment to our attention.

Is Texas really getting more for less? To back up Maddow, MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski pointed us to the most recent state-by-state analysis of federal tax burdens and spending by the Washington-based Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. It covers the 25-year period between 1981 and 2005.

According to the analysis, Texans paid about $147 billion in federal taxes in 2005 while the state received $149 billion in federal spending. That year, 33 other states also got, as Maddow put it, more money back than residents paid in.

The paid taxes included employment, estate and trust income taxes, among others. Federal spending in Texas includes funding for retirement and disability, grants (such as for research and construction), wages of federal employees and direct payments for programs such as Medicare.

On an annual basis, however, there were only six years in that time period when Texas residents paid fewer dollars in federal taxes than they got in return, according to the foundation.

And since 2005? For those numbers, Skowronski pointed us to the most recent federal tax data posted by the IRS and federal spending data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

In fiscal 2009, the IRS collected about $163 billion from Texans and the state received about $224 billion, for a net gain of $61 billion. Federal spending in Texas also exceeded tax payments in 2008 by $8 billion. It was the other way around in 2006 and 2007, when tax payments by Texans exceeded federal spending by a total of about $47 billion.

Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst at Austin’s Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for moderate- to low-income Texans, told us Texas started receiving more federal funds in the last decade because of an increase in military spending, tax cuts and tax credits and a modest growth in federal health spending — not to mention a spike in social services and aid every time a hurricane hit.

""Texas is definitely getting back way more than people in Texas are paying in taxes,"" she said. ""So do a lot of other states. Texas isn’t unique in that.""

In 2009, most states — there were 45, including Texas — received more than residents paid in taxes. Though no data is yet available, DeLuna Castro said Texas will again receive more than residents paid in taxes in 2010. But by 2011, when stimulus funds dry up, she speculated that Texas will revert to being a ""donor state.""

Summing up: The figures from our sources show two different trends. On an annual basis between 1981 and 2003, Texas almost always paid more in federal taxes than it got back from Uncle Sam. But since 2003 the reverse has been true, with Texas receiving more than it paid in five out of seven years, which is close to routine.

We rate Maddow’s statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B2F080>],/factchecks/2011/apr/22/rachel-maddow/msnbc-host-rachel-maddow-says-texas-routinely-rece/

School board member claims later start date saves money
","
School or Six Flags?

In Cobb County, home to the famed amusement park, there’s been debate for years about when is the best time to start the school year: the beginning of August or a week or two later? Students would likely choose mid-August so they can have fun at places like Six Flags. The county school board? They’ve had a hard time with this question.

In 2009, the board voted to start the school year at the beginning of August.

In February, the board, with some new members, voted 4-3 to start the 2011-12 school year on Aug. 15.

Kathleen Angelucci, one of the new board members, tried to explain her vote at a March community meeting. Angelucci said she reviewed economic impact studies and concluded it was more cost-effective for Cobb to start classes later.

""It is a fact that it costs more to run the schools in August,"" Angelucci said.

A few Cobb parents didn’t buy her claim and asked us to investigate.

We called and e-mailed Angelucci several times in recent weeks and didn’t get a reply. We finally caught up to her at an April 13 board meeting. Angelucci said she thought the issue was in the past, explaining why she didn’t get back to us. Angelucci said she would send us some data that backed up her claim by April 15. We didn’t receive a call, e-mail or letter.

Cobb, with its 106,000 students and 5,925 teachers, is the second-largest school district in Georgia. Cobb initially planned to use a balanced calendar for three consecutive years, beginning with the 2010-11 school year. Students would start earlier, but get weeklong breaks during Thanksgiving, September and in February. Like other districts, Cobb would still wind up with 180 school days.

Balanced school year calendar supporters contend the shorter summer vacation under a balanced calendar makes it easier for students to retain what they learned during the prior school year as opposed to the longer recess under the traditional calendar. Some academics and educators say there’s no significant difference in test scores.

Some folks use the term ""balanced calendar"" to refer to year-round schools, but educators say there is a difference. Year-round schools typically hold classes for nine consecutive weeks and then give students the following three or four weeks off and begin the cycle again.

Traditional school year proponents argue there is a financial savings in starting the school year later in August because it costs more to keep schools cool in early August, which are some of the hottest days of the year. Georgia Power spokeswoman Lynn Wallace said customer demand typically rises with the hot August temperatures. She did note that customer use rose 21 percent in February 2010 from the prior February when a cold snap hit the South and President Barack Obama approved emergency home heating funds to several southern states.

Local school district officials who use a balanced calendar said they did not have data to determine if there is a cost savings, but they offered some interesting insights.

Cherokee County Superintendent Frank Petruzielo told us they’ve seen fewer students dropping out and have noticed other potential financial benefits, such as fewer student and faculty absences.

""The [school] days become a little more important"" with a balanced calendar, said Petruzielo, offering his reason why there are fewer absences.

The Cobb County school communications office provided us a spreadsheet that shows there were 41,148 substitute teacher days through March of this school year, a decline of about 15,000 days from a similar time period in the 2009-10 school year. As a result, the district paid about $1.1 million less to substitute teachers to work those days. Cobb County saw an average of about 56,437 substitute days used the prior three school years.

Jack Parish, who was the superintendent of the Henry County school district when it went to a balanced calendar, said he didn’t notice much of any financial difference between starting the school year in early August as opposed to mid-August.

""You are still operating your school for the same number of days,"" said Parish, now a lecturer at the University of Georgia. ""You are running your buses the same number of days. You are running your food service operation the same number of days.""

Nationally, there’s little research over whether there is a cost savings by using a traditional calendar or a balanced calendar. School system officials in Vancouver, Canada, looked into whether balanced calendar school years are more cost-effective, but found much of the analysis in the blogosphere was ""inadequate.""

Some Texas officials conducted research of its schools and concluded it is less expensive to operate on a traditional calendar. A 2004 report called ""Saving Summer"" by the comptroller of public accounts found electricity, gas and water bills were twice as high in August than in May. Traditional school year proponents point to Tulsa, Okla., where officials found they saved nearly $500,000 by delaying the start of the school year until after Labor Day, according to 2002 newspaper accounts.

Sean Beavers, a Cobb parent who contacted PolitiFact Georgia about the Angelucci claim, sent us utility budget information he said came from the Cobb district. Beavers’ numbers show in August 2010, when the district began classes a week earlier than in the past, that utility costs were slightly lower than August 2009. Cobb officials said Thursday those numbers were accurate, but cautioned that utility costs can vary because of weather.

Cobb is spending less money this school year from factors associated with the balanced calendar, according to data produced by the district. Some officials, like in Texas, have produced data that shows starting the school year earlier can cost a district more money. Area school officials who have used a balanced calendar for years say there’s not much financial difference either way.

There is scant evidence that Angelucci made a valid point, and she failed to provide us anything to back up her statement. We rate her claim as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F8C40>],/factchecks/2011/apr/22/kathleen-angelucci/school-board-member-claims-later-start-date-says-m/

Virginia Republicans say Tim Kaine broke campaign pledge not to raise taxes
","
The Republican Party of Virginia was ready to roll when Democrat Timothy M. Kaine recently announced he will run for the U.S. Senate next year.

The GOP posted on its website a list of unflattering numerical milestones from Kaine’s term as governor from 2006 to 2010.

One item particularly grabbed our attention.

Under the subhead ""7 days,"" the GOP wrote that’s ""How long it took Tim Kaine to break his campaign promise not to raise taxes.""

Kaine indeed asked for a tax increase on his seventh day in office. On Jan. 20, 2006, he proposed a $1 billion-a-year transportation package that called for higher levies on vehicle sales and insurance as well as increased traffic fines and registration fees.

Whether he broke a campaign promise is more complicated. Kaine held a murky position on taxes during the campaign.

So how do the Republicans justify their claim that Kaine promised not to raise taxes?

Garren Shipley, the communications director for the state GOP, pointed us to a gubernatorial debate on Oct. 9, 2005. Jerry Kilgore, the Republican nominee, charged that Kaine had a history of supporting tax increases that guaranteed he would try to raise levies as governor. Kilgore portrayed himself as a tax cutter.

""There you go again, Jerry, just making stuff up,"" Kaine retorted.

Shipley said Kaine’s response ""very strongly"" implies he would not propose tax hikes.

Perhaps. But a review of the debate transcript shows Kaine could have been responding to a variety of charges and claims Kilgore made in a minute-long barrage. In any event, Kaine’s reply hardly constitutes a no-tax vow.

Shipley offers a second argument that is more complex. Kaine repeatedly promised he would not seek a tax hike for transportation unless he could guarantee the revenues would be sequestered and never used for any purpose other than improving roads, rail and public transportation.

Shipley says Kaine broke his campaign vow by introducing the transportation plan without the guarantee.

Kaine did promise not to seek a tax increase for transportation unless the money was ""locked up.""  He objected to a legislative practice of siphoning money from state transportation fund during lean times to help pay for schools, prisons and health care. The practice led to the 2002 defeat of local referendums that would have raised taxes for roads in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. Polls showed many voters in those regions did not trust state politicians to keep their promise that the revenues would never stray from transportation.

Kaine solidified his position in a July 16, 2005, gubernatorial debate while answering a tax question posed by Bob Holsworth, a political scientist.

""I have pledged, Bob, as you said, that I will not support any increase in transportation taxes or revenues so long as the Transportation Trust Fund is unlocked,"" Kaine said. ""I don’t think I can look voters in the face and ask them for more money for transportation if there is a hole in the bucket and money is going to drain out.""

Kaine at first advocated that road money be locked through passage of a state constitutional amendment shielding transportation money from raids. But enacting a constitutional amendment is a three-year process. Business leaders in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads weren’t willing to wait that long to ease traffic congestion.

So Kaine, in August 2005, altered his position to open the possibility of raising taxes during his first year in office. While still endorsing a constitutional amendment, he gave himself wiggle room by saying he was also open to locking the transportation money through other means. Kaine was short on details. 
Days after his inauguration, Kaine offered specifics in his State of the Commonwealth address. He said that in lieu of a constitutional fix, he would amend any new transportation tax or revenue laws to ensure they would expire if the money was shifted to other programs. He also promised to veto any budget that diverted transportation money.

Kaine’s protections would not have made the funds tamper-proof, however. The General Assembly was empowered to override any amendments or vetoes Kaine might use to safeguard the money. And future governors would not be bound by any commitments Kaine made to shield funds.  

When he unveiled his transportation plan on Jan. 20, the GOP criticized Kaine for breaching his campaign pledge not to raise taxes for transportation without a lock. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted, however, in its following-day story, that Kaine as a candidate ""refused to rule out new road taxes.""

Kaine’s bill died in the Republican-led House of Delegates, which has been and remains opposed to raising taxes. The 2005 House also killed 10 bills that would have placed before voters a constitutional amendment to put a lock on transportation money.

Let’s review:

The Republican Party of Virginia says that within a week of becoming governor in 2006, Kaine broke a promise not to raise taxes. Kaine indeed proposed a $1 billion transportation tax increase on his seventh day in office.

There’s no evidence Kaine made a no-tax pledge during the 2005 campaign. To the contrary, Kaine set conditions under which he would seek a tax hike for transportation. Kaine did, however, leave himself open for criticism by compromising those conditions once he got into office.

"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Ronald Renuart']","
Florida Republican says abortions make up 37 percent of Planned Parenthood revenues
","
Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood have filtered down from Washington to Tallahassee, where a GOP state legislator is accusing the not-for-profit group of operating a business plan that relies on abortions.

State Rep. Ronald Renuart, an osteopathic physician from Ponte Vedra Beach, says Planned Parenthood opposes several anti-abortion measures being considered by the Florida Legislature because Planned Parenthood needs to perform abortions in order to stay in business. During an April 20, 2011, meeting of the Health and Human Services Committee, Renuart let Stephanie Kunkel, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, have it.

""In 2008, Planned Parenthood, they put out a report, and it showed that they did 305,000 abortions and the average cost was $450,"" Renuart said (about 47 minutes into this video). ""Their total income for Planned Parenthood alone was $374 million, of that $137 million was actually for abortions. So that's almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood is from abortions. And to me, it sounds like they don't want to lose business.""

Kunkel, standing at a lectern where audience members can address the committee, later said Renuart was mistaken. ""Mr. Renuart, 97 percent of the services that Planned Parenthood provides currently in Florida is prevention and education,"" she said.

But Renuart stood his ground.

""What I was quoting was a 2008 Planned Parenthood report,"" Renuart said. ""That comes from Planned Parenthood mobile on my Blackberry here. Now are you claiming that, nationally, your organization is misrepresenting statistics and sending out false reports?""

We wanted to check out Renuart's bottom line -- that almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood comes from abortions.

To set the stage, though, we need to explain the difference between what Renuart and Kunkel were talking about. Because they are not the same thing. Kunkel was referencing the services that Planned Parenthood provides, and she's right that abortions make up only 3 percent of the total number of procedures or services the group provides. (That's the figure that got Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl in trouble when he claimed -- incorrectly -- that over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is abortions).

But Renuart is talking about revenue, not the number of services or procedures performed by Planned Parenthood.

And because different services or procedures cost different amounts, it's easily possible that abortions could generate more than 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenues. Therefore, it's possible that both claims could be correct. 

We contacted Renuart's office to see where he got his information but did not hear back. After some research, however, we are fairly certain we tracked down Renuart's sources.

Planned Parenthood releases an annual report each year detailing its activities. The 2008 report is online, and several of the numbers Renuart cited match the report.

In its 2007-08 report, Planned Parenthood said it performed 305,310 abortions in 2007 and that its health center reported total revenues of $374.7 million. Those numbers line up with what Renuart said.

But Renuart's other numbers -- that the average cost of an abortion is $450 and that abortions generated $137 million -- are not in the report.

Those figures came from pro-life bloggers, who have been making a claim similar to Renuart's for more than a year.

We found the information from a blog called Live Action.

The blog said the average cost of an abortion is $450 ""based on what Planned Parenthood across the country has told Live Action staff. Although it is slightly higher or lower depending on what part of the country it is."" Planned Parenthood's web site offers a range of costs for abortions -- which could include the procedure or the taking of a pill. The procedure costs about $350–$950 in the first trimester, Planned Parenthood says. The cost for what Planned Parenthood calls a ""medication abortion"" ranges from $350 to $650.

So using $450 is reasonable.

From there, Live Action does simple math.

First, Live Action multiplies the number of abortions (305,310) by what it says is the average cost of an abortion ($450) to reach a figure for the total revenue generated by abortions ($137.4 million).

Then they take the total revenue generated by abortions ($137.4 million) and divide it by the total revenue generated by the health center ($374.7 million), and conclude that 36.7 percent of Planned Parenthood's health center revenue comes from abortion.

So Renuart's right?

Not really.

What blogs like Live Action specify, and Renuart doesn't, is that they are talking only about health center revenue. That makes up only about 36 percent of all revenue for Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood had $1.04 billion in total revenues in 2007-08, according to the group's annual report. Other revenue came from government grants ($350 million), private contributions ($250 million) and other sources ($69 million).

So abortion procedures could generate 37 percent of Planned Parenthood's health center revenue -- but mind you, that's an estimate created by pro-life groups because the organization doesn't release that figure. If true, that's still only 13 percent of the total revenue generated by Planned Parenthood.

Renuart didn't make that distinction in his comments during the House committee meeting. He presented his figures and claimed that ""almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood is from abortions.""

Renuart should have been more cautious with his words. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979CF080>],/factchecks/2011/apr/21/ronald-renuart/florida-republican-says-abortions-make-37-percent-/

Sarah Palin says $38 billion in cuts in budget compromise is really “less than $1 billion in real cuts”
","
About 11 p.m. on April 8, 2011, shortly after a federal budget compromise averted a government shutdown, President Barack Obama addressed the nation from the august Blue Room of the White House.

The compromise measure, he declared, contained ""the largest annual spending cut in our history.""

News reports pegged the figure at $38 billion.

Eight days later, with sleet bearing down on her outside the Wisconsin Capitol, Sarah Palin took aim at the budget compromise while speaking to a tea party rally.

The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee asserted that because of ""politics-as-usual and accounting gimmicks, we find out it’s not $38 billion in cuts.""

She added: ""We find out it’s not even $38 billion; it’s less than $1 billion in real cuts.""

Palin’s claim about the bill, which was signed into law by Obama, was about as specific as it was startling.

Let’s find out if it’s true.

News media throughout the country reported that the compromise made $38 billion in spending cuts -- but they characterized the cuts in different ways.

The New York Times said the cuts would be made ""this year."" Reuters was more specific, saying they would be made by Sept. 30, 2011, the end of the federal government’s 2011 fiscal year. But the Associated Press said ""most of those cuts will either not take effect until future years or amount to accounting gimmicks that won’t reduce actual spending.""

The reports were consistent, however, on the amount of the cuts: $38 billion.

So, how could $38 billion become ""less than $1 billion in real cuts,"" as Palin claimed?

We e-mailed SarahPAC.com -- the website for Palin’s political action committee, which has fueled speculation that she might run for president in 2012 -- but didn’t get a reply. We did get a return e-mail from Conservatives4Palin.com, which supports Palin but is not an official Palin website.

That e-mail cited an Associated Press article that was published three days before Palin’s speech in Madison. It quoted the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal analyst, as saying the compromise would cut just $352 million in spending by Sept. 30, 2011.

So, the CBO seemed to provide some backing for Palin.

The CBO analysis, however, was limited to cuts that would be made in the current fiscal year.

The same Associated Press article cited by Conservatives4Palin.com explained how a bill that was touted to contain $38 billion in spending cuts was producing only $352 million in cuts in the first 5-1/2 months after being signed into law.

""At issue is a concept in budgeting that is often difficult to grasp,"" the article said. ""Appropriations bills like the pending measure give agencies the authority to spend taxpayers’ money. But such authority typically takes months or years to actually leave the federal Treasury, so cuts made in the middle of the budget year often have little immediate impact.""

In other words, the budget compromise cancelled what is known as the budget authority for $38 billion worth of spending. But only $352 million in actual spending would be eliminated before Sept. 30, 2011.

An explanation provided by a Washington Post article, published two days before Palin’s Wisconsin speech, was more thorough.

That article said ""Congress usually gives agencies the authority to draw from Uncle Sam’s one gigantic checking account. That is the Treasury’s General Fund, which is constantly taking in taxes, fees and borrowed money. The agencies can’t take money out of this fund until they’re ready to spend it. And that’s where it becomes complicated.

""Sometimes, agencies aren’t ready to spend the money until a year, or longer, after Congress gives them their IOU. That’s not a problem when an agency makes a one-time purchase for something like pencils. Officials call a supplier, get their pencils and write a check, and the money is gone. But it works differently when the government buys an aircraft carrier,"" when the final check won’t be cut until several years later, the article said.

The Post also found 98 instances in which the budget compromise took back unused IOUs and called it a cut. For example, the article said, the compromise ""takes $560 million from the Academic Competitiveness and SMART programs, which gave grants to college undergraduates. But the programs are set to end after this school year. And the Education Department has enough cash to cover the remaining grants.""

In other words, some of what is counted in the bill as spending cuts are monies that had budget authority but would never have actually been spent. That also lends support to Palin’s claim, that not all of the $38 billion in the announced spending cuts would actually be achieved.

Well, how much spending will actually be cut?

Two days before Palin’s Madison speech, the Congressional Budget Office issued a second report on the budget compromise. It estimated that, beyond the $352 million in spending cuts that would be made by Sept. 30, 2011, $20 billion to $25 billion in cuts would be made between 2011 and 2021, with the vast majority occurring between 2012 and 2016.

Clearly, $20 billion to $25 billion is less than the $38 billion in spending cuts that were claimed by backers of the compromise bill. But it also far exceeds the less than $1 billion in cuts that Palin claimed.

We consulted two Washington, D.C. think tank experts, Joseph Antos of the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute and Scott Lilly of the liberal Center for American Progress, who was chief of staff to former Democratic Wisconsin congressman Dave Obey.

They agreed that the CBO’s $20 billion to $25 billion estimate was the best representation of the spending cuts produced by the budget compromise.

Let’s review.

Sarah Palin claimed that a federal budget compromise, which was billed as containing $38 billion in spending cuts, would actually make less than $1 billion in cuts.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the spending cuts would amount to only $352 million for fiscal 2011. But it said the cuts would total $20 billion to $25 billion from 2011 to 2021.

Palin’s statement contained some element of truth, in that the spending cuts amount to less than $1 billion for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, 2011. But she ignored a critical fact, namely that the bill makes $20 billion to $25 billion in cuts over the next 10 years. We rate her claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809694F200>],/factchecks/2011/apr/21/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-38-billion-cuts-budget-compromise/

Mitch Daniels says government workers in 41 states make more than taxpayers who support them
","
Count Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels among skeptics of government workers having collective-bargaining rights, the issue that cleaved Wisconsin this year.

Daniels, a Republican presidential prospect, told PBS talk-show host Tavis Smiley March 28 that government workers are better off than others: ""There may have once been a time, Tavis, in the old days of patronage and so forth, where government workers were put upon and vulnerable, but that's a long time ago. Now, in 41 states out of 50, they are better paid than the taxpayers who support them. In the federal government they're almost twice as well paid. This doesn't even count the benefits and the almost complete job security they have.""

Never mind that government workers are taxpayers too. We note also that in November, PolitiFact Ohio rated False a claim that average federal workers make double the pay of average private-sector workers. The fact check cited a statement placed online by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis noting the private-sector workforce includes a broader range of jobs than the federal government, from minimum-wage positions to CEOs, while federal civilian jobs focus on professional areas like law, accounting and economics that require higher education.

We’re focusing here on whether state and local government workers are better compensated than private-sector counterparts.

To our inquiry, Daniels’ office pointed us to a March 2 news article in USA TODAY. The story, citing figures obtained from the bureau, says state and local government employees in 41 states earned higher average pay and benefits than private workers in those states in 2009. The national average for the government workers was $57,775, $2,511 greater than private-sector counterparts.

But not in Texas, which ranked last among states in benefits for public employees. Its average compensation to state and local government workers, $51,310, placed the state 30th nationally, according to the article, but its government workers trailed private-sector Texans by $3,580.

For more Texas-centric information, we turned to the latest comparison of state government and private-sector positions by the Texas State Auditor’s Office. The August report says that in fall 2009, nearly three quarters of 150,000-plus state workers were paid 10 to 20 percent less than private sector employees and another 19 percent fared worse.

""Some states that limit the right of public employees to unionize — such as Texas, Georgia and Virginia — pay less in compensation than the private sector,"" the article says. ""Massachusetts and New Hampshire generally permit unions but pay less than the private sector in those high-income states.""

The story says the newspaper’s analysis included full and part-time workers and did not adjust for specific jobs, age, education or experience. It says that in an earlier job-to-job comparison, USA TODAY found that state and local government workers make about the same salary as those in the private sector but get more generous benefits.

The article also quotes economist Jeffrey Keefe of the liberal Economic Policy Institute saying  the analysis is misleading because it doesn't reflect factors such as education that result in higher pay for public employees.

For our part, we consulted Austin economist Stuart Greenfield, a retired state worker who has long advocated on state employee issues. Greenfield guided us to a Texas Watchdog article playing off the USA TODAY story and a 2010 study commissioned by two Washington-based groups.

The March 3 Watchdog article says the $10,760 average benefits package for the average public worker in Texas compares to the $9,190 average benefits that average private employees receives, according to the federal bureau’s figures.

The 2010 study, comparing worker earnings and benefits across and between private, state and local sectors, was written by Keith Bender and John Heywood, economists at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The study was undertaken by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence, whose mission is to ""help state and local governments become knowledgeable and competitive employers so they can attract and retain talented, committed, and well-prepared individuals to public service,"" and the National Institute on Retirement Security, which says it was established to foster understanding of the value of retirement security to employees, employers, and the economy.

""Public and private workforces differ in important ways,"" the authors write. ""For instance, jobs in the public sector require much more education on average than those in the private sector. Employees in state and local sectors are twice as likely as their private sector counterparts to have a college or advanced degree.

""Wages and salaries of state and local employees are lower than those for private sector workers with comparable earnings determinants (e.g., education). State employees typically earn 11 percent less; local workers earn 12 percent less,"" they write. In Texas, the gap was even greater for local government workers, who made nearly 18 percent less between 2000 and 2008.

""Over the last 20 years, the earnings for state and local employees have generally declined relative to comparable private sector employees,"" they say.

In the study, the economists air what they refer to as Simpson’s Paradox: ""The average state worker appears to earn more only because the state hires more of those in the highly educated categories that tend to earn more, not because workers with the same education earn more in the public sector."" They say too that compensation specialists ""repeatedly show that the typical state and local public sector worker has more education, more tenure, and greater responsibilities... the fact that public sector workers receive greater average compensation than private sector workers should be no more surprising than the fact that those with more skills and education earn more.""

In fact, the study says, ""if we limit our data to college-educated workers, those in state government earn 13 percent less than those in the private sector, while those in local government earn 11 percent less than those in the private sector.""

The study also isolated benefits, including pension, insurance and paid leave differences, finding that from 2004 to 2008 benefits comprised a larger portion of compensation in state and local government ""although not dramatically different, particularly when compared to larger private sector firms.""

Incorporating ""benefits makes state and public workers appear somewhat less poorly compensated, but our estimate suggests they still receive less total compensation than similar private sector workers,"" the study says. ""Benefits should be expected to be higher if the public sector workers are more highly educated and doing jobs that command higher earnings.""

Big picture:  ""Although a comparison of unadjusted average earnings will show that wages are higher among jobs in state and local government, this result is largely due to the fact that the workers in those sectors have more education. Holding education and other characteristics the same, typical state and local workers earn an average of 11 percent less and 12 percent less, respectively, than comparable private sector workers,"" the study concludes. ""Workers in the state and local sector receive a slightly larger share of their compensation in benefits, but it is not dramatically larger.""

Next, we wondered if there was an inherent weakness in the USA TODAY analysis Daniel cites. If most government jobs are of the professional, white-collar variety -- with requirements and compensation to match -- that would skew comparisons with the private sector, with its larger share of low-wage and service-sector jobs.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 6.5 percent of private sector workers in 2010 were paid at or below the minimum wage, compared to 2.8 percent of government workers.

As we closed out this review, we asked the Wisconsin economists if they’d compared government to non-government workers in every state. By e-mail, Bender said the ""data for our study were such that we were uncomfortable reporting results for any but the largest 10 (states) or so because of sample sizes,"" but he guided us to a Feb. 25 New York Times’ state-by-state comparison breaking out employees with and without college degrees. Based on median salaries, state workers lacking college degrees fared better than their counterparts in the private sector in 30 states. But private-sector workers with such degrees earned more than degreed state workers in all but four states.

Bender also called the method employed by USA TODAY inaccurate. ""Both earnings AND benefits vary greatly by educational level (and other personal characteristics) and without explicitly taking this into account, the vast majority of economists would think that these numbers are essentially meaningless,"" he said. ""If one group of workers has more education or experience than another group, it makes economic sense that that more highly educated and experienced group get paid more on average...

""In sum, do I know whether there are 41 states where earnings plus benefits are greater in the public sector once you compare similar workers? No -- the number may be lower or higher. I haven't seen any research that does this convincingly. What I do know is that the analysis in the USA TODAY doesn't come close.""

Daniels’ message, that government workers are better paid than those in the private sector, traces to an egregiously simplistic comparison, ignoring meaningful differences in the public and private sector workforces largely due to education. Factoring those in, many state and local government workers lag behind their private-sector counterparts.

Granting illegal immigrants amnesty will destroy second amendment, says Senate candidate Joe Miller
","Joe Miller thinks there’s an obvious link between illegal immigrants and the Second Amendment. In a recent mailer to Alaskans, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate touts a record that is ""100 percent pro-gun"" and ""100 percent against amnesty."" And, he says he’s the only candidate with endorsements from various pro-gun groups. Alaska’s Republican primary is next Tuesday, and Miller is trailing far behind his opponents Mead Treadwell and Dan Sullivan (the leader) in the latest polls. Whoever wins will face off against incumbent Democrat Mark Begich. He says Begich wants to give amnesty and the right to vote to illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, and this is bad for the country’s gun rights. (Both Begich and Alaska’s other senator, Lisa Murkowski, voted for the Senate’s immigration reform bill.) ""If 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye,"" the mailer says. We thought drawing a connection between illegal immigration and the right to bear arms was dubious, so we decided to dig into it. Understanding the amendment First, some background on the Second Amendment and how it’s interpreted: The amendment reads: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" So the Second Amendment ensures that Americans are born with a certain amount of gun freedom. How courts have interpreted the text, though, is important. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in District of Columbia vs. Heller that an individual who is not part of a militia has the right to own a weapon. Additionally, the court said the amendment permits individuals to use the guns for legal purposes, like self defense in their homes. Two years later, the court ruled that these rights also apply to the states. But the Heller decision does not necessarily mean a person can own a gun of any type for any purpose. The court has approved gun regulations, such as the decision this year that upheld a ban on ""straw purchases"" (one person buying a gun for someone else). In sum, the court believes the Second Amendment means individuals have the right to own guns, with limited regulations. If 20 million people who all leaned one way or another on gun control were suddenly injected into the population, the surge could change the country’s political make-up and tip the balance in favor of Americans that support stricter gun laws, said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Under this scenario, he said, the country would elect politicians that support stricter gun laws, and those politicians would nominate Supreme Court judges who reflect their own views. These judges could reinterpret the Second Amendment as restricting gun ownership, and the right to bear arms as we currently understand it would disappear over time. This is also how the Miller campaign explained to us how immigration and gun rights are connected. However, the mailer does not say that the current understanding of the Second Amendment would disappear, it says the amendment would disappear altogether. Could that happen? ‘If pigs could fly’ Every scholar we spoke with agreed that it’s ridiculous to think that the Second Amendment could be removed from the Constitution under any circumstances -- let alone because of immigrants. ""If pigs could fly, would it change air travel?"" said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor. ""I guess it might, but it’s hard to imagine the premise."" First of all, citizens (and undocumented immigrants) cannot vote on a change to the Constitution. Amending the Constitution is a laborious process that requires two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of states to approve the change. With the current population, this would be nearly impossible, considering that only 25 percent of the country believes that there should be a law banning gun ownership except for police and other authorized individuals, according to a Gallup poll from October 2013. And just around 50 percent of the country thinks there shouldn’t be control over gun ownership, according to a February Pew study. The addition of 20 million new voters -- a population of about 6 percent -- of any ideological persuasion is unlikely to make a dent, said Clark Neily, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice. Additionally, there are about 12 million -- not 20 million -- illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, according to the latest estimates by Pew. (Alaska alone had fewer than 50 illegal immigrant households in 2010.) Of these illegal immigrants, about 60 percent of them are concentrated in just six states -- far fewer than the 38 states that would be needed to approve a change to the Constitution. It’s fair, though, for Miller to imply that illegal immigrants might be more sympathetic to Democrats than Republicans, Neily said. They are a predominantly Hispanic group, and Hispanics tend to align with Democrats. (In fact, a 2013 Pew study found that illegal immigrants strongly lean toward the Democratic Party.) America’s Hispanic community tends to be in favor of more gun restrictions. A recent Pew poll on political polarization found that 70 percent support controlling gun ownership, but that still leaves about 30 percent that prefer less control over gun ownership. If the primarily Hispanic illegal immigrants reflect this group, far fewer than 20 million would support scrapping the Second Amendment. At Republican primary debates recently, Miller explained why he thinks illegal immigrants would be more likely to support gun restrictions. ""There’s a clear correlation, and the clear correlation is this: If you end up granting amnesty to those who don’t value gun rights, who have not been raised in an environment where the Second Amendment is cherished -- is considered to be a God-given right -- the reality is over a generation or two, the likelihood is very strong that the Second Amendment will not be here,"" he said, according to Alaska Dispatch News. Even though it’s plausible immigrants could bring their cultural beliefs to the United States, it’s also likely that American culture -- which is overwhelmingly in favor of the Second Amendment -- would rub off on them, said Trevor Burrus, a research fellow at the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Our ruling Miller said, ""If 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye."" We found that it would be nearly impossible to remove the Second Amendment from the Constitution, given the country’s ideological make-up, and adding a voting bloc of 20 million would be unlikely to change that -- regardless of their political persuasions. However, it’s possible that adding 20 million new voters who lean Democrat could result in stricter gun control laws. Miller’s mailer muddies the waters, because increasing gun ownership regulations is not the same thing as scrapping the Second Amendment entirely. The ad is wrong when it suggests 20 million voters can repeal part of the Constitution’s Bill of Rights. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809700D140>],/factchecks/2014/aug/14/joe-miller/granting-illegal-immigrants-amnesty-will-destroy-s/

Scott Walker says Wisconsin tops its neighbors in income growth
","Wisconsin lagged all of the Midwest in job growth in the latest quarterly employment numbers, released in June 2014. So is it possible that by another economic measure -- the state’s total personal income -- the Badger State is gaining faster than all of its neighbors? Gov. Scott Walker made that claim July 30, 2014 on his campaign Twitter account: Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year. (US BEA Q1 2013 over Q1 2014)   In the tweet, Walker cited U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates comparing the first quarter income total for 2014 to those from the same quarter one year earlier. The agency, an arm of the U.S. Commerce Department, publishes quarterly estimates of the total personal income in each state. There’s no ""Midwest"" category in the agency’s geographical breakdowns. Two of the regions it defines include states often associated as Midwestern peers for the Badger State. One is the ""Great Lakes"" region (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). The other is the ""Plains"" region: (Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota). When we looked at percentage income growth for both regions, Walker’s claim held up. Among those 12 states, Wisconsin’s 3.33 percent income growth led the way, topping Ohio (3.12 percent) and Illinois (3.08 percent.) Minnesota and Iowa were toward the low end at 1.6 percent and 1.13 percent, respectively. Nationally, Wisconsin’s increase fell below the overall U.S. growth (3.55 percent) and trailed growth in 20 states. The top five states -- Oregon, Colorado, Texas, California and Washington -- ranged from 4.5 percent to 5.35 percent. Wisconsin’s top showing was an improvement over three previous one-year comparisons using fourth, third and second-quarter figures: -- Fourth Quarter of 2013 vs. fourth quarter of 2012: Wisconsin trailed income growth in North Dakota and Iowa. -- Third quarter: Wisconsin was in fifth place. -- Second quarter: Wisconsin trailed two states, North Dakota and Michigan. In March 2014, the Journal Sentinel reported that from 2012 to 2013, Wisconsin's growth in personal income outstripped the national average. Earlier, it had rebounded more slowly from the Great Recession. Reasons for the gains Economist Brian Jacobsen said the uptick in personal income is due to a combination of gains in 2014 and government policies that depressed incomes in early 2013 (the comparison time period). ""Not only was there the ‘fiscal cliff,’ which encouraged businesses to pay dividends in the fourth quarter of 2012 instead of the first quarter of 2013,"" Jacobsen said. ""There was also the expiration of the payroll tax holiday and some changes to farm subsidies."" Additionally, farm income didn’t drop nearly as much in Wisconsin as in nearby states, said Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls: ""The fact that Wisconsin’s agricultural programs didn’t lose as many subsidies as other programs helped."" Jacobsen said the best relative performers in the Wisconsin economy have been nondurable goods manufacturing; real estate and rental; management of companies and enterprises; administrative and waste management services; arts/entertainment/recreation; and state and local government. ""More business friendly policies have been helping, but so has the general pick-up in the U.S. economy,"" he said. Before we close up shop, let’s answer how it is aggregate income can be rising faster here than the rest of the Midwest, even while job growth is dead last? One answer is how  the government defines ""personal income""  -- it’s a broader measure than than wages from a job. The three components: -- Net earnings from wages and salaries and bonuses, plus the current-production income of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and tax-exempt cooperatives; -- Rental income, personal dividends and interest -- Transfer payments, such as Social Security and Medicare and unemployment, by all units of government and business. For much of 2013, Wisconsin’s personal income growth was faster in that second category than in wages from employment, the figures show. That shifted in the first quarter of 2014, when job earnings growth far outpaced the other two categories. And therein lies the second answer. We have the income estimates for the first quarter of 2014, but the jobs data is less up to date. The most reliable jobs data has not yet been released for early 2014. Our rating Walker tweeted that ""Wisconsin is #1 in the Midwest for personal income growth over the year."" The governor correctly identified a good-news trend that has seen Wisconsin boost its status from a laggard to a leader on total personal income, including wages, property income and government assistance. We rate the claim True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809757FA00>],/factchecks/2014/aug/14/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-tops-its-neighbors-inc/
"['Immigration', 'Oregon', 'Protect Oregon Driver Licenses']","
Was an Oregon law giving driver cards to undocumented citizens crafted 'behind closed doors?'
","With the general election less than three months away, a ballot measure that would overturn the Legislature’s vote to provide driver cards to those who can’t prove they are in the state legally is generating considerable heat. Almost as soon as Gov. John Kitzhaber signed Senate Bill 833 on May 1, 2013, a group opposing the measure mapped plans to gather enough signatures to refer it to voters. Protect Oregon Driver Licenses’ effort succeeded, and state voters will decide on Ballot Measure 88 in November. A yes vote would allow the law, whose implementation was suspended by the referendum effort, to take effect. The claim: Group members remain unhappy with the process, saying they were denied chances to participate in a 15-member work group convened by the governor before the original legislation was drafted. Among statements on Protect Oregon Driver Licenses’ website is this claim: Gov. John Kitzhaber formed a group to create SB 833 ""behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest."" PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We called Jim Ludwick, communications director for Oregonians for Immigration Reform -- the parent group of Protect Oregon Driver Licenses. Although the claim was made more than a year ago in April 2013, Ludwick said the group stands by it. He told us group members, hearing that the governor wanted a ""special work force to draft legislation"" to authorize driver cards, repeatedly asked the governor’s staff how they could take part. ""We wanted a place at the table,"" Ludwick said. ""We felt we should have a right to debate the issue."" Only later, he said, did he and others learn a work group had already been appointed. ""The whole thing was cooked and baked behind closed doors,"" Ludwick said. ""We were strung along and excluded at every step."" Legislative records show that four Democrats and four Republicans served as the bill’s primary sponsors. We emailed their offices for their take. Rep. Chris Harker, D-Beaverton, noted apparent confusion between the work group’s role and the actual drafting of the bill. Kitzhaber convened the 15-member work group, Harker said, to make policy recommendations around an Oregon driver card. Those recommendations, he said, were combined with information provided by Driver and Motor Vehicles Services and a bipartisan group of legislators to ""inform the drafting of Senate Bill 833."" The bill itself sailed through through two ""very well attended public hearings,"" Harker said. He added that it was significantly amended once and had ""input from more than 20 legislators."" Harker said that the first hearing, held April 11, 2013, drew ""so many participants they had to open three overflow rooms; hardly what I would call ‘behind closed doors.’"" Members of Ludwick’s group, according to legislative records, were among those testifying. Rep. Vic Gilliam, a Republican from Silverton, was even more vociferous. ""The unfounded protestations by this group and other similar groups has, for me, moved from disappointing to disgusting,"" he wrote in an email. ""Claims that a bill moved through the Legislature, with committee and floor-sessions in both chambers, seems hardly to have been fashioned behind closed doors, without allowing any citizen input."" The office of another co-sponsor, state Sen. Chip Shields, D-Portland, said opponents shouldn’t have been caught off-guard by the 2013 effort since Shields introduced ""a very similar bill"" the prior session, in 2011. That bill, SB 845, died in committee but not before a public hearing. We then emailed the governor’s office, asking who participated in the work group and whether that process proceeded in accordance with Oregon’s public meetings law requirements. Spokeswoman Rachel Wray provided the list of participants, who represented a variety of public and private interests -- four current and retired chiefs of police; members of four Latino-affairs and advocacy organizations; a labor union representative; dairy, nursery, restaurant and winegrower representatives; someone from Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon; and a member of the governor’s staff. We consulted state statutes, which give the governor a green light to convene such groups, so long as they make only recommendations for his consideration. The ruling: The 2013 Oregon Legislature, in a bipartisan effort, approved a bill providing driver cards to those unable to prove they are in the country legally. After the governor signed the bill, a group opposing it quickly gathered enough signatures to refer SB 833 to the November ballot. However, members of the group, Protect Oregon Driver Licenses, claim they were shut out of a 15-member work group that made recommendations for how the bill should be drafted, and that the effort was fashioned ""behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest."" The work group, in accordance with Oregon public meeting law, met privately, giving some credence to the opponents’ claim of meeting ""behind closed doors."" While the work group did not include those who opposed the effort outright, it did include a wide spectrum of views, from chiefs of police to industries and individuals potentially affected by the bill. In addition, the bill that ultimately passed, after two well-attended public sessions, went through at least one significant amendment and other tweaks. Dozens of people, including the opposition, testified before the bill’s eventual passage, making it hard to argue that, as an opposition spokesman asserted, everything was ""cooked and baked behind closed doors.""

David Gregory: Al-Qaida cast off ISIS as 'too extreme'
","Multiple rounds of U.S. airstrikes rained down against militant jihadists calling themselves the Islamic State this weekend. The operation was described by President Barack Obama as humanitarian intervention against the Islamic State’s genocidal activities in Iraq -- activities that even al-Qaida consider extreme, according to MSNBC host David Gregory. On Aug. 10’s Meet the Press, Gregory discussed the airstrikes with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Gregory wondered whether the group’s rapid emergence and success could have been predicted and prevented. ""This is a terror state trying to construct a caliphate, cast off by al-Qaida because this group is considered too extreme,"" he said. ""This is a big, expansive terrorist threat that has amassed on (Obama’s) watch."" We’ve heard before that the Islamic State -- which is also called ISIS --  is so extreme that even al-Qaida washed its hands of it, and we wondered if it was true. Who is the Islamic State? In February, al-Qaida’s central command formally severed ties with ISIS, as it was known then. Al-Qaida said in an Internet statement that ISIS ""is not a branch of the al-Qaida group (and) does not have an organizational relationship with it and (al-Qaida) is not the group responsible for their actions,"" reported the Washington Post. So the Islamic State certainly was cast off by al-Qaida. But was the disownment due to the Islamic State’s extreme actions, as Gregory suggests? Experts told us not entirely. To really understand the break-up, they said, we have to go back to the beginning of the Islamic State. 2003: A militant group known as JTJ (""Group for Monotheism and Holy War"" ) under the leadership of extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi bombs the United Nations Headquarters in Baghdad, killing 34. 2004: The JTJ pledges its allegiance to Osama bin Laden, and is now known as al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI). 2006: Zarqawi is killed in an airstrike. AQI is rebranded again as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). 2010: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is named leader of ISI, after his predecessor is killed in an American and Iraqi raid. 2013: Baghdadi claims that the active Syrian jihadist group, al-Nusra Front, is ""an extension of the Islamic State in Iraq and part of it,"" and the two groups should be considered one, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). ISIS begins to rapidly advance in Syria and Iraq. 2014: Al-Qaida central command dissolves its relationship with ISIS in February. Four months later, ISIS announces the establishment of a caliphate and changes its name to the Islamic State. The evolution of names of the Islamic State shows an evolution in their ambitions, and an expansion of their brand from an al-Qaida terror arm to an established insurgent army with territorial holds fighting on two fronts, said Austin Long, a security policy professor at Columbia University. And the Islamic State has now positioned itself as a more appealing alternative to its former parent al-Qaida for would-be jihadists. ""They’re not going to seek a reconciliation with al-Qaida, because why should they?"" Long said. ""They can say to their recruits, ‘You could be suicide bomber or you can join a legitimate army that’s establishing a caliphate.’ That’s a big selling point."" Too extreme for al-Qaida?  The differences between the Islamic State and al-Qaida are more deep-rooted than their current standing in the hierarchy of terror groups. But to categorize the Islamic State as ""too extreme"" isn’t quite accurate. In terms of fundamentalism, the Islamic State’s enforcement of Sharia law is certainly ""the most traditional of the traditional"" if not down-right draconian, said Colin Clarke, a terrorism expert at the think tank RAND. But, according to Long, al-Qaida just hasn’t had the opportunity to the do the same. As for brutality of actions, the extremism just manifests differently. Long and Clarke both pointed that al-Qaida certainly has not hesitated to kill civilians or fellow Muslims in certain contexts. The true difference between the two groups is ideological -- why and how to carry out a holy war, according to Long and William Braniff, executive director at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. The Islamic State Al-Qaida Goal Establish a caliphate Establish a caliphate through incremental steps (first, drive the West out of the Middle East) Purpose of violence To purify Islam, ignite a civil war To awaken the masses Method Mobilizing against ""the near enemy"" Mobilizing against the West Source: Interviews with Long and Braniff  Al-Qaida certainly has objected to the Islamic State’s sometimes anti-Muslim tactics since at least 2006, but the concerns were less about ethics and more about strategy. Al-Qaida’s current leader Ayman al-Zawahiri reprimanded the Islamic State, then al-Qaida in Iraq, in a letter that warns AQI against focusing on the wrong enemy and losing Muslim support. ""The Muslim populace who love and support you will never find palatable ... the scenes of slaughtering the hostages,"" Zawahiri wrote. ""Is the opening of another front now in addition to the front against the Americans and the government a wise decision? Or does this conflict with Shia lift the burden from the Americans by diverting the mujahedeen to the Shia, while the Americans continue to control matters from afar?"" Why was it disowned? The idea that the Islamic State was cast off by al-Qaida because of its brutality is ""a bit of a misnomer,"" Clarke said. ""Really the splintering emerged from a command and control problem."" Though al-Qaida’s central command has limited control over its affiliates, the Islamic State has actively disobeyed orders from headquarters. And its activities threaten the legitimacy of al-Qaida’s presence in the Middle East, while its conflicts with other terrorist affiliates were seen as destabilizing, Braniff said.   The biggest fallout was in 2013, when Baghdadi declared the establishment of ISIS, incorporating Syrian jihadist group Nusra Front without the consent of Nusra, experts agreed. Tensions metastasized when Nusra objected to this merge, and al-Qaida central had to step in. Al-Qaida’s Zawahiri scolded Baghdadi for declaring ISIS without asking or even talking to al-Qaida, and ruled that the two groups would be separate and confined to their respective countries-- Nusra in Syria, ISI in Iraq. Baghdadi said, no, ISIS would stay as ISIS. This feud with Nusra sowed the seeds for al-Qaida’s rejection of ISIS and siding with Nusra. By 2014, ISIS was continuing its violent tactics. What’s more, it was fighting with Nusra and other rebel groups actively. Al-Qaida had had enough. ""It’s true that ISIS is more brutal than al-Qaida would like, and al-Qaida had told them repeatedly to cool it with the killing of the shiites. But the problem really was that al-Qaida had been saying, ‘Hey stop this,’ and (ISIS) was not listening,"" Clarke said. The ruling Gregory said, the Islamic State was ""cast off by al-Qaida because this group is considered too extreme."" The Islamic State certainly was cast-off by al-Qaida, but to say it was because the Islamic State is ""considered too extreme"" is a bit of an oversimplification. While it is true that al-Qaida considered some of the Islamic State’s actions unnecessarily brutal, there were a couple of other reasons for the fallout. The Islamic State’s ideological differences with the al-Qaida brand and its constant failure to obey orders from headquarters had been sawing away its ties to al-Qaida for quite some time. In-fighting with Nusra in Syria and continued killing of fellow Muslims were the final straws. In short, shorthanding the Islamic State as too extreme leaves out the nuances behind the split.   We rate Gregory’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096952BC0>],/factchecks/2014/aug/13/david-gregory/david-gregory-al-qaida-cast-isis-too-extreme/

Mitch McConnell ad says he supported 'stronger' Violence Against Women Act than Barack Obama
","Sen. Mitch McConnell enlisted the help of his wife, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, to push back against claims from Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes that the Kentucky Republican is anti-women. ""Have you ever noticed how some liberals feel entitled to speak on behalf of all women? As if every woman agrees with Barack Obama,"" Chao says in an ad released Aug. 5, 2014. A narrator adds: ""Mitch McConnell co-sponsored the original Violence Against Women Act – he’s always supported its purpose. Mitch voted for even stronger protections than Obama’s agenda will allow."" We took a look at Grimes’ ad in a separate fact-check. We said the claim that McConnell voted ""two times against the Violence against Women Act"" was Half True, given McConnell’s history of voting in favor of the law at times. But what about McConnell’s response that he ""voted for even stronger protections"" than the Violence Against Women Act that President Barack Obama signed? The Violence Against Women Act first passed Congress in 1994 and, according to the Congressional Research Service, was ""intended to change attitudes toward domestic violence, foster awareness of domestic violence, improve services and provisions for victims, and revise the manner in which the criminal justice system responds to domestic violence."" The bill was reauthorized and expanded several times in the succeeding two decades, most recently in 2013. While the Violence Against Women Act sailed to reauthorization in 2000 and 2005, attempts to do so in 2012 and 2013 were marred by partisan fighting in Congress. Democrats presented a bill with three new components that many Republicans rejected: including victims of discrimination for sexual orientation and gender identity among ""underserved populations""; increasing the cap on U-Visas, a visa that grants nonimmigrant status to immigrant victims of domestic violence who assist police in prosecuting their attackers; allowing non-American Indian residents on tribal land to be prosecuted by tribal courts for domestic violence. The 2012 Senate bill died in the House, but the 2013 version passed Congress and was signed by Obama. Both years, Republicans offered their own versions of the Violence Against Women Act. Those measures, McConnell’s campaign said, included provisions that made them ""stronger"" than the bill Obama signed into law. What were those provisions? For starters, Republicans proposed mandatory minimum sentences — ranging from 5 to 15 years — on certain sexual assault crimes. However, advocates of domestic violence awareness were specifically against the inclusion of these provisions. The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women, an umbrella group for many stakeholders advocating on this issue, worried that long mandatory minimums would ""keep victims who were assaulted by someone they know from reporting"" and would create other issues in sentencing. ""These proposals are solutions in search of problems, and will only serve to exacerbate the already existing problem of prison overcrowding,"" the organization wrote. McConnell’s campaign also noted that the Republican amendments required that 30 percent of the grant money given to states and localities to train and assist law enforcement in combating violence against women must be set aside for sexual assault. The Democratic bill put the figure at 20 percent. But this was more a shift in priorities than anything. It wasn’t allocating extra money to combat violence against women, just mandating how much of the pot must be spent on a specific type of violence. Advocates of the Democratic bill said the Republican bill was weaker because it did not include the additional protections for LGBT, immigrants and American Indian women who are abused on tribal land by non-natives. While there were may have been considerable political differences on whether those provisions should be part of the Violence Against Women Act, it’s hard to claim that bills that didn’t include them — the ones McConnell supported — had ""stronger protections."" Our ruling McConnell’s ad claimed that he ""voted for even stronger protections than Obama’s agenda will allow."" Perhaps McConnell could argue that the mandatory minimum sentences Republicans required in their alternative made for a ""stronger"" bill, but advocates of domestic abuse awareness opposed this measure as unnecessary. And the Republican measure was absent several protections for certain groups that were included in the bill Obama signed. McConnell is within his right to oppose those provisions, but it makes it hard for him to prove that he supported ""stronger"" legislation.

Alison Lundergan Grimes ad claims McConnell twice voted against Violence Against Women Act
","Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes says in a new ad that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has forgotten that ""over half the voters in Kentucky are women."" The proof? Grimes turns to Ilene Woods, an elderly Kentucky woman, who sums it up in a question for Mitch McConnell: ""Senator, why did you vote two times against the Violence Against Women Act and against enforcing equal pay for women?"" Silence. ""I can never get him to answer this one either,"" Grimes offers. Does Grimes’ evidence hold water? Let’s take a look at McConnell’s record on the Violence Against Women Act to find out. This is a case where the literal truth is still somewhat misleading (as FactCheck.org dutifully laid out in its own review). The Violence Against Women Act was introduced in 1990 by Joe Biden, then a senator from Delaware. The bill created federal penalties for sex crimes, provided federal grants to law enforcement agencies to combat crimes against women, created the National Commission on Violent Crime Against Women, aided victims of sexual assault, funded women’s shelters and changed how courts can weigh a victim’s past sexual experience in sexual assault cases. McConnell was one of just three Republican cosponsors of the bill, along with 22 Democrats. It was sent to a committee but never came up for a vote. Biden tried again in 1991. Support was building. This time, McConnell was one of 10 Republican cosponsors and 56 overall. But again, it didn’t make it out of committee. The bill was introduced a third time by Biden in 1993. This time, there were 67 cosponsors, but McConnell wasn’t one of them. (His campaign would not say why.) While the bill once again died in committee, the language of it was adopted into the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a $30 billion omnibus crime bill that was also sponsored by Biden. The bill won widespread bipartisan support, passing the Senate in 1993 on a 95-4 vote. McConnell joined the majority of the Senate in voting for it. The House bill also contained the Violence Against Women Act, but included as well a much more controversial assault weapons ban. This was opposed by a majority of Senate Republicans, including McConnell. It passed the Senate 61 to 38, with McConnell voting against it, and Clinton signed it into law. The Violence Against Women’s Act was twice reauthorized, once in 2000 and again in 2005, passing the Senate unanimously on each occasion. The 2005 reauthorization occurred under Republican control of the Senate (McConnell was in the party leadership at the time) and included additions such as enhanced penalties for stalking and programs for American Indian victims, according to the Congressional Research Service. Grimes’ campaign, though, pointed to more recent votes against the Violence Against Women Act twice. Indeed, in 2012 and 2013, McConnell opposed the measured put forward by the Democratically controlled Senate. What were his objections in reauthorizing a bill he had supported many times throughout the previous two decades? McConnell contended that Democrats added a number of contentious provisions in the legislation that Republicans, who backed the overall legislation, could not sign off on. Republican angst was centered on three new components: including victims of discrimination for sexual orientation and gender identity among ""underserved populations""; increasing the cap on U-Visas, a visa that grants nonimmigrant status to immigrant victims of domestic violence who assist police in prosecuting their attackers; allowing non-American Indian residents on tribal land to be prosecuted by tribal courts for domestic violence against Native women. In both 2012 and 2013, Republicans put forward their own legislation that reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act without these three elements. In 2012, McConnell voted for an amendment offered by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. It failed 37 to 62. Later that day, the Senate passed the Democratic bill, but it couldn’t get through the GOP-controlled House. In 2013, the Senate again passed the Democratic measure. McConnell voted against the Democrats’ bill and for an unsuccessful amendment by Sen. Chuck Grassely, R-Iowa, that did not contain the provisions for LGBT victims, American Indians and immigrants. This time, the Senate bill passed the House, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. Our ruling Grimes’ ad claims McConnell twice voted against the Violence Against Women Act. The claim paints a very incomplete picture. McConnell supported the act repeatedly when it was first introduced and when it first passed the Senate in the early 1990s, and twice voted to reauthorize it. While he voted against the Democratic versions of the bill in 2012 and 2013 that included new provisions for sexual orientation, immigration status and tribal lands (and eventually became law), he voted for Republican measures that largely maintained the status quo. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context.

PAC accuses Rick Scott of letting Duke Energy fleece customers
","Gov. Rick Scott has a new enemy on the campaign trail: Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer. And Steyer has started bringing his message and massive checkbook to the airwaves. In an Aug. 8, 2014, commercial from Steyer’s political action committee NextGen Climate, the group accused the Republican incumbent of letting utility company Duke Energy run wild on the state’s citizens. The ad references the botched upgrade at the now-shuttered Crystal River nuclear plant and canceled Levy County nuclear project. ""We Floridians are paying billions to the nation's largest power company and getting nothing in return,"" says a TV reporter. Then the narrator: ""One defective power plant. Another never built. Florida fleeced by Duke Energy. Rick Scott knew, but he’s letting Duke keep collecting billions anyway."" The ad flashes a statement attributed to the Tampa Bay Times: ""Duke’s customers on the hook for up to $3.2 billion."" It also says Scott received $500,000 in campaign contributions from Duke and its pre-merger counterpart, Progress Energy, strongly implying a connection. The commercial was one of two NextGen Climate ads released attacking Scott. The other accused Scott of accepting campaign contributions from a Texas company performing unauthorized oil drilling in Collier County. We looked at that one in a separate item. It’s obvious Scott heard of the troubles in Citrus and Levy counties, since it was a major headache for the 1.7 million Florida residents billed by Duke Energy for electricity (the company said it doesn’t comment on political ads). But we wondered, is there something Scott could have done to prevent the utility from pulling in billions for the troubled projects, even though no customer is benefitting from them? PolitiFact Florida decided to check the fine print. The nuclear option  The saga of Duke Energy’s ill-fated nuclear plants on Florida’s west coast is complex, making it hard to comprehensively explain its ups and downs. (The Tampa Bay Times has extensively covered the morass.) We will give you a quick overview, though: In 2006, the state Legislature overwhelmingly passed SB 888, allowing utilities to charge a so-called ""advance fee"" to customers in order to pay for nuclear projects. The fee was based on the number of kilowatt hours the customers used, and shifted the expense of new nuclear projects to customers instead of shareholders. Unfortunately, while the bill allowed utilities to collect the fee for facilities yet to be built, there was no language included to ensure those companies had to actually build anything. That same year, Progress Energy began selecting a site in Levy County for a new nuclear power plant. Over the years, the potential cost of the project neared $25 billion, and Progress collected roughly $1 billion in advance fees to help pay for it. In 2009, Progress Energy was also upgrading its Crystal River nuclear plant by installing new steam generators. Progress elected to perform the upgrade itself and the reactor containment dome contracted during the project, requiring extensive repairs. Progress planned to reopen the plant in 2011, but the company committed one mistake after another in the work. Estimates to repair the building reached as high as $3.4 billion. Progress merged with Duke Energy in 2012. State lawmakers changed their tune about the advance fee in 2013 amending the 2006 law with SB 1472, saying a utility has 10 years after it gets its federal license to begin construction or lose access to the fees. The projects also had to be ""reasonable,"" an important addition, considering the Levy project had turned into the most expensive nuclear power plant in U.S. history. The same day lawmakers passed the amendment by a wide margin, the Florida Supreme Court rejected an environmental group’s challenge to the fee, saying the 2006 fee was constitutional and the state’s Public Service Commission had a framework with which to apply it. Duke then decided in 2013 to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fix it, even after using $265 million in advance fee money. The total cost of the Crystal River project grew to about $1.7 billion from repair work, having to buy electricity for customers elsewhere and other expenses. The company also canceled the Levy County project after spending $1.5 billion on it. Duke continued to clamor for more advance fee cash, saying it may one day continue the Levy County project or build a natural gas plant. They also claimed decommissioning the Crystal River facility would take 60 years and cost another $1.18 billion, much of which the utility collected for its federally required decommissioning fund. The five-member Public Service Commission voted 4-1 in October 2013 to settle with Duke Energy over $5 billion in costs for the two doomed projects. Customers would shoulder $3.2 billion in expenses, insurance would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest, with Duke keeping about $250 million ($150 million for Levy, $100 million for Crystal River). Customers will have to pay monthly charges of $3.45 per 1,000 kilowatt hours for Levy through the early part of 2016 and $2.17 for Crystal River through at least 2017 -- all for two projects that never produced any electricity in exchange for the money paid. Who’s to blame? The commission’s members are appointed by the governor, who relies on the Legislature to draft a list of nominees when members’ four-year terms are up. Of the five veteran members on the board under Scott, four were previously chosen by Gov. Charlie Crist, and one was originally picked by Gov. Jeb Bush. Scott reappointed each, and the Legislature confirmed them. ""Like judges appointed by the governor to the judiciary, PSC commissioners make independent decisions based on the established evidentiary record for each case,"" spokesperson Cindy Muir said. ""PSC decisions are not reviewed by the Legislature or the governor."" Scott did have some say on who served on the commission, however, although he has not spoken publicly about the two nuclear plants or the PSC’s vote. Scott could have urged lawmakers to deal with the advance fee, but no action was taken until 2013. Many lawmakers were still not pleased with the commission’s settlement. Rep. Dwight Dudley, D-St. Petersburg, called the 2013 changes to the fee ""total eyewash"" and several legislators demanded a complete repeal of the advance fee. That hasn’t happened. A change in the law is the only way consumers could avoid the advance fee, and that’s not up to the PSC or the governor alone, according to Public Counsel J.R. Kelly. ""Whether the governor likes it or not and, to a certain extent, whether the PSC likes it or not, they have to follow the law,"" Kelly said. ""I don’t know what the governor’s office or anyone else could have done."" He pointed out that whether or not the governor and the commissioners share opinions on subjects, the PSC’s board members are appointed to four-year terms in order to avoid political reprisals after making unpopular decisions. Commissioners can only be removed for malfeasance, he said. Our ruling NextGen Climate said Scott ""is letting Duke (Energy) keep collecting billions"" after the utility company took in billions for two failed nuclear projects. The $3.2 billion settlement was the decision of the Public Service Commission, however, and not the governor or the Legislature. Scott and lawmakers have a say in who serves as commissioners, but the board’s decisions in utility matters is final. Scott could have asked for a change in the advance fee from 2006 that led to the flap, but he didn’t. He also could have appointed commissioners who may have voted differently. Beyond that, there’s not much the governor could do about the settlement the PSC awarded Duke. But it’s not like Scott has spoken up on the issue. If anything, he has been notably silent.

Ron Johnson: Affluent taking advantage of student loans at expense of middle class families
","Roughly 40 million students have taken out loans to pay for college, contributing to about $1.2 trillion in outstanding loan balances nationwide, according to the Federal Reserve. Those students graduate with $30,000 in loan debt on average and about half of them worry about paying that debt back, a 2013 Urban Institute study found.   And according to Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the federal government is to blame for a system that is out of whack. ""I’ve got a problem where you’ve got kids coming from an affluent background, taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants for higher education and who’s paying for that?"" Johnson asked at a May 28th, 2014 town hall meeting in Bristol. ""I mean, in many cases, working class families – the middle class who aren't going to college, who aren’t sending their kids or they didn’t go to college themselves, and yet their tax money’s being used to fund the college educations of more affluent individuals."" Is this really the case? Johnson’s claim has two main parts so let’s take a look at both. ‘Affluent’ backgrounds The first part of Johnson’s claim is that some college students who come from an ""affluent background"" take advantage of federal student loans and grants so they can afford higher education. When we asked Johnson for backup, his policy advisor, Patrick McIlheran, said Johnson didn’t have a ""precise numerical definition"" in mind for affluent when he made the claim. Instead, Johnson meant the dictionary definition of affluent, which is ""having a generously sufficient and typically increasing supply of material possessions."" Meanwhile, federal student aid has no formal income limits. Rather, the U.S. Department of Education defines financial need as the difference between the cost of attending college and a family’s expected contribution to the education. This, of course, varies by university and family.   Federal student loans fall into two major categories -- subsidized and unsubsidized. For subsidized loans, a borrower needs to prove financial need to qualify. In these loans, the Department of Education pays interest on them while the student is in college and up until six months after the borrower leaves college, according to the department’s student aid website. In contrast, unsubsidized loans are available to all students with no financial need requirement. But unsubsidized loans accrue interest while the borrower is still in school and during the six-month grace period. In any case, the structure means the affluent students Johnson described, by and large would not be using the need-based subsidized loans. Even if those families borrow do direct unsubsidized loans, this comes at no cost to the federal government because these loans generate revenue, according to  Jon Fansmith, director of government relations at the American Council on Education, which represents presidents of accredited universities and colleges. A  2008 College Board study that analyzed debt level for student loans by income and labeled ""$120,000 or higher"" as its highest income bracket. That group accumulated the lowest amount of debt at $14,500 on average at public four-year universities and $18,000 at private, nonprofit universities. But there is no breakdown of whether that debt involved federal student loans, or whether any such loans were subsidized or unsubsidized. In any case, that income bracket is also the fastest growing category of student loan debt, according to an August 2012 Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Reserve data. Johnson’s claim also included grants being used by affluent students. But the Department of Education restricts Pell Grants to those who meet income-eligibility standards, which targets them for the neediest financial aid recipients. Students whose families earn below $20,000 annually often qualify for Pell Grants but, in some cases, those from families earning up to $50,000 can receive them. Again, this rules out the ""affluent"" students mentioned in Johnson’s claim. Who ""funds"" student aid? In the second part of the claim, Johnson said middle class taxpayers who didn’t attend college, or have any connection to college,  fund ""federal loan programs and grants."" Here it’s important to understand how the student loan programs work. The system is structured to be self-sufficient and even generate revenue. That is, the costs of administering the program are covered by loan repayments, so it’s not part of the general fund budget that is picked up by average taxpayers. The Department of Education budget draws on funds from the Treasury to shoulder the costs of subsidized loans, grants, and the repayment of some loans. This money from the Treasury is indirectly funded by taxpayers, Fansmith said. When loan payments are collected, those funds are then returned to the Treasury so student loans generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually for the federal government, Fansmith said. This actually reduces the deficit, he said, rather than costs general taxpayers anything.   But loan repayment and forgiveness programs that rely on ""general appropriations"" do affect the nation’s roughly 143 million taxpayers. So that tab is shared by those who have college degrees and those who don’t. There are more than 50 repayment programs. In most cases, they are aimed at helping individuals who take jobs in specific areas, such as teaching in low-income school districts or working in particular government agencies. Newer programs, aimed at alleviating the student debt crisis, are open to more people. For instance, the ""Pay As You Earn"" plan took effect July 1, 2014. It allows borrowers to repay their debt for up to 20 years -- twice as long as most standard repayment cycles -- and then the federal government repays their remaining debt. As its name suggests, the PAYE plan offers lower monthly payment rates that depend on 10 percent of a borrower’s income. So borrowers with higher incomes -- the more affluent -- would still pay more than others. The Department of Education estimated the program would cost more than $2.1 billion between 2012 and 2021 but its final cost has not been determined, according to the Congressional Research Service. In any case, the costs won’t won’t really kick in until 2017, when the U.S. Dept. of Education starts paying off the first round of borrowers’ remaining debt. The Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research group, released a study in April 2014 that estimates existing repayment programs could cost the federal government four times more than the Department of Education anticipated, totaling roughly $3,400 overall per borrower. Of course, any such costs would affect the general budget and all taxpayers. Our rating Johnson said those ""coming from an affluent background"" are ""taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants"" while many middle-class families with no connection to college are picking up the tab. In some cases, affluent people get a subsidized loan and based on repayment programs, some small portion hits the general fund. But then it’s picked by all taxpayers not simply the group Johnson mentioned -- middle class taxpayers with no ties to college. In short, he vastly overstates the problem on both ends and makes a link that he cannot clearly establish based on available data. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973DEA80>],/factchecks/2014/aug/13/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-affluent-taking-advantage-student-loan/

Perdue largely on target with claim about businesspeople in Senate
","Republican David Perdue is hoping to parlay his achievements in corporate America into a six-year term as a U.S. senator from Georgia. At virtually every campaign stop since he announced his candidacy last year, Perdue has stressed his leadership at well-known corporations, including Sara Lee, Reebok and Dollar General. ""There are only about 10 people in the United States Senate who have any real business experience,"" Perdue said during a recent campaign swing through Middle Georgia. ""And with my 40-year career, I hope to add some value to the debate of how to break the gridlock between tax increases and spending cuts and get this economy going and put people back to work."" Perdue, 64, and Democrat Michelle Nunn, 47, are first-time candidates locked in one of this year’s most closely watched elections. The outcome of the race will help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate for the final two years of Barack Obama’s presidency. Libertarian Amanda Swafford is also in the race, which will determine who succeeds retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. PolitiFact Georgia decided to ponder Perdue’s point -- with 100 members in the U.S. Senate, could only one in 10 senators have a background in business? We started with the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Quarterly Roll Call Guide to the New Congress, two sources of detailed information on House and Senate members, including their average age, religion and education. In the 113th Congress, 27 senators identified ""business"" as their occupation, according to the groups’ data. But it’s more complicated than that. The law was the No. 1 occupation in the Senate (with 55 out of 100), followed by careers in public service and or politics (with 42 members listing that as their occupation), according to the data. Here’s the complication: There were two qualifiers to the data. In responding to a survey by Congressional Quarterly, some members of Congress listed more than one occupation, and members of Congress may not have been practicing their listed profession immediately before they entered Congress. As for Perdue, he is using a number that campaign researchers gleaned by going through the biographies of all 100 senators, said Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s spokesman. ""The occupational summary information available online was fairly generic and did not describe primary work responsibilities,"" Dickey said. He said the campaign research zeroed in on senators who worked in the corporate world or had responsibility for a company’s profit and loss margins. ""Some of the members’ primary occupations are debatable, which is why we use the language ‘about 10,’ "" Dickey said. Perdue isn’t the first candidate to make his business background a key campaign focus. In 2010, businessman Ron Johnson unseated Russ Feingold, a three-term Wisconsin Democrat, in one of the most hotly contested Senate races of the midterms. Political pundits said Johnson capitalized on the electorate’s economic angst with an ad that pointed out that the 100-member Senate had 57 lawyers, including Feingold, but just one accountant and no manufacturers. Johnson, who is an accountant and manufacturer, presented himself as a candidate with know-how to balance a budget and create jobs. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that a candidate promoting himself as a businessman is trying to project the image of someone who is ""practical, knows the value of hard work and knows how to balance a budget."" ""In this particular case, though, I doubt Perdue has any occupational edge over Nunn,"" Sabato said. ""Running a nonprofit requires some of the same skills, and the Points of Light foundation has the added advantage of being tied to a former GOP president -- no doubt one reason why Nunn stresses it."" So where does this leave us? Perdue identified ""about 10"" business people in the Senate. His campaign research was more narrowly focused on people with responsibility for a company’s bottom line. But the overarching theme of Perdue’s statement is correct. Members who are or consider themselves as business people are in the minority in the U.S. Senate. And that’s according to his tally and official records.

Is having a kid a leading trigger for poverty?
","Everyone knows that raising kids isn’t cheap. The latest estimate from the U.S. Agriculture Department says parents shell out over $240,000 for the average child by the time he or she is 18. For many families, that can be tough to manage, but a tweet from the advocacy group Moms Rising says the consequences can be very dire indeed. ""Having a baby is a leading cause of poverty spells in the United States,"" the group tweeted on Aug. 5, 2014. Moms Rising supports paid family leave and boasts a membership of more than 1 million people. For proof, the group points to a 2012 article in The Nation that said, ""a quarter of all ‘poverty spells’— falling into poverty for two months or more at a time — begin with the birth of a child."" The article did not cast the birth of a child as a leading reason a person would slip into poverty, but it did link to a 2001 report by Jane Waldvogel, a professor of social work and public affairs at Columbia University. Waldvogel’s language was a bit more cautious than what appeared in The Nation. ""Recent estimates suggest that one quarter of all poverty spells in the United States begin with the birth of a new child,"" Waldvogel wrote. Waldvogel based that on 1998 data from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. Here’s the key table: Percentage of First Poverty Spell Beginning by Event Event Spell Began 1973-79 Spell Began 1980-85 Spell Began 1986-91 First birth - single mom 4.2 5.8 7.3 First birth - other 2.3 4.5 2.3 Second birth and up 9.2 10.2 17.9 Sub-total births 15.7 20.5 27.5 Mom’s work hours dropped 500+ hours/year 12.5 21.4 28.6 Other adult’s work hours dropped 500+ hours/year - no change in family structure 29 27.7 27.7 Other adult’s work hours dropped 500+ hours/year - change in family structure 24.6 22.9 16.3 Sub-total work hours drop 66.1 72 72.6   Let’s take the period when having a child had the biggest impact. When we add up the percentages tied to the arrival of a new baby, we see the source of the 28 percent cited by Waldvogel. But while that’s a large number, it fails to prove that the birth of a child was a leading change that tipped people into poverty. Since we added up the numbers tied to births, it makes as much sense to to add up the numbers for another set of related events, loss of work hours. The total there is 72.6 percent, or more than twice as large as having a child. The original table included four more categories that caused a poverty spell, including divorce, moving or becoming injured and unable to work. The chart doesn’t add up to 100 percent because respondents could select more than one category that fit their situation. We asked Ann Huff Stevens, an economist and director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of California-Davis, what she made of these figures. ""That, to me, suggests that pregnancy is not the leading cause of poverty,"" Stevens said. However, Stevens warned that no one should go too far down the path of adding up the percentages because the events are not mutually exclusive. In other words, one person could experience both the birth of a child and a loss of work hours or some other event. She did note that the 1986-91 period was unusual because no full recession took place in those years. Stevens said in good times, giving birth would play a bigger role as a poverty trigger because the other leading trigger, job loss, would be less common when the economy is doing well. A 2014 report from the Health and Human Services Department reaffirms the primacy of a job. The target group is different, single mothers who start receiving welfare payments, but the pattern is consistent with the 1998 table. In the 2004-06 period, the three leading events that put a woman into poverty were: Recipient’s earnings decreased (48.6 percent), Other household earnings decreased (23.8 percent),  and New child in family (22.9 percent). Teasing out the most important events Part of the problem with the HHS table -- which is essentially the source for Moms Rising’s tweet -- is that the events that trigger poverty can overlap. This makes it difficult to say which is most important. But in 2002, analysts with the Urban Institute, an academic center in Washington, took the data files behind the HHS tables and used more sophisticated tools to assess how much each event -- by itself -- mattered. They calculated the likelihood of a person slipping into poverty if one of seven changes occurred. Event Likelihood of slipping into poverty Head of household loses employment 16.7% Shift from two-adult to female-headed household 15.3% Spouse loses employment 8.9% Another household member loses employment 7.2% Child under age 6 enters household 5.8% Head of household becomes disabled 5.8% Young adult sets up own household 4.6%   One of the Urban Institute researchers, Caroline Ratcliffe, said having a child plays a role, but not a leading one. ""The impact of having a child isn’t as large as losing a job,"" Ratcliffe said. ""But in the different analyses, we find that it’s either as important or more important than the onset of a disability of the family head."" Out of the seven events Ratcliffe assessed, having a child ranks in the bottom three and it is about a third as potent a factor as job loss. Sheldon Danziger, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and president of the Russell Sage Foundation, a group that funds poverty research, said the claim from Moms Rising puts too much weight on the wrong issue. ""The primary problem is an economic one,"" Danziger said. ""If you grow up poor and live in a bad neighborhood and go to a bad school and you are not likely to go to college, you are likely to be poor at age 20 whether or not you have had a child."" Our ruling The advocacy group Moms Rising said having a baby is a major reason someone will slip into poverty. The evidence cited by Moms Rising goes back to 1998 and while one might say that having a child can trigger a spell of poverty about a quarter of the time, the impact of job loss is much greater. The most careful analysis separated the relative influence of different life changes. According to that, having a child ranks low and is much less important that changes in employment or shifting from a two-adult to a female-headed household. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A415AC0>],/factchecks/2014/aug/12/moms-rising/having-kid-leading-trigger-poverty/

Conservative group says Hispanic business growth is three times faster than the national average
","A conservative grassroots organization is targeting a demographic group that the GOP is struggling to win over -- Hispanics. The Libre Initiative is a 501(c)4 nonprofit that has ties to the Koch brothers. They reach out to the traditionally liberal Hispanic community, espousing conservative ideals in favor of economic and religious freedom, and against the Affordable Care Act. Their stated stance on immigration reform is that they believe the system should have a streamlined process for allowing immigrants to work legally in the United States, though their view on how to handle illegal immigrants already in the country is less clear. Part of the Libre Initiative’s mission is to promote business development in the Hispanic community, even hosting a small business summit with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They shared a positive fact about Hispanic-owned businesses on Facebook and Twitter over the weekend. ""The startup rate of Hispanic businesses is three times the national rate,"" they said. Knowing that Hispanics continue to make up a larger and larger share of the U.S. population, we decided to look into their business growth, too. Growing and growing The Libre Initiative directed us to a White House report on the Fiscal Year 2013 budget that included the same claim, without elaboration. ""According to the most recent Census data, Hispanics are opening businesses at a rate three times faster than the national average,"" it said. So we turned to the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau conducts a survey of business owners every five years, broken down by various demographic groups, industry, size and location. The most recent report came out in 2010 and looks at the years 2002 to 2007. (The bureau will release the next report in 2015.) The survey defines Hispanic-owned businesses as those operating in the United States that ""self-identified 51 percent or more of their ownership… to be by individuals of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or other Hispanic or Latino origin."" According to the 2010 report, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses grew 43.7 percent from 2002 to 2007. The national average growth rate was 18 percent, so Hispanic-owned businesses grew at a rate that was a little more than twice as fast. But the growth was not quite three times as fast as the national average, so we jumped back five years to the previous business owners survey results, which came out in 2006. This survey seems to contain the claims’ origin. Between 1997 and 2002, the national average growth rate for businesses was 10 percent, and the growth rate for Hispanic-owned business was 31 percent -- just over three times the national rate. We found a 2013 report by business intelligence firm Geoscape and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that had some more recent data. The report projected that in 2013, there would be 3.16 million Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States -- a growth rate of 40 percent since 2007. The Geospace report also said the average annual increase in Hispanic-owned firms during that time frame was 6.66 percent, compared to 3.14 percent annual growth among all U.S. firms. ""The Hispanic population has been starting and growing new businesses at nearly twice the rate of the general population and this trend has continued for more than 10 years,"" the report says. Service areas and technology are among the top industries where this growth is happening. The growth of Hispanic-owned businesses mirrors the country’s rising Hispanic population. Between 2000 and 2010, the Hispanic population grew from 35.3 million to 54.1 million, which is more than a 50 percent growth, according to the Pew Hispanic Trends Project. All businesses are responding to the growing Hispanic consumer base -- and their more than $1 trillion purchasing power --  said Javier Palomarez, CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The Hispanic community is generally aware of and responds well to Hispanic-led businesses, which might be aiding the growth, Palomarez said. He added that the Hispanic population is younger than the non-Hispanic population, which means they tend to be more technology-able and innovative. Our ruling The Libre Initiative said, ""The startup rate of Hispanic businesses is three times the national rate."" We found data that showed the number of Hispanic-owned businesses growing at three times the national rate between 1997 and 2002. However, more recent data shows a growth rate of Hispanic-owned businesses that’s closer to twice the national rate. The overall trend -- that Hispanic-owned businesses are popping up faster than other demographics -- is correct, though.   We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966FFAC0>],/factchecks/2014/aug/12/libre-initiative/conservative-group-says-hispanic-business-growth-t/

Mayor on target in estimating city's needs
","Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed is talking about going before voters in March with a plan for chipping away at a backlog of repairs to city roads, sidewalks, bridges and buildings. Some of the projects could be retreads from a grab bag of $7 billion-plus in road and sidewalk improvements that were pitched to voters in 10 metro counties in 2012. The transportation sales tax, or T-SPLOST as it was called, was rejected by a majority of voters in nine of 12 regions across the state, but not by Atlantans. Nearly 60 percent of voting city residents supported the 1 percent tax. Details of the proposed March referendum are still being ironed out, including what projects would be funded. But at a news conference July 29, Reed talked of the work that’s waiting. ""There is no dispute. The minimum number of infrastructure (needs) in Atlanta is $900 million,"" the mayor told reporters. We decided a fact check was in order and reached out to the city and Tom Weyandt, Atlanta’s deputy chief operating officer. Weyandt told us $900 million is on the conservative side. At least one forecast puts the costs of the backlog of projects at about $1.02 billion, with $881 million in transportation, $130.8 million for facilities. (Some estimates out there are as high as $1.1 billion.) The $1.02 billion cost projections are based on two reports -- one from 2010 that sized up the condition of city bridges, roads, sidewalks, streetlights, traffic signals and signs; and one completed this year that looked at city buildings in need of repair or replacement. On the long list of potential transportation projects are 1,634 miles of road that need resurfacing and vast portions of sidewalks and curbs that require improved access for the disabled. (In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated a compliance review of the facilities and policies of the city of Atlanta as it relates to provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. As one of the outcomes, the city’s Public Works Department had to identify and install curb ramps on sidewalks resurfaced since January 1992. The estimated backlog is 31,442 noncompliant intersections at an estimated cost of $52 million.) Also identified as in need of repair or replacement are 14 bridges that have been rated poor to fair. The average age of a bridge in the city is 57 years old, and the oldest has stood for 108 years, according to city records. A recent presentation suggests city officials divvy up the $1 billion-plus this way: $262 million, or 31 percent, in street resurfacing; $259 million, or 30 percent, in bridge replacement and maintenance; and $204 million, or 24 percent, in sidewalks, curbs and ADA ramps. The remaining 15 percent would go to signals, streetlights, signs, unpaved roads, school zone flashers and similar improvements. In terms of facility improvements, tentative plans call for putting $130.8 million into returning some fire stations, police stations and recreation centers to good condition. For some that would mean renovation. For others, it would mean replacement. The referendum is expected to be for a maximum of $250 million in bonds, said Anne Torres, the mayor’s spokesman. The understanding is that more money would be requested from voters down the road, she said. A final list of proposed projects for the referendum is expected by November or December. To summarize: Reed said the city has infrastructure needs that will cost at least $900 million. That’s a conservative estimate based on studies and previous comments by him and others. We rate Reed’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D47A40>],/factchecks/2014/aug/12/kasim-reed/mayor-gives-conservative-estimate-city-needs/

Bloggers: Bill and Melinda Gates, George Soros funded Sierra Leone lab that started Ebola outbreak
","The underbelly of the Internet is no place to find credible information about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Last week we brought you example No. 1. Example No. 2 is as follows: Several conspiracy websites have raised questions lately about a ""bioweapons lab"" in Sierra Leone being the source of the virus. Questions like, ""What's behind the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone? Could it possibly be a U.S. bioweapons project gone amuck?"" Some of the websites tie the ""bioweapons lab"" to billionaires George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. ""At the epicentre of the current Ebola epidemic is the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, which houses a U.S. a (sic) biosecurity level 2 bioweapons research lab with links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Soros Foundation,"" reads an excerpt shared on sites like RumorMillsNews.com and BeforeItsNews.com. We wanted to set the record straight. Soros and Gates There’s no proof of Soros and Gates funding a bioweapons lab in Kenema, one of the largest cities in Sierra Leone with a population of about 150,000. And there’s really no case that a bioweapons lab in Kenema is behind the outbreak. ""The assertion is absurd,"" said Chris Williams, spokesman for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation did provide a $1 million Ebola-related grant to support emergency efforts in West Africa by UNICEF, he said. A spokeswoman for Soros’ Open Society Foundations also said it does not fund any labs, much less a bioweapons lab, in West Africa. We can’t exactly pinpoint the reason people are connecting Soros and the Gateses to the Ebola outbreak, our best guess is people are trying to insinuate they had something to do with creating the current crisis. One blogger who invoked the Soros/Gates connection, Dublinsmick, referenced the website of the ""viral fever bioweapons lab inside Kenema Government Hospital,"" saying it ""read like a roll call of New World Order organizations."" The New World Order is a popular conspiracy theory whereby a group of wealthy elites plan to take over the world. Here’s the list, which does not include Soros or Gates: The Consortium is a collaboration between Tulane, Scripps Research Institute, Broad Institute, Harvard University, University of California at San Diego, University of Texas Medical Branch, Autoimmune Technologies LLC, Corgenix Medical Corporation, Kenema Government Hospital (Sierra Leone), Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (Nigeria) and various other partners in West Africa. …The Consortium intends to expand this program to include other important infectious agents such as Ebola, Marburg and other Arenaviruses that are of great concern to public health and bioterrorism,"" states the bioweapons lab website. This text matches a list of partners of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium, which conducts research at Kenema. No, it does not describe itself as a bioweapons lab. And the program director said there is no financial connection to Gates or Soros. We did find one very, very loose Soros-Gates link. One of the Broad Institute researchers who is part of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium is a Harvard University computational geneticist who earned her medical degree from Harvard Medical School as a Soros Fellow, and her work is supported by awards from groups that include the Gates Foundation. Of course, she was also a Rhodes scholar, won a Packard Foundation award in science and engineering, and was recognized by the National Institutes of Health with an Innovator Award. A spokeswoman for the Broad Institute, Haley Bridger, said the institute has not received money from Soros. She said it has received money from the Gates Foundation, but it was for research on tuberculosis, not Ebola. The consortium Before the current Ebola outbreak, members of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium focused their work on a bigger concern in West Africa: Lassa fever, a viral disease with symptoms that resemble Ebola but is more common than Ebola in that area. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded a five-year, $15 million contract to Tulane to continue researching Lassa fever, and the consortium was created in 2010. Tulane University researchers have worked in the area for about a decade to better understand Lassa fever and develop modern diagnostic assays, or tests to see if a person has the fever, and treatments. Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone is a major partner of the research scientists from Tulane and other universities. The multi-facility hospital contains a laboratory and ward dedicated to Lassa fever research and isolating Lassa fever patients. When the first Ebola case was diagnosed in Guinea, about three hours from the Kenema site in in early 2014, a team from the consortium went to Kenema to help the site switch gears. ""We were there working 10 years and then Ebola came here,"" said Dr. Robert Garry, a Tulane University professor and program manager of the consortium. ""We’re not here to turn Lassa and Ebola into a kind of superweapon. It can do that on its own."" The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases also sometimes works in the facility, Garry said. Part of its mission is to prevent viruses like Ebola and Lassa fever from being used deliberately as bioterrorism agents against soldiers and civilians. It did not respond to our inquiry by our deadline.  Ebola infections have cropped up over the years, but the latest spell is the deadliest, with 961 deaths and 1,779 infections reported by the World Health Organization. The first case was reported in Gueckedou, Guinea, in early 2014 before it spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, some of the poorest parts of Africa with limited access to medical care (and in some cases, a deep mistrust among some residents of medical professionals spreading the disease). So, no, it did not start at the country-owned hospital in Kenema, though the city is a major player in a very dispersed outbreak. The hospital’s medical staff is in the thick of treating patients infected with the Ebola virus, and several nurses and doctors have died in the course of treating patients. That includes Dr. Sheik Umar Kahn, a worldwide pioneer of Ebola research from Sierra Leone who died July 28. Kahn was the physician in charge of the Lassa Fever Program at the Kenema hospital, so he worked with researchers from Tulane and elsewhere. ""The conspiracy theories really just kind of, wow,"" Garry said. ""Our teammates are dying, and you’re talking this trash about us."" Our ruling Bloggers worried about the New World Order connected the bank accounts of Soros and Gates to a facility responding to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone -- a facility they strongly suggest is responsible for the outbreak. A direct link to the billionaires is unproven. One researcher who received education and research grants from their foundations does not warrant the much-hyped connection. Moreover, the virus did not start from a research lab in Kenema, giving the bloggers’ incendiary claims even less credibility.

Hymes says Chafin took money from Southwest Va. schools while voting for new legislative building
","In a special state Senate election, Democrat Mike Hymes accuses Republican Del. Ben Chafin of cutting education spending while giving legislators a luxurious office building in Richmond. The Aug. 19 contest between Chafin and Hymes, a Tazewell County supervisor who is also a human resources corporate director for a coal company, will fill the seat of former Sen. Phillip P. Puckett, D-Russell. It will decide control of the chamber. Hymes recently released a television ad that accuses Chafin of putting his own needs before students. Here’s what the ad’s narrator says: ""Wonder why Southwest Virginia doesn’t get its fair share from Richmond? Here’s one reason – Del. Ben Chafin, a millionaire lawyer, took money away from public schools here while wasting it over there. Ben Chafin voted to tear down this legislative office building and build a nearly half-billion dollar politician’s palace in its place, putting his luxury before our kids’ education."" We looked into Hymes’ claim that Chafin stripped money from his region’s schools while voting for fancy new digs for the General Assembly. Education money We defined Southwest Virginia based on a map from Radford University. The region stretches from Lee County in the corner of the state to Roanoke County. The region includes 19 counties and six cities. Chafin has served only this year in the House of Delegates. The fiscal year 2014, which covers the 2013-14 school year, just ended June 30, so we compared the numbers for this year and the recently approved budget that covers the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years. Here’s the state aid to Southwest Virginia by school year: 2013-14, $606 million 2014-15, $620 million 2015-16, $638 million Meanwhile, public school enrollment is expected to continue to decline, so school divisions will actually receive more aid per student. The Education Department will adjust during the school year based on actual attendance. Here’s the state aid per student for Southwest Virginia: 2013-14, $5,713 2014-15, $5,887 2015-16, $6,133 So, what did the Hymes camp use to explain its claim? Campaign manager Peter Clerkin sent us a link to the Virginia Education Association’s budget wrap that compared spending in each division between the proposed budget from then-Gov. Bob McDonnell to what was actually enacted. The amount ultimately adopted for Tazewell schools, for example, was a bit lower than what was originally proposed, so the Hymes campaign considers that a cut. But it’s not a cut in spending -- the approved level of funding increases in the next couple of years. Tazewell schools received $35.8 million in the 2013-2014 budget year to $37.2 million in 2014-2015 and $36.8 million in 2015-2016. In Russell County, approved spending of $28 million this year is expected to fall to $26.8 million by 2015-2016. Amid falling enrollments, both Tazewell and Russell will see an increase in the amount of state aid spent per pupil, which is a more fair way of tracking education spending. When looking at all Southwest Virginia districts -- not just the two counties Hymes cited -- the amount of state aid rises under the adopted budget. Funding for a year-old compensation grant program was eliminated. We would agree that was a true cut, to the tune of $7.5 million. But only two divisions in Southwest Virginia -- Roanoke City and Salem -- received money through this program. Hymes also cites the budget’s change in funding for the K-3 class size reduction program, but the overall amount for that initiative is still projected to rise under the adopted budget. He also notes the budget eliminated a plan to loan money from the literary fund for school construction, but that hasn’t been done since 2008, so it's hard to say that amounts to a cut. Before we examine Hymes’ legislative office building claim, a key thing to keep in mind is the general fund and lottery sources of money that pay for education programs are not what would have been used for a new General Assembly building. ""Politicians’ Palace"" Readers of the Richmond Times-Dispatch are well acquainted with the legislators’ office and meeting building, which has been the subject of many articles on its decrepitude. Its issues include asbestos, fire and safety code violations and a crumbling facade. The proposed project to tear it down and build a new office building also includes renovation to Old City Hall and construction of a parking garage, funded by a $300 million bond sale. This project was never considered in a stand-alone vote, but was instead considered as part of the caboose budget bill, which makes final adjustments for the current fiscal year. Chafin voted for that caboose budget bill. It’s not for us to say whether the project is a waste. But the measure was a minute piece of a much larger -- $89 billion -- two-year spending plan. And McAuliffe ordered all work on a $300 million replacement stopped, perhaps in retaliation for the loss of Medicaid expansion in the budget. In a final piece of irony, the Virginia Education Association named Chafin a ""legislative champion"" -- a recognition that would be unlikely if Chafin had indeed conspired to take money away from schools. He introduced a budget amendment to authorize paying the state’s share of a 6 percent salary increase for public school employees. This was an VEA legislative wish list, but was unfulfilled. Our ruling Hymes suggests there’s a tie between education spending and a new office building for legislators. School aid comes from the general fund, which is supported by sales and income taxes, while the construction project would have been a separate expense covered by borrowing money through bonds. They come from two distinct parts of the budget and a bond sale would not have hurt the amount of general fund money available for schools. That misplaced comparison is compounded by an inaccurate statement regarding funding for Southwest Virginia schools. Chafin did not take money away from schools. Overall, schools in Southwest Virginia will see an increase both in total state aid and state aid per pupil under the recently approved budget. We rate the claim False. CORRECTION: An earlier version was incorrect on teacher pay for the coming school year. Teachers will not receive a pay increase.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE8D00>],/factchecks/2014/aug/11/mike-hymes/hymes-says-del-ben-chafin-took-money-sw-schools-wh/

NCAA president: Student-athletes graduate more often than other students
","The line between amateur and professional for college athletes is up for grabs in the courts, but the NCAA continues to argue that its players are amateurs because they truly are students. Last week, a U.S. district court judge in California ruled against the college athletics association in a case filed by a former basketball player from the University of California at Los Angeles. The decision in Ed O’Bannon vs. NCAA said student-athletes cannot be banned from profiting off of their own names and likenesses. The NCAA plans to appeal the decision, at least in part, said president Mark Emmert on ABC News’ This Week Aug. 10. Emmert defended the athletes’ amateur status by emphasizing their academic successes. ""Many, many, many thousands of student-athletes take full advantage of the opportunity to be both a student and an athlete while they’re in college,"" Emmert said. ""The vast majority of them graduate. More graduate than the students who aren’t student-athletes. So I believe strongly, and more importantly, the evidence demonstrates that indeed they are students."" With how much time student-athletes spend in practice, in games and on the road, we wondered if it’s true that they have higher graduation rates than their nonathlete peers. The rates The NCAA calculates its graduation success rate by tracking how many student-athletes graduate within six years of enrolling, including students who transfer between schools in good academic standing. Using this measurement, the NCAA Division I student-athlete graduation rate was 82 percent for students who enrolled in 2006 and graduated by 2012. In Division II, the graduation rate was 69 percent for the 2006 cohort. Division III schools aren’t required to disclose their graduation rates to the NCAA. But among those that did, the graduation rate for students who enrolled in 2005 was 88 percent. However, there is no general student body graduation data using the NCAA’s parameters. To show that the student-athlete graduation rate is higher than that of the student body, NCAA officials point to the federal graduation rate, which counts both student athletes and the general student body. It’s different than the NCAA measurement because it only counts students who graduate from the institution where they first enrolled and not transfer students. (The purpose is to measure retention.) To get an idea of the size difference between the two pools, the federal rate included 82,226 Division I student-athletes in 2012, and the NCAA rate included 91,701. The federal measurement tends to calculate a much lower student-athlete graduation rate than the NCAA’s measurement. Using this measurement, 65 percent of Division I student-athletes who enrolled in 2006 and graduated by 2012. This is only 1 percentage point higher than the general student body, which had a 64 percent graduation rate. The difference is a little bigger in the other divisions. Division II athletes had a graduation rate of 68 percent, while the general student body had a rate of 64 percent. For Division III (the 2005 cohort) the student-athlete rate was 54 percent compared with 48 percent generally. Researchers at the College Sports Research Institute at the University of South Carolina have also expressed concern that these calculations include part-time students in the general student body. Part-time students are less likely to graduate in the six-year time frame, bringing down an institution’s overall graduation rate. (The NCAA requires student-athletes to go to school full time.) The institute’s adjusted graduation rate calculations regularly show major negative gaps between Division I football and men’s basketball graduation rates and that of their nonathlete peers. Breaking it down further The graduation rates vary wildly by sport, school and demographic group.  For example, compare men’s basketball and football (what often comes to mind when we think college sports) to the general student body and other student-athletes: Group NCAA grad rate Federal grad rate   General student body n/a 64 percent All Div. I student-athletes 82 percent 65 percent Men’s basketball 70 percent 47 percent Football — bowl subdivision 70 percent 59 percent Football and basketball have the lowest graduation rates using the NCAA measurement. Additionally, more than half of the 18 women’s sports have graduation rates higher than 90 percent, while only one men’s sport — fencing — has a graduation rate above 90 percent. Under the federal measurement, the sports with the highest graduation rates are: men’s gymnastics with 88 percent, women’s gymnastics with 83 percent and women’s lacrosse with 80 percent. Some experts have taken issue with the NCAA’s claim because the graduation rates vary depending on the team, meaning one group’s success could mask another’s troubles. ""Emmert is not referring to football and men's basketball, which is considerably lower,"" said Gerald Gurney, a former senior associate athletic director for academics at Oklahoma University. ""The problem in college sports is not with the women's soccer team."" Additionally, it’s difficult to compare the graduation rates and other academic successes of student-athletes to nonathletes because some programs keep their athletes up to NCAA academic standards ""by any means necessary,"" said Dave Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University. He referenced the recent controversy at the University of North Carolina, where some football players were registered for fake classes to get easy As. ""Keeping them eligible by any means necessary … might lead to graduation, but are they educated?"" Ridpath said. Our ruling Emmert said, ""more (student-athletes) graduate than the students who aren’t student-athletes."" Experts, the government and the NCAA don’t agree on how this data should be calculated. But the best and most recent measurement we have for drawing a comparison shows that the graduation rate among Division I student-athletes is about the same as the general student body, though it is higher for Division II and Division II. But the graduation rates are not the same across all sports, divisions, schools or demographics, so a group with a particularly good or bad graduation rate could skew the overall results. Because the data is inconclusive, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097706D40>],/factchecks/2014/aug/10/mark-emmert/ncaa-president-student-athletes-graduate-more-ofte/

Graham: U.S. intelligence leaders predicting ISIS attack in America
","President Barack Obama’s decision to launch limited, open-ended air strikes against Islamic militant positions in Iraq has drawn criticism that the situation demands a more muscular military response. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Armed Services Committee, described the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, the force that has quickly occupied a large section of Iraq, as ""an existential threat"" to the United States. ""Do you really want to let America be attacked?"" Graham asked on Fox News Sunday. ""What is going on in Washington when the FBI director, when the head of national intelligence, the CIA, the Homeland Security secretary, tells every member of Congress, including the president, we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq? ""If he does not go on the offensive against ISIS, ISIL, whatever you want to call these guys, they are coming here. This is not just about Baghdad. This is not just about Syria. It is about our homeland,"" Graham said. In this fact-check, we examine whether each of those high ranking officials have said ""we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq."" Graham’s office sent us several quotations from three of the officials the senator listed. FBI director James Comey On Jan. 9, 2014, FBI Director James Comey said: ""My concern is that people can go to Syria, develop new relationships, learn new techniques and become far more dangerous, and then flow back."" This quotation appears in an ABC News report. We found three news reports of Comey answering journalists’ questions about the threat posed by Americans who joined the fight against Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and have returned to the United States. The New York Times reported on the high priority the FBI has put on tracking people returning from Syria. ""It’s something we are intensely focused on,"" Comey said. In an article later in January, the Los Angeles Times repeated that Comey said the FBI was putting a ""tremendous amount of time and effort into identifying those who go to Syria."" The article summarized Comey’s assessment this way: ""The threat ‘keeps me up at night.’ He (Comey) sees the region as a ‘launching ground’ for potential Sept. 11-style mass-casualty attacks in this country."" These stories emerged almost exactly at the time that ISIS began its assault in Iraq and had yet to show how effective it could be. Comey saw a threat from returning combatants, but a larger-scale attack was more a future risk than an immediate danger. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson Graham’s office pointed to comments from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson from Feb. 7, 2014. ""We are very focused on foreign fighters heading to Syria,"" Johnson said. ""Based on our work and the work of our international partners, we know individuals from the U.S., Canada and Europe are traveling to Syria to fight in the conflict. At the same time, extremists are actively trying to recruit Westerners, indoctrinate them, and see them return to their home countries with an extremist mission. … Syria has become a matter of homeland security."" Johnson made these comments during a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. Johnson spoke of the evolving terrorist threat and, like Comey, specifically mentioned the citizens who come back from fighting in Syria. But Johnson went further and talked about the people who ""self-radicalize"" and never train with foreign fighters. ""In many respects, this is the terrorist threat to the homeland, illustrated last year by the Boston Marathon bombing, that I worry about the most,"" Johnson said. ""It may be the hardest to detect; involves independent actors living within our midst, with easy access to things that, in the wrong hands, become tools of mass violence."" Johnson was describing less an imminent threat from ISIS and more a chronic risk posed by radical Islam. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Graham’s office pointed to comments from James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, on Jan. 29, 2104. He spoke of ""the sectarian war in Syria, its attraction as a growing center of radical extremism and the potential threat this poses to the homeland."" On Feb. 11, 2014, Clapper talked about forces in Syria: ""The three most effective are the Al-Nusrah Front, Aura al Sham and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, as it’s known, whose numbers total more than 20,000. Complicating this further are the 7,500-plus foreign fighters from some 50 countries who have gravitated to Syria. Among them are a small group of AfPak (Afghanistan-Pakistan) al-Qaida veterans who have aspirations for external attack in Europe, if not the homeland itself."" The first quote comes from a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing where Clapper, like Comey and Johnson, was talking mainly about the conflict in Syria serving as a breeding ground for trained militants, some of whom might return to the United States. Clapper said, ""We should be very concerned about this."" In February, Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan testified before the House Select Intelligence Committee. Clapper, as the quotation from Graham’s office said, talked about Syria as a magnet for radical fighters. Clapper did not necessarily tie ISIS to attacks on America itself, but for a subgroup of al-Qaida veterans, he spoke of their ""aspirations"" to launch an operation ""in Europe, if not the homeland itself."" When Brennan was asked whether training camps in the region presented a real threat to America, he said they did. When asked if groups like ISIS might need to ""prove themselves"" with an operation outside of Syria, Brennan said, ""It's a near-term concern, as well as a long-term concern."" Michael O’Hanlon, a foreign policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington, said Graham has a point that ISIS should be taken seriously, but O’Hanlon offers a caveat. ""The ISIS threat is very grave, but attacks are not — and in fact, virtually never are —  inevitable,"" O’Hanlon said.  ""We have a host of defense mechanisms and shouldn't be fatalistic about protecting ourselves."" Our ruling Graham said that four top administration officials have said ""we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq."" Graham’s office sent quotations from three of the four. While each of them voiced strong concern about attacks on American soil, the role of ISIS was more indirect and less immediate than Graham would have us believe. The government officials spoke of the conflict in Syria as a training ground. Johnson, the Homeland Security director, also cast the Syrian civil war as a cause that could inspire ""lone wolf"" terrorists in the mode of the Boston Marathon bombers. The government officials talked about the ""aspirations"" of some al-Qaida veterans and the steps they were taking to track the people who posed the greatest risk. They spoke of taking the threat seriously, but their words fell well short of Grahams’ phrase that,""we’re about to be attacked in a serious way.""
