Fact-checking Bernie Sanders’ attack on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis about school tests
","Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders expressed his solidarity with Florida teachers who descended upon the state Capitol to rally for higher school funding. Sanders, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont, said Florida places too much emphasis on school tests and that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to start them even earlier. In Florida, he wrote in the Sun Sentinel, ""children are required to take their first standardized test within 30 days of beginning kindergarten and Gov. DeSantis wants to extend that requirement to preschoolers."" Sanders called such a policy ""absurd"" and ineffective. Whether that’s true is outside of the scope of this fact-check. Here, we wanted to know if Sanders correctly assessed the timing of Florida’s earliest standardized test and whether DeSantis wants to expand it to preschoolers. After we contacted the Sanders campaign, his team tweaked the language in the online op-ed. The revised piece says, ""DeSantis wants to extend harsh accountability requirements to preschoolers."" (The update is not disclosed on the Sun Sentinel website.) While we applaud the Sanders campaign for making its language more accurate, we still wanted to fact-check what was missing from the original statement.  It’s true that Florida kindergarteners take a screening test at the beginning of the year. However, we could not find any evidence that the state is adding similar tests for preschoolers. The most we’ve heard so far is an unspecific call for more accountability, presumably among pre-K providers. RELATED: Florida Gov. DeSantis proposes starting teacher pay increase Florida isn’t unusual for giving tests to students in kindergarten. More than half the states have a kindergarten assessment, said W. Steven Barnett, who co-directs the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University.  Public school students take the Florida Kindergarten Readiness Screener within 30 days of entering kindergarten. The assessment test asks students to recognize numbers up to 20, distinguish numbers from letters, and match words that are the same, among other skills. The information is meant to help teachers and parents, as well as the state. The state uses the results to calculate the kindergarten readiness rates for Florida’s voluntary prekindergarten program, which provides free access to all of the state’s 4-year-olds. In May, results showed that 41% of children who participated in VPK were not ready for kindergarten. In response, DeSantis directed education commissioner Richard Corcoran to create an improvement plan. In the same press release, Corcoran called for ""a real accountability measure for all our school readiness programs"" and said it was a rallying cry to improve early learning.  Does that mean adding tests for voluntary pre-k? We did not get a response by our deadline. So far we have not seen any more details from the DeSantis administration. For the record, Florida law already requires VPK students to take a test at the outset of the program and at the end. The assessments are designed to track progress for the students, classroom and preschool center.  A new bill filed by state lawmakers would require VPK students to undergo a specified screening and progress-monitoring program. Since the session just started, we don’t yet know how far proposal will go or whether DeSantis supports it. His office did not respond to our questions about that. An aide to a bill sponsor, Sen. Gayle Harrell, said that Harrell doesn’t know if DeSantis supports her bill. Sanders said, ""But in Florida children are required to take their first standardized test within 30 days of beginning kindergarten and Gov. DeSantis wants to extend that requirement to preschoolers."" Kindergarten students do take a standardized screening test during the first 30 days. We didn’t find any evidence that DeSantis wants to extend such a test to preschoolers (and we’ll note they are already tested).  The DeSantis administration called for an ""accountability measure for all our school readiness programs"" after a report showed 41% of VPK students were not prepared for kindergarten. But he has not been specific, and we haven’t found evidence that it will include new testing for VPK students in the first 30 days.

Does just 1% of ocean waste come from the United States?
","Not all news about the environment is bad these days, at least according to the conservative Young America’s Foundation. A recent Facebook post by the group said, ""FACT: Less than 1% of the trash in the ocean is from the United States."" The graphic cites the prestigious Science magazine as the source of the tidbit and tells readers, ""An inconvenient truth that climate change alarmists leave out.""  When we took a closer look, we found that the post is based on real numbers, but it glosses over some context that paints a more nuanced picture. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Young America’s Foundation pointed us to the peer-reviewed article in Science published in 2015. That article summarized the findings of several scientists from the United States and Australia in a table that ranked the 20 biggest contributors of ""mismanaged plastic waste."" ""Mismanaged waste"" refers to material that is either littered or inadequately disposed, and thus could find its way into the oceans due to wind, tides, or rivers because it is dumped in open landfills. On that list, the United States ranked 20th. We used the paper’s data to create the following pie chart, which shows that the United States accounts for about 1% of the world total. A big reason why the United States ranks low as a global contributor of mismanaged plastic waste is that the United States, like other advanced industrialized countries, does a better job of securing its waste than lower-income nations do. (In fact, the United States is the only country on the 20-nation list that’s a high-income country.) So is there anything else to know? One of the paper’s co-authors, industrial ecology professor Roland Geyer of the University of California-Santa Barbara,, offered a few cautions. First, he said the data is already a decade old, and it is based on modeling, not empirical observations. So the ""uncertainties"" about the data ""are large,"" he said. Second, the data addresses how the plastic enters the oceans, not who made the plastic or even who used the plastic. ""A non-negligible portion of the plastic entering the oceans from Chinese soil could be from products originally produced in the U.S. or from plastic waste exported by the U.S. to China,"" Geyer said. Meanwhile, the paper did not address how much plastic was already in the ocean at the time the calculations were made, said George Leonard, the chief scientist at the Ocean Conservancy, an advocacy group. It’s possible that the United States accounted for a larger share of existing plastic waste that migrated to the ocean many years before. ""We estimated the total amount of mismanaged plastic waste generated within 50 kilometers of a coast that could enter the ocean,"" said Kara Lavender Law, a research professor of oceanography with the Sea Education Association in Woods Hole, Mass., and a co-author of the 2015 paper. ""We did not take into account plastic debris entering the ocean from other sources, such as natural disasters or lost or abandoned fishing gear."" The upshot is that we don’t have a great idea of how big a contributor the United States is to ocean plastic pollution. In a Facebook post, Young America’s Foundation said, ""FACT: Less than 1% of the trash in the ocean is from the United States."" This number stems from a peer-reviewed scientific article, but the post’s wording glosses over nuances about the finding. The 1% figure refers to ""mismanaged"" waste entering the ocean in 2010, and does not take into account the accumulated waste already in the ocean prior to that year.  In addition, the study only looked at the country that immediately held the waste before it entered the ocean. It’s possible that the United States generated an additional volume of plastic waste that ended up in another country before going into the ocean.

"['Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Wisconsin', 'Tom Tiffany']","
Are wolves partly to blame for the dairy crisis? No. Tiffany misses the mark.
","State Sen. Tom Tiffany, a candidate for Wisconsin’s open 7th U.S. Congressional District seat, has a theory about what’s causing dairy farmers to struggle throughout Wisconsin: the growing wolf population.  The district, which covers northwest Wisconsin, is open after Republican Sean Duffy stepped down in September 2019. The primary is Feb. 18, and the special election will be held May 12.  During a Dec. 12, 2019, Republican debate, a panelist asked Tiffany and his primary opponent, Army veteran Jason Church, about economic growth in the state, specifically about what the candidates would do to combat the rising popularity of socialism.  In response, Tiffany spoke about ""socialistic things"" that happen in the federal government, among them the decision to keep wolves on the endangered species list:  ""We should be able to manage the wolf population here in Wisconsin, by our own state rather than the federal government. What happens as a result of the federal government managing it? Our farmers, their cattle get harmed by it. They're attacked, livestock. Their cattle get harassed, less production. It harms their businesses. And we're wondering why farms are going out of business in Wisconsin?""  In other words, wolves play a key role in the struggles of dairy farms across the state.  In 2019, more than 800 dairy farms in Wisconsin -- many of them small, family-run operations -- closed amid a deep downturn in milk prices and other factors.  Is Tiffany right?  Wolves have long been a problem for farmers  Tiffany has made similar claims in the past about the impact of wolves on cows. In September 2016, he was one of the co-hosts of a wolf summit in Cumberland and pushed for the delisting of wolves, because of the harm they bring to farmers and cattle.  When we asked Tiffany’s campaign team for backup, his staff said the information came from Tiffany’s own upbringing on a dairy farm, and seeing the effect of stress on cows. The stress of predation by wolves can cause cows to lose pregnancies, lower milk production and lead to  smaller weight gains, said Mattias Gugel, Tiffany’s communications director. The state’s gray wolves were granted protection in 1974 under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits the killing of any protected animal.  Since then, the population of wolves has grown in Wisconsin, reaching 205 in 1999, and growing to about 978 wolves during the 2018-2019 count, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  The wolves have reached a point in recovery that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering removing them from the endangered species list, with a final determination to come in spring 2020, according to the agency’s website. That would allow wolves to be hunted.  One measure of damage from wolves is a state program that reimburses farmers for losses from verified wolf killings. In 2018, the most recent year available, the state of Wisconsin paid out more than $63,000 for 26 dead calves, 43 missing calves, four dead cows and two treatments of cattle by a veterinarian, according to DNR documents.  That same year, 691 dairy farms closed, some with as much as $150,000 of projected losses that year for a single farm, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  All told, the state’s dairy industry includes 1.28 million cows on more than 7,000 farms, and accounts for a $45.6 billion share of the economy, according to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.  From that perspective, the impact of killed or injured livestock is tiny.  Also, the area for wolves, mostly in northern and central Wisconsin, as shown on DNR maps, seemingly overlaps little with maps of dairy operations that have closed in the last several years, which has been largely in southern and western portions of the state, according to data from the Journal Sentinel.  The effects of wolves beyond just predation are hard to tell According to a study published by the DNR in 2007, it’s hard to tell the actual effect of wolves on cows, because most evaluations focus mainly on predation and killings.  Other effects could include stillbirths from stress and decreased weight gain from increased vigilance, but those results were hypothetical, and unable to be properly proven without a different study, said Adrian Wydeven, one of the researchers who worked on the DNR study and a certified wildlife biologist. ""Producers may suspect and have lower rates of pregnancy and lower weights, but unless you can eliminate all other factors, it’s hard to attribute some of these non-lethal impacts on livestock,"" Wydeven said.  He also pointed out that most studies on wolf and cattle interactions focus on beef livestock, because dairy farms often have more people moving around, and the cows are brought in several times a day for milking. That can discourage wolves in the area. Adrian Treves, a professor with the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said dairy cattle are less affected by wolves than by other elements of their environment.  ""The hypothesis of body weight loss in domestic animals exposed to wolves, as Mr. Tiffany is suggesting, has little solid evidence worldwide although it has been mentioned for decades,"" Treves wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Considering the vastly more costly and concerning losses of farm animals to weather and disease, Wisconsin’s family farmers would benefit from attention to more important issues.""  Other factors at play There are many other larger factors at play, as the Journal Sentinel and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin found in the Dairyland in Distress series. Among them: The long-running decline in milk consumption, the drop in milk prices paid to farmers, increased global competition and the struggle to maintain leadership in the industry, as well as more recently, the impact of tariffs and trade wars.  What’s more, the number of wolves in the state started to skyrocket in the early 2000s. During that time, milk production grew steadily and continues to grow -- which itself is a factor in lower prices.  That, too, undermines the impact Tiffany places on wolves. Mark Stephenson, director of the Center for Dairy Profitability at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that wolves haven’t come up as a factor in his conversations with milk producers.  ""That isn’t to say that there aren’t a few farms on the edge of our wilder areas of the state where this could be an issue, but it certainly isn’t a major issue for the greater dairy industry in the state,"" he wrote. ""It is more likely to impact grazing farms on the edge of large woodland tracks, and we don’t have a significant portion of our dairy industry under those conditions.""  Our ruling Tiffany claimed federal regulation of the wolf population has led to attacks on livestock, driving down production, leading to dairy farms going out of business.  But the number of cows killed by wolves is tiny in comparison to the size of the state’s dairy industry, which has been battered by years of low milk prices, declining consumption and a host of global economic factors. What’s more, the rise in the wolf population came amid a period of growing milk production. And it’s that over supply that is helping drive down prices.  Our definition for Pants on Fire is ""the statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2020/jan/15/tom-tiffany/are-wolves-partly-blame-dairy-crisis-no-tiffany-mi/

Va. House leaders wrongly say State Capitol Police 'recommended' gun ban
","In imposing a gun ban at the State Capitol, newly-empowered House Democrats repeatedly said they were acting on the recommendation of Capitol Police. Pro-gun Republicans angrily accused the Democrats of deceit. It all happened during Jan. 10 at the meetings of two committees that set the rules for the State Capitol, and sounded the opening shots of a Democratic effort to toughen Virginia’s gun laws. Calling for gun control in last fall’s elections, Democrats won majorities in the House and Senate for the first time this century. Working with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, they have introduced bills that would establish universal background checks on firearm buyers, an assault weapons ban, a one-handgun-a-month purchase limit, and a red-flag law that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. In response, more than 100 localities have declared themselves ""Second Amendment Sanctuaries""  that won’t enforce gun restrictions they think are unconstitutional. Thousands of gun advocates are expected to rally at the Capitol on Jan. 20, prompting public safety concerns. The gun ban was passed on a party-line vote by the Joint Rules Committee, a panel of Senate and House leaders, whose decisions are not reviewed by the full legislature. It applies to visitors of the Pocahontas Building, where lawmakers have offices and committee rooms. In the past, anyone with a valid concealed-handgun permit was allowed to bring a gun into the Capitol. Democrats said four times during the meeting that the Capitol Police recommended the new policy. Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax: ""This is all done, really, at the recommendation of the Capitol Police, who I think are going to speak to these measures themselves. This is the advice we’ve gotten from the security professionals on what they need to do their jobs effectively and keep us all safe going forward throughout this session and sessions of the future."" House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria:  ""I just have to say that this is something that has been recommended by our Capitol Police, and I think there are times when we sort of have to trust what our law enforcement officers our telling us in concern for our safety and the safety of others coming into this building."" Herring: ""This is a recommendation for our Capitol Police who we trust every day and who have kept us safe and I trust their judgment."" Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax: ""Again, this is being recommended by Col. Pike and the professionals and that’s why we’re moving in this direction."" She was referring to Capitol Police Col. Anthony Pike. After the meeting, Pike qualified the Democrats’ statements. He told reporters neither he nor his agency recommended the gun ban. They simply complied with a Democratic request to figure how such a plan would be put in effect. ""When (Democrats) approached me and indicated they were going  to put in a firearms prohibition, that’s when they asked me for my input on how we would process, how we would handle these facilities with that prohibition,"" he said. Pike declined to say if the thought the gun ban is a good idea, saying the Capitol Police is non-political and implements legislative rules. Later, in a meeting of the House Rules Committee, Pike again emphasized that the Capitol Police strives to avoid politics and didn’t call for the ban.  ""I was told that there was going to be a prohibition on firearms and to put together my recommendations on how to handle that prohibition for the buildings,"" he said under questioning from Republicans. House Minority Leader Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenanhoah, chastised the Democrats, saying, ""I just think that entire effort to put this on the Capitol Police was disgusting."" Former Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, told Filler-Corn, ""Let’s be honest with each other...That was a deliberate misrepresentation. There’s no way around that."" Filler-Corn later accused Republicans of trying to divert attention on the gun control debate. Our ruling House Democratic leaders (Filler-Corn, Herring and Simon) said four times they were imposing a gun ban at the Capitol at the ""recommendation"" of the Capitol Police. But Pike, the chief of the Capitol Police, says the Democrats had decided among themselves there would be a gun ban and approached him afterwards to work out the details. He declined to tell reporters if he thinks thinks the ban is a good idea, citing the nonpartisan nature of his agency and its role to enforce legislative rules.  Democrats have not disputed Pike’s account.

Sanders targets health industry' profits. Are his figures right?
","At the January Democratic debate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders zeroed in on the question of profits in the health care industry. Under ""Medicare for All,"" he said, ""We end the $100 billion a year that the health care industry makes."" It’s a huge number, and one that Sanders has cited before. So we decided to look closer. The math The Sanders campaign shared its math, and it’s comprehensive.  The $100 billion total comes from adding the 2018 net revenues -- as disclosed by the companies -- for 10 pharmaceutical companies and 10 companies that work in health insurance.  We redid the numbers. Sanders is correct: The total net revenues, or profits, these companies posted in 2018 comes to just more than $100 billion - $100.96 billion, in fact. We also spoke to three independent health economists, who all told us that the math checks out. There are a couple of wrinkles to consider. Some of the companies included -- Johnson & Johnson, for instance -- do more than just health care. Those other services likely affect their bottom lines. But more importantly, $100 billion is likely an underestimate, experts told us. For one thing, there are more than just 10 pharmaceutical companies, and more than 10 insurance companies, noted Robert Berenson, a health economist at the Urban Institute. Many more exist -- even if they are smaller and post smaller profits. And this figure looks at pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, but it doesn’t include the biggest source of health care profits: hospitals and physicians. ""You could ask the same questions of health systems and not-for-profit hospitals who are raising prices at a steady clip,"" said Ellen Meara, a professor of health economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""If you’re going to go after industry, you need to go after the whole system and say prices are a problem everywhere."" If anything, Berenson said, that makes Sanders’ point stronger. After all, $100 billion is a small proportion of the trillions spent annually via national health expenditures. When you factor in hospital margins, the number grows significantly. So, Medicare for All? Sanders suggested that Medicare for All would ""end"" the $100 billion per year profits reaped by the health care industry. The proposal would certainly give Washington the power to do that.  ""If you had Medicare for All, you have a single payer that would be paying lower prices,"" Meara said.  That means lower prices and profits for pharmaceuticals, lower margins for insurers and lower prices for hospitals and health systems.  That could bring tradeoffs: for instance, fewer people choosing to practice medicine. But, Meara noted, the number supports Sanders’ larger thesis. ""There’s room to pay less."" Other health reform plans — including letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, or a government-sponsored public option, such as the plan backed by former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg — could also have this effect.  But, Berenson noted, having only one insurer, and having it be publicly funded, would likely have a greater impact. ""I could whack pharmaceutical companies, and I don’t need Medicare for All to do it, but I do need Medicare prices for All to deal with what the real profits are — whether you call them profits or not — which is hospitals."" Our ruling Sanders said Medicare for All would ""end the $100 billion a year that the health care industry makes."" The math holds up. If anything, it’s an underestimate because it doesn’t include one of the largest sources of health care profits: hospitals, health systems and physicians.

Meanwhile, after this exchange, Warren and Sanders faced off on another piece of their electoral win-loss records. Warren said that she was ""the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years."" The two candidates sparred over the meaning of ""at any time in the past 30 years."" As the list above shows, Sanders defeated an incumbent Republican in 1990. That’s right on Warren’s cutoff of 30 years. Warren said, ""Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women, Amy and me.""  We checked the electoral histories of the candidates on stage and found that Warren spoke accurately.

Trump’s claim that he ‘saved’ pre-ex conditions ‘part fantasy, part delusion’
","President Donald Trump attempted to take credit for one of the most popular elements of the Affordable Care Act: Its protection for people who have preexisting medical conditions. ""I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your healthcare,"" Trump tweeted on Jan. 13. The  protection for people with medical problems has been a rallying cry for Democrats, and they used the issue to help propel their widespread election victories in 2018. Trump repeatedly has sought to align himself with this issue – in May, for instance, claiming he would ""always protect patients with preexisting conditions."" We rated that claim False. His re-election campaign has made similar claims, which experts debunked. Trump’s recent claim that he ""saved"" that guarantee of coverage adds a new twist, though. We contacted the White House to find out the basis for this statement. Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, told us, ""President Trump has repeatedly stated his commitment to protect individuals with preexisting conditions and his track record shows that he has consistently done what is necessary to improve care for the vulnerable."" Deere also pointed us to a range of other policy initiatives – such as efforts on kidney health, approving generic drugs and loosening restrictions on short-term health plans. But none of those addressed the basis of Trump’s tweet. The health policy experts we consulted, however, were unambiguous: The president’s claim has no factual basis and flies in the face of his ongoing policy efforts. ""I feel like we’re being gas-lit,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health economist at the Urban Institute. ""You can’t tell me you’re the savior of people with preexisting conditions when every single thing you’ve said or done is the opposite of that."" (Gaslighting means manipulating the telling of events in such a way it leads people to question their recollections.) This skepticism persisted across the political spectrum. ""That’s a rather extended version of aspirational rhetoric short of any evidence,"" said Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The preexisting condition protection Under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, health insurance plans cannot charge people higher prices because they have a medical condition. This protection has been intact since the law took effect, under then-President Barack Obama. As a 2016 candidate, Trump promised to repeal and replace the health law. That came to a head in 2017, when the law came within one vote in the Senate of being undone.   ""That tweet is part fantasy, part delusion, part politics, and all lie,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ""The president is lying about preexisting conditions. He supported, and continues to support, efforts to repeal the ACA that would take those consumer protections away."" After that effort, Blumberg said, the president boasted that he had dismantled Obamacare – which is not only untrue, but, she added, confused many consumers. Since then, the president has maintained his desire to undo the ACA and replace it with something new. Neither his administration nor congressional Republicans have yet offered a replacement plan. None of the bills they have endorsed would maintain the guarantees of coverage for people with medical problems. ""By supporting repeal of the ACA, they’re supporting repeal of protecting preexisting condition prohibitions,"" Robert Berenson, another analyst at the Urban Institute, previously told us. Texas v. Azar Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s work elsewhere could undo the  protection. A group of Republican-led states are suing to have the entire ACA dismantled. Their argument stems from a law Trump signed: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. That law gutted the individual mandate – the ACA’s requirement that everyone have coverage or pay a penalty – by reducing the penalty to $0. In this case, known as Texas vs. Azar, the Republican states are arguing that the individual mandate was central to the ACA, and that without it, the entire law must be taken down. That would include the protections for people with preexisting conditions. The administration has declined to defend the law in court, a move legal analysts have called almost unprecedented. The case is widely expected to  go to the Supreme Court. Since the White House has unveiled no replacement, striking the law would leave a policy vacuum, allowing health plans to revert to discriminating against people with medical issues. Miller argued that the still-pending court case and previous repeal efforts don’t necessarily mean there’s any imminent threat of the president gutting the ACA’s preexisting condition protections. ""For pure public opinion purposes, you want to say you’re protecting against preexisting condition protections,"" Miller said. ""Does he know how to do it? No. Is he doing anything trying to change it? Not really."" But others noted that the administration’s stance is firmly against maintaining the ACA’s prohibitions. ""The Democrats have correctly said the Trump administration has in fact opposed protections for preexisting conditions by endorsing the lawsuit,"" Berenson said. Our ruling Trump tweeted that he ""was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your healthcare."" The president had nothing to do with the ban on health insurance plans discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. This consumer protection is a core part of the health care law that became law during the Obama presidency. Trump has expressly supported the repeal of this law without offering a replacement that would keep the protection intact.   And to this day, his administration is arguing in court that the law – including this provision – should be undone. The president’s tweet is not only untrue, but it misrepresents his administration’s efforts to repeal the health care law without offering any replacement that might maintain its core protections.

In New York, it is now perfectly legal to murder me at 12:04.""  We rated that False, but people keep spreading misinformation.  This Jan. 26, 2019, post, for example, was recently flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Like the image we fact-checked last year, this one features an image of an infant and the same text. It has more than 15,000 shares, many in recent days. Here are the facts. New York’s Reproductive Health Act says that a health care practitioner ""may perform an abortion when, according to the practitioner’s reasonable and good faith professional judgment based on the facts of the patient’s case: the patient is within twenty-four weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s life or health."" Previously, women in New York could only get abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy if their lives were threatened, according to Justin Flagg, a spokesman for Democratic state Sen. Liz Krueger, who sponsored the legislation Under the new law, women can also get an abortion after 24 weeks if their health is threatened or the fetus isn’t viable, Flagg said. He added that this was the standard set by the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade but that the discrepancy between the state and federal laws ""meant that many women have been forced to go out of state to get necessary medical care after 24 weeks."" ""If a healthy baby is born at 12:05, the only thing happening at 12:04 is labor,"" he said.  Abortion opponents were alarmed by the new law, arguing that the exceptions of Roe — the health or the life of the mother — are carveouts that could apply to any pregnancy for any reason.  The state’s Catholic bishops, for example, said in a statement that the law ""will expand our state’s already radically permissive law, by empowering more health practioners to provide abortion and removing all state restrictions on late-term procedures.""  Third-trimester abortions are relatively rare. The Guttmacher Institute finds that ""slightly more than 1 percent of abortions are performed at 21 weeks or later."" In a study of abortions in the United States in 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported that 1.3 percent of abortions happened at 21 weeks gestation or later. Jen Villavicencio, an ob-gyn in the Midwest who provides abortions, told PolitiFact that, in some cases, pregnancy complications aren’t detected or haven’t developed until the third trimester. Doctors may ask patients if they want to continue the pregnancy and deliver a ""nonviable fetus,"" she said, or have an abortion. When a woman is pregnant with a viable fetus but her life is at risk, meanwhile, delivery is most often pursued, not abortion, Villavicencio said. ""Abortions are not performed at 40 weeks on healthy, viable pregnancies,"" she said. ""Overwhelmingly, abortions that occur at this point in pregnancy are pregnancies where lethal fetal anomalies have been diagnosed."" When we rated the claim in the Facebook post last year, we found that New York’s Reproductive Health Act permits abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy only if the mother’s life or health are threatened or the fetus isn’t viable. But the post still doesn’t make clear that significant restrictions still apply to the new law.

After Pearl Harbor, Japanese didn't invade US because they feared armed citizens?
","History quiz:  After Pearl Harbor, did the Japanese refrain from invading the mainland United States because they feared there were gun-savvy Americans in nearly every home? That’s the claim of a 20-paragraph post on Facebook that has been shared more than 21,000 times.  The post argues that America is safe from invasion because of gun-owning hunters. It starts its historical claim by stating: ""After the Japanese decimated our fleet in Pearl Harbor Dec 7, 1941, they could have sent their troop ships and carriers directly to California to finish what they started. The prediction from our Chief of Staff was we would not be able to stop a massive invasion until they reached the Mississippi River. Remember, we had a 2 million man army and war ships in other localities, so why did they not invade? After the war, the remaining Japanese generals and admirals were asked that question. Their answer....they know that almost every home had guns and the Americans knew how to use them."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not a new claim. In a video posted in 2012, Ed Emery, a Repubican state senator from Missouri, claimed that it is known that Japan was deterred not by America’s armed services but because ""every American was armed."" The surprise aerial attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor on Oahu Island, Hawaii, climaxed a decade of worsening relations between the United States and Japan, and precipitated the entry of the United States into World War II, as Encyclopedia Britannica puts it. But the success didn’t mean Japan was poised to march into California. ""The Japanese didn't plan to invade the U.S., never considered it seriously and knew they couldn't succeed,"" said Jonathan Dresner, a history professor at Pittsburg State University in Kansas whose specialties include Japanese history.  When Japan lost its main aircraft carriers in the Battle of Midway seven months after Pearl Harbor, any thought of a mainland invasion ""was doomed and abandoned,"" Fred Notehelfer told us.  ""Certainly the Japanese were not constrained by the notion that some Americans had guns in their homes — no one had AK-47s and other assault weapons at the time,"" added Notehelfer, an emeritus professor of history at UCLA who specializes in the history of Japan. Professor James Holmes, chair of maritime strategy and at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island, told us it’s plausible that private gun ownership was part of Japan’s calculus, but not the dominant factor. ""I seriously doubt anyone in Tokyo countenanced an invasion of the continental United States apart, perhaps, from raids on the West Coast. There is only so much a small island state in Asia can do, no matter how skilled its armed forces,"" he said. ""Geographic space, logistics, other commitments—these considerations would have outweighed any concerns about an armed American populace."" Ian Toll, author of ""The Conquering Tide: War in the Pacific Islands, 1942-1944"" and ""Pacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941-1942,"" told us that regarding an invasion, the Japanese ""had plans on a shelf, but never seriously considered putting them into action,"" and that ""I’ve never come across anything to suggest that gun ownership was a factor in Japan’s decision."" ""In June 1942, some Americans were concerned the Japanese would advance into Alaska and then through Canada to the northwest,"" he said. ""But the scale of the operation was simply beyond their national capabilities, measured by troop numbers, naval power, or shipping."" Promoters of the guns deterring an invasion theory also point to this quote attributed to Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto:  ""You cannot invade mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass."" But the quote is ""unsubstantiated and almost certainly bogus, even though it has been repeated thousands of times in various Internet postings,"" FactCheck.org reported.  Toll told us: ""It is true that Yamamoto told others in the Japanese government and military that invading North America was unrealistic, but I know of no source that has him citing gun ownership as a factor."" A Facebook post says the Japanese military did not invade the mainland United States after Pearl Harbor because ""they know that almost every home had guns and the Americans knew how to use them."" Four experts told us there is no evidence that Japan ever seriously considered such an invasion and that military limitations, not Americans armed with hunting weapons, were the reasons why.

In a Facebook post, the group uses a black-and-white image of the border streaked in red with the following text: ""More than 100,000 DACA applicants have been arrested — Murder, Rape, DUI."" A caption for the graphic cites an ""alarming"" government report as its source. The Judicial Watch post has been viewed more than 600,000 times and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is misleading. While more than 100,000 people who applied for DACA had an arrest in their record, the bulk of those arrests were for driving offenses that exclude DUI, and for immigration-related offenses.  An arrest does not mean that the person was found guilty of a crime. Convicted felons and people who pose a threat to national security or public safety are not eligible for DACA, and neither are those convicted of a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors. Also, the 100,000-person figure includes applicants who were denied DACA or terminated from the program. The Judicial Watch post does not make that clear. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton defended the Facebook graphic in an email, saying the post ""does not say or even suggest that all 100,000 referenced recipients were arrested for the three crimes,"" as in murder, rape and DUI. He also said that ""nowhere does Judicial Watch refer to the arrests as convictions."" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles DACA applications, in a November report said 118,371 immigrants who applied for DACA had an arrest or apprehension in their record. A recorded arrest does not prohibit someone from applying for DACA. ""Under long-standing DACA guidelines, not all convictions or arrests will necessarily result in a denial or termination, unless, as a matter of its discretion, USCIS determines that DACA is not warranted due to public safety, national security, or other discretionary factors on a case-by-case basis,"" the agency said in its report. An arrest is not the end of the story, the report notes. Applicants may not have been charged with a crime resulting from the arrest, may have had their charges reduced or dismissed entirely, or may have been acquitted of any charges. The agency outlined two sets of data: applicants with prior arrests and approved for DACA, and applicants with prior arrests and denied or terminated from the program. If immigration officials determined that an applicant had a felony conviction, met other disqualifying criteria or posed a security threat, federal guidelines say they should deny the application or revoke DACA status. The government data does not specify if the denials or terminations were related to the arrests. Arrests for DUI, rape and murder represent a sliver of the full picture. And the data does not say anything about whether these applicants were convicted of the crimes, which would affect their eligibility for DACA.  The top arrest category was for ""driving-related"" offenses, such as speeding or driving without a valid license. (It does not include DUI.) More than 25,300 approved DACA applicants had a prior arrest in this category. The second-most common category was for ""immigration-related"" offenses, such as overstaying a visa or an arrest related to deportation proceedings. (Nearly 13,000 approved DACA applicants had a prior arrest in this category.) See a list of all the offenses and arrests here. A Judicial Watch Facebook post said, ""More than 100,000 DACA applicants have been arrested — Murder, Rape, DUI."" This is deceptive. More than 100,000 DACA applicants have been arrested, but not for murder, rape, and DUI. By emphasizing those crimes, the post gives the wrong impression. The post does not mention the most common arrests, which are for driving and immigration violations (not DUI). Immigrants deemed to pose a security threat or who have a felony conviction are not eligible for DACA.

Trump wrongly says Obamacare has 'no options,' competitive bidding
","Donald Trump vows he’ll do away with Obamacare. He calls it a ""disaster"" and says ""it’s going to be repealed. It’s going to be replaced."" But beyond that, it can be hard to tell what Trump would actually do. ""We're going to have great plans, they're going to be a lot less expensive than Obamacare,"" Trump said on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""They're going to be private. And there are going to be lots of ... We're going to have a lot of different options. Right now, you have no options. You know why? Because the insurance company controls (President Barack) Obama, because they gave him a lot of money. That's why you have lines around the states. And you can't get competitive bidding."" Trump was referring to the Republican idea of allowing insurance companies to sell in multiple states in one fell swoop, rather than through the state-by-state permitting process that happens today. Trump also believes in health savings accounts and some sort of program for the very poor. When NBC host Chuck Todd asked him about his view on mandates, Trump said no one would be forced to buy health insurance, unlike the law says today. But we were struck by his statement that ""right now, you have no options."" We reached out to the Trump campaign to learn what he specifically meant and did not hear back. Trump’s comments seemed misleading because a major part of the health care law is set up to encourage competition and give people options. Does the law achieve that? The short answer is, for most people it does. However, in more rural counties, residents might have to choose between only one or perhaps two insurance companies. Those people have few options. The exchanges The new health care law sets up exchanges or marketplaces, primarily online but also accessible through various government offices, where people can pick from roughly comparable insurance plans for which the main difference is price. The law puts each plan into one of four tiers -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum. The more generous, and costly, the plan, the higher the tier. The government’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that for 2016, about two-thirds of the counties have three or more insurers offering plans at the silver level. (This only has to do with plans on the exchanges, and primarily the exchange run by Washington. Employer-provided insurance is altogether separate.) A more detailed analysis for 2016 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research center widely seen as a source of objective data, found wide variation across the country. In Indiana, for example, residents in every county have at least four carriers to choose from. In contrast, in Oklahoma, no county has more than two companies competing with each other. Out of about 2,600 counties in the Kaiser study, 10 percent, or about 260, have just one insurance company offering any policies.  As the table above shows, while people in most counties can choose from among three or more insurers, the change from 2015 to 2016 is toward less competition, not more. ""There are a lot of things to criticize about the Affordable Care Act -- too rigid and regulated in terms of the benefits that must be offered, etc. -- but most exchanges have several options available and some have many options,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed the Medicare program during the George H.W. Bush administration and now is a health care analyst with Project Hope. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 9 out of 10 returning customers using the national exchange, healthcare.gov, were able to choose from among at least three companies. The Kaiser Family Foundation noted that the lack of competition is greatest in rural communities. The higher the percentage of rural residents, the lower the number of insurers. ""There are fewer potential enrollees to attract insurers and also fewer health care providers with whom they can contract,"" the report said. Robert Laszewski, a private analyst with Health Policy and Strategy Associates, offered a different interpretation of Trump’s words. Laszewski said Trump could have meant that for lower-middle income people, none of the plans are actually affordable. ""These policies have come to be very expensive both in terms of premiums and deductibles,"" Laszewski said. ""In that sense the choices are very limited."" It is also worth noting that because rural counties have fewer people, the fraction of the population that faces no real choice is less than than the fraction of counties where that is a problem. Most Americans live in urban areas where insurance competition is more robust. Our ruling Trump said that under Obamacare, ""you have no options,"" for health insurance plans. That is true in about 10 percent of the counties where individuals buy their coverage on the government’s insurance exchange. In another 30 percent of counties, people have only two companies to choose between. But the people living in about 60 percent of the rest of the counties have at least three insurance providers to compare. There’s an element of truth in Trump’s words, but his statement leaves out a lot of information that would leave a different impression.

Do Republicans think Donald Trump is the right candidate to beat Hillary Clinton?
","Don’t let Donald Trump’s win in South Carolina fool you, says Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The good majority of Republicans don’t actually support the frontrunner. Cruz made the case against Trump’s inevitability on NBC’s Meet the Press and argued that he, Cruz, was actually the best candidate for the job. ""For anyone who doesn't believe that Donald Trump is the best candidate to go head to head with Hillary Clinton in November, and that's about 70 percent of Republicans nationwide who don't think Donald Trump is the right guy,"" Cruz said on Feb. 21. ""Our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump and that can beat Donald Trump."" This rosy forecast caught our attention (as well as the attention of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who made a similar claim on CBS’s Face the Nation). Is it true that 70 percent of Republicans ""don’t think Donald Trump is the right guy?"" The Cruz campaign referred us to Trump’s Real Clear Politics polling average of 34.2 percent, as of Feb. 17, 2016. This figure represents the portion of Republican primary voters who prefer Trump as the party’s nominee. ""The point is, close to 70 percent of Republicans are choosing someone else,"" said Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips. True. But by this logic, about 80 percent of Republicans don’t think Cruz — who’s polling at an average of 20.6 percent — ""is the right guy"" either. Here’s a breakdown of the latest polls: Date Trump Cruz Rubio Fox News Feb. 15-17 36 19 15 NBC/Wall Street Journal Feb. 14-16 26 28 17 CBS Feb. 12-16 36 19 12 USA Today/Suffolk Feb. 11-15 35 20 17 Quinnipiac Feb. 10-15 39 18 19 The Economist/YouGov* Feb. 11-15 39 19 16 Cruz’s interpretation leaves out some nuance. Even though Trump isn’t the top pick for many Republican primary voters, a good chunk of them would be perfectly happy with him (or Cruz or Rubio for that matter) as the party’s nominee. Trump was the first or second choice for 47 percent of Republicans in a Fox News poll, for 38 percent in a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, for 44 percent in a USA Today/Suffolk University poll and for 52 percent in The Economist/YouGov poll. A similar portion of GOP voters (39 to 45 percent) named Cruz and Rubio as their top two picks. Trump is also viewed favorably by most of the party: about 62 percent of Republican voters in a Quinnipiac University poll and 62 percent in The Economist/YouGov poll. Cruz and Rubio commanded similar numbers. Conversely, in the Quinnipiac poll, more Republicans (31 percent) had an unfavorable opinion of Trump than Cruz or Rubio (23 percent). The three men clocked similar numbers in The Economist/YouGov poll. Trump does the worst when voters are asked if they could see themselves supporting him for the nomination. In a Feb. 17 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 42 percent of Republicans said no. In comparison, 33 percent could not see themselves supporting Cruz, and 28 percent said the same about Rubio.   And finally, most Republicans would support any of the three men if they were the party’s nominee according to a CBS poll. But about a fifth of Republican voters said they wouldn’t back Trump (20 percent), Cruz (18 percent) or Rubio (17 percent) no matter what. Our ruling Cruz said, 70 percent of Republicans nationwide ""don't think Donald Trump is the right guy"" to take on Hillary Clinton in November. Cruz is referring to the polling average of 34 percent of GOP voters who say Trump is their top choice. Inverted, 66 percent of Republicans prefer someone else. That doesn’t mean, however, that the 66 percent refuse to support Trump overall. The highest estimate we found for Republicans flat-out protesting Trump is 42 percent.

Rep. Todd Richardson mostly accurate in assessment of earning power for Missouri families
","Ranked 47th in the nation by Business Insider, Missouri’s seemingly stagnant economy has been a talking point for politicians across the state in recent months. Speaker of the House Todd Richardson recently weighed in on the discussion, specifically addressing the income and earning power of Missourians. On ""This Week in Missouri Politics,"" Richardson said, ""Missouri families earn $5,000 less, their earning power is about 5,000 less today, than it was at the turn of the century.""  Has the typical Missouri household lost that much ground since 2000? Shifts in median household income We were directed by Richardson’s office to the U.S. Census Bureau’s statistics on median household income. When adjusted for inflation, the median Missouri family brought home $56,360 in 2014, down more than $5,000 from the median family income of $61,995 in 2000. Those numbers support Richardson’s statement. But the median income number jumps around a fair bit from year to year. If Richardson had chosen just slightly different starting and end points, the result could create a different impression. For example, in 1998, the median household income in Missouri was $58,355. And in 2013, Missouri’s median household income was $47,601 – significantly lower than the statistic for 2014. But Saku Aura, associate professor of Public Economics at the University of Missouri, said even with those ups and downs, the overall trend is not debatable. ""Missouri’s economy has undoubtedly had very little to no positive growth in the last 15 years or so,"" Aura said. Aura gave us a couple of reasons for the swings in median income. The Census Bureau sample is small and the margin of error can be over $3,000. And he also noted that family size has been edging down.  ""If there are less people in each family, it would make sense that perhaps there is less money being earned."" Another way to measure income is to look at the average per person.

New Hampshire Democratic Party says a one-year vacancy on Supreme Court would be unprecedented
","The unexpected death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has thrown Washington, D.C., into tumult, with Democrats and Republicans clashing loudly about the timing of a replacement. The clash is especially notable in high-profile U.S. Senate races, including the one in New Hampshire that pits Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte against her challenger, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte almost immediately backed Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s pledge not to take action on a Supreme Court nominee until after the election of the next president. And the state’s Democratic Party was quick to criticize. In a Feb. 16, news release, the party put it this way: ""Fearing discontent from her far-right base and pressure to appease her party bosses, Senator Kelly Ayotte has rejected her constitutional duty and decided to back Mitch McConnell’s controversial decision to block the Senate from giving fair and timely consideration to President Obama’s next Supreme Court nominee -- a move that would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy."" While much of that statement is political boilerplate, we were interested in the last clause -- that refusing to bring up any Obama nominee would lead to an ""unprecedented year-long vacancy"" on the court. We decided to check it out. Asked for comment, the state Democratic Party directed us to two news stories. The first was an article from NPR that noted the longest time a Supreme Court nominee waited to receive a vote. That was in 1916, when Louis Brandeis waited 125 days. And a quick look at the calendar reminds us that Obama has more than 300 days remaining in office. Those are interesting numbers, and certainly suggest that if the Senate refuses to act on Obama’s nomination, there would be an unprecedented wait for a vote. But that’s not what the party’s press release said. It referred to a ""vacancy"" on the court itself, which is different. Later in the same NPR article, which cites the Congressional Research Service as a source, it’s said that: ""The longest vacancy on the Supreme Court was 27 months between the Tyler and Polk administrations before the Civil War. Tyler, derided as ‘His Accidency,’ because he was the first vice president elevated to the White House, also holds the distinction of a record eight nominees rejected or withdrawn."" Tyler actually had another Supreme Court seat open up, and that one took more than 400 days to fill on its own. Taking those two openings from 1843 and 1844 into account, it certainly looks like a yearlong wait for a justice to be seated has precedence. The party also pointed to an article on the Time magazine website. This article, however, says that since the Supreme Court has had nine members -- going back to 1869 -- the court went 391 days without a ninth justice in 1969 and 1970. Over that time, the Senate rejected two nominations from President Richard Nixon. So while this article indicates that a yearlong vacancy on the court would be unusual, it wouldn’t be unprecedented. Even restricting our view of the court to its existence as a nine-member panel, it has spent one lengthy span -- less than 50 years ago -- without a ninth justice. There is one way in which McConnell’s threat would be unusual. As PolitiFact noted this week, it would be unheard of for the Senate to spend more than a year without acting on a Supreme Court nomination after such an appointment is made. In the past, extended vacancies on the court resulted from nominees being rejected sequentially, rather than not acted upon at all. Our ruling The New Hampshire Democratic Party said that not confirming a Supreme Court nominee from President Obama ""would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy."" While the lack of Senate vote on an actual nominee would indeed be unprecedented, there are at least three examples of a seat in the Supreme Court going unfilled for more than a year, one of them within the last half century. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/feb/19/new-hampshire-democratic-party/new-hampshire-democratic-party-says-one-year-vacan/

Arizona's schools chief links 2009 murder to board's failures
","State Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas recently lobbied against a bill that would allow the state Board of Education to hire and fire its employees, arguing that the board can’t handle the business it currently has. Douglas, who oversees K-12 education across the state, has a rocky history with the board, including trying to fire two board employees last February. Douglas mentioned an extreme example of board negligence to make her case against SB 1416 on Feb. 4 during a state Senate Education Committee meeting. ""We presented a report to the board on (teacher discipline) that showed their abject failure to report teachers whose certifications have been revoked or suspended to the national database,"" she said. ""And in one instance, because of that failure to report, it resulted in the death of a student."" Her accusation was striking, so we wanted to fact-check whether the board failed to report a teacher’s history and if it resulted in a student’s death. The board erred Douglas was referring to former high school math teacher Tamara Hofmann. She taught at Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe. In November 2006, Chandler police found Hofmann and one of her students, Sixto Balbuena, together in her car. Both denied sexual relations when questioned by police. The incident immediately spurred an internal school investigation. Hofmann was removed from the classroom, but her provisional secondary teaching certificate remained valid until it expired on Jan. 5, 2007. Typically, a teacher needs to teach for three years on a provisional certificate before the state issues them a standard one. The process is usually automatic as the state Department of Education vets a teacher’s experience before issuing the certificate. However, only the state Board of Education can take action on a certificate, whether it's revoking or suspending an existing certificate, or denying a new certificate. The state board took no action on her provisional certificate. On Jan. 18, the school closed its investigation. She appealed the discipline — 10 days unpaid suspension and a letter of reprimand — before it was denied and imposed in February. The state board admitted that they recorded the investigation internally, but a clerical error did not show anyone outside the board that she was under investigation. If reported correctly, anyone could search for a teacher and whether or not they have any discipline using the state’s website. The state Department of Education, in turn, did not see that Hofmann was under investigation before they issued her a standard teaching certificate on Jan. 29, 2007. ""There was nothing to flag it,"" Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said. ""That never got into the system."" Hofmann returned to school in March 2007, working in the district’s office away from students. Hofmann continued to work in the district office until her contract ended in May. El Dorado High School in Chandler hired Hofmann the following summer. Like the department, they did not see past discipline for Hofmann visible on the state’s web site. It was there Hofmann met another student, Samuel Valdivia. In April 2009, Hofmann’s alleged lover, Sixto Balbuena, walked in on Hofmann with Valdivia at her apartment. Balbuena stabbed and killed Valdivia. It was only after the murder that Hofmann surrendered her certificate instead of going through a state board hearing. The board launched a complaint against the certificate in November 2009 and approved her surrender in January 2010. As for the ""national database,"" Douglas was referring to the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification. It is an oversight board for all state education departments. Reporting Hofmann's discipline at Marcos de Niza to the association would have provided another red flag to El Dorado before they hired her. Association CEO Phillip Rogers said a teacher with a valid certificate could still have discipline reported to the database. States decide on their own what to report to the database, he said. ""In some states a reprimand where the educator retains his/her certificate might be reported, and in other states it would not,"" Rogers said. The one entry in the national database on Hofmann is from Jan. 27, 2010 — two days after she surrendered her teaching certificate. Our ruling Douglas said, ""We presented a report to the board on (teacher discipline) that showed their abject failure to report teachers whose certifications have been revoked or suspended to the national database,"" she said. ""And in one instance, because of that failure to report, it resulted in the death of a student."" Let’s be clear: There is not a straight line between the actions of the Board of Education and the death of a student. But the actions -- or, really, lack of action -- by the Board of Education prevented a school district from seeing red flags that might have prevented Hofmann’s hiring. Without those flags, Hofmann was rehired. And that’s how a student ended up in a position that ultimately resulted in his death. Douglas’ claim is accurate but requires that fuller description of events. So we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/19/diane-douglas/arizonas-schools-chief-links-2009-murder-boards-fa/

Office that provides ID for voting in one Wisconsin burg is open 4 days in 2016, John Oliver says
","Sauk City, which prides itself on being the oldest incorporated village in Wisconsin (yeah, it’s a little confusing), made HBO on Feb. 14, 2016. The mention came on ""Last Week Tonight,"" a Sunday show that takes a satirical look at news, politics and current events. The program is hosted by John Oliver, who used to be a correspondent for ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" on Comedy Central. Opening the segment by noting ""we are finally in an election year,"" Oliver talked about voting in America -- in particular, identification requirements for voting. (The show happened to air two days before Wisconsin’s primary election, when voters cast ballots for the a state Supreme Court seat and a variety of local offices.) Several minutes later, Wisconsin and a few other states, along with Sauk City (pop. 3,410), were singled out. ""And in some parts of the country, the offices that issue IDs are hardly ever open,"" an incredulous Oliver said. ""In 2012, a study found that in Wisconsin, Alabama and Mississippi, fewer than half of all ID-issuing offices in the state are open five days a week. ""And in Sauk City, Wisconsin,"" Oliver continued, ""the ID office is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month -- and only four months in 2016 even have five Wednesdays."" Oliver’s Sauk City claim later got online attention from Vox and Bustle. A graphic that flashed on the screen during Oliver’s monologue carried a screenshot of a website page that listed the hours of operation for a state Division of Motor Vehicles office in Sauk City. That appeared to back up Oliver’s claim. But Oliver’s claim could leave the impression that the only place Sauk City residents can get an ID for voting is at an office that’s open only on fifth Wednesdays, as in four days for all of 2016. Voter ID law In 2011, Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill that requires residents to present a photo identification in order to vote. The law was used for the first time in the February 2012 primary election. But after that, the law was put on ice while it was challenged in court. In 2014, the challenge reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear it. That meant the law was put back into effect. The first time it was used again was in the primary held two days after Oliver made his claim. Oliver’s claim Let’s be clear that Wisconsin has no ""voter ID."" Rather, under the voter ID law, Wisconsin voters must present an existing ID. Generally, it’s one of these: drivers license; state-issued ID (often in lieu of a drivers license); a military ID card issued by a U.S. uniformed service; a U.S. passport; or an identification card issued by a federally recognized Indian tribe. To get a drivers licensed or state-issued ID, residents are directed to the state Division of Motor Vehicles. You need to go to a DMV customer service center, fill out two forms and present documents (such as a marriage certificate) to prove your identity, as well as documents (such as a pay stub, a utility bill or a bank statement) to prove you’re a Wisconsin resident. So, if you’re in Sauk City, which is about 30 miles northwest of Madison, how do you find the nearest DMV office? We went to the DMV’s online locator for DMV offices by city and chose the listing for Sauk City. That DMV service center is inside the Sauk City Community Center. And, sure enough, as Oliver’s piece stated, it’s open only on the fifth Wednesday of every month, from 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m. The DMV doesn’t list the actual dates, so we looked them up. The four fifth Wednesdays in 2016 are in, as Oliver noted, March, June, August and November. (Oliver even offered a clever rhyme to remember when the fifth Wednesdays fall, but it’s a little profane.) A number of DMV locations relatively nearby, however, are open more often. The one in Baraboo (home to Circus World), about 20 miles away, is open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays. The one in Reedsburg (""fastest available"" Internet speeds in Wisconsin), about 30 miles away, is open the first, second and third Wednesday of each month from 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m. And in Madison, the nearest major city, there are three DMV facilities that are open even more during the week, plus Saturday mornings. To be sure, Sauk City isn't the only small town where DMV hours are limited, but no DMV site is open less. Our rating Oliver said that in Sauk City, Wis., ""the ID office"" that provides identification for voting ""is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month"" -- a total of four days in 2016. He’s correct that the state DMV office in Sauk City is only open on those four days in 2016, but that isn’t the only place where residents can go to get a state ID that they can use for voting. Several other locations within a relatively short drive of Sauk City are open much more often.

Donald Trump compares his spending and New Hampshire primary results to Jeb Bush
","Donald Trump brought a souvenir from the New Hampshire primary with him to the GOP debate in South Carolina last weekend, and he appeared eager to dangle it over Jeb Bush’s head. It’s nothing new to see the billionaire businessman tangling with the former Florida governor – but this piece of data he twice repeated was a novel talking point, seeking to illustrate the efficiency of his campaign compared to Bush’s. ""In New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1,"" Trump said. Trump first deployed a version of this line after Bush accused him of getting his foreign policy knowledge ""from the shows,"" but it was garbled as the two went back and forth in a flared exchange. Later, Trump circled back to make the same point with better clarity during a question directed only to him, again trying to paint Bush as a failed candidate. Even if the statistic fits with the storyline – that Bush’s well-heeled campaign and super PAC went all out in New Hampshire, and Trump doesn’t need to spend money to get attention – the gap seemed extraordinary. PolitiFact New Hampshire knew straight away his recollection of the election results was a bit off, so we decided to investigate whether it could be true that Trump tallied more than three times as many votes as Bush, while spending less than one-tenth what the governor did.  The results First, we’ll take on the second half of Trump’s statement: Bush ""came in five, and I came in No. 1."" We only needed to look at the election results to know Trump was right about his position -- he won the Republican primary on Feb. 9 with 100,406 votes --  but wrong about Bush’s. With 11 percent of the vote (31,310), Bush came in fourth place, not fifth. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was the one who actually came in fifth – although the margin was very close. The difference between Bush and Rubio was 1,278 votes, or about 0.4 percent of the total. We reached out to Trump’s campaign and never heard back. The spending Trump said Bush spent $44 million in New Hampshire, but made no mention of super PACs spending money. We won’t hold that wording against Trump, especially since the money was spent on Bush’s behalf, and Bush himself raised money for his PAC before he was an official candidate. Various news agencies have published analyses of the money that campaigns and related super PACs have spent on ads in New Hampshire. NPR, for one, looked at NBC-SMG Delta and Associated Press data through Feb. 3 to consider each candidate’s return on his or her New Hampshire TV ad spending. Their data, which doesn’t include the final few days before the primary, found that Bush and super PACs backing him spent the most per-vote by far: $4.5 million from his campaign and $29.5 million from super PACs. With about 31,000 voters supporting him, that meant a per-vote cost of more than $1,000. Trump, according to the same analysis, spent $3.1 million, all of which came from his campaign and none from a super PAC. With slightly more than 100,000 votes, that’s $31 per vote. To refocus on Trump’s statement, the total spent for each candidate per NPR’s analysis was: Trump $3.1 million; Bush, $34 million. By that measure, Trump appears to be accurate on his own numbers but exaggerating Bush’s. A secondary analysis by Morning Consult, which was published the morning of the primary, accounts for the last few days before voting. It had each candidate’s ad spending slightly higher in line with the additional time. By this time, Bush was at $36.1 million and Trump was at $3.7 million. So Trump’s estimate for himself was slightly low, while his account for Bush was still exaggerated by about $8 million. To put that spending in perspective, we took a look at the numbers for the campaigns that fell in after Bush. Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Hillary Clinton weren’t even close, spending $18.5 million, $15.2 million, $12.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively, according to the Morning Consult analysis. So whether Trump had said $34 million or $44 million, he was pointing out a radically high number. Our ruling Trump said: ""In New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1."" Bush came in fourth, not fifth, and his campaign and the PACs supporting him spent about $36 million, not $44 million. But it was still the most of any candidate. Trump did finish in first but spent closer to $4 million, not $3 million. Trump is slightly off in three out of the four claims, but his larger point about spending and campaign effectiveness in New Hampshire hold true. We can’t say whether Trump was intentionally exaggerating or not. Either way, we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-compares-his-spending-and-new-hampshi/

Marco Rubio says two-thirds of U.S. kids can't read at grade level
","Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pulled out a stunning statistic about the current state of K-12 education while making the case for school choice. ""Two-thirds of our kids can’t read at grade level,"" Rubio wrote in a recent Medium post. We wondered whether the situation in American schools was really that bad, so we took a closer look. Rubio’s source was the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a closely watched, federally sponsored standardized-testing effort. The most recent NAEP data for fourth- and eighth-grade students covers 2015. It offers four categories of achievement. From lowest to highest, they are ""below basic,"" ""basic,"" ""proficient,"" and ""advanced."" The two most relevant categories for this fact-check are basic and proficient, and neither level’s definition mentions reading on grade level. Basic is defined as ""denoting partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade assessed. Proficient is defined as ""representing solid academic performance for each grade assessed"" and ""competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter."" Rubio is using the proficient level as his benchmark, and the picture that produces isn’t pretty. In 2015, just 36 percent of American fourth graders were categorized as either proficient or advanced in reading. Here’s the chart:  And that same year, just 34 percent of eighth graders rated as either proficient or advanced in reading. Here’s the chart:  Using that metric, Rubio supports his point. But education experts advised caution. Most important is that it’s a bit of a stretch for Rubio to equate a NAEP rating of ""proficient"" with being ""at grade level."" ""There is no commonly accepted definition for what ‘grade level’ performance is or should be,"" said Christopher B. Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. NAEP, he said, is developed independently of the knowledge required by any specific state, district or school. David Bills, a professor of education at the University of Iowa, agreed. ""As far as I know, no one has ever tested those labels against what kids actually need to know to do well in school,"" Bills said. Indeed, after the No Child Left Behind education law was enacted under President George W. Bush, ""each state had to choose a level of ‘proficiency,’ and on average, this came closer to the NAEP basic level,"" said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow in education policy at the conservative Hoover Institution. If this is the case, then one could instead use the ""basic"" level under NAEP and find that the success rates are 69 percent and 76 percent for fourth and eighth graders, respectively. Still, despite such words of caution, experts said Rubio’s decision to use the ""proficient"" level as his benchmark was defensible. Experts also ratified Rubio’s use of the NAEP tests as his data source. ""Sure, there are lots of problems and it’s not a perfect measure, but that doesn’t mean it’s meaningless in all contexts,"" said Patricia M. Cooper, an associate professor and program coordinator for early childhood education at Queens College-City University of New York. There aren’t many credible alternatives to the NAEP numbers, she said. Cooper added that even the best-case scenario isn’t that great. ""Even if Rubio’s off by half, that means one-third of our kids aren’t reading on grade level,"" she said. ""Would that make us feel better?"" Our ruling Rubio said that ""two-thirds of our kids can’t read at grade level."" The numbers from the NAEP reading test for fourth and eighth graders provide some support for his statement. However, experts said that there is no accepted definition of what being at ""grade level"" means under the NAEP tests. While Rubio's use of NAEP's higher ""proficient"" standard is a reasonable choice, experts said, it's not the only one -- many states have set standards aligned with NAEP's ""basic"" level instead.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal correct that the longest Supreme Court vacancy in 30 years has been 237 days
","In the political wrangling over whether President Barack Obama should appoint a new Supreme Court justice or wait until his successor is sworn in next January, Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal argued on MSNBC's Hardball that a delay goes against modern precedent. The Democrat said that failure to fill the seat could mean a lot of tie votes on the court, which could ""really hurt people. And so there’s a duty to fill that vacancy, to make the system work."" ""Our constitutional system depends on nine members serving on the Supreme Court, which is why there has never been a vacancy in the last, I think, 30 years lasting longer than 237 days. The president has 339 left."" We wondered if Blumenthal was correct, and why he was limiting his analysis to the past 30 years. Using the Supreme Court's list of justices and their terms, we counted the gap between the date each justice left office and the date their successor was sworn in, beginning with justices who were on the bench in 1900. We found Blumenthal's 237-day gap. It began when Lewis F. Powell Jr. retired on June 26, 1987. It took nearly eight months to find a replacement. Ronald Reagan's first choice, Robert Bork, was rejected by the Democratic Senate, mostly along party lines. His second choice, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew after admitting he used drugs, both as a college student and later as a professor at Harvard. Anthony Kennedy, Reagan's third choice to fill Powell’s seat, was confirmed without opposition by the Senate on Feb. 3, 1988. He was sworn in Feb. 18, 1988. We found a longer vacancy, though it falls outside of Blumenthal's 30-year window. When Justice Abe Fortas resigned on May 14, 1969, 391 days passed before his successor, Harry Blackmun, was sworn in on June 9, 1970. That was nearly 46 years ago. Once again, a Republican president -- in this case, Richard Nixon -- failed to get his first two nominees approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate, although neither vote was on strict party lines.   Like Kennedy, Blackmun was confirmed without dissent. Blackmun ultimately became one of the most liberal justices on the court. In all, of the 59 vacancies that occurred in the 20th and 21st centuries, only four persisted longer than 200 days. Six were between 150 and 200 days. The average time between a justice's departure and his successor being sworn in: 73 days. Two things to note. Justices don't always get sworn in as soon as they are confirmed. John Hessin Clarke was approved by the Senate on July 24, 1916, but he wasn't sworn in until nearly three months later. Also, justices sometimes announced their resignations months before they step down from the bench, so their departures could take effect the day before or the same day a successor is sworn in. In the case of the 237-day gap cited by Blumenthal, Powell is listed as leaving the court the day he announced his resignation. Blumenthal was talking about the length of vacancies, not the gap between an announced departure and the swearing-in of a new justice. And on his specific timeline, he is correct.

"['National', 'Debt', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says Barack Obama will add more debt than all 43 previous presidents combined
","Compared to immigration and terrorism, the growth of the federal debt may not be quite as big a subject for Republicans running for president this year. But it never went away entirely. In a Feb. 5, 2016, Medium post about his approach to Social Security, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush reiterated a talking point that many Republicans have used before. ""Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together,"" Bush wrote. It’s been awhile since we last checked a claim of this sort, so we decided to take a closer look. Bush phrased his claim carefully, and it largely holds up by the numbers. It’s also important to note, though, that Obama isn’t the only one responsible for the growth of the federal debt.   Running the numbers We first turned to the U.S. Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator, which allows you to track the federal debt on a daily basis.  The website lists two kinds of debt -- publicly held debt and gross federal debt. The difference is that federal debt is calculated by taking the amount of publicly held debt and adding to it the debt that is held by the government. These are typically IOUs between one governmental entity and another, such as the money owed by the general treasury to the Social Security trust fund. On Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama was inaugurated, the public debt stood at about $6.31 trillion. By the day Bush’s column ran, it stood at about $13.67 trillion. That’s an increase of $7.36 trillion, which is short of the $8 trillion Bush mentioned. But remember that Bush said Obama will add that much on his watch, which can be reasonably interpreted to mean the amount by the end of Obama’s second term. If the debt continues to rise at the same pace it has increased over the past seven-plus years, it will end up at nearly $8.4 trillion when Obama leaves office. Using this measurement, then, Bush is right that Obama will see the debt increase by north of $8 trillion on his watch, and that this amount will exceed the amount accumulated by the previous 43 presidents ($6.31 trillion). Bush isn’t correct, however, using gross federal debt. Using the same method of estimating, Obama should see an increase of $9.51 trillion in gross federal debt by the end of his second term. That’s less than the $10.63 trillion he inherited from his 43 predecessors. Experts say that either publicly held debt or gross federal debt could be used to define the term ""national debt"" that Bush uses. Still, economists told us that publicly held debt is often the most popular measurement among specialists, so we won’t quibble with Bush’s decision to focus on publicly held debt. The size of debt production under Obama is reinforced by looking at debt as a percentage of gross domestic product. At the end of fiscal year 2008, publicly held debt accounted for 39 percent of gross domestic product. By the end of fiscal year 2016, it’s expected to be almost 77 percent. Even if bad timing has exaggerated this increase  -- fiscal 2008 ended four months before Obama took office, right as the economy was collapsing -- it’s certainly a big percentage jump over eight years. All this said, we’ll note a few things that are important to keep in mind. • How much blame does Obama deserve? Bush makes it sound as if Obama simply flipped a switch and debt started pouring out. Obviously, it’s a lot more complicated than that. ""It isn’t as if we were projecting balanced budgets and Barack Obama came into office and signed legislation increasing spending and cutting taxes,"" said Marc Goldwein, a budget analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In fact, Goldwein said, the January 2009 estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the debt would be around $9 trillion today. So Obama could -- at most -- be assigned the blame for adding an additional $4.5 trillion to the debt, and that’s only if you absolve Congress (which has been controlled by Republicans for most of his tenure) of any responsibility, and if you blame Obama for all of the long-lasting effects of the recession that he inherited. Also, a lot of the debt comes from entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, which are increasing largely on autopilot due to demographic trends that are out of any president’s control. So while Obama does bear some responsibility for the debt accumulation on his watch, he certainly doesn’t deserve sole responsibility. Bush’s own party played a role, too, as did the inevitable grind of demographic trends. • Any president today would be in much the same situation. Another type of inevitable grind -- inflation -- is worth factoring in as well. Every year, inflation puts an upward pressure on the scale of the debt. Inflation ""erodes the numbers and makes them a bit meaningless,"" Goldwein said. For a comparison, let’s take a look at Obama’s predecessor in the White House, George W. Bush -- a Republican, and Jeb Bush’s brother. The Debt to the Penny calculator doesn’t offer daily tallies for publicly held debt around the time of Bush’s inauguration, but it does offer daily data for gross federal debt, so we’ll use that. When Bush came into office on Jan. 20, 2001, the gross federal debt stood at $5.73 trillion. At the end of Bush’s term eight years later, the debt had risen to $10.63 trillion -- an increase on Bush’s watch of $4.9 trillion. That’s not quite equal to what his 42 presidential predecessors accumulated, but it’s 86 percent of the way there. That increase under Bush is a little smaller than the expected increase during Obama’s full tenure -- 89 percent -- but it’s not off by much. Our ruling Bush said that Obama ""will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together."" On the numbers, Bush is right, as long as you measure the nation’s publicly held debt, the most commonly cited statistic, and as long as you project forward to the end of Obama’s tenure. But Bush leaves out some important context when he focuses the blame solely on Obama, and when he ignores that the percentage increase in the debt under George W. Bush was similar. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/18/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-barack-obama-will-add-more-debt-all-/

Claim shows abortion rights group gave '100' to Joe Straus for 2007 vote he evidently didn't cast
","For years, Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio has been characterized on right-leaning websites like Breitbart and Red State as effectively pro-choice, in favor of abortion rights. Of late, SpeakerStraus.com, a site run by the Empower Texans Foundation, a tea party nonprofit, suggests Straus, who faces tea-party challengers in the March 2016 Republican primary, had a perfect pro-abortion voting record in the two legislative sessions before he became speaker in 2009. At the top of the SpeakerStraus.com page: A graphic stating Straus received a 100% legislator rating from NARAL Pro-Choice, an abortion rights advocacy group, in 2005. Further down on the page: ""In 2007, Joe Straus received a 100 percent rating by NARAL (the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League)."" 
 Image from SpeakerStraus.com (fetched Feb. 12, 2016) We wondered if the foundation’s representation of NARAL’s ratings were accurate. As it turned out, the posted 2005 rating for Straus was inaccurate and the one for 2007 could arguably use a blinking asterisk. NARAL scorecards The foundation didn't respond to repeated inquiries. But we found the NARAL Pro-Choice Texas scorecards using the web’s Wayback Machine and confirmed their authenticity with a NARAL representative. In 2005, that year’s scorecard shows, the group gave Straus a 45 percent rating — not ""100"" — for his House votes. Straus leaned ""pro-choice,"" the ‘05 scorecard says, in voting to require agencies getting funds for abstinence-only sex education to report to the state about successes reducing teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases and also voting on the group’s side in four instances during action on abortion restrictions. But Straus otherwise took six ""anti-choice"" votes that session, the scorecard says, fueling his 5-of-11 rating. The group’s 2007 scorecard indeed shows a ""100%"" score for Straus based on his ""pro-choice"" vote against setting aside a NARAL-backed amendment to the 2008-09 state budget. But a web search led us to a Dec. 16, 2014, blog post by the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life’s Joe Pojman stating Straus’s 2007 rating ""has little validity. NARAL’s scorecard is wrong."" That is, Pojman wrote, Straus didn’t even vote on the amendment that NARAL’s scorecard cites for Straus’ ""100."" The 2007 vote Stop the carousel: Did Straus get his ‘07 ""100"" based on a single, possibly misreported vote? According to the ‘07 scorecard, Straus got his ""100"" for being 1-for-1 on the group’s scored votes in which he participated — a result confirmed by email by Zoey Lichtenheld, communications coordinator for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. Then again, the scorecard shows, Straus didn’t vote on 10 other items potentially affecting each House member’s NARAL rating; he wasn’t on the House State Affairs Committee where the votes occurred. Lichtenfeld said NARAL records indicate Straus on March 29, 2007, voted on the group’s side against tabling proposed Amendment 20 to the 2008-09 state budget, the committee substitute for House Bill 1. That amendment, offered by Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, sought to strip the state’s Alternatives to Abortion program of its $5 million in funding over two years and put that amount into child abuse prevention grants for community organizations. Alternatives to Abortion program The Alternatives to Abortion program’s state backing traces to 2005 when a rider to the 2006-07 appropriations act directed $2.5 million a year in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funding to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program ""focused on pregnancy support services that promote childbirth"" among women who don’t want abortions.  The program took the form of a network of clinics run by the nonprofit Texas Pregnancy Care Network that offer counseling along with adoption and parenting resources. In 2011, lawmakers amended a 2003 law and newly required doctors to give patients a directory listing such centers (along with a sonogram and verbal explanation of the sonogram) 24 hours before performing an abortion. NARAL has been an outspoken opponent of the Alternatives to Abortion program and of crisis pregnancy centers in general, deeming them ""outposts across the country with the sole purpose of preventing women from accessing abortion (through lies and coercion)."" In a March 2011 report, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas called the Alternatives to Abortion program ""bad health policy, bad fiscal policy,"" and described the program’s primary provider, the Texas Pregnancy Care Network, as ""a wasteful and inefficient public structure"" that ""overestimated its budget needs by half a million dollars in FY 2010."" House Journal: Straus absent from vote So, what was Straus’ position? We checked the Texas House Journal for voting details. It says Straus — who otherwise participated in 26 of 35 votes that day — was absent during the vote on Amendment 20, as were 11 of his colleagues. House-posted video of the floor action that day shows that after the amendment was offered, another legislator moved to table it. Next, Speaker Tom Craddick announced the unfavorable-to-NARAL result (89 ayes to 48 nays); the journal presents the same tally. From the video, we further determined that a few minutes after the vote, Straus wasn’t at his desk on the floor; members usually vote from their desks. The speaker’s press secretary, Jason Embry, said by email he wasn’t sure why Straus missed the decision. Our ruling The foundation says Straus in 2005 and 2007 received 100 percent NARAL ratings. To the contrary, Straus got a 45 percent ""pro-choice"" NARAL rating in 2005. And while he got that ""100"" in 2007, that result was based entirely on the group concluding that Straus sided with it on a budget amendment when, records show, he was absent from the scored vote. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Black man shot dead by white Milwaukee police officer was 'unarmed,' Hillary Clinton says
","The disproportionate incarceration of black males was posed by a Facebook user during the Feb. 11, 2016 Democratic presidential debate, which was hosted by PBS in Milwaukee. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders responded to the question first. When former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton followed, she made a claim about the 2014 death of a black man at the hands of a white Milwaukee police officer that we want to check. Clinton, after alluding to a statistic cited by the questioner, said: ""And we know of the tragic, terrible event that led to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee. A young man, unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I."" The key word in Clinton’s claim, of course, is unarmed. We found this to be one of the more difficult claims we have rated. Moments before he was shot to death by the officer, Hamilton had taken the officer’s baton and struck the officer with it. But Hamilton, who was mentally ill, had no weapon when he was rousted by the officer shortly after two other officers had allowed Hamilton to continue sleeping in a park. In that sense, Hamilton was armed only after he had been struck. Sequence of events Diagnosed with schizophrenia, Hamilton, 31, was described as having long suffered from mental illness, including making a suicide attempt the year before his death. He had a history of encounters with Milwaukee police, but no convictions for any violent crimes. Hamilton was shot to death April 30, 2014 after police were called to Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. Here’s an overview of the incident, based on a report by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm. Chisholm’s report was based on an investigation done by a division of the Madison-based Wisconsin Department of Justice and a review by Emanuel Kapelsohn of the Peregrine Corp. in Pennsylvania, whom Chisholm cited as a leading national expert in use-of-force reviews. First police contacts: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee of the Starbucks located at Red Arrow Park called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a ""welfare check"" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called downtown officer Christopher Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about ""a homeless guy sleeping"" there. Manney, a 38-year-old, 13-year veteran of the department, was working another call downtown. Because he didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification; he said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left, since Hamilton was not disturbing anyone, according to the report. About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers went to Starbucks and told the employees Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. So, at this point, police had no concerns that Hamilton was armed or dangerous. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked, according to the report, ""that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject"" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him. Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times, according to the report. The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly --  when Manney fired his service weapon. It was determined that Manney fired the gun 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. So, Hamilton had no weapon when Manney approached him. He was armed, with Manney’s baton, only after Manney struck him with the baton. It’s worth noting that Flynn said, when he later fired Manney, that ""officer-created jeopardy is a term that has real meaning in the training circles of police departments around the country."" He said officers, in their use-of-force training, ""are taught not to create circumstances that place them at a situation where they have no choice."" (Chisholm opted not to file criminal charges against Manney, saying Manney's use of force was justified self-defense.) Our rating Clinton said Hamilton, who was killed during a confrontation with Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney, was ""unarmed."" Hamilton had no weapon when he was confronted by Manney. After Manney rousted Hamilton and began patting him down, a struggle ensued and Manney used his baton to strike Hamilton. Only then did Hamilton take the baton and strike Manney. That’s when Manney shot and killed Hamilton. Clinton’s statement is accurate, but needs clarification. That’s our definition of Mostly True.   More on police use of force Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and only 410 ""uses of deadly force"" by police in the United States. Our rating was Mostly True. Flynn correctly quoted FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although the 410 appeared to be an undercount of the number of people killed. PolitiFact National rated Half True a claim by National Urban League president Marc Morial, who said: ""The number of killings of citizens by police is at a two-decade high."" The former New Orleans mayor also cited FBI figures. But only a fraction of law enforcement agencies provide such data to the FBI, and the agencies that file the reports change from year to year, complicating comparisons.   Conservative Michael Medved, a nationally syndicated radio talk show host, said: ""More whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings."" That earned a Half True from our partners at PunditFact. In absolute terms, the claim was accurate. But when comparing death rates, blacks are about three times more likely than whites to die in a confrontation with police.",/factchecks/2016/feb/18/hillary-clinton/black-man-was-unarmed-when-shot-dead-white-milwauk/
"['Supreme Court', 'PunditFact', 'Stephen Colbert']","
Colbert: Scalia 'told more jokes and got more laughs than any of the other justices'
","As Antonin Scalia is memorialized for his conservative influence on the Supreme Court and legal theory, Stephen Colbert paid tribute to the late justice’s ""great sense of humor."" ""People have actually broken down the transcripts for oral arguments,"" Colbert said on Feb. 15’s Late Show, ""and he told more jokes and got more laughs than any of the other justices."" The comedian then shared a memory of Scalia being one of the few people to enjoy Colbert’s controversial address lampooning the George W. Bush administration at the 2006 White House Correspondents Association Dinner. Colbert's line got us wondering: Is there really data that shows Scalia made more jokes than any other justice? Or was Colbert, himself, just telling a joke? A spokesperson for CBS did not get back to us, but we found plenty of evidence backing Colbert’s point. King of laughs Researchers and Supreme Court watchers have been counting how many chuckles each justice has earned since 2004, when court reporters began identifying the nine members by name. Laughs are demarcated as (Laughter.) in oral argument transcripts. Really. This is a thing. Out of six Supreme Court terms dating back to 2004, Scalia has taken the crown for funniest justice every term. Overall, he was responsible for about 40 percent of the laughter (352 out of 919 laughs). Here’s a breakdown:  Jay Wexler, a Boston University law professor and first person to count Supreme Court laughs in 2005, told PolitiFact that Scalia always came in first place for as long as he’s been tracking them. ""Justice Scalia was a brash questioner and would say things people didn’t necessarily expect, which helps account for his laughs,"" he said. Take, for example, the giggles he got in Jan. 19’s argument for Heffernan vs. City of Patterson, in which Jeffrey Heffernan sued for the city for demoting him based on the mistaken perception that he was taking part in a political campaign. Attorney Thomas Goldstein, representing the city, argued that the case was ""bizarre"" given that Heffernan was politically apathetic and therefore not exercising his constitutional right to free speech.   ""It is bizarre,"" Scalia chimed in. ""Do you really believe, Mr. Goldstein, that the Constitution does not solve all problems?"" (Laughter.) ensued. Scalia is actually 64 percent funnier than the transcripts show, drawing more laughter than the bottom seven justices combined, according to a 2012 paper by litigation consultant and communications expert Ryan Malphurs. In a separate analysis, Malphurs noted the wide range of Scalia’s wisecracking. He made humorous hypotheticals, poked fun at himself and joked with advocates and the other justices. Witness Scalia riffing with Justice Anthony Kennedy in March 2007’s oral argument for Morse vs. Frederick, a case about whether the First Amendment protected students to express pro-drug use views: Justice Kennedy: ""So under your view, if the principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the street, had to come up and say now, how many of you here are truants — I can’t discipline you because you’re a truant, you can go ahead and throw the bottle (Laughter.)"" Mr. Mertz: ""No I don’t think she needs to do that in the heat of the moment. But later on once she’s discovered the true facts, then at that point I think she loses a basis for punishing him as a student if he was not there as a student."" Justice Scalia: ""Because you’re both a truant and a disrupter, you get off. (Laughter.) Had you been just a disrupter, tough luck. (Laughter.)"" The joshing wasn’t always good-natured, Malphurs told PolitiFact in an interview. Scalia joked pleasantly with Justices Stephen Breyer and Clarence Thomas outside of court, but Breyer, one of the court’s more liberal members, often bore the brunt of merciless teasing from Scalia in court. ""Scalia's humor was dependent on the tone that he wanted to take and the position he wanted to take,"" Malphurs said. ""The humor was goodnatured if he agreed with the advocate. If he disagreed with the advocate, it tended to be sarcastic and belittling."" A noted wit Scalia’s sarcasm shown especially in his opinions. Between 1986 and 2013, Scalia was quantifiably the most sardonic justice, penning more ""sarcastic"" or ""caustic"" opinions (75) than all the other justices combined. For context, Justice John Paul Stephens came in second with nine sarcastic opinions. In his controversial Obergefell vs. Hodges dissent, Scalia denounced gay marriage and skewered his colleagues, writing, ""The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie."" And then there's his hyperbolic refrain in his King vs. Burwell dissent: ""Understatement, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act! … Impossible possibility, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act! … Contrivance, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!"" Of course, some have found Scalia’s acerbic lines to be extremely offensive. But sometimes that was the the point, as shown by the Scalia-isms the justice ""unleashed"" on the court. Here are a few via intellectual property lawyer Yury Kapgan: • ""A fiction of Jack-and-the-Beanstalk proportions ...""; • ""'We’ll-look-at-all-the-circumstances-and-see-if-it-looks-dangerous’ approach ...""; • ""'It-is-so-because-we-say-so’ jurisprudence ...""; • ""The original-meaning-is-irrelevant, good-policy-is-constitutional-law school of jurisprudence ...""; • ""Thoreauvian ‘you-may-do-what-you-like-so-long-as-it-does-not-injure-someone-else’ beau ideal ..."" Whether Scalia joked to lighten the mood of oral arguments or used humor bitingly in legal prose, one thing is for sure. ""He liked to laugh and to make people laugh,"" said Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor and friend of Scalia’s. Our ruling Colbert said, ""People have actually broken down the transcripts for oral arguments and (Scalia) told more jokes and got more laughs than any of the other justices."" This wasn't a joke.  Out of six Supreme Court terms spanning 2004 to 2016, Scalia produced about 40 percent of all the laughter transcribed in oral arguments. That’s more than any other justice overall and more than any other justice every term. We rate Colbert’s claim True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/17/stephen-colbert/colbert-scalia-told-more-jokes-and-got-more-laughs/

Cuyahoga prosecutor Tim McGinty touts reduction in rape kits in reelection bid
","Ohio’s March 15 primary will essentially decide the Cuyahoga county prosecutor's race. No Republican candidate is running. Incumbent Tim McGinty and his challenger, Michael C. O’Malley, are both Democrats. McGinty’s website, McGintyForProsecutor.com, is peppered with exclamation points touting his successes since coming into office in 2012. We decided to check out some of the claims McGinty makes about his last four years. ""I formed one of the nation's most successful Rape Kit Task Force to eliminate the backlog of 4,850 rape kits that were untested for decades,"" McGinty says. ""Our Rape Kit Task Force will solve and prosecute 1,000 forgotten rape cases. Hundreds of serial rapists will finally be indicted. We are almost halfway to our goal of 1,000 rapes prosecuted!"" In 2009, Cleveland police began sending forensic evidence to the Ohio Bureau of Investigation's laboratory in response to news reports that sounded the alarm about thousands of sexual assault kits that never underwent DNA testing. When those DNA profiles match known offenders from a national database, prosecutors can file charges. But what does McGinty mean by ""almost halfway to our goal of 1,000,"" in terms of rapes prosecuted?   We asked the Cuyahoga Prosecutor’s Office for the numbers, and here’s what they turned up, as of Feb. 9, 2016:   1,424 completed investigations 2,193 active investigations 444 indicted defendants 136 convictions (out of 149 completed cases) 91.3 percent conviction rate If the goal was to have ""1,000 rapes prosecuted,"" 444 comes pretty close to ""almost halfway."" But is ""indicted"" the same as ""prosecuted?""    Yes, says Jonathan Witmer-Rich, an associate law professor at Cleveland State University. ""A prosecution begins when charges are filed, usually by the prosecutor,"" Witmer-Rich told PolitiFact Ohio. ""That is the beginning of the case. So it would be correct to say that McGinty ‘is prosecuting’ a particular defendant even though they have not gone to trial yet or been convicted. Once charges are filed, the defendant is being prosecuted.""   But can McGinty claim responsibility for the initiative to test the county’s rape-kit backlog? Various media sources credit Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine for putting out the call, over four years ago, for police departments to clear their evidence rooms of shelved rape kits and send them to the central state lab for DNA testing. This month, DeWine’s office marked the 10,000th sexual assault kit tested.   Jill Del Greco, the public information officer for the Ohio Attorney General, says that McGinty deserves credit. ""A lot more goes into it -- when we get a hit, they can’t necessarily go out and make an arrest,"" Del Greco says. ""Once we obtain the DNA testing results, we return the results to the investigating agency."" Witnesses have to be tracked down, she continued, and oftentimes, the victim has to be found again, too, when years have passed since the crime occurred. It’s up to the prosecutors and police departments in each jurisdiction to re-boot these investigations. Our rating McGinty said his office is ""almost halfway"" to his goal of prosecuting 1,000 rapes as a result of testing a cache of thousands of previously untested rape kits. As of Feb. 9, 444 defendants had been indicted, which is nearing the halfway point of 500.   A defendant is being prosecuted once charged, so we rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/17/tim-mcginty/cuyahoga-prosecutor-touts-reduction-rape-kits-reel/

Clinton spokesman wrongly says Nevada 'is 80 percent white voters'
","After a big loss in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign is lowering expectations in Nevada. Several campaign representatives, including spokesman Brian Fallon, are attempting to compare the state’s population to the fair-skinned denizens of Iowa and New Hampshire to help lower expectations in the state against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ surging campaign. Here’s what Fallon said in full: ""There’s an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucusgoer universe in Nevada,"" he said to NBC’s Chuck Todd on Feb. 9, 2016. ""But it’s still a state that is 80 percent white voters. You have a caucus-style format, and he’ll have the momentum coming out of New Hampshire presumably, so there’s a lot of good reasons he should do well."" Given Nevada’s population diversity, that ""80 percent white"" claim has struck several observers, including veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston, as highly questionable. Clinton herself has even addressed the claim, saying in a recent interview that Nevada is ""one of the most diverse and exciting states in our country."" We thought it merited fact-checking.  Unfortunately, there’s no official state office that collects the ethnicity of registered voters, so any claims related to demographic turnout rely mainly on aging exit polls from elections four to eight years ago. And due to Nevada’s recent emergence as an early state in the primary season, only the competitive 2008 contest stands as a valid comparison to the upcoming caucus. White voters made up around 65 percent of the vote according to 2008 caucus exit polls, with black and Hispanic voters each taking around 15 percent of the vote. About 118,000 voters, or 30 percent of registered Nevada Democrats, participated in the 2008 caucuses. The Clinton campaign pointed to comments it made to Ralston that some caucus modeling ""showed an 80 percent turnout in Nevada come Feb. 20"" for white voters. But there’s little evidence that increasing minority participation in Nevada elections would suddenly reverse itself. Joe Lenski, an executive with exit-poll giant Edison Research, said there’s no indication that massive growth in white voter turnout is coming in Nevada. ""The three times we’ve measured either caucus or general turnout in the last eight years has given us no number that high,"" he said. Demographic trends in Nevada don’t seem to favor the Clinton campaign’s position. Nevada is poised to become one of a handful of states with a majority-minority population within the next five years. Nevada’s population has trended to slightly older and more Hispanic since 2008, state demographer Jeff Highcastle said. According to 2014 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, whites make up a slim majority of the state’s population, while Latinos make up more than a quarter at 28 percent. That’s a huge difference from Iowa and New Hampshire, where census data shows close to 90 percent of the population in both states is white. It’s important to clarify that the state’s population diversity doesn’t necessarily translate into diversity at the polls, especially with low-turnout caucuses. Scant polling and the wild-card of same-day voter registration makes predicting caucus turnout difficult. But Hispanic voters do make up a sizable portion of the Nevada electorate. The nonpartisan Pew Research Center finds that around 17 percent of eligible Nevada voters are Hispanic, which ranks sixth nationally. Our ruling A Clinton campaign spokesman claimed that Nevada is a state with ""80 percent white voters."" Even looking at the best-case scenario, it’s difficult to imagine a sudden reversal in the trend of  increasing minority voter participation in Nevada elections. Given past turnout levels and the ethnic makeup of the state, the claim of ""80 percent white voters"" deciding the state’s caucus doesn’t hold up.

"['Global News Service', 'Economy', 'Poverty', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Pretty much on the money: Sanders says world's 80 richest own more than the bottom half do
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign against economic inequality went global in a video for the One Campaign, a global AIDS and poverty advocacy group,. ""The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time,"" Sanders said. ""It is the great economic issue of our time and the great political issue of our time. Truthfully, there is something profoundly wrong when the richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population, 3.5 billion people."" That’s an astounding fact, if true, that 80 people own as much wealth as 3.5 billion. We decided to see if Sanders was right. He largely is. Sanders relied on a 2014 analysis from Oxfam, which came up with the comparison from two different reports. The first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes’ list of billionaires. We'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats.  The Credit Suisse report Analysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $263 trillion. From there, analysts estimated that the bottom half of the world’s population (approximately 3.5 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world’s population own .72 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.7 trillion. James Davies, one of the report’s lead authors and an economist at the University of Western Ontario, said no one else has done this exact study. That’s true, but the Allianz Group, another global financial corporation, and the Boston Consulting Group, a financial and management consulting firm, have estimates of total household financial wealth that are pretty close to what Credit Suisse reported. Brent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, told us both his firm and Credit Suisse used much of the same data, but Credit Suisse included more countries. Beardsley said that difference wouldn’t be significant. Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Credit Suisse may have underestimated wealth in low-income countries. But even if true, it wouldn’t throw off Sanders’ comparison much. Santaeulalia-Llopis said Sanders and Oxfam might need to add a few more billionaires to their tally to make it more accurate. The strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, Beardsley said. ""(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income,"" Beardsley said. ""In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth --  is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty."" However, this doesn’t challenge the underlying numbers. Instead, it raises a question about interpreting them. Economist Branko Milanovic, formerly with the World Bank and now at City University of New York Graduate Center, countered in a blog post that sometimes, a negative net worth is a very big deal. ""Even for those people in the rich world who are ‘anomalously’ placed among the wealth-poor and who may lead nice lives despite owning nothing, a shock in the form of a medical emergency  -- unless there is public health care -- or loss of job may have catastrophic consequences,"" Milanovic wrote. ""There is just no wealth to fall back on to tide you over the bad times."" Forbes billionaire estimates The second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward. Oxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.7 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population. Forbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off because far from all the necessary information is public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market. The list can’t deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world’s wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate. One final note The divide between the super rich and the bottom of the global population appears to be getting worse. Credit Suisse, Forbes and Oxfam update their numbers at least every year and for 2015, Oxfam said just 62 billionaires own as much as half the world’s people combined. The Sanders campaign, however, told us the video was shot before the latest Oxfam report. So we won't hold it against Sanders in our rating. Our ruling Sanders said that 80 people own as much as half the world’s population. The statement was in line with the latest Oxfam report available at the time Sanders spoke. The Oxfam analysis was based on a report from Credit Suisse and the Forbes list of billionaires. The exact number of billionaires might well be different from the 80 that Sanders said, or the 62 that Oxfam said more recently.  But out of world population of 7 billion, it makes little difference if the tally were 160. It still represents a tiny sliver of a percentage of the people in the world. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/17/bernie-sanders/pretty-much-money-sanders-says-80-richest-own-more/

Gary Cobb won guilty jury verdicts against Tom DeLay but county lost on appeal
","It’s no secret: A Democratic candidate for Travis County district attorney starred in the high-profile prosecution of a felled U.S. House majority leader found guilty of campaign finance violations. A May 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story summed up: ""Travis County prosecutor Gary Cobb persuaded jurors in 2010 that former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay had illegally channeled corporate funds to Texas candidates."" Still, an adviser to one of Cobb’s opponents in the March 2016 primary asked us to gauge a TV ad posted on Cobb’s campaign website. In the spot, Cobb faces the camera and says: ""You trusted me to take on Tom DeLay — and we won."" By email, Jeff Crosby, an adviser to candidate Margaret Moore, noted that while a local jury found DeLay guilty, his convictions were thrown out on appeal. We asked Katie Naranjo, a consultant to Cobb’s campaign, about Cobb’s victory statement. By email, Naranjo told us Cobb ""was entrusted as lead trial lawyer"" in DeLay’s trial ""and Gary (and his trial team, other attorneys, investigators and support staff—that is, ‘we’) won the trial."" Naranjo acknowledged the convictions were overturned. Still, she wrote, ""Gary was not the appellate lawyer, which was another team. Trial lawyers often win a trial, and then that result might get overturned on appeal. That doesn’t mean that the trial lawyers didn’t win the trial."" News accounts Let’s revisit the DeLay turning points as depicted in Statesman news stories, starting with the trial. In November 2010, eight years after the county launched its investigation, a jury found DeLay, then 63, guilty of laundering corporate money into political donations during the 2002 elections. His indictment on the charges earlier led him to give up the leadership post; next, he left the House. From the Statesman account of the verdict: DeLay, a Republican whose nickname was ""The Hammer"" because of his heavy-handed leadership style, was accused of conspiring to funnel $190,000 of corporate money through the Republican National Committee, which sent $190,000 in campaign donations to seven GOP candidates for the Texas House. Prosecutors argued that DeLay conspired to launder corporate money into political donations as the first step in creating a GOP majority in the Texas House. It later redrew the state's congressional districts to favor Republicans, which prosecutors said bolstered DeLay's hold on his leadership post in Washington. State law prohibits corporations from giving donations to candidates directly or indirectly. Prosecutors earlier said they thought the DeLay case is the first such criminal charge ever filed over the state's century-old law on corporate contributions in state political races. In January 2011, DeLay was sentenced to three years in prison. But he also was released on a $10,000 bond pending appeals avowed by his lead trial lawyer, Dick DeGuerin. Cobb's role Cobb appears to have led the county’s courtroom team. A web search led us to a 2011 commentary by Rob Kepple of the Texas District & County Attorneys Association stating Cobb was part of a ""seasoned team"" of prosecutors in DeLay’s trial including Beverly Mathews, Steven Brand and Holly Taylor. Separately to our inquiry, the Travis County district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, said Cobb was the county’s lead counsel in the trial. Lehmberg said: ""He was not as active in the appeals process,"" specifying that Taylor steered that task. Appeals courts On Sept. 19, 2013, the state’s 3rd Court of Appeals sided with DeLay and overturned the convictions won by Cobb. In a 2-1 ruling that broke along party lines, the judges said the prosecution had failed to prove ""proceeds of criminal activity."" It further noted that the jury on two occasions had asked trial Judge Pat Priest whether the $190,000 was ""illegal at the start of the transaction"" or ""procured by illegal means originally."" And, the court said, prosecutors didn’t prove that point — a critical element to conspiring to launder money — and the judge never answered the jurors’ questions. More than a year passed. But on Oct. 1, 2014, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, splitting 8-1 along party lines, upheld the lower court. DeLay’s political committee could legally donate corporate money to the Republican National Committee and the national organization could legally make political donations to Texas candidates, the court found, and the agreement to swap money didn’t constitute conspiracy -- and DeLay didn’t ""knowingly"" violate the law. District attorney comments At the time, Lehmberg said in a written statement the court had effectively repealed the state law prohibiting corporate donations to candidates and placed an impossible burden on the state to prosecute violators of the ban. ""The decision undermines the fairness and integrity of our elections,"" she said. For this fact check, we asked Lehmberg if Travis County ""won"" against DeLay. She credited Cobb with winning at trial. But, she said by phone, ""ultimately, we didn’t"" prevail. Our ruling Cobb says Travis County residents ""trusted me to take on Tom DeLay--and we won."" Cobb and the county won a jury verdict against DeLay. However, the convictions were tossed by an appeals court; its ruling was upheld by the state's highest criminal court of appeals. We rate Cobb's claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
