No, Facebook doesn’t have a new rule that allows it to use people’s photos
","After Facebook announced that it changed its name to ""Meta,"" a refurbished rumor surfaced that claims the company can freely use people’s photos and messages.  ""The new Facebook/Meta rule starts tomorrow where they can use your photos. Don't forget the deadline is today! This could be used in lawsuits against you. Everything you've ever posted is posted today - even messages that have been deleted. It doesn't cost anything, just copy and post, better than regretting later,"" the warning message begins. The second half then instructs people to post a legal notice telling Facebook it isn’t allowed to use their content:  ""Under UCC Law Sections 1-207, 1-308... I am imposing my Reservation of Rights...I DO NOT ALLOW Facebook/Meta or any other Facebook/Meta related person to use my photos, information, messages or messages, both in the past and in the future. This statement I inform Facebook/Meta that it is strictly prohibited to disclose, copy, distribute or take any other action against me based on this account and / or its contents. This account content is private and confidential information. Violation of my personal life may be punished by law."" We’ve seen these posts about fake social media rules before, and this one is just as wrong as the others that came before it. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no such rule change and posting a notice barring Facebook from implementing it doesn’t have any effect. This online rumor first appeared in November 2012 when Facebook started trading publicly, and while the language is tweaked from earlier iterations, the message remains the same: Post this or else Facebook has control of your content. But users cannot just undo the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they first signed up and made an account. As well, simply posting a notice will not have any impact on new policy changes. Meanwhile, the company’s data policy and terms of service haven’t changed.  ""The Facebook company is now Meta,"" reads a disclaimer at the top of the company’s terms of service page. ""While our company name is changing, we are continuing to offer the same products, including the Facebook app from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Service remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data."" The website adds: ""You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want."" While users own the rights to their content, they gave Facebook license to do certain things with that content when they signed up and agreed to the company’s terms of service: ""When you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings)."" But it isn’t so much status updates or photos that Facebook is necessarily interested in, it’s data. Facebook, as well as other websites, wants to know details like age, gender, marital status and general interests to help it better target advertisements to its users. Social media posts claim that Facebook has a new rule that gives the company permission to use your photos and that posting a notice on your page will bar it from doing so.  This is an old hoax. There is no such rule change and posting a notice doesn’t override the company’s terms of use that users agree to when they sign up for an account.

Comparison of shootings omits key difference: 2 were killed in Rittenhouse case
","A post pushing back against the prosecution of Kyle Rittenhouse, the white teen awaiting a jury verdict in his Wisconsin shooting case, implies that a Black suspect got more favorable treatment in a less publicized shooting. The comparison is made in a viral image showing pictures of Rittenhouse, who says he shot in self-defense during a violent protest in Kenosha, Wis., and Timothy Simpkins, who is charged with shooting three people at his high school in Arlington, Texas.  The image says Rittenhouse shot three people ""in self-defense and got 2+ mo in prison, with a 2 million dollar bail"" and Simpkins ""shot four children"" and ""was freed within 24 hours, and then bail was $75k. I think it’s pretty evident to say that white privilege is a myth.""   The image was shared in a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two important facts are left out:  Two of the people Rittenhouse shot were killed, leading to two homicide charges against him, including one that carries a mandatory life prison sentence.  No one died in the school shooting, and Simpkins faces much lesser charges of aggravated assault. The jail and bail details have been widely reported. Simpkins was released from the Tarrant County jail in Fort Worth on Oct. 7, 2021, the day after the school shooting, after paying a $75,000 bond. His case is pending, with a court date scheduled for Dec. 10, 2021. Rittenhouse was released from the Kenosha County jail on Nov. 20, 2020, on $2 million bail. He had been in custody since surrendering to police in his hometown of Antioch, Ill., on Aug. 26, 2020, the day after the Kenosha shooting. The jury in his trial on homicide charges began deliberations on Nov. 16, 2021. Simpkins is charged with three counts of felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Simpkins, 18, was involved in a fight with a 15-year-old student at his high school in Arlington, which is between Dallas and Fort Worth, on Oct. 6, 2021, according to an arrest warrant and news reports. The incident left four people hurt, including three wounded by gunfire. During the fight, Simpkins fired shots from a handgun, according to police. He turned himself in later that day after police said he was wanted for the shooting. One teacher was injured from a fall. Three people were wounded, two seriously: the 15-year-old who was in the fight with Simpkins, who was released from a hospital after several surgeries about two weeks later, and a teacher who was hospitalized for about a week. News reports initially linked the shooting to Simpkins being bullied at school, but the police chief later said bullying was not a factor. Rittenhouse is charged with four felonies, including two homicide charges. Rittenhouse, then 17, traveled across state lines from his home in Antioch, Ill., about 20 miles to Kenosha, site of violent protests over a police shooting days earlier. He was armed with an AR-15, and on a self-described mission to protect property. During a confrontation, he shot three people, killing two. Charged with four felonies and one misdemeanor weapons charge, Rittenhouse said that he shot in self-defense.  If convicted of the most serious charge, first-degree intentional homicide in one of the shootings, Rittenhouse would face a mandatory sentence of life in prison. A viral image contrasting the treatment of two teens charged in shooting cases said that Simpkins, a Black teen shooter, got one day in jail and $75,000 bail, while Rittenhouse, a white shooter, got two months in jail and $2 million bail, implying that Simpkins was treated more favorably. The bail and jail details are correct. But the post leaves out important facts: No one died in the case involving the Black teen, Simpkins, who was charged with aggravated assault. But two people died in the case involving the white teen, Rittenhouse, who crossed state lines to commit the shooting and was charged with homicide. The image is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Medical diagnosis code for declining vaccines is not new, will not be used to track noncompliance
","On a Facebook page for healthcare workers fighting COVID-19 vaccine mandates, an unidentified woman shared what sounds like a warning about new industry practices to promote vaccination. In the viral video, the woman says a new medical diagnosis code has been designated for people who decline vaccines, and it will be used to help determine who will go into ""education camps."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Despite the ominous tone of the post, the diagnosis code is not new and has been in use since 2015. There is also no evidence to support the claim that the government plans to send unvaccinated people to education camps. The woman in the video gives the impression she is at her workplace reading aloud from an email. She says the correspondence is from ""DOH and DHS,"" and while she does not specify what the initials stand for, they are common abbreviations for Department of Health and Department of Health Services, or Department of Homeland Security. The woman says she will not identify what state sent the information, other than to say it’s not Florida. Reading from the purported email, she says the agencies will be using diagnosis code ICD-10 Z28.20 ""for vaccine counseling that does not result in vaccination."" She explains that ICD-10 codes are used to track people through various medical data systems, including insurance and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and continues, ""So for those of you who were wondering how they were going to find out who they need to put in those ... education camps and counseling camps, I think we just got our ...."" Her answer trails off as she points to the screen with the email. ICD-10 stands for International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. It’s a classification system ""designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification and presentation of mortality statistics,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal Department of Health and Human Services mandated that the current set of codes, ICD-10, be used by healthcare providers, effective Oct. 1, 2015. The code referenced in the Facebook video, Z28.20, is for ""immunization not carried out because of patient decision for unspecified reason,"" according to ICD10Data.com. The website indicates that the Z28.20 code became effective on Oct. 1, 2015. Other healthcare publications mention the code as well. The American Academy of Pediatrics published a 2016 report about ""Codes to Capture Vaccine Refusal,"" and noted that the codes begin with category Z28. The claim from the video about education and counseling camps appears to relate to an Oct. 24, 2021, appearance on Fox News by Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC. During an interview, Chris Wallace asked Walensky whether the Biden administration is ""still full speed ahead on mandates for essential workers to get vaccinated."" Walensky’s answer included this comment at the 8:05 mark in the exchange: ""There is a plan should these people not want to be vaccinated towards education and counseling to get people the information they need so that they are feeling comfortable in getting vaccinated."" Her comment was misconstrued by websites known for spreading misinformation, such as NaturalNews.com, which published an Oct. 27 story with the headline, ""CDC’s Walensky threatens cops who refuse covid shots, says they’ll be sent to reeducation camps."" Others, such as conservative commentator Laura Ingraham, also claimed that Walensky’s comments meant she wanted to send people to camps for reeducation. A Facebook post claims that a new medical diagnosis code has been designated for people who decline vaccines, and it will be used to help determine who will go into ""education camps."" The diagnosis code is not new and has been in use since 2015. There is no evidence to support the claim that the government plans to send unvaccinated people to education camps.

Actor Macaulay Culkin is alive and well, just like in 2014 when rumors of his death were debunked
","Actor Macaulay Culkin was not dead in 2014, when the false rumor of his demise first surfaced. And he was not dead when the debunked claim reappeared in November 2021. A viral TikTok video shows footage of Culkin walking in a fashion show Nov. 2 in Los Angeles. A narrator asks who the person is because, he says, Culkin died from a heroin overdose. Culkin, 41, rose to fame as a child actor in ""Home Alone,"" the 1990 Christmas movie that became a classic. The video appeared on Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Evidence does not support the claim that Culkin died. He recently starred in a television show, ""American Horror Stories, Red Tide."" In October he tweeted about the new ""Home Alone"" reboot on Disney+. In early November, he was featured in the L.A. fashion show; and a week ago, he was photographed at a Los Angeles Rams NFL game with his partner. The TikTok video shows Culkin walking in an outdoor Gucci runway show, and a text overlay says, ""Home Alone died in my timeline, Mandela effect."" The caption includes the hashtags #conspiracies and #mandelaeffect. The video’s narrator asks, ""Who the hell is that walking? Because this man literally died from a heroin overdose."" The narrator then moves to one side to display a screenshot of an online search for ""Macaulay Culkin death,"" with the top search result recounting details of Culkin’s supposed death on Nov. 6, 2014. The information in the screenshot is excerpted from a 2014 Snopes story that debunked the claim about Culkin’s death. But the Facebook video does not reveal that Snopes rated the information false. The 2014 false claim about Culkin’s death followed other rumors in 2012 that he was addicted to heroin and oxycodone. Culkin has said he used recreational drugs but did not have a serious drug-use problem. The video references the Mandela effect, which occurs when ""a piece of misinformation is propagated as fact by enough people that it becomes commonly accepted,"" the New York Times reported when it used the term as its crossword-puzzle theme in 2019. ""The term refers to Nelson Mandela, the news of whose death was somehow memorized by people all over the world as occurring at various times, from his imprisonment in the 1980s to the middle of the 2000s (he died on Dec. 5, 2013)."" A Facebook post claims Macaulay Culkin died from a heroin overdose. Culkin is alive.

Critical race theory isn’t in Virginia’s curriculum
","In a Nov. 8 CNN interview, Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott claimed that critical race theory was being used in Virginia schools. Scott said that despite denials from Democrats like former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, ""parents know their kids are being indoctrinated with critical race theory in Virginia.""  When CNN anchor Brianna Keilar challenged Scott, the senator pulled out some notes and read aloud: ""In 2015, when Terry McAuliffe was governor, the Virginia Department of Education promoted incorporating critical race theory lens in education. You can still find it on the Department of Education's website.""  Scott further said that a 2019 memo written by Virginia Superintendent of Public Instruction James Lane promoted critical race theory and the idea of white fragility. ""It’s not a part of the curriculum,"" Keilar retorted before Scott interrupted her. ""Brianna, wait a minute. Let’s all agree. They were trying to indoctrinate kids. Terry McAuliffe denied it. It’s still on the website. This is happening,"" Scott said.  We fact-checked a related claim from Virginia’s Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin that ""critical race theory moved into all our schools"" and rated it False. When we reached out to Scott for evidence behind his claim, his office sent us a 2015 slide presentation and a copy of Lane’s memo, as well as a Virginia Department of Education webpage with a list of books. We read through that information and reached out to both the Department of Education and to the author of the slide presentation. We found that the state was focused on trying to combat racism in disciplinary procedures and increase awareness of the social and emotional needs of students affected by news that several state leaders had worn blackface. But Scott’s claim goes too far in suggesting that this effort amounted to indoctrination of kids with critical race theory.   Critical race theory is a broad collection of ideas about systemic bias and privilege. It holds that racism is ingrained in American history, and appears in big and small facets of life, like who gets a job interview or a home loan, and how people are treated by police.  Opponents of critical race theory say that because it involves discussion of race, the approach is inherently racist, painting a negative picture of America and teaching white students to feel guilty. In May, Utah Republican Rep. Burgess Owens introduced two pieces of federal legislation aimed at restricting the teaching of critical race theory. Owens and other Republican members of Congress said the theory ""undermines civil rights,"" and teaches students ""to be ashamed of our country.""  In June, Scott introduced another resolution against the theory. ""While we cannot ignore the scars of our past, we also cannot tolerate the attempts of the woke left to weaponize our history in radical curriculums that teach our children to see America only for its worst days, and the American people only for their darkest hours,"" he said. Meanwhile, several states have passed legislation or rules barring the teaching of critical race theory in public schools.   Steven Staples, Virginia’s former superintendent of public instruction, said that critical race theory was not an initiative during his time in office. A McAuliffe appointee, Staples served in the post from 2014 until January 2018.  In 2015, the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative news organization, reported that Virginia referred students to law enforcement agencies at a rate three times higher than the national rate, with Black students making up a disproportionate percentage of the referrals. As part of its effort to combat this, Staples said the Department of Education held a two-day training program to encourage local school districts to examine their data for disproportionality and identify solutions.  ""A flurry of legislative proposals followed,"" Staples said. One of the presentations made during that 2015 institute came from Brenda L. Walker, a professor of exceptional student education at the University of South Florida whose area of specialization includes schooling issues related to Black students in the U.S., including how they are disciplined. Walker created the slideshow that Scott referred us to. Walker told PolitiFact that Scott’s claim is incorrect, and her slides were being taken out of context. Her focus was on helping teachers be proactive in finding solutions to the problem of out-of-school suspension rates that primarily affected Black students, not on how to implement teaching critical race theory. The presentation mentions the theory only once, and Walker said she leaned on it as one framework to help educators better understand the suspension-rate problem ""so that teachers’ classrooms are responsive to the changing needs of their students and students’ families."" ""CRT for me undergirded the presentation,"" Walker said. ""I was trying to present a rationale for why we need to look at these issues differently. This problem has been going on for decades, so we can’t look at this in the lens that we’ve always used."" Walker’s presentation also included a tool to help teachers to develop their own action plans to address the issue of disproportionate suspension rates.  In 2019, Lane, who was appointed by Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam, wrote a memo to district superintendents following the news that showed a number of Virginia politicians, including Northam, had worn blackface in the past.  The memo read as a call to local school leaders to be actively engaged in creating inclusive and diverse environments for students. ""The recent revelations from some of our leaders have left our communities hurt and left our students seeking deeper understanding,"" Lane wrote. ""Now more than ever, our joint commitment to supporting the social and emotional needs of Virginia’s diverse student population is required.""  Lane included a list of trainings, resources and books, including ""Between the World and Me"" by Ta-Nehisi Coates and ""White Fragility"" by Robin DiAngelo, the book that Scott mentioned. However, the letter was meant for school leaders, not students. VDOE’s Standards of Learning include subjects like math, English, science, and history. VDOE’s media director Charles Pyle confirmed there is no mention of critical race theory.  In our fact-check of Youngkin’s claim, we noted that a growing number of districts have announced that they don’t teach the theory, including Virginia Beach, Colonial Heights and Hanover County.  VDOE’s executive communications director Ken Blackstone said the purpose of the document was to support division leaders as they worked to create a welcoming school environment that is respectful of all students, families and school staff.  ""To argue that a single memo, issued while the Commonwealth was embroiled in discussions about race, with outside resources for division leaders to consider, is a wholesale endorsement of Critical Race Theory in our schools is inaccurate and unfair,"" Blackstone said.  Scott claimed that, ""In 2015, when Terry McAuliffe was governor, the Virginia Department of Education promoted incorporating critical race theory lens in education...They were trying to indoctrinate kids."" As evidence, he cited a slide presentation from 2015 and a 2019 memo written by the Virginia superintendent of public instruction. The slide presentation was part of a two-day training program to help school administrators, teachers and staff solve the disproportionate rate of disciplinary action taken against Black students. The presentation referred to the theory only once — and it was under a slide marked ""alternatives."" The slide show’s creator said she referenced the theory as a framework to help educators better plan a course of action. The 2019 memo was addressed to district superintendents, and its list of resources were suggested for school leaders, not as a part of the curriculum. Media representatives for Virginia’s education department have said that critical race theory is not included in the curriculum. Furthermore, a list of books that Scott referenced on VDOE’s website are books for school leaders and instructors — not kids.  We rate Scott’s claim Mostly False.  CORRECTION, Dec. 16, 2021: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly quoted Brenda Walker to say ""a decade,"" not ""decades."" We have updated this check to reflect this correction. The change does not affect the rating.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A436C40>],/factchecks/2021/nov/16/rick-scott/critical-race-theory-isnt-virginias-curriculum/

A false anecdote about Stalin and a chicken circulates again — adapted for the pandemic
","As leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin is said to have coined the Russian word ""dezinformatsiya"" to describe the spreading of false reports in the media to mislead public opinion.  A modern example of that is a viral image being shared on Facebook that mixes a critique of COVID-19 mitigation policies with an anecdote about Stalin himself.  The image tells a gruesome story starring the dictator, who ruled the Soviet Union between the 1920s and 1950s. ""Stalin once ripped all the feathers off a live chicken as a lesson to his followers,"" it says. ""He then set the chicken on the floor a short distance away. The chicken was bloodied and suffering immensely, yet, when Stalin began to toss some bits of wheat toward the chicken it followed him around."" Stalin then purportedly told his followers: ""This is how easy it is to govern stupid people, they will follow you no matter how much pain you cause them, as long as you throw them a little worthless treat once in a while."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Conservatives have been sharing this claim for years on different platforms and in different languages to criticize communism. It was shared on Facebook by a conservative Brazilian politician in 2017 and on Twitter by a libertarian Venezuelan think tank in 2019. The new post uses the story to criticize anti-COVID-19 measures, including relief payments, adding: ""Stay inside. Shut your business down. Do as you’re told. We will take care of you. Help is on the way. Here’s $600."" But the event described in the anecdote never actually happened. Some versions of the story in other languages hint at that. A Spanish newspaper calls it a ""fable,"" while a Brazilian website calls it a ""rumor."" But versions in English, like the Facebook post above, tend to present it as fact, leading people to wonder if it’s true. ""Did Stalin really pluck the feathers off a chicken to demonstrate how his power worked?"" asked a user on Reddit. ""Did Stalin pluck a live chicken?"" asked a user on Quora.  Snopes traced the origin of this anecdote to the writings of Chingiz Aitmatov.  Aitmatov had a ""distinguished history as an anti-Stalinist,"" according to the New Yorker, and wrote his critical works amid an ""extraordinary torrent"" of anti-Stalinist works published in the 1980s — decades after Stalin’s death. Aitmatov also used allegories and fantasy in his work, and was inspired by legends and myths, according to the preface of his book ""The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years."" An obituary of the writer published by Reuters in 2008 says that he ""often interwove popular myths and folktales to create allegorical themes populated with down-to-earth characters."" Based on those traits of the writer’s work, Snopes concluded that the tale about the chicken is likely not a factual account, ""but rather an illustrative sketch that Aitmatov either invented himself or heard elsewhere and subsequently attributed to Stalin."" Oleg Khlevniuk, a historian based in Moscow and the author of a biography of Stalin, told PolitiFact that the anecdote is false. An image shared on Facebook claims that Stalin plucked a live chicken to teach his followers a lesson about political control. The image uses the anecdote to criticize anti-COVID-19 measures. But there’s no evidence the anecdote is true. The story comes from an author who is inspired by legends and myths and uses allegories and fantasy in his work.

Kyle Rittenhouse’s mother did not bring him to a Kenosha riot armed with a rifle
","With the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse nearing its end, a viral image on social media attacked the mother of the Illinois teen who is charged with shooting two men to death during a race-related violent protest in Kenosha, Wis. The image, with pictures of Rittenhouse and his mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, stated: ""Why are we just glazing over the fact that Kyle Rittenhouse’s mother put her minor child in a vehicle, drove him across state lines and dropped him off in the middle of a riot armed with an assault rifle? Why is she not behind bars?"" The image, shared in an Instagram post from actor D.L. Hughley, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could find nothing to back the attack on Wendy Rittenhouse. There is no evidence that Wendy Rittenhouse, who has not been charged with a crime, drove her son to Kenosha, and no evidence that Kyle Rittenhouse was armed when he left their Illinois home.According to court documents and testimony, Kyle Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha on his own and went to the protest with a friend who provided him with the gun. The gun was kept at the home of the friend’s stepfather in Kenosha.  Three nights of violent protests erupted in Kenosha, which is roughly halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago, after a white Kenosha police officer shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, while arresting him on Aug. 23, 2020. Kenosha is a city of about 100,000 residents, and almost 80% are white. Blake, who was armed with a knife, was left paralyzed; the officer was not charged with a crime. Two days after the shooting, Rittenhouse, then 17, traveled from his home in Antioch, Ill., about 20 miles from Kenosha, to the protests. He was armed with an AR-15, with a magazine that held 30 rounds of ammunition, and a self-described mission to protect property. During a confrontation, he shot three people, killing two. Charged with one count of intentional homicide and one count of reckless homicide, among other crimes, Rittenhouse’s trial centers on his claim that he shot in self-defense. Attorneys began their closing arguments to the jury on Nov. 15. Here is the first issue with the social media post attacking Wendy Rittenhouse: There is no evidence that Kyle Rittenhouse possessed any gun before he arrived in Kenosha from Illinois. The gun Rittenhouse used in the shootings was provided by his friend, 20-year-old Dominick Black of Racine, Wis., after Rittenhouse arrived in Kenosha, according to a criminal complaint. According to the complaint: Black bought the rifle for Rittenhouse in May 2020, using money from Rittenhouse, and they agreed the rifle would be stored at Black’s stepfather’s house in Kenosha. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, was too young to legally buy the gun in Wisconsin.  At Rittenhouse’s trial, Black testified that he bought the rifle for Rittenhouse and that they shot target practice together in a rural area.  On the day of the shootings, Black testified, Black invited Rittenhouse to join him at the Kenosha protest to protect a car dealership. Before they went to the protest, Black testified that they went together to the home of Black’s stepfather to get Rittenhouse’s gun.

Rittenhouse testified that after the shootings, Black drove him home in Antioch, where he told his mother and two sisters what happened.

Kids ‘50 times more likely to be killed’ by COVID-19 vaccines? Pants on Fire
","A viral image about COVID-19 vaccines and kids makes this distressing — and spurious — claim:  ""Children are 50 times more likely to be killed by the Covid vaccines than by the virus itself.""  The words are presented as a quotation attributed to ""Dr. Michael Yeadon, former Pfizer VP."" Included are the Pfizer logo, a clown holding cash and two hands outstretched toward the money. The image, shared on Instagram, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Child deaths from COVID-19 are rare, but several hundred kids in the United States have died from the virus. There is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S. The FDA on Oct. 29 granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, after finding it to be safe and effective for that age group. The claim stems from a June interview Yeadon gave to Steve Bannon, a podcast host who served as a White House aide and strategist to former President Donald Trump. Yeadon, who hasn’t worked for Pfizer since 2011, said young people are not at risk of serious illness from COVID-19: ""It’s a crazy thing then to vaccinate them with something that is actually 50 times more likely to kill them than the virus itself."" Bannon interrupted Yeadon, saying, ""I want you to back this up."" Yeadon’s reply did not cite any evidence to back his claim regarding children. Yeadon responded by discussing what he described as the large number of adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, as compared to other vaccines, that have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a federal database run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration that is often used for misinformation.  VAERS helps researchers collect data on vaccine after-effects and to detect patterns that may warrant a closer look. It is designed as an open system, where anyone can submit a report, and the reports are widely accessible. The reports are not verified, and incomplete VAERS data is often cited as a basis for false claims about vaccine safety. The CDC cautions that VAERS results are not enough to determine whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse event. Yeadon was formerly the chief scientific officer and vice president of allergy and respiratory research, his LinkedIn profile says. But his statements about COVID-19 vaccines have become fodder for a number of false social media claims. The Spanish fact-checker Maldita.es rated Yeadon’s claim false.  The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association reported that as of Nov. 4, there were 614 COVID-19 deaths among children. That figure was based on reports from 45 states, New York City, Puerto Rico and Guam, and it amounted to 0.09% of the 673,301 total COVID-19 deaths in those areas. Meanwhile, there is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S. Researchers are still evaluating whether there is a connection between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and rare types of blood clots that have led to deaths, but such cases are few. In vaccine trials, zero deaths were reported among the 1,131 adolescents age 12 to 15 who received the Pfizer vaccine, according to an April 2021 FDA document. Zero deaths also were reported among 2,489 people ages 12 to 17 who received the Moderna vaccine, according to an August 2021 medical journal article.  In July 2021, the CDC reported there were 14 deaths among 8.9 million people age 12 to 17 who received Pfizer vaccinations. None of the deaths were determined to be related to the vaccines, said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, professor in pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Florida. In total, more than 432 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Nov. 8, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 9,549 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. A viral image claimed that ""children are 50 times more likely to be killed by"" COVID-19 vaccines than by the virus itself. There is no clear evidence COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths.

What's true, what's unproven in Dan Patrick's claim about people apprehended at southwest border
","The potential reinstatement of Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols, also called the Remain in Mexico policy, has been in flux since President Joe Biden took office. Biden ended the policy soon after taking office. It required people seeking asylum without proper documentation to wait in Mexico for their immigration court date. The policy affected more than 70,000 migrants, many of whom legally sought asylum or refuge at the southwestern border, the El Paso Times reported. The administration was ordered to reinstate these protocols by a federal court in Texas in August, and the Supreme Court upheld that decision. Mexico would have to agree to the policy's reinstatement. But the Biden administration again expressed on Oct. 29 its goal to end the policy if the courts allow it through a memo by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The memo said the policy likely reduced the flow of migrants, but Mayorkas opposed the policy for humanitarian reasons. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, center, appearing Oct. 18 on Fox News, says the number of migrants crossing the border under Biden's presidency is ""out of control. Republicans have been calling for the reinstatement of the policy, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, appearing Oct. 18 on Fox News, said the Migrant Protection Policy lowered the number of migrants and spoke in favor of the court-ordered reinstatement of the policy. Patrick described the number of migrants crossing the border under Biden's presidency as ""out of control."" Patrick said, ""And right now, we are looking at over a million people apprehended this year, meaning probably another 2 or 3 million have come in illegally."" Let’s take a look at that claim: Has the Border Patrol apprehended more than 1 million people, and have millions more people crossed the border? When asked about Patrick’s source, his office pointed to Customs and Border Protection’s website for the number of encounters between Customs and Border Protections and migrants on the Southwest land border. Encounters are the total number of law enforcement actions by Customs and Border Protection. There were 1.7 million Border Patrol encounters on the southwestern border in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, according to the data page updated Oct. 22. Excluding the recently released September data, which was published after Patrick made his statement, there were 1.5 million encounters. But 1.7 million encounters do not mean 1.7 million people tried to cross the border. Customs and Border Protection indicated in a news release on August operations that just over 1 million individuals were encountered year-to-date in fiscal 2021. A news release on September operations indicates agents encountered 142,710 individuals on the Southwest border in September. Those two values together place the number of individuals who tried to cross the border in fiscal 2021 at 1.1 million. So, Patrick was accurate when he said more than 1 million people were apprehended at the border this year. There's a second part to this claim: Patrick said ""probably another 2 or 3 million have come in illegally."" Patrick's spokesperson wrote in an email, ""we are clearly on pace for well over 2 million encounters"" and that the number of people who crossed the border between ports of entry but were not apprehended are from ratio estimates by ""various law enforcements."" His office did not answer follow-up questions from PolitiFact Texas on which law enforcement entities made those estimates. The number of people who entered the U.S. illegally but were not apprehended is not available from Customs and Border Protection, but the Homeland Security Department does calculate border security metrics. The methodology behind the Border Patrol's migrant apprehension rate is presented in annual reports. The latest available report is the 2020 report with fiscal 2018 data. Some of these metrics rely on estimates of the number of people who crossed the border undetected. The apprehension rate was 70% in 2018. Ruth Wasem, who teaches policy courses on immigration at the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs, noted this rate suggests the number of people who were not apprehended this year would be lower than Patrick's estimate. Patrick's estimate of 2 million or 3 million people would mean two-thirds or more of migrants weren’t apprehended. That might have been the case in the early 2000s when the apprehension rate ranged from 33% to 43%, but not now, Wasem said. The apprehension rate generally has increased over time. In an October Fox News interview, the former head of the Border Patrol, Rodney Scott, said there were more than 400,000 ""got aways"" over the past year. The Migration Policy Institute estimates 500,000 to 600,000 people entered the country without authorization and were not apprehended last year. ""There's also been statements from CBP officials throughout the year that they're seeing about 1,000 got aways per day. If you multiply that by 365 days to account for 365 days in a year, it comes out to about 365,000,"" said Jessica Bolter, an analyst for the Migration Policy Institute. So, it could be estimated there were 365,000 to 600,000 people entering the country without authorization in fiscal 2021. Patrick said, ""And right now, we are looking at over a million people apprehended this year, meaning probably another 2 or 3 million have come in illegally."" The first part is accurate when you look at figures released by the Border Patrol. Because the Border Patrol has been apprehending a higher share of people over time, the number of people who were not apprehended in fiscal 2021 was likely far fewer than his estimate. We rule this claim Half True, which means the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097036A80>],/factchecks/2021/nov/15/dan-patrick/texas-lt-gov-patrick-half-right-claim-about-people/

Bob Good spreads bogus claim about infrastructure bill
","In a long-awaited vote, the U.S. House of Representatives on Nov. 5 approved an infrastructure bill crafted by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and supported by President Joe Biden. The measure, which includes more than $500 billion in new spending plus additional money from reallocated funds, has already passed the Senate and awaits Biden’s signature. When the House voted, six progressive Democrats opposed it, which would have been enough to tank the bill had 13 Republicans not crossed party lines to vote with most Democrats. (In the earlier Senate vote, 19 Republicans joined all of the chamber’s Democrats in supporting the bill.) One Republican who voted against the infrastructure bill was Rep. Bob Good from Virginia’s 5th congressional district. He assailed the bill as a Democratic boondoggle during a Nov. 4 interview with John Fredericks, a conservative radio host. ""The infrastructure bill is only 10% true infrastructure,"" Good said. He made the same claim during a Nov. 9 television interview and in an Oct. 29 video. Saying that just 10% of the bill is ""true infrastructure"" is incredibly off-base, as PolitiFact has pointed out before. When Biden first proposed what would eventually become the infrastructure bill in April, PolitiFact National gave a Pants on Fire rating to Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., for saying ""something less than 6%"" of the proposal ""is actually focused on infrastructure.""  The figure Cheney cited applied to spending on roads, bridges and highways but excluded items in Biden’s proposal that are widely considered to be infrastructure, including public transit, rail, airports, ports, waterways, the electrical grid, drinking water systems and broadband.  Good’s statement is, if anything, more inaccurate than Cheney’s, because several large elements of the original proposal that had the weakest claims to be considered ""infrastructure"" were stricken from the bill that passed both chambers.  The transformation of the bill happened because Biden and congressional leaders decided to seek bipartisan buy-in for a pure infrastructure bill and then vote separately on a set of safety-net measures that are more polarizing between, and within, the parties. For instance, when Cheney made her statement, Biden was seeking $400 billion for expanding access to long-term, home and community-based care under Medicaid. That never made it into the bill that passed both chambers.  Other elements of Biden’s original plan fell into a gray area, fitting under some definitions of infrastructure but not others. These included $590 billion for research and development and domestic manufacturing, $400 billion in clean energy tax credits and $328 billion for capital investments in housing, schools, child care centers, veterans hospitals and other federal buildings. But these did not make it into the final infrastructure bill. Instead, the bill that passed Congress consisted almost entirely of traditional infrastructure provisions.  Here’s one categorization by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent group that scrutinizes federal spending. • Roads, bridges and major projects: $110 billion • Passenger and freight rail: $66 billion • Public transit: $39 billion • Airports: $25 billion • Ports and waterways: $17 billion • Electric vehicles: $15 billion • Road safety: $11 billion • Reconnecting communities: $1 billion • Electricity infrastructure: $73 billion • Broadband: $65 billion • Water infrastructure, including lead pipe replacement: $55 billion • Resiliency and Western water storage: $50 billion • Environmental remediation: $21 billion Total: $548 billion A few of these categories might be called infrastructure-adjacent rather than pure infrastructure, such as road safety and environmental remediation. But even if you set those two categories aside, roughly 94% of the spending is allocated to categories that are pretty clearly infrastructure — not the 10% Good said. The bill will provide Good’s home state of Virginia $7 billion for highway repairs and more than $537 million for bridge work over the next five years, according to White House estimates.  Why does Good say only 10% of the money is going to ""true infrastructure?"" We asked his office three times for an explanation but did not get one. Good is not alone in making the 10% claim. PolitiFact National recently gave a Pants of Fire to Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., for a similar comment. She said in the bill ""only 10% is actual infrastructure."" Funding for airports, ports, waterways, broadband, the electric grid and drinking water systems are ""not only infrastructure but critical infrastructure,"" Robert Greer, an associate professor in public service and administration at the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government and Public Service, told PolitiFact National in April.  Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, agreed. ""There is no reason to exclude traditional infrastructure categories — transportation, water resources, energy, and telecommunications — when assessing"" Biden’s agenda, Tomer said in April. ""For decades, and in some cases centuries, the federal government has supported direct investment in these physical capital systems and related policies like workforce development and planning grants."" Good said that in the infrastructure bill that just passed the House, ""only 10% is true  infrastructure."" This is a version of a Republican talking point that was inaccurate months ago and has been rendered even more inaccurate since then. Because Biden and congressional Democrats split their agenda into an infrastructure-only bill and a separate measure that deals with social safety-net spending, the bill that passed the House was almost entirely pure infrastructure spending.

Jim Renacci says that Betty Sutton ""gutted Medicare by $500 billion"" with her vote for health care reform
","
Truth is the first casualty of war, it has often been said, and truth -- or factual accuracy -- often goes down first in the talking points of political campaigns.
And talking points never die. They just keep spinning.

PolitiFact Ohio recently noted that Rep. Betty Sutton was using a claim that PolitiFact National named as its ""Lie of the Year"" when she said Rep. Jim Renacci ""voted repeatedly to end Medicare.""

Sutton, a Democrat, and Renacci, a Republican, are both incumbents facing each other in November in the new 16th Congressional District.

Renacci voted for measures that would significantly change Medicare as we know it, but would not end it. PolitiFact, like our friends at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker, rated the claim used by Sutton as False.

In our research, however, we found that Renacci's campaign website using another popular talking point about health care. Sutton, the website said,  ""gutted Medicare by $500 billion"" when she voted for the health care reform that is formally known as the Affordable Care Act  and informally called Obamacare.

PolitiFact has examined the claim that health care reform cuts Medicare by $500 billion on a number of occasions, including once when Renacci said it at a town hall meeting early in 2011. We rated that one Mostly False.

We asked Renacci's campaign how he backs up the statement and the amped-up use of ""gutted.""

About ""cuts,"" they responded that ""it has been widely reported that these changes to Medicare are real, and the use of the term 'cut' has been used in analyses done by numerous media outlets including CNN, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Daily News.""

Health care reform does, by definition, make changes. But the use of ""cuts"" in every instance was journalistic shorthand describing a complicated piece of legislation. It is important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, as Renacci and the law’s foes make it sound. Instead, it reduces the projected growth in Medicare spending, by about $500 billion over a 10-year period. That's about 7 percent of what Medicare was projected to cost over that decade.

The total projected cost of Medicare over that decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is $7.1 trillion, even with the reduced growth in spending.

Medicare spending will still increase. That's a big difference.

Renacci's campaign said the word ""gutted"" was used ""because it accurately reflects what the real-life and real-dollar impact of what this law will do to seniors.""
Webster’s New World College Dictionary’s applicable definitions for ‘gut’ are to destroy the interior of, as by fire, or to remove the intestines from or eviscerate.

In support of the word ""gutted,"" the campaign cited a report that 20 million people, including seniors, could lose their current coverage under the new law. But that report, released in March by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that provides economic and budgetary analysis to Congress, dealt with people who get health insurance through work. It didn’t even apply to Medicare.  

Changes planned to the Medicare Advantage, which the Renacci camp also cited, would phase out payments for extra benefits not available under traditional Medicare. That’s not gutting Medicare.

Since 2010, PolitiFact has examined repeated claims by politicians and interest groups that the health care reform bill would cut Medicare by $500 billion. Each time the claim was found to be Mostly False or False, depending on the specific wording.

In this case Renacci’s website claims Sutton’s support of health care reform was a vote that ""gutted Medicare by $500 billion.""  

There is an element of truth in this claim from Renacci: the health reform law is forecast to cause less spending on Medicare than what was previously forecast. But that spending reduction is a result of slowing growth so that less is spent in the long run, not cutting out traditional Medicare benefits.

Those are critical facts missing from Renacci’s claim.

On the Truth-O-Meter, this claim rates Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AAE600>],/factchecks/2012/may/21/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-betty-sutton-gutted-medicare-500-/

Rep. Jon Runyan claims Medicare “will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it""
","
Do nothing, U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan said, and the nearly 50-year-old Medicare program will vanish in eight years.

Runyan, a Republican representing parts of southern New Jersey, sounded that alarm during a May 4 interview with Michael Aron on NJTV’s ""On the Record.""

""I was elected to make those hard (decisions) and have those serious discussions, and kicking the can down the road and not having those discussions and putting ideas out there on how to solve them, and how to actually preserve these programs for future generations, ‘cause as we sit right now, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it,"" Runyan said.

Medicare -- which provided healthcare coverage to 48.7 million Americans in 2011 -- is eight years away from ceasing to exist?

Not at all, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

One of Medicare’s two trust funds is set to run out of assets in 2024, but incoming tax revenues would still cover more than 60 percent of projected costs for decades to follow, according to estimates released in April by the trustees overseeing the funds.

The second trust fund is to remain on solid financial ground indefinitely, the trustees said.

Runyan spokesman Drew Fasoli told us the congressman meant to say that ""‘Medicare as we know it’ would be gone and that as a consequence (there) could be a drop in the level of coverage.""

Now, let’s discuss that fund in financial trouble.

The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund covers Medicare Part A, which includes inpatient care at hospitals. The revenues behind that trust fund primarily come from payroll taxes.

Any surplus revenues are credited to the trust fund in the form of government securities, which represents money the government owes itself. The trust fund also accounts for interest earned on those securities.

Starting in 2008, there haven’t been enough revenues to fully cover Part A costs, leaving officials to make up the difference by redeeming those securities and spending interest earnings. That process is slated to continue until the fund is exhausted in 2024.

Still, even after the HI trust fund is exhausted, tax revenues would still cover a portion of Part A expenses, starting at 87 percent of projected costs in 2024.

""The Trustees project that the share of HI expenditures that can be financed with HI dedicated revenues will decline slowly to 67 percent in 2045, and then rise slowly until it reaches 69 percent in 2086,"" according to the trustees.

It’s worth noting that the HI trust fund has faced a projected insolvency since nearly the time it was created, but lawmakers always have taken steps to prevent that from occurring.

Due to a different type of financing, the accounts within the second fund, known as the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, ""will remain in financial balance for all future years,"" the trustees said.

That trust fund covers Medicare Parts B and D. Part B includes outpatient care and Part D relates to prescription drug coverage. Medicare coverage provided through private health plans -- known as Medicare Part C -- is financed by both trust funds.

The six trustees overseeing both funds include the Secretary of the Treasury; the Secretary of Labor; the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the Commissioner of Social Security; and two other members appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Our ruling

In a May 4 interview on ""On the Record,"" Runyan claimed that ""as we sit right now, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it.""

One of Medicare’s two trust funds is on track to no longer fully cover certain benefits, but the entire program is not facing extinction.

Even after that trust fund is exhausted in 2024, tax revenues would still cover more than 60 percent of projected costs for decades to follow. The second trust fund is to remain financially sound indefinitely.

We rate the statement False.

In Wisconsin recall, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch says challenger Mahlon Mitchell urged boycotts of more than 100 companies
","
The memory might be dim now. But one of the flashpoints in the 2011 fight over public employee unions in Wisconsin was a boycott of businesses that supported Gov. Scott Walker.

The effort was launched in the days before and after Walker signed a bill that sharply curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees.

That was back in March 2011. But in a Milwaukee TV interview broadcast May 13, 2012, less than a month before Wisconsin’s historic recall elections, GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch reignited the boycott issue in the context of one of the recall’s top issues: jobs.

Sitting alongside Mahlon Mitchell, her Democratic challenger, Kleefisch spoke on WISN (Channel 12) about the importance of creating jobs.

Then she turned to Mitchell, who is president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union, and this exchange ensued:

Kleefisch: ""Sir, when you send out a letter encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies as the head of the firefighters union, I don't know how that helps job creation.""

Mitchell: ""That’s just not true, that’s just not true. I didn’t send out a letter to boycott a hundred companies. You show me that letter because that’s not true.""

Kleefisch: ""Sure.""

We’d like to see the letter, too, as we examine what role Mitchell, a political newcomer, played in the boycotts.

Indeed, it was Mitchell’s role as a sharp Walker critic -- and the fact he opposed Walker’s collective bargaining changes even though his union was exempt from them -- that first gave him political prominence.

To back Kleefisch’s statement, Kleefisch campaign manager Rachel Pecor provided a letter that was dated March 10, 2011 and signed by Mitchell and six other public employee union leaders.

The letter was sent to Tom Ellis, president of what was then the Milwaukee-based M&I Bank. M&I has since been acquired by BMO Financial Group.

The letter noted that Ellis was a campaign contributor to Walker. It demanded that M&I Bank publicly oppose Walker’s reform law, which limited most state and local government employees to collectively bargain over wages only.

If M&I didn’t comply, the letter said, the letter signers would ""publicly and formally boycott the goods and services provided by your company.""

M&I clearly is a single business, although it had well over 100 branches in Wisconsin.

Pecor also provided a March 2011 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article reporting that Mitchell and the other signers of the M&I letter made the same demand a day later in a letter to the Kwik Trip convenience store chain.

Kwik Trip is a family owned company with more than 100 stores in Wisconsin.

So, it’s clear that Mitchell signed not one but two boycott letters. Kleefisch claimed they urged boycotts of more than 100 ""companies,"" which isn’t technically correct, although the two targeted companies each had more than 100 business locations.

Pecor also provided a Journal Sentinel article from later in March 2011 indicating that, according to the state chamber of commerce, the boycott had targeted additional businesses; and another Journal Sentinel article reporting that a state employees union was circulating letters to businesses threatening a boycott.

Pecor acknowledged there wasn’t proof that Mitchell had signed any other letters urging boycotts beyond M&I and Kwik Trip. But she argued that the larger boycotts were ""encouraged"" by the Mitchell letters. She also cited a list of more than 100 businesses that, according to the pro-recall Scott Walker Watch group, were targeted for boycotts.

Mitchell campaign spokesman Kevin Benish said Mitchell signed only the two boycott letters because M&I and Kwik Trip had received government aid but mistreated employees. Benish tried to downplay the letters, saying they didn’t actually threaten boycotts, though they clearly did.

Benish said Mitchell didn’t endorse and couldn’t control any boycotts efforts undertaken beyond M&I and Kwik Trip. Asked whether Mitchell opposed any of the other boycott efforts, Benish didn’t provide any evidence that Mitchell had.

Our rating

Kleefisch said Mitchell sent a letter ""encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies.""

Mitchell signed boycott letters to two businesses, each of which had more than 100 locations. Eventually, the boycotts targeted more than 100 individual businesses.

That was the thrust of Kleefisch’s statement, although she overreached by saying Mitchell sent a letter specifically encouraging a boycott of more than 100 companies.

In short, her statement is partially accurate but left out important details -- our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A47FC00>],/factchecks/2012/may/20/rebecca-kleefisch/wisconsin-recall-lt-gov-rebecca-kleefisch-says-cha/

Gov. Haslam, schools merger and new legislation
","
Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam on whether to allow new schools merger legislation before the completion of work by Shelby County’s Transition Planning Commission.

Jan. 12: ""My sense is there is a real good-faith effort being made now to come up with the right plan, and I would like to see that play out before anything else happened legislatively.""

April 2: ""I would just love to see that commission reach the end of their work, come out with a proposal and then let the municipals make a decision. I’ve felt that all along.""

May 8: ""I’ve made my thoughts clear: I really did want to see the commission have a chance to get their plan out and implemented.""

May 9: Haslam signs into law the new state legislation paving the way for Shelby County suburban cities to hold Aug. 2 referendums to create new municipal school districts.

As Shelby County awaited Gov. Bill Haslam’s decision on what to do when new schools legislation reached his desk, the Memphis-dominated Shelby County Board of Commissioners was already considering how it might respond legally after the bill, allowing Aug. 2 referendums on creating new municipal districts, became law.

This despite the fact that Haslam had made statements all year saying he wanted the countywide schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC) to complete its work before any new legislation affecting the merger was enacted. Why the concern over creating a legal strategy to challenge the municipal districts when the governor, who had said he did not want new legislation, had the power to kill the bill with a veto? After all, the legislature had adjourned and speakers of the state House and Senate had said they would not be reconvening, not even to override a veto.

But Commissioner Walter Bailey, one of the longest serving public office-holders in the state, said members of that body held little hope that Haslam would provide the veto that in essence would prevent the municipalities from creating new municipal districts before the TPC had completed its work.

""He indicates his feelings on one hand but I don’t think his actions have been consistent,"" Bailey said.

On May 9, Haslam signed the bill. We decided to look at whether, in so doing, the governor had effectively changed his position on whether to endorse new schools legislation before the schools merger commission had completed its work. This is our first use of the Flip-O-Meter in Tennessee, and it's important to stress this from the Flip-O-Meter description: ""We are not making a value judgement about flip-flopping. Some people say it shows inconsistent principles and lack of backbone. Others say it's just pragmatism and a willingness to compromise.""

Some background is required to understand why this is such a crucial issue for Shelby Countians. Last August, U.S. Dist. Court Judge Samuel ""Hardy"" Mays ruled that Memphis had followed proper legal procedures in surrendering the charter of its special school district. That ""surrender,"" in essence, forced consolidation of Memphis City Schools (MCS) with the suburban Shelby County Schools (SCS) system.

The judge’s ruling also upheld a new state law, called Public Chapter 1, that set up a transition process culminating in the final transfer MCS to the county system in time for the 2013-14 school year. Chapter 1 also included a clause saying that, upon the completion of merger in the summer of 2013, the statewide ban on municipal or special school districts could be lifted in Shelby County.

It took only a few months for the suburban municipalities to put plans in motion to create municipal school districts, with the goal of opening in time for the 2013-14 school year and thus opting out of the merged system. But Haslam, who made one of the 18 appointments to the 21-member schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC), told The Commercial Appeal editorial board in January he wanted the TPC to finish its work before enacting any new legislation that would impact the process.  

""My sense is there is a real good-faith effort being made now to come up with the right plan, and I would like to see that play out before anything else happened legislatively,"" Haslam said.

The suburban push for rapid formation of municipal schools, however, came to a halt in early spring when Tennessee Atty. General Bob Cooper advised that no action could be taken to form municipal districts ""until from and after the beginning of the 2013-14 school year.""

But Senate majority leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, who had authored the suburban-friendly Public Chapter 1 in 2011, had already begun pushing for new legislation that would explicitly allow the suburbs to legally move forward. As Norris moved that new legislation, Haslam on April 2 reiterated his preference for letting the TPC finish its work: ""I would just love to see that commission reach the end of their work, come out with a proposal and then let the municipals make a decision. I’ve felt that all along.""

TPC chairwoman Barbara Prescott, at an April meeting, said that new legislation enabling municipalities to immediately opt out of the merged system qualified as interference with the process.

""I believe we should be able to finish this work under the same legislation that we started,"" Prescott said.

Norris, however, insisted the new legislation was aimed not at interfering with the process but would instead make the merger process less complicated, by allowing everyone to know on the front end whether the municipalities would or would not be part of the new district.

Norris, in the final days of the legislative session, oversaw passage of a bill that, when it became law, would provide for municipal school referendums to be held on Aug. 2. That would allow municipal school board elections in November and lead to a tight but feasible process for starting up in time for the 2013-14 school year.

With the legislature adjourned and the new legislation headed his way, Haslam told reporters it was unlikely he would kill the bill with a veto but again stated his position: ""I’ve made my thoughts clear: I really did want to see the commission have a chance to get their plan out and implemented.""

The past tense indicated where Haslam was headed. In justifying signing the bill or allowing it to become law, Haslam suggested the TPC would be done with its work by June, just ahead of the the July 13 beginning of early voting in the Aug. 2 referendums: ""I think their report will be out in June and hopefully the recommendation and the vote won’t be until August so there will be some window to do that. Sometimes that’s just the way the timing works. In a perfect world I’d love for there to be a little bit more time to consider that.""

On May 9, without public comment, Haslam signed the bill into law.

So a key question here -- maybe the key question -- involves just when the TPC’s ""work"" will be completed. This document from the TPC lays out the timeline, with different deadlines for various committees and target dates for the TPC to pull everything together.

One key date does indeed come in June, as Haslam indicated. By June 14 or June 21, the TPC timeline calls for it to ""finalize draft plan."" However, the documents show that is not the end of the process, and it assumes the ""draft"" plan will undergo significant change. Many more meetings and decisions follow, with a busy four-week ""comment period"" running from June 25 to July 20.

During that comment period, the TPC would engage the public, the unified county school board and the state Department of Education for suggestions about major or minor adjustments and, on July 17, the TPC will hold a session ""to review and approve revisions for incorporation into plan.""

Another three-week comment session will follow, again including several TPC meetings, again providing for feedback from the school board and the state. On Aug. 9, the TPC would meet, make ""live edits to finalize plan"" and then, finally, vote on  ""final approval of plan."" At that point, the plan would be submitted to the school board ""for up or down approval"" and to the state ""for endorsement by mid August.""

So there will be a ""draft plan"" by mid-June, as Haslam suggested, but the TPC’s work will be far from complete. Indeed, early voting will begin four days ahead of the TPC even giving final approval to the ""draft plan."" A final official plan will not get a vote by the full TPC until Aug. 9 -- at which point suburban municipalities will have already voted to on whether to create their own districts. And even then, the school board and state must give their approvals before it becomes final.

It is understandable why Haslam, a Republican governor, would feel compelled to sign legislation strongly favored by Republican-dominated suburbs in Shelby County. It may even, as Norris contends, ultimately be the best thing for the county and the state. 
But, by not exercising the veto power that would have killed the bill, the governor acted contrary to his earlier statements that no new schools legislation should be enacted before the schools merger team had completed its work.

On the Flip-O-Meter, Haslam earns a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C215E80>],/factchecks/2012/may/20/bill-haslam/gov-haslam-schools-merger-and-new-legislation/

R.I. congressional candidate John Matson says U.S. Rep. James Langevin is still paying off debt from his 1994 campaign for secretary of state
","
Political campaigns cost a lot of money. But is Rep. James Langevin, who has been a congressman since 2001, really still trying to pay off debt from campaigns for his previous job, Rhode Island secretary of state?

That’s what John O. Matson, who is running against Langevin in the Sept. 11 Democratic primary, contended during the April 26 taping of ""State of the State,"" a public access television program that aired May 5 and 6.

""Jimmy Langevin is having a fundraiser on the 3rd to retire the debt from his campaign for secretary of state, which was 12 years ago. How can anybody not pay his debts from 12 years ago? Because the Ethics Committee has no power,"" Matson said. ""They need to be in power to make people pay up, you know, when they do something wrong. Here we are 12 years later. I got the invitation today. He's holding it to retire the debt from his secretary of state's run. Now, why wasn't it paid? The Ethics Commission would take care of that.""

We're not sure why the Ethics Commission -- which has nothing to do with campaign financing -- could resolve that issue. But we were curious whether a six-term congressman is still paying off debts for campaigns he ran when Bill Clinton was president, Regis was with Kathie Lee, and America Online was the big dog of the Internet.

When we called Matson, he sent us a copy of the invitation for ""a reception in honor of Congressman Jim Langevin to retire debt from his Secretary of State Campaign."" (Matson got the date wrong. It was April 30 at Luigi's Restaurant in Johnston.)

We called Langevin's office, where spokesman Jonathon Dworkin confirmed that the congressman is still raising money to cover his secretary of state campaign.

Here's why.

When he first ran for secretary of state, in 1994, Langevin loaned his campaign $280,000. Candidates commonly loan money to their campaigns. He held the office until 2000, when he was elected to Congress.

In 2006, Langevin decided to recover his money. He asked some of his congressional colleagues to donate. They did, over five years, giving a total of $63,500.

The congressman had a 2006 letter from the Rhode Island Board of Elections' chief auditor at the time, Henry Johnson, saying such contributions were legal.

But the board itself, when it learned in 2011 how the contributions were being handled, said Johnson wasn't authorized to make that determination and, more importantly, Johnson was wrong. Rhode Island law says that only campaign committees legally recognized in Rhode Island can make contributions to a Rhode Island candidate.

Later that year, Langevin agreed to  pay the board $127,000 -- forfeiting the $63,500 and paying a penalty in the same amount of $63,500. It was the largest judgment in the board’s history.

Richard Thornton, director of campaign finance at the Rhode Island Board of Elections, said that as of the end of March, Langevin's state campaign fund still owes Langevin $107,600.

As for the $127,000, Langevin has been paying it off in installments, Thornton said. Currently, $47,625 remains and payments of $15,875 are due on June 30, Sept. 30 and Dec. 31. The money must come from Langevin personally, not his campaign.

Finally, it should be noted, to avoid confusion, that this fundraising is separate from the fundraising Langevin is doing to get reelected to Congress. His most recent federal report shows that he raised $609,000 during the current election cycle and his campaign had $276,251 cash on hand.

Our ruling

Congressional candidate John O. Matson said Rep. James Langevin is still trying to raise money to cover the costs of the campaign he ran for secretary of state 12 years ago.

That statement, by itself, makes Langevin sound like a deadbeat, especially when Matson refers to ""debts,"" which suggests that more than one person is owed money. In fact, the money Langevin’s campaign owes is not to other people, but to one individual -- Langevin himself. Eighteen years ago, the candidate loaned $280,000 to his campaign. In 2006, he tried to get that money back, running afoul of state election laws.

There's a big difference between owing money to others and trying to recoup funds you loaned to your own campaign, especially when Langevin is under no obligation to ever pay himself back in the first place.

So Matson is correct in saying that Langevin is still trying to pay off debt racked up while running for secretary of state, but his statement leaves out important facts that might give voters a very different impression. So we'll give him a Half True.

Did Mitt Romney flip-flop on the economic stimulus?
","
During his 2012 presidential campaign, Mitt Romney has been no fan of the stimulus Democrats passed in 2009. On the third anniversary of its passage, Romney issued a news release titled, ""Three Years Later, Obama's Stimulus is Still Failing.""

Democrats contend Romney has flip-flopped on it.

On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos -- a 30-second version and a four-minute version -- that claimed he had flipped on several issues, including the stimulus:
   
On-screen text: ""Opposed the stimulus.""
   
Video clip of Romney: ""I have never supported the president's Recovery Act, alright -- the stimulus. No time, nowhere, nohow.""
   
On-screen text: ""After he was for it.""
   
Different video clip of Romney: ""I think there is need for economic stimulus.""
   
When we asked the DNC for citations for these clips when the ad was released, they responded that the first (""I have never supported ..."") was from a town hall at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., on Sept. 28, 2011, and the second (""I think there is a need ..."") from a Romney appearance on CNN’s Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer on Jan. 4, 2009.
   
We noticed that the CNN interview -- when Romney said, ""I think there is need for economic stimulus"" -- took place before Obama had been sworn into office and therefore before there was much detail about it.
   
The transcript indicated Romney was talking in general terms.
   
Blitzer said that Obama, then president-elect, was ""talking about a $750 billion economic stimulus package. He wants it to be passed as soon as possible. It's unclear if whether it can be passed before he's inaugurated on January 20th. What do you think about this proposal?""
   
Romney replied, ""Well, I frankly wish that the last Congress (had) dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president could have signed that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time. And that's one of the reasons why I think a stimulus program is needed.""
   
He continued, ""I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies. But let's not make this a Christmas tree of all of the favors for various politicians who have helped out the Obama campaign, giving them special projects. That would be wrong. You'll see Republicans fight that tooth and nail if that happens. Let's do what's right for the economy, and let's not do what's a political expedient move."" 
Our ruling 
It’s misleading to say that Romney flip-flopped on supporting ""the president's Recovery Act."" At the time of the CNN interview, no Obama stimulus bill had been introduced, much less enacted. With such complex bills, the devil’s in the details.

But before Obama took office, Romney had spoken in favor of a stimulus -- particularly if the stimulus in question had been passed when a Republican was in the White House. We rate this a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000002809755F100>],/factchecks/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-didnt-flip-flop-obama-stimulus/

Did Mitt Romney flip-flop on TARP?
","
The Troubled Asset Relief Program -- the ""TARP"" program that was supposed to stabilize the financial markets -- has not been popular with conservatives. During the Republican presidential primary, most candidates attacked it.

But the Democratic National Committee says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on it.

On Nov. 28, 2011, the DNC released two videos -- a 30-second version and a four-minute version -- that said Romney flipped on several issues, including TARP.
       
About three minutes into the four-minute version, the word ""TARP"" appears on screen. Then Romney is shown in a split-screen view with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto.
   
""TARP got paid back and it kept the financial system from collapsing,"" Romney says.
   
""So you feel it was well worth it?"" Cavuto asks.
   
""Well, it was the right thing to do,"" Romney answers.
   
Cut to another video clip, and we hear Romney say, ""TARP ought to be ended."" Rewind, then again, ""TARP ought to be ended.""
   
Sounds contradictory, right? We checked it out.

We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did.
   
A fact sheet provided by the DNC tells us the source of the video clips. The first thing to note is that the statement in which Romney appears to support TARP was made after his ""ought to be ended"" clip.
   
So does that mean Romney was originally against TARP, and then he was for it? Not exactly.
   
We researched what Romney has said about TARP over the last four years and found that his position has largely remained unchanged.
   
• In March 2009, Romney told Reuters, ""The TARP program, while not transparent and not having been used as wisely it should have been, was nevertheless necessary to keep banks from collapsing in a cascade of failures. You cannot have a free economy and free market if there is not a financial system. … The TARP program was designed to keep the financial system going, to keep money circulating in the economy, without which the entire economy stops and you would really have an economic collapse.""
   
• A December 2009 clip shows how the DNC plucked the ""TARP ought to be ended"" quotation and distorted his position. His complete statement, in answer to a question by CNN’s John King about how to get the economy going, was, ""And by the way, TARP has served its purpose. TARP ought to be ended. We've got hundreds of billions of dollars there that is being used as a slush fund by Secretary (Timothy) Geithner and the Obama administration. Stop the TARP recklessness at this point and get ourselves back to creating jobs by encouraging businesses to grow, expand their capital expenditures and hire.""
   
• In January 2010, Romney appeared on Fox and had even more positive things to say about TARP: ""That was an investment made to try and keep a collapse of our entire financial system from occurring,""   
   
• In a Republican primary debate in October 2011, Romney said, ""My experience tells me that we were on the precipice, and we could have had a complete meltdown of our entire financial system, wiping out all the savings of the American people. So action had to be taken. Was it perfect? No. Was it well implemented? No, not particularly. Were there some institutions that should not have been bailed out? Absolutely. Should they have used the funds to bail out General Motors and Chrysler? No, that was the wrong source for that funding. But this approach of saying, look, we're going to have to preserve our currency and maintain America -- and our financial system is essential.""

Our ruling
   
The DNC portrayed Romney as having flip-flopped on his support for TARP. But the statements the DNC chose for the ad echo what Romney has said on the topic all along -- that a Wall Street bailout was necessary to prevent a financial calamity, but the way the money was administered was poor. We rate it No Flip.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AD37C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/did-mitt-romney-flip-flop-tarp/

Did Mitt Romney flip-flop on gun control?
","
Mitt Romney has at times had an awkward relationship with firearms, as when he said during the 2008 Republican presidential primary that his hunting experience generally involved ""small varmints.""

But has he flip-flopped on gun policy?

We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did.

Romney’s statements on gun restrictions before he became governor

In 1994, Romney challenged Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and lost. In 2002, he ran successfully for governor of Massachusetts.
   
During his campaign against Kennedy, Romney supported two gun control measures -- the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. Both were strongly opposed by most gun-rights advocates.
   
In a July 1994 question-and-answer session with voters arranged by the Boston Herald, Romney ""reaffirmed"" his support for both measures. ""I don't think (the waiting period) will have a massive effect on crime, but I think it will have a positive effect,"" Romney said.
   
In a subsequent interview published on Sept. 23, 1994, Romney said, ""I don't want special-interest groups making this their campaign. I don't want their money. I don't want their help. This is my race."" In the interview, Romney specifically mentioned gun-rights advocates, acknowledging that his stands on the two gun-control measures would put him at odds with such groups.
   
""That's not going to make me the hero of the NRA,"" he said, referring to the National Rifle Association. ""I don't line up with a lot of special interest groups.""

Then, in his 2002 race for governor, Romney said during a debate against against Democrat Shannon O'Brien, ""We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them.""

In both cases, Romney expressed views favorable to certain kinds of gun-control laws. This is not too surprising, since he was running for statewide office in Massachusetts, which tends to be more favorable toward those laws than more rural parts of the country.

Romney’s views on an assault-weapons ban as governor

In 2004, in the middle of his single four-year term as governor, Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense,"" the Globe quoted Romney as saying. ""They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.""
   
Despite that provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry firearms. The Globe reported that during the 2008 campaign, Romney described the bill as a ""consensus measure"" and a ""positive step.""

Not long after Romney signed the bill, Romney appeared on the Aug. 4, 2004, edition of the Fox News program Hannity and Colmes. Guest co-host Pat Halpin asked Romney about the existing federal assault weapons ban, which was then on a path to expiring due to intentional Republican inaction. ""So are you in favor of that ban being extended or do you want to see it lapse?""
   
Romney responded, ""I believe the people should have the right to bear arms, but I don't believe that we have to have assault weapons as part of our personal arsenal. … In my state I just signed a piece of legislation extending the ban on certain assault weapons in our state.""
   
Halpin continued to prod. ""Governor, would you like to see that extended again on the federal level, as well?"" she asked.
   
Romney replied, ""It very well may be. In our state what we did is we got both sides of this issue to come together, because we relaxed a number of things, allowing people who hadn't been able to get weapons in the past to be able to purchase those. … There are hunters in the NRA and the gun owners' action league (who) backed the legislation that said, ‘Look, let's protect our citizens from dangerous assault weapons, but let's also make … regular weapons more available to our citizens.’ And we made a compromise that works.""
   
Romney, at that moment, appears to be straddling the issue, arguing that ordinary Americans have the right to bear some types of arms but not assault weapons. He said it ""very well may be necessary"" to extend the federal assault-weapons ban, while adding that he acted on the state ban because it was a compromise that included expansions of other types of gun ownership rules.

Romney’s statements during the 2008 presidential campaign

Romney’s rhetoric on gun control began to shift as he made his first bid for the White House in 2008.

• Addressing a National Rifle Association members by video on Sept. 10, 2007, Romney said, ""I support the Second Amendment as one of the most basic and fundamental rights of every American. It's essential to our functioning as a free society, as are all the liberties enumerated in the Bill of Rights."" He repeated that message later that month at a meeting of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
   
• On the Oct. 21, 2007, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer challenged Romney on the evolution of his gun-control position.
   
Schieffer said, ""You once said, ‘We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts, I support them, I won't chip away at them. I believe they protect us.’ Now you say you are a gun owner. You have joined the National Rifle Association, after saying at one point, ‘I don't line up with the National Rifle Association.’ Why would you join that group?""
   
Romney responded, ""I support the NRA. I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine. But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. ...""

• During a Republican presidential debate on Jan. 24, 2008, in Boca Raton, Fla., fellow Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee challenged Romney on his views about gun control. Romney responded, ""I do support the Second Amendment. And I believe that this is an individual right of citizens and not a right of government. And I hope the Supreme Court reaches that same conclusion.""
   
He continued, ""I also, like the president, would have signed the assault weapon ban that came to his desk. I said I would have supported that and signed a similar bill in our state. It was a bill worked out, by the way, between pro-gun lobby and anti-gun lobby individuals. Both sides of the issue came together and found a way to provide relaxation in licensing requirements and allow more people to have guns for their own legal purposes. And so we signed that in Massachusetts, and I said I would support that at the federal level, just as the president said he would. It did not pass at the federal level. I do not believe we need new legislation.
   
""I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people. But I do not support any new legislation, and I do support the right of individuals to bear arms, whether for hunting purposes or for protection purposes or any other reason. That's the right that people have.""
   
• In a candidate questionnaire during the 2008 primary campaign, the Washington Post asked Romney, ""Do you think tighter restrictions should be in place for those buying a firearm?""
   
Romney answered, ""No. I believe we need to focus on enforcing our current laws rather than creating new laws that burden lawful gun owners. ... I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all federal approach to gun ownership because people keep and use firearms for different reasons. ...""
   
Collectively, Romney’s comments from the 2008 campaign suggest that he heightened his rhetorical support for gun rights, while maintaining some distance from NRA orthodoxy. On actual policies, though, Romney doesn’t appear to have changed his position.

Romney’s statements during the 2012 presidential campaign

Whatever lingering tolerance Romney expressed for gun control in 2008 disappeared in the heat of a contentious 2012 Republican primary.

The issues section of Romney’s website offers a clear endorsement of gun rights:

""The Second Amendment is essential to the functioning of our free society. Mitt strongly supports the right of all law-abiding Americans to exercise their constitutionally protected right to own firearms and to use them for lawful purposes, including hunting, recreational shooting, self-defense, and the protection of family and property. Like the majority of Americans, Mitt does not believe that the United States needs additional laws that restrict the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.""

The website even touts the bill Romney signed as governor but ignores the assault-weapons portion. ""As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt was proud to support legislation that expanded the rights of gun owners. He worked hard to advance the ability of law-abiding citizens to purchase and own firearms, while opposing liberal desires to create bureaucracy intended to burden gun owners and sportsmen.""

Romney offered a similar message in an address to the national convention of the NRA in St. Louis on April 13, 2012:

""We need a president who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners. President Obama has not; I will. We need a president who will stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and those seeking to protect their homes and their families. President Obama has not; I will. And if we are going to safeguard our Second Amendment, it is time to elect a president who will defend the rights President Obama ignores or minimizes. I will.""

Our ruling

During his campaigns for statewide Massachusetts office, Romney openly spoke of his support for -- to use his words from 2002 -- ""tough gun laws."" As recently as the 2008 Republican primary, Romney said ""I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA."" But since then, his pro-gun rhetoric has become sharper and virtually all nuance was erased. He even touted the bill he signed in Massachusetts by scrubbing any reference to the provisions banning assault weapons.

Still, while Romney’s rhetoric has moved distinctly in the NRA’s direction, it’s not clear that his policy positions have changed. This is partly because Romney, even in the 1994 campaign didn’t take a full-blown, pro-gun-control stand. And even now, as his rhetoric has become more pro-gun, Romney has never gone so far as to specifically renounce his prior positions, such as his signing of the 2004 Massachusetts law, which at the time was billed as a compromise measure. So Romney’s shift has been more on the rhetorical level than substantive. He earns the rating of Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACF540>],/factchecks/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-exhibits-marked-change-gun-rhetoric/

In attack on Alan Grayson, Chamber says Florida judge ruled ""Obamacare unconstitutional""
","
Remember that time when former Florida congressman Alan Grayson quipped on the House floor that the Republican health care plan plan was ""don’t get sick"" and, if you do, ""die quickly""?

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sure does.

The business lobbying group is using Grayson’s words against him in an attack ad. The commercial is part of a broader Chamber campaign targeting Democrats over their support of ""Obamacare,"" including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. (Read our fact-checks of the Nelson ad here and here).

This commercial compares Grayson to a literal broken record (remember records?) entitled Reckless, featuring House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The ad repeats his explosive lines from floor debate.

Narrator: ""Reckless politicians gave us Obamacare. Alan Grayson was one of Obamacare’s biggest cheerleaders. He’d say anything.""

Grayson: ""Die quickly. The Republicans want you to die quickly.""

Narrator: ""Now we learn Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage.""

Another record appears with Grayson’s face on it, labeled ""Obamacare Unconstitutional.""

Narrator: ""And a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional. Will Alan Grayson change his tune on Obamacare, or be the same broken record?""

PolitiFact Florida already fact-checked the chamber’s claim about 20 million people losing their current coverage in our review of the Nelson ad. We rated it a Pants on Fire, because it cherry-picks a worst-case-scenario statistic and strongly suggests seniors would lose Medicare coverage.

Here, we’re checking the ad’s other claim that ""a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional."" The Chamber includes this claim in another ad against Democrat Lois Frankel, running in Florida’s 22nd District.

Grayson is running in Florida's new District 9 seat, which includes part of Orlando and parts of the district he lost in 2010 to U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster. At this time, Grayson is the only Democrat in the race. 

From this moment on

Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law May 23, 2010. It’s been a long and winding legal path ever since.

At issue, for most plaintiffs, is the individual mandate, which requires all citizens to buy health insurance and takes effect in 2014.

The ACA Litigation Blog, launched by Santa Clara University law professor Brad Joondeph, keeps a spreadsheet of all lawsuits against the reforms on its website. By its count, 31 parties have filed lawsuits against the law, 12 of which have been dropped. Eight have reached the Supreme Court.

On the same day Obama signed the law, then-Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum filed a lawsuit on behalf of 13 states challenging the law. (Ultimately, 26 governors and attorneys general joined the suit.)

Two months later, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli sued the government over the law’s implementation. At the end of 2010, a Virginia district judge appointed by Ronald Reagan ruled the individual mandate unconstitutional.

Florida re-entered the picture on Jan. 31, 2011. Pensacola-based U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson went further than the Virginia judge, declaring in Florida v. HHS that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and ""inextricably bound"" to the rest of the law -- meaning the whole thing needed to be tossed out because of that faulty provision.

""The act, like a defectively designed watch, needs to be redesigned and reconstructed by the watchmaker,"" Vinson wrote in his opinion.

Vinson’s decision on the individual mandate was upheld by a three-person panel at the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Aug. 12, 2011, though they reversed his recommendation to throw out the law. The case then moved up to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Then a district judge in Pennsylvania ruled against the mandate on Sept. 13, 2011, but said the rest of the law could stand.

This brings us to the first misleading aspect of the claim. The tone and visuals of the commercial may lead viewers to think that because a Florida judge ruled it unconstitutional, the fate of Obamacare has been decided. 

What the commercial doesn’t mention is that the Supreme Court has the final say.

The court heard three days of oral arguments in March and could release a verdict by the end of June.

Mandate upheld elsewhere

Judicial decisions on various challenges have not all been negative on the individual mandate.

Three federal district judges -- all appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton -- have upheld the mandate since 2010. A judge in Detroit did so in an Oct. 7, 2010, decision. The next month, a federal judge in Virginia followed suit over a challenge from Liberty University. And on Feb. 22, 2012, a district judge in Washington also deemed the individual mandate constitutional.

And even though the U.S. Appeals panel in Atlanta isn’t keen on the insurance requirement, its counterpart in Cincinnati went the other way.

A Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals panel, by 2-to-1 approval, declared the provision a ""valid exercise of legislative power by Congress under the Commerce clause"" on June 29, 2011. That was consistent with a lower court’s decision on a challenge by the conservative Thomas More Law Center.

Fighting back

Grayson pushed back against the Chamber ad in a May 17, 2012, Orlando Sentinel column. He referenced a D.C. newspaper report saying Republicans have no plan to present a health care alternative this year.

""Which means that after almost four years of debate, the national Republican health care plan still is this: Don't get sick,"" he said, sticking by his old catchphrase.

He turned the commercial of ""brazen lies"" into a fundraising appeal to supporters, asking them to contribute to his ""Fight Back"" Fund.

Our ruling

The U.S. Chamber's ad says, ""A Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional."" It’s true that a Florida judge ruled parts of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. But the chamber fails to acknowledge that other judges have upheld it, and that the Supreme Court will have the final say this summer.

Their statement is accurate but needs additional clarification. We rule it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FD4B80>],/factchecks/2012/may/18/us-chamber-commerce/attack-against-alan-grayson-chamber-points-florida/
"['Crime', 'Wisconsin', 'Graeme Zielinski']","
Wisconsin Dem spokesman Zielinski says Gov. Walker is helping defend man accused of ‘boy rape’
","On May 15, Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski sent out dozens of tweets to his 1,423 followers. The tweets had a recurring theme: Republican Gov. Scott Walker is using his criminal defense fund to help defend a man accused of child sexual enticement.

Among the nearly 20 tweets on the subject that day, many were framed as rhetorical questions, such as ""DEAR WISCONSIN: Your Governor, @GovWalker, may be bankrolling the criminal defense of a top @WisGOP who tried to rape underage boys.""

The most jarring message was this one:

""@MarkBellingShow, @JerryBaderShow, liar@SykesCharlie, @VickiMcKenna-you guys shud hold fundraiser 4 @GovWalker defense of boy rape.""

The tweet, in which Zielinski attempts to draw several conservative radio talk show hosts into the fray, flatly states Walker is defending someone accused of a sex assault involving a child. Indeed, the way it was stated it could be read as if Walker has taken a broader position in defense of ""boy rape.""

Wow. We’ll need more than 140 characters to put this one in context:

What has happened so far

Walker established a criminal defense fund in early 2012 in response to a John Doe criminal investigation by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm into the actions of former Walker aides when he was Milwaukee county executive. In April 2012, Walker transferred $60,000 from his campaign account into the defense fund.

As of May 2012,  five people have been charged in the probe, which is ongoing.

Walker’s June 5, 2012, recall opponent, Democrat Tom Barrett, and the state Democratic Party have demanded that Walker explain more about his role in the investigation, which is done in a cloak of secrecy -- hence the name, John Doe. They want to know why he established the fund, and what and who the money is being used for. It is unclear if Walker has testified, but if he had he’d be precluded from saying so under the rules.

Among those facing charges is Brian Pierick of Sun Prairie, who was charged with two felonies -- child enticement and exposing his genitals -- in connection with text messages he allegedly exchanged with a 17-year-old Waukesha boy in 2010. Pierick has pleaded not guilty.

Pierick was not a paid Walker aide, but at one point was listed as the official registrant for the Walker campaign’s website. Pierick was an office assistant at the state Department of Public Instruction dealing with education for homeless children and youth. He was fired from the civil service position shortly after he was arrested.

Pierick is the domestic partner and business partner of Timothy Russell, who was a top aide to Walker when he was county executive. Russell has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of embezzling $23,000 from a veterans group and a political candidate.

A criminal complaint says Pierick was acting with a co-conspirator in attempting to lure a 17-year-old into Russell's van for a sexual encounter. The complaint says Russell and Pierick used the screen name ""Walker04"" to procure online porn involving young boys.

In his tweets, Zielinski again and again links Walker to Pierick and the sex crimes charges. But they were not what prompted the investigation. Prosecutors came across them as they were looking into the embezzlement allegations.

We asked Zielinski to explain the claim that Walker was helping with Pierick’s defense on the sex crimes charges.

He responded via email: ""The criminal complaint against Brian Pierick, who is a known associate of Scott Walker and a campaign functionary as well, alleges serious crimes. It is a serious and legitimate question for Scott Walker to answer -- is he paying for the criminal defense of a man accused of these serious crimes.""

But that’s not what Zielinski said. His tweet claimed Walker is raising money to defend Pierick. And Zielinski provided no evidence of that.

Walker has not responded to questions about how or for whom he is using the defense fund. Walker spokesman Ciara Matthews had no comment about Zielinski’s tweets.

What the law says

State law says candidates can establish a criminal defense fund and that the money can be used for ""expenditures supporting or defending the candidate or agent, or any dependent of the candidate or agent, while that person is being investigated for, or while the person is charged with or convicted of a criminal violation"" of campaign laws.

Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel for the state Government Accountability Board, said state law was vague about who would be considered an ""agent.""

""An agent is a very broad term,"" he said. ""It becomes a question of fact which people can debate endlessly.""

Kennedy said he was not able to discuss specifics about the establishment of the Walker defense fund. Walker is not required to publicly disclose how or on whom the fund is spent, he said.

The broad definition of an ""agent, or a dependent, could be argued to Pierick. But that doesn’t mean Walker has spent anything to help him. And the same same could apply to literally hundreds of people. At no point has the governor defended Pierick or given any indication that he is coming to Pierick’s defense.

Pierick is charged with two felony sex crimes involving underage males -- not campaign law or government work  violations. And he’s hardly a ""top Republican,"" as described by Zielinski in one tweet

Pierick’s lawyer, Maura McMahon, is with the state public defender’s office -- paid for by taxpayers because the court has determined that Pierick can’t afford to pay a private lawyer. No obvious Walker defense help there.

The Zielinski tweets are loaded with innuendo that’s not supported in any way. He’s using social media shorthand in a brazen effort to link Walker to defending Pierick amid the allegations of sex crimes. He suggests or imply that the governor supports or defends ""boy rape.""

Repeated postings with variations on the same theme are meant to stir attention, with the hope that others will repeat and retweet the claim, and that it will show up in searches.

In this case, what’s being recycled is a hot, ridiculous mess … which we call Pants on Fire. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's website.)",[<zip object at 0x000002809706D3C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/18/graeme-zielinski/wisconsin-democratic-party-spokesman-zielinski-wi/
"['Tennessee', 'Congress', 'Beth Harwell']","
Tennessee House Speaker says Congressmen don't have to be present for debates or votes
","
Since the Tennessee General Assembly installed electronic voting systems in the House and Senate chambers more than 20 years ago, lawmakers have often cast votes for an absent colleague – a practice that has been nicknamed ""ghost voting."" The old custom got some fresh attention in the last days of the 2012 session when a Nashville television station, WTVF, filmed state representatives using long sticks to sit at their desks and punch voting buttons on the desks of other members who were missing.

Subsequently, House Speaker Beth Harwell offered commentary on the matter in an interview with the station, saying she doesn't really condone the practice but it is permitted under legislative rules. That's true. But then the speaker went on to say that,""We're not like Congress. In Congress, they don't even have to be on the floor for debates or votes. I require my members to be on the floor.""

Was the speaker speaking the truth in contrasting Congress with the General Assembly in ghost voting?

We consulted the U.S. House of Representatives rules, and  rule III, section 2, states:

(a)   A Member may not authorize any other person to cast the vote of such Member or record the presence of such Member in the House or the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union.
(b)   No other person may cast a Member’s vote or record a Member’s presence in the House or the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union.

So U.S.House rules explicitly prohibit ""ghost voting.""

Recorded and roll call votes are normally taken by electronic device, and each member is provided with a personalized Vote-ID Card which can be used to vote electronically. A number of vote stations are positioned around the House chamber. Each vote station has a slot into which the voting card is inserted and buttons marked ""yea,"" ""nay,"" ""present."" The stations have an ""open"" indicator, which is lit when a vote is in progress and the system is ready to accept votes.

The state House procedure is far more informal. There is no voting card. Each member's desk is equipped with three buttons – green for voting ""yes,"" red for voting ""no"" and blue for abstaining or answering a roll call.

The ""roll call"" votes come at the start and end of each House session. And being present for a roll call has consequences – those voting present automatically get their $174 daily expense payment, called ""per diem."" Members are allowed to vote a colleague present if he or she is absent from the chamber at the moment. Indeed, one legislator – state Rep. Lois DeBerry, D-Memphis – refunded her ""per diem"" payment after the WTVF video aired, acknowledging she wasn't present on a day when a colleague voted for her.

State House rules permit one member to vote for another, so that legislators can take a short break to visit the restroom, get a sandwich, meet with a visiting constituent or perhaps a lobbyist outside the chamber. But the speaker can order that all members be at their desks to vote. This is done by the speaker declaring the chamber ""under the rule."" Harwell estimates that the House is ""under the rule,"" meaning a member must be seated at his or her desk to vote, about half the time. The rest of the time, it's OK to push another member's voting button -- and often that's done on non-controversial or procedural matters.

On the other hand, Congress is far more informal than the Tennessee General Assembly when it comes to being present for debates.

We’ve sat through enough congressional proceedings to know firsthand that House members are not always present during debates. Often, the only lawmakers in the House chamber during a floor debate are those representatives who are speaking on the issue or waiting to speak.

There are a number of reasons why there are a lot of empty seats in the House chamber during debates. For one, legislative committees often meet while the House is in session and a floor debate is taking place. Lawmakers can’t be two places at once, so unless they have a particular interest in the topic being debated on the House floor, they go to their committee meetings instead.

House floor proceedings also are beamed live into the offices of each member via closed-circuit television. Lawmakers often monitor floor debates from their offices and head to the House floor when debate begins on a topic on which they have an interest or want to speak.

At the state House, members are generally required to be in the chamber during floor sessions – with the exception of the permitted and presumably brief absences where ""ghost voting"" occurs. That's the case even when legislators embark on lengthy ""personal orders,"" wherein guest speakers make sometimes long-winded speeches and are honored by the reading of a resolution.

In contrast to Washington practice, legislative committees in Nashville do not meet when floor sessions are underway. Debates, both on the floor and in committees, are face-to-face, back-and-forth encounters with multiple members joining in on a hot topic. And only rarely does the speaker move to limit the debate.

So Harwell is correct when she says that members of Congress don't have to be present for debates. But she was mistaken insofar as voting goes.

Kara Watkins, spokeswoman for Harwell, acknowledges the speaker ""misspoke"" by including ""votes"" in the quoted remark and says her intention was to emphasize that Tennessee lawmakers are present on the floor a lot more than their counterparts in Washington.

With that in mind, we rate the speaker's statement Half True.

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Brett Bittner']","
MARTA subsidy claim derailed by facts
","
In a recent Marietta Daily Journal story about opposition to the July 31 regional transportation referendum, the executive director of the Libertarian Party of Georgia took a swipe at MARTA for relying too heavily on taxpayers.

""When you take a look at what MARTA costs to operate, the taxpayers are subsidizing about 80 percent of it for each trip that’s taken, so there are a lot of opportunities there with the money that’s being proposed especially in the transit perspective,"" Brett Bittner said in an article published May 2. 

Bittner told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he came to his conclusion by visiting the MARTA website, looking at the per-trip costs, subtracting the cost of a fare and attributing the rest to the taxpayer.

Transit systems across the nation rely on tax subsidies to operate. But do taxpayers foot the bill for MARTA to that great of an extent?

First, let’s look at what MARTA’s ridership pays into the system.

MARTA has one of the highest fare rates in the nation following a fare hike from $2 to $2.50 per ride last fall. Helped by a recent fare increase, the agency projects fare revenue this year of $130.3 million – 31 percent of its operating costs. Last year, fares covered 29 percent of operating costs.

Simple math says Bittner’s figures are askew. If riders are paying almost a third, taxpayers can’t be subsidizing 80 percent.

""Our Libertarian friend is dead wrong,"" MARTA spokesman Lyle Harris concluded.

But how far off is he? Let’s look at the taxpayer side of the MARTA coin.

The largest part of MARTA’s current $413.8 million in transit costs is paid by local sales tax. MARTA gets $201.2 million from the penny tax collected in Fulton and DeKalb counties and the city of Atlanta. 

On top of this, the federal government kicks in $37.8 million. A sore point for MARTA backers is that the state of Georgia makes no direct contribution to operate the city’s transit service.
In all, MARTA is paying for bus, rail and other services with $239 million in local and federal taxpayer money.

The service rounds out its revenue pie with some other sources of income. Advertising on buses, parking fees and land leases bring the non-taxpayer funds to $152.1 million.
MARTA tapped its reserve fund to plug a $22.7 million hole in its operating budget. Officials say the reserve fund is ""mixed"" with taxes and other revenue, but they said the money pulled for this year’s operating budget comes from the sale of real estate decades ago and some other non-tax sources. If the deficit persists, MARTA may end up pulling more tax money out of reserves to fund transit in coming years. 

With figures in hand, the rest is just math: Taxpayers subsidize 57.8 percent of MARTA’s operating costs.

Ten years ago, fares made up more than a third of MARTA’s budget, and while ridership is down from 2002, that’s not why taxpayers are being asked to foot more of the bill. Fares increased 13 percent in actual dollars from 2002 to 2011, but the service’s operating expenses increased 38 percent. That gap has to be made up somewhere, and Bittner is right about where, even if the exact percentage is off.

""I only looked at the cost per trip and the fare per trip. I didn’t use the ancillary figures in the budget,"" he said. ""We’re still subsidizing over half as taxpayers, especially those of us who live and work in Fulton and DeKalb.""

In rebuttal, Harris points out every mode of transportation – including road building – is subsidized by taxes to some extent.

That argument aside, Bittner was significantly off in assigning 80 percent of the costs of a MARTA trip to the taxpayer, even if he stands by the larger point.

We rate his claim as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F88040>],/factchecks/2012/may/18/brett-bittner/marta-subsidy-claim-derailed-facts/

Sherrod Brown campaign says Josh Mandel opposes the auto industry rescue
","
For all the heat Josh Mandel has taken in this space for things he has said, the Republican state treasurer and U.S. Senate hopeful earns an equal amount of grief for what he won’t say.

Mandel often refuses to offer clear opinions on key issues before Congress, be it the Violence Against Women Act or a bill to keep interest rates from doubling on student loans.

He says he won’t ""cast imaginary votes."" His opponents, namely those supporting Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, say he doesn’t want to be pinned down on topics important to voters.

So PolitiFact Ohio was surprised recently when Brown’s campaign began asserting that Mandel would have voted against the federal loans to rescue automakers Chrysler and General Motors. Brown dialed up the criticism Monday prior to a Mandel event near a GM plant in Lordstown.

A headline on a news release labeled Mandel as ""anti-auto rescue."" In the release, Friends of Sherrod Brown spokeswoman Sadie Weiner said Mandel ""would have voted ‘no’ on the auto rescue despite the fact that it saved Ohio jobs and put middle-class families back to work.""

The claim caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, given Mandel’s trademark stealth. Had we missed a policy stand?

After considerable research and many discussions with both campaigns, we are not convinced.

Brown has been painting his opponent as anti-auto bailout since at least March, when Mandel told The Vindicator, Youngstown’s daily newspaper, that he was developing a plan ""to rescue the auto industry."" To those who thought the industry already had been rescued by the government loans to Chrysler and GM, Mandel’s statement was a head-scratcher.

""I’m not saying the bailout didn’t work,"" Mandel told the paper. But he also said he ""respectfully disagreed"" that it saved the U.S. auto industry. Nowhere in the story is he quoted as saying he would have voted against the loans as a senator.

Nevertheless, Mandel’s opponents pounced. Citing The Vindicator story in late March, the Ohio Democratic Party bashed Mandel in a news release that, among other gripes, stated he ""would have voted to let the auto industry die."" The state party works closely with Brown’s campaign -- so closely that Justin Barasky, the Brown campaign’s communications director and a former party spokesman responded to our questions about the statement at the time.

Barasky referred PolitiFact Ohio to a Toledo Free Press article from March 14 that appeared under the headline ""County Democrats criticize Mandel for opposing auto bailout."" Barasky also pointed us to a statement from U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, a South Carolina conservative who cited Mandel’s support of a ""ban on government bailouts"" when endorsing him in June 2011.

But in the weeks that followed our initial questions, we found no evidence that Mandel himself had ever confirmed he would have voted against the auto bailout. Meanwhile, both the Brown campaign and the Ohio Democratic Party continued with this line of attack.

Mandel could have made it easy on us by simply taking a position -- yea or nay. But true to form, he declined. Furthermore, his campaign communications director, Travis Considine, was adamant that our research was accurate: Mandel had not taken a public stance on the loans.

We followed up with both campaigns last week and again this week as Mandel traveled to the heart of Ohio’s car-manufacturing belt. Barasky emailed us a clip of video footage he said comes from a February meeting with the Tea Party Express near Cincinnati.

""Your United States senator, Sherrod Brown, voted for the Wall Street bank bailout, the largest bailout of Wall Street banks in the history of the United States of America,"" Mandel says from behind a podium in the video. ""If I were there, I would have voted against it.""

Here’s where it gets tricky. The Wall Street bailout is encapsulated by the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a measure Congress passed in October 2008. After the Senate failed to reach a deal on a separate bailout for automakers, President George W. Bush, nearing the end of his administration, allocated TARP funds to Chrysler and GM.

President Barack Obama allocated additional TARP funds to the two companies in 2009. It is important to note, though, that the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, never held an up-or-down vote on a standalone auto bailout.

Brown’s official support for the rescue plan came when he cast a procedural vote to quickly move on a bill that would have given the automakers emergency loans. The motion failed. Brown also voted for TARP, but at the time no TARP money had been reserved for Chrysler or GM.

Barasky argues that Mandel has the benefit of hindsight, and that by declaring he would have voted against the bank bailout, he also is declaring he would have voted against the auto bailout.

When Mandel was in Lordstown this week, a reporter for the Youngstown Business Journal asked about this very conflict. Did Mandel oppose the allocation of TARP funds to the automakers?

Mandel did not answer the question directly.

""When I talk to Democrats, Republicans and independents throughout the Mahoning Valley, I have not come across anyone who supports bailing out Wall Street banks,"" he said. ""I agree with Democrats, Republicans and independents in the Mahoning Valley that it’s dead wrong to bail out the Wall Street banks with our tax dollars.""

So where does all of this put the Brown campaign’s statement on the Truth-O-Meter?

The senator’s re-election team said Mandel ""would have voted ‘no’ on the auto rescue.""

Mandel doesn’t help himself by refusing to take a clear position. A voter who read his comments in The Vindicator would be hard-pressed to determine where he stands on the auto bailout. He indicated he did not think the measure was perfect, but he stopped short of speaking against it.

But PolitiFact Ohio puts the burden of proof on the speaker. And the Brown campaign was unable to show us anything in which Mandel definitively stated he would have voted against rescuing the auto industry.

By virtue of voting against TARP, a position Mandel confirms he would have taken, he would have voted against a bill that eventually benefited the auto industry. Of course in these hypotheticals, Mandel wouldn’t have known that at the time, so it is intellectually dishonest to write him off as anti-auto rescue.

Maybe Mandel will enlighten voters one day with his thoughts on the loans to Chrysler and GM. But for the moment, Brown’s campaign is putting words in Mandel’s mouth and pushing a deceiving line of attack.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2E3C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/18/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-campaign-says-josh-mandel-opposes-au/
"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Neumann']","
Senate candidate Mark Neumann says state Republicans voted to endorse him
","
He finished second in a bid for for the Republican Party of Wisconsin’s endorsement, but that didn’t stop U.S. Senate candidate Mark Neumann from declaring himself top dog in separate fundraising appeals.

""Victory! Republicans by 2 to 1 vote to endorse Mark Neumann on first ballot at GOP convention!,"" a pop-up appeal covering Neumann’s website said. ""Join the Republican Party and conservative activists who voted to endorse Mark.""

That sounds an awful lot like Neumann walked away with the party endorsement -- and on the first ballot.

No mention was made, on the website or in an email fundraising appeal, of the fact that not only did Neumann not win the endorsement --  no candidate reached the 60 percent voting threshhold to claim the prize.

So has down come to mean up?

In the spin zone, yes. But not on the Truth-O-Meter.

Neumann, a businessman and former congressman, finished first in the first of three ballots at the party gathering. Each round of balloting narrowed the four-person field by one candidate. Businessman Eric Hovde dropped off first, then, in a surprise, former Gov. Tommy Thompson fell out.

That left Neumann and Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald in the final runoff.

But neither one passed the 60 percent threshold needed to win the party’s nod and nobody emerged with the endorsement. Fitzgerald actually edged Neumann with 51.5 percent. (We rated a related Fitzgerald claim of a ""win"" at the convention Mostly True)

What about Neumann’s claim of ""victory"" related to the ""2 to 1 vote to endorse"" him.

He argues he won the most telling vote, when all four candidates were on the ballot for delegates, as they will be when facing voters in the September 2012 primary.

In that first round, Neumann had 42 percent, Fitzgerald 21 percent, Thompson 20 percent and Hovde 16 percent.

That’s the 2-to-1 margin, Neumann’s camp says. But that’s only true if you compare his share to any one of his rivals. Neumann didn’t win 65 or 70 percent of the vote, as his ""2-to-1"" claim suggests.

Neumann was the frontrunner on the first two ballots, but his support stalled in the upper 40s, while Fitzgerald’s jumped to the slim majority in the final round.

Neumann never got even a majority, much less 60 percent.

Some observers -- and Neumann’s camp -- say Thompson and Hovde supporters voted tactically with Fitzgerald to deny Neumann the endorsement on later ballots.

It’s clear Neumann had something to crow about. He vanquished Thompson, the frontrunner in the polls, and led the pack on the earliest ballot. But that’s like declaring victory at the first turn and not the finish line.

Neumann was runner-up on the final vote. And it’s highly misleading to say he was ""endorsed"" by delegates when no such endorsement was made.

We rate Neumann’s ""victory"" and ""endorsement"" claim False.

 Senate candidate Jeff Fitzgerald says he scored a ‘win’ in state Republican endorsement contest
","
By his own assessment, Republican Jeff Fitzgerald ""breathed a little new life"" into his U.S. Senate campaign with a strong showing at the May 12, 2012, state GOP convention.

Fitzgerald edged Mark Neumann in a head-to-head race on the final ballot, giving him some badly needed momentum. But the party ultimately did not endorse, because no one received the required 60 percent of the vote.

So did he win the day?

Soon after the vote, Fitzgerald posted on Facebook:

""Thank you everyone for the tremendous support at the Republican Party of Wisconsin Convention and to have won the majority support! Thank you!""

In the days after the convention, he claimed ""a win"" on Twitter and on his Facebook page, citing a Wisconsin Radio Network Web story headlined, ""Fitzgerald climbs to first-place convention finish.""

""ICYMI: Here's an article covering my win at the Republican Party of Wisconsin's State Convention. The same grassroots activists who support Governor Scott Walker supported me because they want to see bold reforms in Washington!""

Fitzgerald, the Assembly Speaker, did not use any form of the word ""endorse"" -- a prudent move since none of the four GOP candidates (Fitzgerald, businessman and former congressman Mark Neumann, former Gov. Tommy Thompson and businessman Eric Hovde) won the state party’s official support.

That set his reaction apart from that of Neumann, who declared ""victory"" despite finishing second in the final vote, while strongly implying he was endorsed. (We rated that claim False.)

Still, even the article cited by Fitzgerald doesn’t go quite as far as calling Fitzgerald’s showing as a ""win.""

Here’s our take on Fitzgerald’s claim.

A first-place showing in the final showdown -- and majority support -- do represent a ""win"" for Fitzgerald. Or, as he tweeted, ""success.""

But the claim needs some clarification in that it was not a formal endorsement -- the prize everyone was seeking.  

We rate it Mostly True.

Crossroads GPS says the health care law raises taxes 18 times on people making less than $250,000
","
The conservative advocacy group Crossroads GPS has a new ad that says President Barack Obama has broken his campaign promises.

The ad says, ""President Obama’s agenda promised so much,"" then recounts several areas where it says Obama broke his promises.

One those points is about taxes. The ad shows video of Obama saying, ""If you are a family making less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes go up.""

The ad’s narrator says, ""Broken: Obamacare raises 18 different taxes. … We need solutions, not just promises."" The text on the screen says, ""$503 billion between 2010 and 2019.""

We’ll be fact-checking the ad’s other claims in separate reports. Here, we’ll look at what the ad says about taxes.

We should note that here at PolitiFact, we consider ourselves experts on the president’s campaign promises. Our Obameter tracks more than 500 campaign promises Obama made during the 2008 campaign, including many promises about taxes.

The health care law and taxes

The ad makes a sweeping claim about taxes that suggests broad increases. It says that the health care law raised 18 different taxes, citing an analysis from the Heritage Foundation.

We know from our previous research on the law that it does in fact raise taxes. But when we looked at the issue in January 2011, we found only 13 measures that could reasonably be considered tax increases. (The other items were mostly new regulations.)

Many of those taxes are aimed at health insurance companies, drug manufacturers, medical device makers or high earners, not people who make less than $250,000, as the ad says. (See our detailed list of taxes in the health care law.)

When we looked at the list with the Crossroads statement in mind, we found only five taxes that might apply to individuals making less than $250,000.

Those taxes include the following:

• Higher federal excise taxes on tobacco.
• A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services.
• Limiting the amount taxpayers can deposit in flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. For people who use the accounts, this could increase their taxable income. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
• Raising the 7.5 percent adjusted gross income floor for the medical expenses deduction to 10 percent. People who would have qualified for the deduction this year would pay more. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.   
• A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided ""Cadillac"" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. This takes effect Jan. 1, 2018.

There’s one other thing that may or may not be a tax, and it’s a biggie: the individual mandate. The mandate means that everyone has to have health insurance or pay a penalty; the Supreme Court is currently considering whether it's constitutional -- and whether it's a tax. We won’t take a side on this question here.

The tax increases on tobacco and tanning services prompted us to give Obama a Promise Broken on our Obameter for his pledge that ""no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.""

But the statement from Crossroads is different. It makes the sweeping claim that the health care law raises 18 taxes on people who make less than $250,000 when in fact many of the taxes are on corporations and health care companies. Only a few of them are on individuals in that income range.

Obama’s tax cuts for workers

On the other side of the equation, though, Obama has cut taxes for many people of modest means.

Obama pushed for small tax credits in the economic stimulus of 2009. The ""Making Work Pay"" tax credit amounted to about $400 per worker per year for two years.

Then, in 2010, Obama hammered out a deal with Republicans for lower payroll taxes. That lowered them by 2 percent; with a maximum tax break of about $2,202 per year.

Those tax cuts apply to all workers, while the health care tax hikes apply to more limited groups, such as smokers and indoor tanners.

Our ruling

The Crossroads ad says Obama ""promised"" families making less than $250,000 a year would not see taxes go up, but ""Obamacare raises 18 different taxes.""

Obama has increased a few taxes -- on tobacco and tanning -- that hit people making less than $250,000. But he also gets credit for tax breaks for workers, most notably a payroll tax holiday that is still in effect.

The Crossroads ad wrongly implies that people of modest means are getting hit with 18 tax increases because of the health care law. In fact, most of the taxes in the health care law are on high-income individuals or the health care industry. We rate their statement Mostly False.

Crossroads GPS ad says Obama failed to keep pledge of halving the deficit
","
President Barack Obama is failing to deliver on his promises, insists a new attack ad from conservative group Crossroads GPS.

The TV commercial, airing in Florida and nine other states through May 31, 2012, lists a few examples relating to foreclosures, taxes and Obama’s health care plan. We plan to fact-check each claim, but for now we’ll address one about the deficit. (See our other stories on past claims from Crossroads GPS.)

The ad shows a clip of Obama at a press conference where he says, ""Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office.""

A narrator deems that a broken promise over the sound of shattered glass, adding that Obama ""hasn’t even come close.""

Spoiler alert: We’ve already checked out this issue a few times. In short, the claim about the deficit -- the difference between government spends and takes in -- is accurate.

Obama indeed made the pledge on Feb. 23, 2009, following a ""Fiscal Responsibility Summit"" shortly after his inauguration. (Watch more of his remarks that day.) He said then that the nation’s $1.3 trillion deficit was the largest in the nation’s history. It was mostly unchanged through fiscal year 2011.

In 2012? It’s expected to be $1.17 trillion.

So not cut in half. That’s according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in a March 2012 report.

""Although the deficit is starting to shrink, it remains very large by historical standards,"" the CBO noted.

PolitiFact Florida asked the Obama campaign about the pledge as part of a fact-check along the same lines from Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry. The campaign pointed us to Obama’s response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012.

""Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized,"" he said. ""Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. …""

Obama promised to halve the nation’s deficit, but he hasn’t managed to chip away much as the end of his first term nears.
