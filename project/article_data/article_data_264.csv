Suzanne Bonamici says we gave Rob Cornilles a Pants on Fire for what?
","
This week Suzanne Bonamici’s campaign unleashed a memorandum of complaints regarding opponent Rob Cornilles’ latest television ad. The National Republican Congressional Committee is chipping in for part of the cost of Cornilles’ ad buy.

The memo is addressed to members of the Oregon media and lists three ""False attacks"" within the Cornilles’ ad that the Bonamici folks say have been discredited by independent news analysts. Yours truly, PolitiFact Oregon, is on the list:
  
False Attack #2: 
AD: ""She voted for higher taxes and fees on the middle class and small business."" 
On January 2, 2012, The Oregonian’s PolitiFact found this attack to be so FALSE that it was rated ""Pants on Fire."" 
""We can’t accept their explanation that punishing unemployment benefit cheats or allowing the state to go after people who haven’t paid taxes is a new tax or fee."" 
http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/jan/10/rob-cornilles/rob-cornilles-claims-suzanne-bonamici-has-voted-60/ 

We’re astonished with the Bonamici campaign’s interpretation. The quote about punishing unemployment benefit cheats contained in the media release is certainly ours, and the ruling is accurate, but that is not the statement on which we ruled. We ruled on his statement that Bonamici ""voted for 60 tax increases.""

Let’s make this clear: It is 100 percent true that Bonamici has voted for higher taxes and fees while in the Legislature. What Bonamici hadn’t done while in the Oregon Legislature was vote for 60 tax increases. This statement was the subject of an earlier ad by the Cornilles’ campaign, the one we ruled Pants on Fire.

We found Bonamici had voted for 14, maybe 16 tax increases, at least 32 fee increases and 14 bills that should in no way have been included as a tax or fee increase, such as legislation to punish unemployment benefit cheats. All of that combined prompted our ruling of Pants on Fire.

Carol Butler, Bonamici’s campaign manager, said she found it incredible that we would fact check a press release when there are so many outrageous statements coming from the Cornilles’ campaign. She said she saw no difference between the Cornilles’ campaign’s  two statements on tax voting, as they both intend to mislead voters.

We see a big difference. Here’s what the Bonamici people didn’t include from our original PolitiFact:
  
""It’s fair to say that Bonamici can’t recall ever voting against a tax increase or fee hike. It’s fair to say that she has one of the most liberal voting records in the Legislature. It’s fair to say that she has voted for big-ticket tax increases that have infuriated conservatives in Oregon. Cornilles could have stuck with that script and his statements would have been True."" 
   
We note that on Wednesday, the Bonamici campaign launched a new ad that correctly states that we gave Cornilles a Pants on Fire for ""more false attacks on Bonamici and taxes."":

The Cornilles’ campaign claim that ""she voted for higher taxes and fees"" is spot on. The Bonamici campaign is twisting a PolitiFact for its own campaign purposes. We rule that a Pants on Fire.

Mitt Romney says presidential candidates tend to release tax records in April
","
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, under pressure to release his tax records, now says he'll do it in April 2012 — when taxes are due.

Why wait?

That's tradition, he argued at the Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Jan. 16.

""You know, I looked at what has been done in campaigns in the past with Sen. McCain and President George W. Bush and others. They have tended to release tax records in April or tax season,"" he said.

Later, he added, ""And if I become our nominee, and what's happened in history is people have released them in about April of the coming year, and that's probably what I would do.""

PolitiFact has already checked whether presidential candidates usually release their tax returns, a claim we found Mostly True. (There are several notable exceptions, such as publisher Steve Forbes in 1996.)

But the question of timing intrigued us: Is April truly the month of choice? 
McCain, Bush and others 
We reviewed news accounts going back six presidential elections for clues. 

We've got to mention that there's nothing new about the battle for tax records. Candidates aren't required to disclose them and sometimes don't. Competitors and the press browbeat Jesse Jackson for weeks before he released returns in 1988. Forbes' refusal to release tax records became a hot campaign issue in 1996, since he focused on a proposal for a flat tax. And no sooner had John Kerry released his own tax records in 2004 than the drumbeat began for his wife's financial history.

But back to Romney's appeal to an April tradition.

Here's what we found: 

• April is a typical month to release tax records for the most recent year. It only makes sense — a candidate would file his or her tax return, then release it to the public. There were exceptions, of course, with candidates dragging their feet for weeks or refusing to release records at all.

• Romney focused on two candidates who released tax records after they had wrapped up the GOP nomination, but plenty of primary contenders joined the disclosure-fest earlier in the process. (In 2008, several Republicans declined, but in 2004, all the major Democratic contenders released at least a year's returns, according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.) 
• On Bush and McCain, Romney was generally right. In 2000, Bush released estimates of his earnings and taxes in April but got a six-month extension to release the actual forms in October. In 2004, as president, Bush released records in April. In 2008, Republican nominee McCain released tax records in April. (Democratic primary candidate Hillary Clinton also released her tax return in April; Obama released a batch in March, then his most recent return in April.)

• But the April trend was less clear when it came to previous years' tax records. In 1996, Republican candidate Bob Dole released 30 years of tax returns in January, weeks before he became the presumptive nominee. In 1987, Democrat Michael Dukakis released five years of federal tax returns in November — in advance of the election year and well before the primaries. Dole one-upped him in January 1988 with 21 years of tax returns.

Who kicked off all this voluntary transparency? Romney's father, George, who as a presidential candidate in 1967 released 12 years of income tax returns — in November before election year. 
For a quick glimpse at when candidates released returns for the last six presidential races, here's a nonexhaustive list. (It doesn't include every primary candidate, such as the batch of Democrats in 2004 — many of whom were already in the habit of annually releasing returns — nor all sitting presidents, who typically release returns when they file. Both of those categories, because they mostly reflect current returns released around the same time they are filed, would further bulk up the April list.)

Months for tax return releases

November before election year:
Bill Bradley, 1999
Michael Dukakis, 1987 (5 years' worth)

January:
Bob Dole, 1996 (30 years' worth)
Phil Gramm, 1996
Bob Dole, 1988 (21 years' worth)

March:
Barack Obama, 2008 (6 years' worth)

April:
Barack Obama, 2008 (his just filed return)
Hillary Clinton, 2008
John McCain, 2008
John Kerry, 2004
George W. Bush, 2000
Al Gore, 2000
Bob Dole, 1996
Bill Clinton, 1992 (12 years' worth)

May:
Michael Dukakis, 1988
Jesse Jackson, 1988 
Our ruling

Romney's right that there's a strong April trend for releasing tax records, especially among politicians who practice annual disclosure. But that's not Romney's history — he's steadfastly refused to open his personal tax records for public consumption. That weakens his appeal to tradition. He could just as easily follow in the footsteps of Obama, Bill Clinton, Dukakis, Dole and his own father and release a batch of earlier federal tax returns now. Meanwhile, he implies that only party nominees release their tax records — when recent history shows primary candidates opening their files to inspection. His statement that candidates ""have tended to release tax records in April"" is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F8AE00>],/factchecks/2012/jan/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-presidential-candidates-tend-rele/

Mitt Romney says U.S. Navy is smallest since 1917, Air Force is smallest since 1947
","During the Jan. 16, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney took aim at President Barack Obama’s support for the U.S. military. ""The most extraordinary thing that's happened with this military authorization is the president is planning on cutting $1 trillion out of military spending,"" Romney said. ""Our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947. We are cutting our number of troops. We are not giving the veterans the care they deserve. We simply cannot continue to cut our Department of Defense budget if we are going to remain the hope of the Earth. And I will fight to make sure America retains military superiority."" This comment includes a lot of separate claims, but after a number of readers contacted us, we decided to focus on two of them: ""Our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917,"" and, ""Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947."" His underlying point: The U.S. military has been seriously weakened compared to what it was 50 and 100 years ago. We’ll look at both the numbers as well as the larger context. But as you'll see below, using the number of military ships and airplanes is an outdated practice that one expert says ""doesn't pass 'the giggle test.' "" The Navy numbers The Romney campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found their likely sourcing when we contacted the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. In January 2010, Heritage published a report titled, ""The State of the U.S. Military."" Citing data from the Naval History and Heritage Command, a part of the Defense Department, the report said that ""the U.S. Navy’s fleet today contains the smallest number of ships since 1916. The total number of active ships in the Navy declined from 592 to 283 between 1989 and 2009."" We looked up the original data, and the Heritage report does reflect the trend line correctly (though Romney said 1917 rather than 1916, something we won’t quibble with). In 1916, the U.S. Navy had 245 active ships, a number that eventually peaked during World War II, then fell, then peaked again more modestly during the Korean War, followed by a slow, consistent decline over the next five decades. In recent years, the number of active ships has fallen low enough to approach its 1916 level. In both 2009 (the most recent year of the Heritage report) and 2011, the number was 285. So Romney has a point. However, even using this metric -- which, as we’ll argue later, is an imperfect one for measuring military strength -- this is not the lowest level since 1916. The same data set shows that during the years 2005 to 2008, the number of active ships was 282, 281, 278 and 282, respectively -- each of which were below the levels of 2009, 2010 and 2011. In other words, each of the final four years under George W. Bush saw lower levels of active ships than any of the three years under Obama. The number of surface warships also bottomed out in 2005 under Bush, later rising by about 10 percent under Obama. Such figures undercut Romney’s use of the statistic as a weapon against Obama. The Air Force numbers How about the Air Force? First, let’s look at the total number of aircraft. We found extensive data in a report titled, ""Arsenal of Airpower: USAF Aircraft Inventory, 1950-2009,"" authored by retired Air Force Col. James C. Ruehrmund Jr. and Christopher J. Bowie and published in November 2010 by the Mitchell Institute, a research and analysis organization founded by the Air Force Association. The figures for 2009 show 5,988 total aircraft (4,460 active, 375 reserve and 1,153 in the Air National Guard). That’s a lower number than any year going back at least to 1950, the earliest year tallied in the report. So while we don’t have data going back to 1947, the specific year Romney cited, his claim about the size of the Air Force seems credible. (Figure 2 on page 5 of the Mitchell Institute report provides a good graphical representation of the numerical patterns over time.) Now, let’s look at the age of the Air Force’s assets. The Heritage report includes a chart titled, ""The Oldest Air Force in U.S. History,"" referencing an October 2005 Government Accountability Office report, ""DOD Needs to Identify and Address Gaps and Potential Risks in Program Strategies and Funding Priorities for Selected Equipment."" We couldn’t find specific support in the GAO report for the claim that the Air Force of today (or, to be precise, the Air Force of 2005 when Bush was president) was the oldest since 1947. However, the report, combined with the analysis of experts we asked, suggest that it’s a fair conclusion. The GAO looked at 30 pieces of equipment from various branches (not just the Air Force) and found that ""reported readiness rates declined between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 for most of these items. The decline in readiness, which occurred more markedly in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, generally resulted from (1) the continued high use of equipment to support current operations and (2) maintenance issues caused by the advancing ages and complexity of the systems."" Charles Morrison, a researcher at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the U.S. ""bought more aircraft in the early 1950s than in all the years combined from 1956 to 2011, clearly at the cost of an older fleet."" So let’s sum up so far. On the number of naval ships, Romney is close, except that he overlooked the four years of lower numbers under Bush. Meanwhile, he’s correct on the number of aircraft and is most likely correct on the age of aircraft. Adding some context But what do those numbers mean? Not much, a variety of experts told us. Counting the number of ships or aircraft is not a good measurement of defense strength because their capabilities have increased dramatically in recent decades. Romney’s comparison ""doesn’t pass ‘the giggle test,’ "" said William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia. Consider what types of naval ships were used in 1916 and 2011. The types of ships active in both years, such as cruisers and destroyers, are outfitted today with far more advanced technology than what was available during World War I. More importantly, the U.S. Navy has 11 aircraft carriers (plus the jets to launch from them), 31 amphibious ships, 14 submarines capable of launching nuclear ballistic missiles and four specialized submarines for launching Cruise missiles -- all categories of vessels that didn't exist in 1916. As for the Air Force, many U.S. planes may be old, but they ""have been modernized with amazing sensors and munitions even when the airframes themselves haven’t been,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a scholar at the Brookings Institution. Human factors matter, too. ""The vast superiority of the U.S. Air Force has little to do with number of planes, but with vastly superior training, in-flight coordination and control, as well as precision targeting and superior missiles,"" said Charles Knight, co-director of the Project on Defense Alternatives at the Massachusetts-based Commonwealth Institute. Ruehrmund and Bowie write in their report that ""although the overall force level is lower, the capabilities of the current force in almost all respects far exceed that of the huge Air Force of the 1950s. Today’s Air Force can maintain surveillance of the planet with space and air-breathing systems; strike with precision any point on the globe within hours; deploy air power and joint forces with unprecedented speed and agility; and provide high-bandwidth secure communications and navigation assistance to the entire joint force."" Increasingly crucial today are pilotless aerial vehicles, some of which are more commonly known as drones. ""The Air Force now buys more unmanned than manned aircraft every year, and that trend is not going to change,"" said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University. ""Within our lifetime, I think you’ll see an end to manned combat aircraft, because unmanned planes are more capable and a lot cheaper."" For a sense of comparison, in 1947, ""it took dozens of planes and literally hundreds of bombs to destroy a single target because they were so inaccurate,"" said Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""But thanks to smart bombs and stealthy aircraft, today it only takes a single plane and often a single bomb to destroy a target."" Or as John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org, puts it: ""Would anyone care to trade today's Navy or Air Force for either service at any point in the 20th century?"" There’s also another problem with Romney’s claim. He appears to be throwing blame on Obama, which is problematic because military buildups and draw-downs these days take years to run their course. Just look at the long, slow declines in the number of ships and aircraft. These are not turn-on-a-dime events that can be pegged to one president. ""Ships are so expensive that they have to be built over long periods of time, and at a pace that accounts for the retirement from service of other ships as well,"" Janda said. ""We also have to space the building out over long periods of time to keep our major shipyards working at a rate that’s sustainable over several decades, because you can’t let them go under and then try to reform them in time of war. So Congress and the president make decisions each year regarding the needs of the Navy that do not come to fruition for decades, making it ridiculous to give blame or praise to the president for the current situation."" All this said, there are lots of serious issues facing the military that Obama, or whoever defeats him in 2012, will have to address. One is the age of the Air Force’s assets, which is probably Romney’s strongest point. And despite the technological advantages of today’s military, there are limitations to having a smaller number of ships and aircraft. For instance, both branches, and especially the Navy, have to be able to position enough assets around the world where they are needed. And having a ""small but sophisticated military is also risky,"" said Thomas Bruscino, a professor at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. ""If the Navy loses one carrier to enemy action, for any reason, that loss would be catastrophic in a way such a loss would not have been in the past,"" Bruscino said. ""Likewise, the Air Force cannot afford to lose even small numbers of the highly sophisticated airframes of today."" Still, most experts we spoke to felt that Romney’s critique was misguided. Knight went so far as to offer this reply: ""If Mr. Romney wants a truly stark example of diminished military capability, he should compare today’s horse cavalry to that in 1917, or even 1941 when there were still 15 active horse-cavalry regiments in the Army. Today there has been total disarmament of horse cavalry,’ he might say, ‘leaving our nation defenseless in this regard.’ His chosen comparisons are almost as absurd."" Our ruling This is a great example of a politician using more or less accurate statistics to make a meaningless claim. Judging by the numbers alone, Romney was close to accurate. In recent years, the number of Navy and Air Force assets has sunk to levels not seen in decades, although the number of ships has risen slightly under Obama. However, a wide range of experts told us it’s wrong to assume that a decline in the number of ships or aircraft automatically means a weaker military. Quite the contrary: The United States is the world’s unquestioned military leader today, not just because of the number of ships and aircraft in its arsenal but also because each is stocked with top-of-the-line technology and highly trained personnel. Thanks to the development of everything from nuclear weapons to drones, comparing today’s military to that of 60 to 100 years ago presents an egregious comparison of apples and oranges. Today’s military and political leaders face real challenges in determining the right mix of assets to deal with current and future threats, but Romney’s glib suggestion that today’s military posture is in any way similar to that of its predecessors in 1917 or 1947 is preposterous. In addition, Romney appears to be using the statistic as a critique of the current administration, while experts tell us that both draw-downs and buildups of military equipment occur over long periods of time and can't be pegged to one president. Put it all together and you have a statement that, despite being close to accurate in its numbers, uses those numbers in service of a ridiculous point. Pants on Fire.

Possible recall challenger to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says she cut public employee costs by $10 million
","
Bracing for a likely recall election in 2012, Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tells voters in a TV ad that he saved them ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" by making public employees pay more toward their pensions and health insurance.

In contrast, one of Walker’s potential challengers, Democrat Kathleen Falk, was asked on a Milwaukee public affairs show that aired Jan. 8, 2012 whether she worries about being perceived as ""the public employee union candidate.""

Mike Gousha, host of the WISN-TV show, posed the question after alluding to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report that said two state union leaders tried to help clear the Democratic field for Falk by discouraging Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett from running in a recall.

Falk, who resigned from her post as Dane County executive in April 2011, answered Gousha by saying she’d had her own success in Madison in curbing public employee costs.

""Well, you know what I've done as the county executive for 14 years,"" said Falk. ""When times got tough, I sat down with eight unions and bargained about $10 million in reduction of their salaries and health benefits by them, voluntarily at the collective bargaining table, agreeing to that.""

Falk was drawing a pointed contrast. She used collective bargaining with unions to achieve savings on employee costs, while Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature used legislation to force most state and local employees to pay more for benefits.

But let’s check Falk’s more specific claim -- that she reduced salaries and health benefits of Dane County employees by about $10 million.

We asked Falk spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence. She provided comments attributed to Dane County director of administration Travis Myren that detailed $9.4 million in reductions, so we decided to contact him directly.

Myren has been director of administration since being promoted from deputy director by Falk in April 2009.

Myren said the $9.4 million in savings were the result of three Falk initiatives that were agreed to by public employee unions and then applied to non-union employees, so that all 2,200 county workers were covered. He also cited a fourth agreement that would put the savings over $10 million.

2009: Temporary pay cut -- $3.6 million

Falk and the employee unions agreed to cut wages 5 percent for six months, saving $3.6 million. The deal was approved by the county Board of Supervisors in June 2009.

In exchange, employees got 48 additional hours of ""personal leave"" time -- paid time off that had to be taken within certain deadlines. The only way that could create a cost to the county is if employees used that additional leave instead of vacation days, banked those unused vacation days and then were paid in cash for them upon terminating their employment with the county, Myren said.  He said there is no way to estimate how much, if any, such payouts the county might one day make.

So, the county saved $3.6 million with the 2009 pay cut, though it could face some higher cash payouts for vacation days down the road.

2010: Temporary pay cut -- $4.7 million

After the 5 percent pay cut expired, putting salaries back at their previous level, Falk and the unions agreed to cut pay 3 percent for one year, saving $4.7 million. That deal was approved by the County Board in December 2009.

In exchange, the county agreed to no layoffs in 2010 and a number of other benefit enhancements, including 64 more hours of personal leave; increasing by 50 the number of hours employees can bank in sick leave, which can be used to buy health insurance after retirement; and senior employees got three extra vacation days per year.

So, although the county granted some benefit improvements, it saved another $4.7 million in salaries with the 2010 pay cut.

2011: Health insurance changes -- $1.1 million

A new employee contract for 2012 through 2014 require employees to pay more for their health benefits. For example, a co-pay for doctor office visits was created and higher deductibles are imposed for certain services. The changes were approved by the County Board in January 2011.

Myren said the changes reduced the county’s premiums by $900,000 and the additional employee contributions are projected to save another $200,000, for a total savings of $1.1 million for 2012.

In exchange, the county agreed to remove a cap on the pension contributions it makes for employees -- potentially exposing the county to higher pension costs through 2014.

Pension funding for Wisconsin public employees is somewhat complicated. A formula, which changes annually, determines what percentage of an employee’s salary is to be contributed to the pension by the employer and what percentage by the employee. However, Dane County, as many public employers in Wisconsin have long done, makes both contributions; in 2011, the employee portion was 5.8 percent of the employee’s salary.

Under the 2012-2014 contract, the county agreed to eliminate a 6.5 percent cap on the employee contribution that was in the previous contract. So, if the pension funding formula changes and puts the employee contribution higher than 6.5 percent, the county would have a higher pension cost than under the previous contract. State pension figures show the employee contribution for most public employees -- including all non-elected Dane County employees -- was 5 percent from 1989 through 2011, but that it rose to 5.9 percent in 2012 after the Walker-led legislation took effect.

Starting in 2015, after the current contract ends, Dane County employees will be subject to the Walker-led collective bargaining legislation and will be forced to contribute to their pensions.

So, the county is exposing itself to potentially higher pension costs through 2014 in exchange for $1.1 million in immediate health insurance savings.

""Voluntary leave without pay"" program

The two pay cuts and the health insurance savings total $9.4 million in reductions in salaries and health benefits -- or, more precisely, the cost of health benefits. That’s just short of the ""about $10 million"" claimed by Falk. But Myren said another Falk initiative negotiated with the unions -- ""voluntary leaves"" -- also should be considered.

Voluntary leaves -- which differ from personal leaves in that they are days off without pay -- were created in 2003. Through 2011, personal leaves saved the county $1.45 million, Myren said.

That would put the total Falk-led employee savings at nearly $11 million.

We ran all of this past two of Falk’s political foes on the Dane County Board, supervisors Eileen Bruskewitz and Ronn Ferrell.

They described Falk as a friend of public employee unions, pointing out that under the current contract she negotiated, union employees got 3 percent raises at the end of 2011; and that, unlike other local governments, the county can't use until 2015 the Walker legislation to put a greater share of health and pension costs onto employees. But they didn’t dispute the fact that her agreements with the unions saved about $10 million.

Our conclusion

Falk said she used collective bargaining to reduce Dane County employee salaries and health benefits by ""about $10 million."" The deals create the possibility that the county will have higher payouts for pensions and vacations in future years, but that is not certain. What is known is that the deals have saved the county more than $10 million in salaries and health benefit costs.

We rate Falk’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772C800>],/factchecks/2012/jan/18/kathleen-falk/possible-recall-challenger-wisconsin-gov-scott-wal/
"['Georgia', 'LGBTQ', 'Marriage', 'Judy Manning']","
Lawmaker says Romney performed same-sex marriages as governor
","
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has spent a lot of time trying to convince socially conservative voters that he really, really is one of them.

Many, including one Georgia lawmaker, still do not think Romney is a true believer in their social and political principles.

State Rep. Judy Manning, a Republican from Marietta, recently told The Marietta Daily Journal that she thinks the former Massachusetts governor is a flip-flopper and she is supporting Newt Gingrich, the former Georgia congressman who was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. We thought one of her comments deserved a spin on the Truth-O-Meter.

""When he was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 — and I’m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it’s about 180 gay marriages — and now, when he is running as president on the Republican ticket, he says that marriage is between a man and a woman,"" Manning said in the article.

Did Romney actually perform 100 to 180 gay marriages? Didn’t Romney say in a nationally televised debate earlier this month that while he believes gay couples should have basic legal rights, one right they should not enjoy is marriage?

We were curious to find out if Manning was right, particularly since she wasn’t sure about how many marriages Romney may have performed.

Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg denied the claim.

""That is simply and completely untrue,"" she said.

We called Manning at her legislative office and at her home and sent the representative an email over the span of a week and did not get a reply.

Romney was elected governor in 2002 and served from 2003 to 2007. In 2003, the Massachusetts State Judicial Court ruled that same-sex couples have the legal right to marry.

Massachusetts has an obscure law that allows family members or friends to perform marriage ceremonies under a one-day marriage designation. The law includes same-sex couples.

In 2006, The Boston Globe reported that Romney approved 189 special-issue, one-day marriage designations to same-sex couples in 2005. The article was a look into Romney’s approach on gay marriage as he considered a 2008 presidential run (which he later lost in the GOP primary). A Romney spokesman said in that article that he was bound by the law and had to approve those one-day marriage designations, although he opposed gay marriage.

Maggie Gallagher, founder of the National Organization for Marriage, wrote a column in December praising Romney’s support for a federal marriage amendment and his efforts to fight against gay marriage in Massachusetts. The National Organization for Marriage has fought against same-sex marriage on the national and local level.

Romney ""apparently approved many more, both before and after 2005, but we have not been able to get any records on them,"" Steve Baldwin, former executive director of the Council for National Policy, said in a column that appeared in the National Review late last month. ""There have been Freedom of Information Act requests to get more documents about this whole issue, but the state government has not been forthcoming.""

Massachusetts officials said their records of one-day marriage designations date back to 2006, not 2005, the year The Boston Globe examined. Massachusetts officials say they do not keep track of how many one-day marriage designations are approved annually for same-sex couples.

MassEquality, a Boston-based group organized to preserve same-sex marriage equality, said Romney has not been supportive of gay marriage, and the group seriously doubted that he performed any ceremonies as governor.

""The notion that Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, presided over the weddings of same-sex couples is ridiculous,"" Executive Director Kara Suffredini told us via email. ""To the contrary -- and contrary to the promises he made while campaigning for governor -- he did everything he could to position himself as the face of the anti-marriage movement, going so far as to revive an arcane and racist anti-miscegenation law to block out-of-state same-sex couples from marrying in Massachusetts. Make no mistake, former Gov. Romney was no friend to loving same-sex couples and the thousands of children they are raising in Massachusetts.""

There’s no evidence that Romney has performed any gay marriage ceremonies. It appears Rep. Manning used the wrong language to describe Romney’s actions as governor because her estimate of how many marriages she thought he performed is very similar to the number of one-day marriage designations that The Boston Globe reported.

Had Manning said Romney approved 100 to 180 one-day marriage designations, her statement would likely be correct. However, she used the word ""performed,"" which suggests Romney actually officiated the ceremony and created a vastly different impression of the candidate’s stance on same-sex marriage for anyone who read that article.

Talk radio host John DePetro: The American Civil Liberties Union and atheists demanded that the National Football League stop Tim Tebow from praying on the sidelines during games
","WPRO radio host John DePetro was chatting on Jan. 13 with Cranston School Committee member Frank Lombardi about the U.S. District Court order to remove a Christian prayer posted on the wall of a high school auditorium when talk turned to football and freedom of expression.

With the playoff game between New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos looming, DePetro lamented that things have gotten so bad, ""There are atheists in Denver and they're asking the NFL to stop Tim Tebow from praying on the sideline.""

Lombardi agreed and DePetro went on, bringing the American Civil Liberties Union into the mix.

""Look at the mindset you're dealing with,"" the radio host said. ""ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop him from praying on the sidelines. He's not forcing anyone to join him. He's off in the zone. You see players sitting with their head down. He happens to kneel on one knee. But that is the mindset we're dealing with in 2012.""

Lombardi joined in, saying he's ""concerned about the slippery slope. Where does it end? . . . I don't know where it ends. I'm certainly troubled by Tim Tebow's situation where you're going to regulate private behavior. I think that goes against everything that we stand for.""

Even we thought that atheists and the ACLU would be guilty of a personal foul if they were trying to get the Broncos’ quarterback in trouble for committing prayer interference.

So we went to Google to search for stories about the ACLU-atheist demand to the NFL.

We came up empty-handed.

So we contacted DePetro. He sent us links to two web pages.

The first was a story by the CBS affiliate in Denver headlined ""Atheist Group Believes Tebow 'Full Of Crap' With Public Display of Christianity."" It quotes David Silverman, president of a New Jersey-based group, American Atheists, and makes no reference to any demand to the NFL or any reference to the ACLU.

The second was from the Bad Catholic blog on Patheos.com criticizing Silverman's comments. Again, no reference to any demand to the NFL and no reference at all to the ACLU.

We asked Patrick Smyth, executive director of media relations for the Broncos about DePetro's statement. ""This is the first I've heard of that,"" he said.

""No, not aware of this,"" said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy.

""We haven't made any demands,"" said Silverman, president of the atheist organization. ""No law is being broken. He has the right to do it. We think he's wrong to exercise his right this way. But we don't have the right to demand anything because the NFL is a private enterprise. It's like demanding someone say Merry Christmas versus Happy Holidays.""

Finally, we called the ACLU of Colorado, where spokeswoman Rosemary Harris Lytle said DePetro's statement was not true.

""The ACLU would never demand that anyone stop praying. A lot of our work is standing up for [religious] rights, even for people some of us would consider extremists,"" she said. ""We would stand for religious liberty and religious diversity for people of all faith backgrounds"" as long as it doesn't violate the separation of church and state.

(In fact, the ACLU has a web page devoted to highlighting cases it has supported to protect the rights of individuals to practice or express their religion.)

Our ruling

Talk radio host John DePetro said, while discussing quarterback Tim Tebow, that the ""ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop him from praying on the sidelines.""

DePetro's evidence consisted of two web pages that make no such claim.

And given the ACLU's history of defending an individual's right to practice his or her religion, the idea that the organization would try to block Tebow from praying when he's not bothering anyone or disrupting a game is ridiculous

We've seen the light. It's not from a burning bush. It's from a Pants On Fire!

Super PAC attacks Rick Santorum for supporting felon voting rights
","
A super PAC that supports Mitt Romney is attacking Rick Santorum with an ad that says he can’t beat President Barack Obama. Santorum confronted Romney about the ad, which is airing in Florida, at a debate in South Carolina on Jan. 17, 2012.

""Gov. Romney's super PAC has put an ad out there suggesting that I voted to allow felons to be able to vote from prison, because they said I'm allowing felons to vote, and they put a person in a prison jumpsuit,"" Santorum said. ""I would ask Gov. Romney, do you believe people who were felons, who served their time, who have exhausted their parole and probation, should they be given the right to vote?""

Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, ended up in an extended back-and-forth with Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. Both men are seeking the Republican nomination for president.

We’ll get back to the exchange in a minute, but here, we wanted to fact-check the ad put out by the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future.

""Barack Obama knows four facts about Rick Santorum that you don’t,"" the ad states. ""Santorum pushed for billions in wasteful pork, voting for the ‘Bridge to Nowhere,’ a teapot museum, even an indoor rain forest. Santorum voted to raise the debt limit five times, increasing spending and debt by $3 trillion. He even voted to let convicted felons vote. So, how will Rick Santorum beat Obama? Obama knows, he can't.""

We’ve fact-checked claims about Santorum’s alleged pork-barrel spending before. We rated the claim that he voted for a tea pot museum Half True -- he voted for a large appropriations bill that included an earmark for the project, but there’s no evidence he specifically supported the museum. We also rated the claim that he voted for the Bridge to Nowhere as Mostly True -- in a separate vote to strip funding, Santorum voted to leave it in. He defended that vote by saying the people of Alaska knew best how to spend their transportation dollars.

Here, we want to look at whether Santorum ""voted to let convicted felons vote."" The ad points to a 2002 vote on a failed amendment sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.

We looked up the amendment and found that it did attempt to grant rights to convicted felons to vote, as long as they were not currently in a correctional institution or on probation or parole.

The amendment failed 63 to 31. Santorum was one of three Republicans on the losing end. (The other two were his fellow Pennsylvania Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter, and Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio.) 
At the debate in South Carolina, Santorum argued that the ad gave the misleading impression that he voted to allow felons who were still in prison to vote. Santorum is correct that the ad shows a man in an orange prison jumpsuit with a jaunty ""I voted"" button pinned to his chest.

Santorum argued that he only supported voting rights for people who had served their sentences and successfully completed probation. Then he charged Romney was a hypocrite, noting that Massachusetts allowed felons who had completed their sentences to vote and that Romney had never moved to change those laws.

Romney responded that he had a Democratic Legislature when he was governor but that he still opposed restoring voting rights for felons after their release. Romney also said he wasn’t responsible for the super PAC’s ads.

Our ruling

Here, we’re fact-checking the original television ad from the super PAC Restore our Future, which claimed Santorum ""voted to let convicted felons vote.""

Santorum argued during the debate that the ad is particularly misleading because the ad’s visual -- a jump-suited prisoner wearing an ""I voted"" button -- could give people the impression that Santorum supported allowing people in prison to vote, which he does not.

When we saw the ad, we were already familiar with efforts in various states to restore voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences, so we didn’t think that it meant that Santorum wanted to allow current prisoners to vote.

Still, we can understand that people who haven’t followed this issue before might be confused into thinking Santorum supported allowing incarcerated prisoners to vote.

Santorum’s vote was actually to restore voting rights for felons who had completed their sentences and probation. The ad muddies that point, so we rate the its claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B31B80>],/factchecks/2012/jan/17/restore-our-future/super-pac-rick-santorum-felon-voting-rights/
"['Agriculture', 'Tennessee', 'Corn Commentary']","
Corn Growers Association blog laments Congress has just one ""working farmer""
","
We know it's been a while since the United States was truly an agrarian society, but is it possible that, of the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, just one is a ""working farmer"" -- U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher? That's the claim made by Corn Commentary, an online newsletter of the National Corn Growers Association. Its headline, ""Only Farmer in Congress wants to wait on Farm Bill"" has been featured in the ""In The News"" feed that runs prominently on the ""About Me"" section of Fincher’s website.

Back in July, Corn Commentary caught up with Fincher, R-Tenn., at the Southern Peanut Growers Conference. It wanted to ask the Northwest Tennessee representative about his concern ""about cuts in agricultural funding being considered at the federal level"" and referred to the freshman lawmaker in the article as ""sadly the only working farmer currently serving in the House.""

Sad maybe, but also unlikely, it seemed to us, given the number of rural districts represented in the House of Representatives. So we set out to find out whether Fincher, of Frog Jump, Tenn., is in fact the only working farmer now serving. That Fincher is running a headline that says ""Only Farmer in Congress . . .  "" next to a big photo of himself on his website also strikes us as an implicit endorsement of the statement, though we could not find any other evidence of him making the claim independently.

A working farmer would, we figured, be someone who gets involved in farm operations, drives a tractor, tends to fence posts, and is known down the blacktop at the local feed store. Fincher clearly meets those specifications.

But a quick call to the House Agriculture Committee, where Fincher served briefly before taking a seat on the Financial Services Committee, revealed that its chairman, Frank Lucas, R-Okla., considers himself a fifth generation farmer and runs a cattle operation.

There’s more: 
● Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., is a co-owner of Stutzman Farms in Howe, where he farms 4,000 acres with his brothers and brothers-in-law, growing soybeans, green beans and seed corn. Stutzman’s spokesman James Wegmann reports that the congressman sets aside ""combine time"" during the harvest season and is very much involved in the operation. 
● Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., lives on a working farm in Cass County, served on the Missouri Farm Bureau and owns businesses that sell farm equipment. Her spokesman, Steven S. Walsh, said she ""can, indeed, be considered a working farmer."" 
Two others have extensive experience on the farm although they no longer claim to be ""working farmers."" 
● According to his House bio, Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, is a ""self-employed farmer, predominately (sic) producing market hogs"" for three decades. But spokeswoman Catherine Gatewood said in an email update that Gibbs is ""technically not a working farmer anymore as he sold his operation!"" 
● Christine Noem, R-S.D., described on her official site as a ""farmer and hunting lodge owner and operator"" -- and who was twice named South Dakota’s Outstanding Young Farmer before entering Congress -- is no longer actively involved in farming, according to her spokesman, Josh Shields. She sold off the last of her cattle and her brothers and sisters now do the actual farming, he said. 
We were also curious how many members of Congress look like farmers on paper by receiving U.S. Agriculture Department payments for farm operations they may not actually actively farm. For that we turned to the Washington-based Environmental Working Group, which for years has maintained a database of crop subsidy payments obtained from the USDA through a Freedom of Information Act request.
 
Earlier this year, EWG noted that 23 members of the 112th Congress, including five senators, have received farm program payments since 1995.

Corn Commentary says Fincher is the only working farmer in the House, and in an emailin response to a PolitiFact inquiry, reporter Cindy Zimmerman doubled-down: ""To my knowledge, the other members of Congress who claim agriculture as a ‘profession’ are investors or part-timers.""

Our Ruling

Several other House members seem comfortable with manure on their work boots and do work farms when back home in their districts. They have the added cachet of actually serving on the committee overseeing farm programs, which Fincher does not.

Chris Christie touts accomplishments in video previewing State of the State address
","
New Jersey stood at a cliff two years ago. Our obituary was being written, and the state we’d grown up in was slipping away.

But then Gov. Chris Christie rescued us.

At least that's the version of events that plays out in a video the governor's office released today, about five hours before his annual State of the State address.

The video includes a clip from Christie’s Dec. 20 appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, when the governor listed some of his accomplishments.

""I have a Legislature that's overwhelmingly Democratic. Yet, we've accomplished balancing two budgets without raising taxes. We've now created 60,000 new private sector jobs. We've made government smaller. We've made it smarter. We've made it less expensive for people.""

With a backdrop of sunshine breaking through the white clouds, three phrases in red and blue font and all capital letters flash on the screen: ""Balanced budgets. Created 60,000 jobs. Made government smaller.""

'Balanced Budgets'

It’s a claim Christie touts as a fiscal accomplishment: his administration balanced ""two budgets without raising taxes.""

Christie is correct that he balanced two budgets, but the state constitution forbids governors from running budget deficits. Following that requirement, Christie signed two balanced budgets for fiscal years 2011 and 2012.

So, that part of Christie’s statement is true.

But the governor’s assertion that he didn’t raise taxes is not as clear. We found in a previous PolitiFact New Jersey ruling that although the rates for the state’s three major taxes -- gross income, sales and corporation business -- have not increased during Christie’s tenure, some experts view cuts in state tax credit programs as tax hikes.

The state reduced funding for the State Earned Income Tax Credit and programs for property tax relief in fiscal 2011.

One expert, Josh Barro, a fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, told PolitiFact New Jersey in July that a reduction in the earned income tax credit was not a tax hike, because it’s a welfare payment through the tax code. But reducing the property tax credits could be considered tax increases, since they’re meant to offset property tax burdens, he said.

In that ruling, the governor’s claim earned a Half True from the Truth-O-Meter.

‘Created 60,000 Jobs’

One of the governor’s frequent talking points is that his administration is responsible for private-sector job growth in New Jersey. PolitiFact New Jersey has checked two previous claims with Christie pointing to jobs gained under his watch.

First, let’s address the 60,000 private-sector jobs cited in the video.

Based on the latest seasonally adjusted data from the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the video isn’t far off. As of November 2011, there were 3,258,100 private-sector jobs in the Garden State.

When compared with January 2010, when Christie was sworn into office, there’s been a gain of 54,700 private-sector jobs. Compared with February 2010 -- Christie’s first full month in office -- there’s been a gain of 62,100 private-sector jobs.

But as economic experts have told us for previous rulings, the governor can’t take credit for all of that job growth. Just as we couldn't fully blame Christie for private-sector job losses, we can't fully credit him for private-sector job gains.

Each time Christie made a similar claim about private-sector job growth, those statements have landed at Half True on the Truth-O-Meter.

‘Made Government Smaller’

Just as there’s been private-sector job gains, there’s been losses within New Jersey’s public sector.

Christie’s claim on Morning Joe that ""we’ve made government smaller"" followed him saying that there are fewer state workers now than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman left office in 2001. We previously found that Christie’s numbers are solid, earning him a True ruling.

Compared with January 2001, when Whitman resigned, there are 600 fewer state government employees, marking a minimal decrease of 0.4 percent.

Since Christie’s first full month in office, the number of state workers has dropped by 13,100 to 137,800 employees as of November.

So, Christie has ""made government smaller"" by reducing the number of state workers.

Our ruling

About five hours before he was set to deliver the State of the State address, Christie released a Hollywood-esque trailer touting his accomplishments.

As words flash across the screen, Christie is heard listing some of those achievements as ""balancing two budgets without raising taxes. We’ve now created 60,000 new private-sector jobs. We’ve made government smaller.""

We’ve heard all this before from the governor and, once again, his statement needs some serious clarification.

Christie has balanced two budgets, but he is required to do so under the state constitution. It’s true that the rates for the state’s three major taxes have not changed under Christie, but the governor has cut funding for some tax credits.

The jobs-related claims in the video are on target. The number of state workers has declined during Christie’s tenure, and number of private-sector jobs has grown by about 60,000. But the governor is giving himself too much credit for that job growth.

Overall, the three claims don’t give a completely accurate picture of Christie’s New Jersey. We rate the statement Half True.

Karen Harrington says Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""missed 62 congressional votes— one of the worst records of any member of Congress”
","
Karen Harrington, a Republican setting her sights on the congressional seat held by Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, says the Congresswoman spends too much time hob-knobbing across the country and not enough time casting votes.

Harrington has a ""Where is Debbie?"" post on her website that includes a map of the U.S. marking the states where Wasserman Schultz has visited. In Florida the map shows a sign reading ""Debbie’s District abandoned.""

Harrington said Wasserman Schultz is ""more concerned with headlining fundraisers for President (Barack) Obama and the DNC than she is with fulfilling the responsibilities owed to her constituents,"" adding, ""In 2011, Wasserman Schultz missed 62 congressional votes — one of the worst records of a member of Congress.""

We decided to see for ourselves: How many votes did Wasserman Schultz miss in 2011, and how did she stack up with her peers?

We soon discovered that the numbers add up quickly when you’re talking about 435 members of Congress and more than 900 votes. But a web team at the New York Times tracks congressional votes in an online database.

The New York Times posted an analysis in October that showed nearly 20 members had missed more than 10 percent of the votes in 2011 -- mostly due to their own illness or that of a family member. Wasserman Schultz was not on that list.

There were some not so-surprising names included. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot Jan. 8, missed the most. Presidential candidates Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Ron Paul, R-Texas, were also on the list. And Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., ""might have been the first paternity leave for a gay member of Congress,"" the Times wrote.

The article reflected about 814 votes -- not the full year.

We contacted Derek Willis, a web developer at the New York Times, who shared internal data with us that showed 948 votes between January and Dec. 20, 2011. The votes are roll call votes and omit voice votes or unanimous consent.

Willis told us in an e-mail that the voting data, which comes from the Clerk of the House, showed that Wasserman Schultz missed 62 votes, which equals 6.4 percent of all House votes in 2011. She tied for 45th among the top missers of votes in the House. The median was 17 missed votes or about 1.8 percent.

The New York Times’ analysis showed that Wasserman Schultz didn’t top the Florida delegation for missed votes. Frederica Wilson, D-Miami, missed the most votes -- she ranked No. 11. Wilson had gallbladder surgery in October, according to the Miami Herald’s ""Naked Politics"" blog.

Three other members of Florida’s Congressional delegation missed more than Wasserman Schultz: C.W. ""Bill"" Young, R-Indian Shores; Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami; and Kathy Castor, D-Tampa.

Our ruling

Harrington said, ""In 2011, Wasserman Schultz missed 62 congressional votes — one of the worst records of any member of Congress."" She’s right that Wasserman Schultz missed 62 votes. That means Wasserman Schultz is No. 45 among members who have missed votes, out of 435 sitting members, a fairly high ranking. On the other hand, she's not even the worst in the state and has a better voting record than four other members of the Florida delegation. So the record is mixed on whether she is ""one of the worst."" We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B1BD40>],/factchecks/2012/jan/17/karen-harrington/harrington-says-wasserman-schultz-missed-62-congre/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Families', 'Welfare', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Newt Gingrich says Obama put more people on food stamps than any other U.S. President
","During the Jan. 16, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., former House Speaker Newt Gingrich resurrected one of his favorite attack lines against President Barack Obama -- that food stamp usage has peaked under the current president.

Calling Obama the ""best food stamp president in American history,"" Gingrich said that ""more people have been put on food stamps under Barack Obama than anyone in American history.""

We addressed a similar comment by Gingrich in May 2011 and thought it would be worth an update.

We’ll start by noting that ""food stamps"" -- which provide qualifying, low-income Americans with vouchers to buy groceries -- have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008, although many people still use the informal name.

It’s possible to interpret Gingrich's statement that ""more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history"" as suggesting that Obama is forcing people into the program. In fact, it’s a voluntary program.

In any case, here are the historical data:

For the most recent month with available data -- October 2011 -- roughly 46.2 million people received SNAP benefits. That’s down slightly from September 2011, when 46.3 million people received benefits, but those two months were the highest in history. The trendline shows consistent increases in the numbers of Americans receiving SNAP benefits: 30.8 million in October 2008, 37.7 million in October 2009, and 43.2 million in October 2010.

In addition, the average number of people on SNAP every month hit a record high in 2011 -- 44.7 million. It’s risen every year since 2007.

We also checked to make sure that this wasn’t influenced by population growth, and it wasn’t. Currently, about 14 percent of the population is on food stamps. In 1994, the highest year for SNAP use prior to the recession that began in December 2007, the rate was 10.5 percent.

So Gingrich is correct that food stamp use is at its highest level in both raw numbers and as a percentage of the U.S. population since the program began in 1969.

Case closed? Not quite. Gingrich’s talking point implies that this is Obama’s fault.

Clearly, the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the most recent recession, which began more than a year before Obama took office. It’s impossible to know how high SNAP usage would have gone had the Republicans, rather than Obama, shaped policy in 2009 and 2010.

On the one hand, SNAP usage has continued to climb almost every month of the Obama presidency despite some signs of an economic recovery. So Gingrich’s charge cannot simply be dismissed out of hand.

On the other hand, there is typically a lag time before an upturn in the broader economy begins to show up in decreased SNAP usage. The previous high from 1994, for instance, came following a recession that officially ended in mid 1991 -- and that recession was much milder than the most recent one. This makes it harder to divvy up the blame.

One last point: The number of food stamp beneficiaries had started to head upward under President George W. Bush, partly because of more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits, and partly because of changes in the rules that had the effect of broadening eligibility. The experts we spoke to agreed that both policies began under Bush but were retained by Obama.

The changes produced consistent increases in the number of average monthly beneficiaries. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush’s presidency -- most of which were years not considered recessionary. All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush’s eight-year presidency.

Our ruling

The number of SNAP beneficiaries is at a record level, and it has risen in most months of the Obama presidency. But Gingrich oversimplifies when he suggests that Obama is the root cause. Much of the reason for the increase was a combination of the economic problems Obama inherited combined with a longstanding upward trend from policy changes. But Obama has supported those policies. On balance, we rate Gingrich’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/040c2b5a-abd6-45ae-9435-c08b06b6a214",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A93540>],/factchecks/2012/jan/17/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-more-people-have-been-put-food-/

Georgia Democrats say Republicans trying to knock Obama off ballot
","
Georgia Democrats are telling their party faithful that Republicans are already trying to play election-year political tricks on President Barack Obama.

And if GOP efforts work, state Democrats won’t even get to vote for Obama for president, Democrats warn.

""Republicans are attempting to remove Barack Obama from Georgia’s Presidential Ballot in 2012,"" read a Dec. 21 post on the state party’s website.

Then the post asked for money to pay for legal bills.

A reader asked us to put the Democrats’ statement to the test, and we were happy to help. With a little reporting, we found that four Georgia residents are challenging Obama’s eligibility for the state presidential preference primary and general election ballots.

They’re saying Obama isn’t a natural-born citizen, which would mean that under the Constitution, he’s not eligible to be president. Critics of this line of thought call some of these people ""birthers,"" a term these challengers by and large reject.

David Farrar of Cedartown in west Georgia thinks Obama’s biggest problem is that there needs to be proof in addition to the president’s birth certificate confirming he was born in the U.S.

Kevin Powell of Duluth, Carl Swensson of Morrow and David Welden of Powder Springs think that Obama does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen. Powell and Swensson say they can cite U.S. Supreme Court precedent to prove it.

A fifth challenger rescinded his complaint, said Kim Beal, a staff attorney with the Office of State Administrative Hearings, which is handling the challenges. A hearing is set for Jan. 26.

""Man up,"" Swensson’s challenge told Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Kemp‘s office administers the state’s elections.

PolitiFact Georgia has addressed such arguments before, and they didn’t do well on the Truth-O-Meter. The claims about Obama’s birth certificate range from False to Pants on Fire. PolitiFact Georgia also found problems with an argument that Obama does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen.

But these theories aren’t the focus of this inquiry. We’re trying to figure out whether Democrats are right that Republicans are trying to knock Obama off the ballot.

Obviously, these concerned citizens all want him gone. But are they Republicans? And is this a GOP-sanctioned effort?  

We looked into the challengers’ Republican bona fides.

They emphasized that the Republican Party is not coordinating their efforts. Swensson told  PolitiFact Georgia that he reached out to the party for its support and got none.

""Basically, what I get from them is crickets,"" Swensson said. ""Lots and lots of crickets.""

Georgia Republican Party Chairwoman Sue Everhart distanced the state party from the challenges.

""The Georgia Republican Party is not a party to any of those challenges, and had no knowledge of them before they were filed,"" Everhart said in a statement released by a party spokesman.

The challengers all said their efforts have nothing to do with their party affiliations.

""It’s an entirely nonpartisan effort. It has nothing to do with politics, only to do with the Constitution,"" said Welden, who said he has voted Republican but leans independent.  

That said, challenges do have significant GOP ties.

State Rep. Mark Hatfield, a Republican attorney from Waycross, represents Powell and Swensson in their challenge. He is vice chairman of the state House’s Judiciary Non-Civil Committee and is listed as the Republicans’ deputy majority whip.

Last year, Hatfield sponsored legislation that would make presidential and vice presidential candidates prove their citizenship to make the state’s ballot.

Swensson is chairman of the Clayton County Republican Party.

Tennessee lawyer Van Irion represents Welden. He ran for Congress in 2010 and won the backing of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. Irion lost in the Republican primary.

Orly Taitz, a California lawyer, represents Farrar. She ran unsuccessfully in 2010 to be the Republican nominee for California secretary of state.

Farrar told PolitiFact Georgia he considers himself a Republican. Voter records show Powell voted in six Georgia primaries between 1996 and 2008 and chose a Republican ballot in all of them.  

How do we rule?

There are efforts to ""remove Barack Obama from Georgia’s Presidential Ballot in 2012,"" as Democrats said.

Whether ""Republicans"" are trying to do this is a dicier issue. The Georgia Democrats’ language could lead a reasonable person to think that the effort is organized by the GOP.

It’s not. Nevertheless, these challenges are dyed bright red. A GOP state representative does represent two of the challengers, and two unsuccessful Republican candidates from Tennessee and California represent the rest.

One challenger is chairman of his county GOP. Three of the four challengers consider themselves Republicans, and all of them have voted Republican.

Because the state party is not involved in the challenge, but individual Republicans are leading the charge, we rate the Georgia Democrats’ statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280966CE200>],/factchecks/2012/jan/17/georgia-democrats/georgia-democrats-say-republicans-trying-knock-oba/

Mitt Romney tweets that “more Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history”
","
With the perception swelling that he will be the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney has increasingly moved his attention away from his party rivals to President Barack Obama. 
On Jan. 16, 2012, Romney sent a tweet blasting Obama for his jobs record. 
""More Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history,"" Romney wrote. 
Several readers asked us to check it out. 
First, we should mention that there is no useful statistic for ""Americans (who) have lost their jobs"" during a given time period. The labor force is fluid, so people who lose their jobs often move quickly into another one. Instead, economists use the concept of net jobs gained or lost -- how many more (or fewer) people were employed on Date B than on Date A. 
When we asked the Romney campaign for backup material, they confirmed that they were talking about net jobs lost under a given president. So that’s the measure we used. 
We found that Obama is indeed the only president to have a net job loss if you count from inauguration day until the end of the presidency. But it’s not necessarily fair to credit or blame presidents for jobs created or lost during the first year on the job, since the president’s policies have not had time to take effect. 
Instead, if you start the count at one year into a president's term and end it one year -- a somewhat arbitrary method, but a defensible one -- it turns out that the Obama administration has presided over a net increase in jobs. So using this method, the premise of the Romney claim -- that the net jobs change for the nation as a whole under Obama was negative -- evaporates. In fact, using this method means that Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, becomes the only president to lose jobs on his watch. 
Let’s dig deeper into the numbers. 
The numbers starting at inauguration day 
As we noted, the numbers provided by the Romney campaign used jobs figures for the president’s first and last days in office. To replicate the campaign's math, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that tracks employment figures going back decades. Due to BLS data constraints and Romney’s use of the term ""modern"" presidents, we limited our search to presidents from Harry Truman on. 
In previous fact checks, we’ve tried to adjust for the time each president has spent in office. But since the Romney tweet was clear about referring to total numbers of people who lost jobs, rather than the rate at which people were losing jobs under each president, we did not take that additional step for this item. 
We first calculated how many jobs were gained or lost during each president’s tenure on a net basis. We also tried to adjust for the size of the population by dividing the net job gain or loss by the nation’s estimated population during the president’s first year in office. (Comparing jobs gained or lost under Obama, when the U.S. population is more than 300 million, to the changes under Truman, when the population was below 140 million, is comparing apples and oranges.) 
In this chart, the first number refers to the net jobs gained or lost during the president’s tenure starting at the very beginning of his term, and the second number refers to the net change in jobs as a percentage of the U.S. population. The presidents are listed in descending order by most jobs created: 
  
So by this measure, Romney is right: Obama is the only president who saw a net job loss during his presidency. This means it’s reasonable for him to say that ""more Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history."" 
But, as we noted, that’s not the only way to look at it. 
The numbers starting one year into each president’s term 
If you use the one-year-into-the-term yardstick, the numbers don’t change dramatically -- except for Obama and his predecessor. Here’s the same breakdown, again in descending order by net jobs gained or lost: 
  
So by this measurement, Obama doesn’t have a net loss of jobs at all -- in fact, the only president who does is George W. Bush. (Lest our readers think that using this methodology is some kind of liberal plot, we’ll also note that using this method gives almost 2.5 million extra jobs to Reagan, vaulting him over Clinton into the top spot in job creation among modern presidents.) 
It’s worth noting that Obama’s record on jobs through December 2011 is positive unless you start counting during the first three months of his administration -- January (as Romney did), February or March 2009.  We might also note that Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, and got Congress to pass his stimulus bill in mid February, a bill that took months to start pumping money into the economy. 
We won't argue that counting from one year into a president’s term (or four months, or nine months) is a better solution than counting from day one; that’s a matter of opinion. But we do think it underlines an important reality -- that making small changes to methodology can produce significant deviations in the results and weakens the black-and-white certainty of Romney’s claim that ""more Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history."" 
It really depends on when you start counting. 
A final note: It’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the numbers in political attacks (or claims of political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit is justified. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we've talked to many workforce experts who tell us that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims less than True on our Truth-O-Meter. 
Our ruling 
Romney’s claim is accurate if you count from every president’s first day in office to his final day -- by those standards, Obama is indeed the only president since World War II to have presided over a net job loss. But if you compare each president from one year into his term to one year after the end of the administration -- a plausible approach if you hope to capture what kind of impact their policies had on the economy -- Obama’s job statistics shift into positive territory, while George W. Bush’s fall into negative territory. 
The fact that Obama’s -- or any other president's -- numbers can change dramatically depending on what timeline you use suggests that Romney’s conclusion isn't as telling as it sounds. Throw in PolitiFact’s perennial reminder that no politician is the sole cause of either jobs lost or jobs created, and we arrive at a ruling of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D01D00>],/factchecks/2012/jan/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-tweets-more-americans-have-lost-their-/

Pennsylvania poll worker was copying information from a damaged ballot, to ensure it was counted

But it’s cropped so that ""bipartisan poll watchers who were not more than six feet away"" are no longer in the frame, said Adrienne Marofsky, a spokesperson for the county.  The poll worker in the video is copying information from a damaged ballot the county received onto a blank ballot so that the votes could be counted.  Because the county received some ballots that were damaged, they couldn’t be scanned, Marofsky said. The scanner manufacturer has advised that the best solution for damaged ballots that can’t be scanned is to transcribe the votes onto a clean ballot and scan that ballot instead, she said.  ""As ballots were being transcribed, the original damaged ballots were directly beside the new ballots, and bipartisan observers witnessed the process at close range,"" Marofsky said.

Does W.Va. rank near last in education, drinking water, child mortality?
","Paula Jean Swearengin, the Democrat who challenged Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., in 2020, took to Twitter to argue that their state needs to improve its standing in some key quality-of-life metrics. Swearengin was replying to a tweet by Andrew Yang, who ran in the Democratic presidential primary earlier this year. Yang had tweeted, ""America is 33rd in access to quality education, 33rd in child mortality and 31st in clean drinking water. But our stock market is up."" In her Sept. 10 reply tweet, Swearengin brought home those metrics for West Virginia voters. ""West Virginia is near last in the U.S. in these rankings. There are conditions in this state comparable to a 3rd world country. Our incumbents have done nothing but line their pockets with dark money while we suffer."" West Virginia is near last in the US in these rankings. There are conditions in this state comparable to a 3rd world country. Our incumbents have done nothing but line their pockets with dark money while we suffer. #NoMoore #WestVirginia https://t.co/Tx7XYj2M3Y We decided to check whether credible rankings show West Virginia to be ""near last in the U.S."" in all three areas. We’ll address them one by one. (Swearengin’s campaign did not respond to inquiries. She eventually lost the election to Capito.) Statistics for K-12 graduation rates differ somewhat, depending on how you measure them, and as we’ve reported previously, no measure is foolproof. Still, West Virginia performs well in a measure that analyzes the ""cohort"" of students entering school in a given year and then follows them to see whether they graduate, adjusting for students who move in and out of the state. By this measure, West Virginia was one of only seven states in the U.S. to reach a 90% graduation rate for the 2017-18 class. Another closely watched metric for K-12 education is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a national test of scholastic achievement at various grades. In both fourth-grade and eighth-grade math, West Virginia ranked fourth from the bottom among the 50 states in 2019. In fourth-grade reading, West Virginia was ninth from the bottom, and fourth from the bottom among eighth graders. So West Virginia has uniformly poor rankings in national standardized testing. Independent analyses suggest a broadly similar picture. An analysis by U.S. News and World Report, using these statistics and a few others, ranked West Virginia 42nd in the nation overall on K-12 education. Another analysis, by the website WalletHub, used 33 metrics to evaluate schools by state. In the metrics for educational ""quality,"" West Virginia ranked 45th nationally. The metrics we cited above on education are ""reasonable ones to use,"" said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education. The Environmental Protection Agency measures the number of violations by public water systems per 1,000 residents in 2017. West Virginia ranked 46th among the 50 states on this metric that year. The only states ranking lower were Maine, Vermont, Montana and Alaska. According to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranked fifth worst among the 50 states for child mortality in 2018. The only states with worse rates were South Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Swearengin said, ""West Virginia is near last in the U.S."" rankings of education, clean drinking water and child mortality. In standard federal government rankings of drinking water and child mortality, West Virginia does rank in the bottom five states. It also ranked no higher than ninth from the bottom in several common math and reading tests for the National Assessment of Educational Progress.  But by one measure, the state’s high-school graduation rate is among the nation’s best.

Social media posts falsely claim 40,000 votes for Jo Jorgensen became votes for Joe Biden in Pa.
","Social media posts are promoting misinformation about the presidential election about lost and found ballots. A Facebook post falsely claimed that Wisconsin ""found"" 112,000 ballots at 3 a.m."" Another post also wrongly claimed that ""Wisconsin took a break, and when they returned"" Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""coincidentally came back ahead by 100k."" President Donald Trump, in his quest for reelection, falsely claimed there were ""surprise ballot dumps"" in several states. Now, posts on Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok are claiming that more than 40,000 votes once counted for Libertarian presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen in Pennsylvania ""magically"" went to Biden. A video posted on TikTok Nov. 5 shows what appears to be a screenshot of a Facebook post, which said: ""Wanna see 40,000+ votes for Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen magically become votes for Joe Biden? Abra cadabra! Nope. No fraud here.""  The Facebook post included two screenshots seemingly taken 12 minutes apart: one claimed to show Pennsylvania results at 56% reporting, the other, results at 59% reporting. The 56% reporting screenshot had these vote counts: Trump: 2,158,770
Biden: 1,571,693
Jorgensen: 89,025 The 59% reporting screenshot had these vote counts: Trump: 2,286,966
Biden: 1,674,122
Jorgensen: 46,987 So from one screenshot to the other, Jorgensen’s vote count is down 42,038. But the images do not show or prove that those votes became Biden votes.  According to the screenshots, Biden’s count increased by more than 102,000, not just the 42,038 purportedly taken away from Jorgensen. Trump’s count also increased by more than 128,000, yet the social media posts don’t similarly link Jorgensen’s alleged lost votes to Trump. We found no evidence that the screenshots even represent true counts at any point in time. The images are not from Pennsylvania’s official elections page; they match the look of images from Google’s election count, which says it relies on data provided by the Associated Press. We can't verify the authenticity of the images in the social media posts. By 5 p.m. eastern time Nov. 5, results posted by election officials in Pennsylvania showed that Jorgensen had around 74,000 votes, with about 93% of the state’s total votes counted. That tally is less than the amount she supposedly had at 56% reporting. PolitiFact reached out to Pennsylvania’s secretary of state for more information, but we did not hear back. Social media posts claimed, ""40,000+ votes for Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen magically become votes for Joe Biden."" We found no evidence that supports the claim. The posts claimed that by the time Pennsylvania had reported 56% of votes, Jorgensen had 89,000 votes, and that her count declined by 40,000 votes shortly after. The latest information available from Pennsylvania election officials, with about 93% of votes counted, showed that Jorgensen had not yet reached 89,000 votes. Given that Jorgensen did not have those 89,000 votes to begin with, the claim that 40,000 of her votes ""magically"" became Biden’s is baseless. Other data included in the posts also do not prove the claim.

No, a dead voter named William Bradley didn’t vote in Detroit
","As Michigan continued to count ballots in the presidential race, social media posts claimed that ballots were cast in the names of dead people. ""118-year-old William Bradley voted via an absentee ballot in Wayne County, Michigan this year. William died in 1984.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Screengrabs on social media showed a Detroit registered voter, William Bradley, with a date of birth in March 1902 and a date of death in June 1984. We entered his name in the state’s voter information website and found that he was listed as a registered voter. The state website showed that a ballot was sent to Bradley in September and received back Oct. 2. A city official said that no ballot was cast on behalf of the dead voter. William Bradley is a potentially common name. We found another William Bradley in the same zip code and spoke to him on the telephone Nov. 5. Bradley told us that he shares the same name as his father who died in 1984, except he has the middle name of Tarnell. He told us that he lives in the same home where his father used to live.  Bradley told us that he voted by mail due to the pandemic. He said that a ballot arrived for his dead father, but he threw that out. ""I didn’t use it, because I didn’t want to get it confused with mine,"" he said. Bradley said that someone on Nov. 5 called him and told him there was a report all over the internet about this situation, so he called the city about it. A city official told him not to worry, because officials check for a matching signature and date of birth, he told us. We put Bradley’s name with his date of birth through the same state website. It showed that he is a registered voter and it showed his application for an absentee ballot was received in July, but it showed no ballot sent or received.  Daniel Baxter, a consultant for the Detroit Department of Elections, sent us a statement that explained what happened: ""No ballot for the 118-year-old Mr. Bradley was ever requested, received or counted. A man with a nearly identical name requested a ballot and voted properly in both the primary and general elections.  When his ballot was initially logged, however, it was incorrectly attributed to the William Bradley born 118 years ago through a clerical error.""  Tracy Wimmer, spokesperson for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, told us that on rare occasions a ballot can be recorded inaccurately if names are identical, creating the impression that a ballot was cast in a dead voter’s name. ""This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr; or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file; for example, someone born in 1990 accidentally recorded as born in 1890,"" Wimmer said. ""In such scenarios, no one ineligible has actually voted, and there is no impact on the outcome of the election. Local clerks can correct the issue when it is brought to their attention."" We have fact-checked many misleading claims about dead people on the voter rolls this year including in Detroit, Michigan, Virginia, Nevada and Wisconsin.

No evidence ballots were smuggled into Detroit counting hub
","Viral video and images have fueled misinformation about people with cases and coolers entering Detroit’s TCF Center, the convention hall where election workers were processing and counting the city’s absentee ballots. The video and images, originally published by the Texas Scorecard, a product of the Tea Party-aligned group Empower Texans, have been widely shared on social media to illustrate claims that late-arriving ballots were being smuggled into the counting center after Michigan’s 8 p.m. deadline for returning absentee ballots. President Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump shared such claims in a tweet. But there’s no evidence of anything like that. Instead, a video shows a photographer entering the convention hall in the wee hours for news coverage of the workers counting ballots. Photos show reporters leaving the counting area and election workers reporting for duty and carrying containers of food. The Texas Scorecard published an article with a video and photos Wednesday that it says were shared by Kellye SoRelle, a Texas lawyer and member of Lawyers for Trump. The Texas Scorecard says SoRelle was working as a poll watcher in Detroit at TCF. The video shows a man unloading a white van and wheeling a wagon into Detroit’s TCF Center, the central processing and counting site for the city’s absentee ballots. According to the outlet, SoRelle took the video early Wednesday at 2:40 a.m. The narrator of the video says, ""polling places were closed, and yet we have a box,"" suggesting that the man was bringing in a new batch of ballots to be counted after Michigan’s 8 p.m. Election Day deadline for returning absentee ballots. The article says, ""SoRelle is raising alarms that the box may have been a ballot box that arrived long after all ballots were expected to have been received at the counting facility."" But the man unloading a box from a van onto a wagon was carrying camera equipment, not ballots. Ross Jones, an investigative reporter with Detroit’s ABC affiliate WXYZ, wrote in a tweet that the purported ""ballot thief"" in the image was actually his photographer. ""He was bringing down equipment for our 12-hour shift,"" Jones wrote. Brett Kast, another reporter with WXYZ, replied: ""The man in this video is Josh, and this is his wagon. He is not a democrat operative, he is a photographer at @wxyzdetroit. The wagon was not hauling ballots into the TCF center, it was hauling equipment in to our crew…""  In a story posted early Thursday, WXYZ once again debunked the claim that the wagon brought into TCF was carrying ballots. The Texas Scorecard also includes four other images it says ""show suitcases and coolers moving in and out of the secure area where mail-in ballots were being counted during a shift change at 4 a.m."" One photo shows a man leaving the absentee ballot counting area with a suitcase followed by a man carrying a camera tripod. A second photo, since deleted from the article, showed another man leaving the absentee ballot counting area with a suitcase, a small ladder and camera. NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, confirmed that the men shown leaving the absentee ballot counting area are NHK correspondents. Other photos published by the Texas Scorecard show what appear to be election workers with coolers inside TCF. The people responsible for processing and tabulating absentee ballots work long shifts and cannot leave to get food. So many bring food with them. Brandon Waltens, the Texas Scorecard reporter who wrote the article, said he did not have any knowledge of what was inside the suitcases and coolers. Texas Scorecard said a video showing a man bringing in a wagon into TCF may have been bringing a box of invalid, late-arriving ballots to be counted, while images showed suspicious suitcases and coolers being brought into the counting area. It offered no evidence for its claim. The video of the man bringing the wagon into TCF showed a journalist from a local news station wheeling in photography equipment, not ballots. The other images showed reporters leaving the counting area with suitcases and election workers with coolers of food.

Claim that postal service failed to deliver 27% of mail-in ballots in South Florida is 100% wrong
","The claim that the U.S. Postal service failed to deliver 27% of mail-in ballots in South Florida has popped up on Facebook and Twitter. There’s no truth to that, but it is interesting to see how one outfit raised suspicions. The website Raw Story posted a story about newly released data on ballot delivery. ""One of the worst failures occurred in South Florida, where 27% of mail-in votes may have never been received,"" the Nov. 4 article said. ""But those statistics might not be telling the entire story. Vice News reported Tuesday that ballots were not being scanned for delivery in an effort to speed up the process."" Anyone who read closely, or better still, went to the Vice News article, would be left with a very different impression. The Vice headline was ""Why the Post Office’s Last-Minute Ballot Crisis Isn’t as Dire as It Seems."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s unpack what’s going on. The 27% figure was derived based on a tweet from Hill reporter (and former PolitiFact reporter) John Kruzel. The tweet showed USPS data, and for the South Florida delivery area, the processing score for ballots was 74.43%.  A few people took that and, with a bit of sloppy math, came up with 27% undelivered. But anyone reading the thread in the tweet would see that in order to speed up the delivery of ballots to election offices, the postal service had said that it didn’t bother to scan ballots on their way out from the mail processing center. ""Many facilities have arranged for local turnaround,"" lawyers for the postal service affirmed wrote in a Nov. 3 filing. ""It’s not that they weren’t delivered,"" said National Association of Letter Carriers chief of staff Jim Sauber. ""They were pulled out directly from the rest of the mail and delivered the same day."" We contacted the election supervisor offices of two of the largest South Florida counties, Broward and Miami-Dade. The spokesman for Broward Steve Vancore said there were zero undelivered ballots. ""We went to all 42 post offices, the main postal collection center in Oakland Park and the regional center in Opa Locka in the days leading up to and on Election Day and retrieved all the ballots that were at those sites,"" Vancore said. ""We were at both the Aldridge and Opa Locka sites at 7:00 pm to get every last ballot."" Miami-Dade processed 510,830 mail-in ballots. In the days right before Election Day, they found 24 ballots at a postal facility that were on their way to voters and hadn’t been delivered. They made sure that they were. They also found six completed ballots. Those came to the election office and were processed. Posts on Facebook and Twitter said that the U.S. Postal Service failed to deliver 27% of mail-in ballots in South Florida. That was based on data that the postal service clearly said did not reflect ballot delivery rates. The sources cited by websites spreading this claim included that reality check. The two largest counties in South Florida went to postal facilities to find any wayward ballots. In one county, they found none. In another they found 30.

No, North Carolina's Secretary of State doesn't control elections
","North Carolina is one of the last states to count all of its ballots. And that has led some pundits to speculate about suspicious activity in the Tar Heel State. The Students for Trump Twitter account, which has 287,000 followers, suggested North Carolina’s Democratic secretary of state might have something to do with the slow counting.  ""It’s going to take North Carolina 9 days to get in the final results. It took Florida a little less than 2 hours. Democrat Secretary of State vs. Republican Secretary of State,"" the account tweeted on Wednesday. Students for Trump is part of the conservative Turning Point Action organization. The post was shared more than 1,400 times. It’s accurate to say North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall is a Democrat. In her first campaign for the office in 1996, she defeated racing legend Richard Petty. The secretary of state does not, however, count votes or control the election process.  The confusion prompted the N.C. Secretary of State account to tweet about the confusion. ""Unlike many states, North Carolina's election process is administered by the N.C. State Board of Elections (@NCSBE), not the NC Secretary of State's Office. All questions or comments concerning election-related matters should be directed to the Board of Elections,"" the account tweeted on Wednesday. Ballots are counted by each of North Carolina’s 100 county elections boards, and then validated by the North Carolina State Board of Elections. North Carolina’s elections board has five members, three of whom are Democrats.  Not only is the tweet wrong about North Carolina’s election process, it wrongly suggests there’s evidence of fraud or wrongdoing by North Carolina’s ballot counters. So far, there is none. It may seem like this year’s vote is taking longer than previous years, and there’s a reason for that. In previous elections, the officials stopped counting mail-in ballots three days after Election Day. This year, the elections board pushed the deadline to Nov. 12.  That decision didn’t sit well with Republicans. The North Carolina elections board’s two Republicans resigned, and were replaced with two different Republicans last month. Republican groups, including Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, challenged the move in court. But the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-3 to allow the later date, with Chief Justice John Roberts and conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the court’s three liberal justices in the majority. That’s all beside the point. To summarize what we’re waiting on, state election officials cannot get an accurate picture of the total tallies until Nov. 12. A mail-in ballot will be counted in North Carolina so long as it was: Properly filled-out and witnessed, Postmarked on or before Election Day, and Received by 5 p.m. on Nov. 12. The deadline for ballots may be new. But it isn’t evidence of wrongdoing.

Milwaukee wards did not have more votes for president than registered voters
","Many political eyes are on Wisconsin after Democratic nominee Joe Biden narrowly won the state, which was the first one to flip parties in a contentious presidential race that’s still too close to call.  The increased attention has led to a surge in misinformation about the state’s election process.  One popular — and very false — claim is that the battleground state had more ballots cast than registered voters. An online article shared widely on social media narrowed that claim to Milwaukee, the state’s largest city and a Democratic stronghold. ""Seven Milwaukee wards report more 2020 presidential votes than registered voters,"" stated a Nov. 4, 2020 article from Milwaukee City Wire.  City Wire later updated the article, but not before an array of other purported news sources echoed the same supposed finding. Those posts remained online after City Wire updated its post the afternoon of Nov. 5. The claim also got some increased attention after a tweet from Sean Hannity. This article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).  Bottom line: It’s wrong. Very wrong. The source Before we get into the claim itself, here’s a refresher on City Wire.  The website is one of several purported local news sites run by Metric Media Publications. In Wisconsin, the company operates 24 web pages including ""Green Bay Reporter"" and ""Fon du Lac News,"" which notably misspells the city name of Fond du Lac.  The Columbia Journalism Review reported the network relies heavily on algorithmically-generated stories and can be traced to conservative businessman Brian Timpone. His former company, Journatic, drew outrage in 2012 for plagiarism, fake bylines and fake quotes in what was dubbed ""pink slime journalism."" Back in August, we looked at an ""analysis"" from the website about Biden’s school choice policy and determined it was False.  Now, onto the latest claim. The crux of the headline centered around seven wards on Milwaukee’s southwest side. The unnamed writers of the article claimed to use data showing the number of ballots cast for the presidential race in these wards exceeded the number of registered voters. There are a few problems here. The first: The numbers were completely incorrect. Here are the unofficial results in those wards as reported by the Milwaukee County clerk’s office (election results aren’t final until officials complete canvassing): 234: 688 registered voters; 588 total ballots cast; 458 votes for Biden; 114 votes for President Donald Trump.  269: 978 registered voters; 861 total ballots cast; 451 votes for Biden; 388 votes for Trump. 272: 1,190 registered voters; 1,096 total ballots cast; 512 votes for Biden; 567 votes for Trump. 273: 671 registered voters; 612 total ballots cast; 313 votes for Biden; 290 votes for Trump. 274: 702 registered voters; 611 total ballots cast; 296 votes for Biden; 297 votes for Trump. 277: 1,520 registered voters; 1,321 total ballots cast; 688 votes for Biden; 602 votes for Trump. 312: 1,029 registered voters; 951 total ballots cast; 553 votes for Biden; 389 votes for Trump. Whether you look at total ballots cast in each ward or just those cast for Biden and Trump, the amount does not exceed the total number of registered voters.  (Quick note: Votes for Biden and Trump don’t add up to total ballots cast because there were other candidates for president, and some people may not have voted in that race.) Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel it wasn’t clear where the numbers in the article came from. She said the reporting software from the city and county reflect different numbers than what City Wire published. For instance, the article said Ward 274 cast 1,290 votes for Biden and Trump when the number was actually only 593.  City Wire also cited the Wisconsin Secretary of State’s office as the source of the data. But, unlike in some other states, that office in Wisconsin is not involved in the state’s elections and therefore doesn’t collect election data.  ""My office coworkers who first saw that and called it to my attention and I have no idea what they’re talking about because we have no such records,"" said Secretary of State Doug La Follette, whose small office focuses on authenticating official documents with the state seal. City Wire published an updated article with an editor’s note on Nov. 5, 2020 that said Milwaukee County updated voter registration data and voting tallies for nine wards after the original version was published shortly after 3 p.m. on Nov. 4. But that's untrue. An archived version of the county election results showed the wards in question had accurate results posted as of 9:48 a.m. Wednesday, hours before the first version of this story published. This is also confirmed by the timestamp on the county website, which notes it was last updated at 3:56 a.m. Nov. 4. On a broader scale, the Wisconsin Elections Commission has emphasized that it’s simply not possible for there to be more ballots than registered voters. Wisconsin allows people to register at the polls on Election Day.  ""There are never more ballots than registered voters,"" the commission tweeted on Nov. 4, 2020.  A widely-shared online article said ""seven Milwaukee wards report more 2020 presidential votes than registered voters."" The numbers cited by Milwaukee City Wire do not match data from the Milwaukee County clerk’s office, which show the number of registered voters exceeded ballots cast. Moreover, it’s simply not possible for there to be more ballots than voters. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967363C0>],/factchecks/2020/nov/05/facebook-posts/milwaukee-wards-did-not-have-more-votes-president-/

Video of ‘ballot stuffing’ is not from a Flint, Mich., polling place. It’s from Russia
","A video purportedly showing election officials ""stuffing ballots"" in Flint, Mich., a Democratic-leaning city of 95,000 people, wasn’t taken at a Flint polling site at all. It appears to show an election in Russia. The video, posted on Facebook, shows election workers depositing ballots into a collection box. It uses shading to spotlight the box, suggesting that the entry of those ballots was improper. The caption reads: ""Here we have staffers stuffing ballots in flint mi.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The notion that a predominantly Democratic city would be stuffing ballots aligns with debunked claims by President Donald Trump of ""surprise ballot dumps"" erasing his lead in certain states, such as Michigan.  But there’s no evidence of it here. Brian Larkin, chief of staff for the city of Flint, told PolitiFact: ""This is absolutely not a Flint polling site. The setup does not meet State of Michigan requirements that must be adhered to."" He added that, ""based upon our familiarity with all of our poll workers, we can positively say these are not Flint residents or election inspectors."" In fact, it was reported by the Washington Post in March 2018 that the video in question comes from Russia.  ""Videos posted online show two election workers coordinating the casual stuffing of ballots into a box in the center of a polling station,"" the Post reported. ""After the video, taken by a CCTV camera, circulated online, police and election commission officials went to the polling station to investigate.

Despite #sharpiegate, no evidence of plot to use the pens to cancel Trump votes
","With Joe Biden edging closer to the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency, but with ballots in battleground states still being counted, President Donald Trump and his supporters made false charges of ""surprise ballot dumps"" and outright voter fraud. It seemed no claim of efforts to deny Trump a second term was too far-fetched — even the notion that election workers, in plain view at polling sites, intentionally gave pens to Trump voters that would invalidate their ballots. The text of one image shared widely on Facebook on Nov. 4, the day after the election, stated: ""If you were forced to use a Sharpie to fill your ballot, call the number below for your state. That is voter fraud."" ""That is voter fraud"" appeared in red lettering in the image. The image included a Sharpie pen and phone numbers identified as election hotlines for 15 states, primarily those that were battlegrounds for Trump and the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. (The first number we tried, for Ohio, was for a Trump campaign office. Democrats have their own ""voter protection"" hotlines, too.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Experts say it is rare but not impossible that filling in an oval with a Sharpie marker could cause a ""bleed-through"" that would cause a voting machine to initially not read a ballot. But in some states, election officials prefer Sharpies because they lead to ballots being processed more smoothly. And there is no evidence election workers gave out Sharpies with the aim to invalidate ballots, or that any widespread spoiling of Sharpie-penned ballots occurred. Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said he is ""not aware of cases where an election official said the Sharpie was fine and then the ballot was invalidated. Of course, every machine is different. But when the election officials themselves are saying this isn’t a problem, I’m going to believe them."" As we found in a previous fact-check about Arizona, one version of the conspiracy theory is that Sharpies were foisted on Trump supporters because those markers wouldn’t be read by election machines and those ballots would be invalidated. That’s False. In Maricopa County, Ariz., home to metropolitan Phoenix, voters could use ink pens to fill out their ballots, but the county gave Sharpie markers to voters because ballots filled in with Sharpie pens are processed more precisely by voting machines.  FactCheck.org, Lead Stories and other fact-checkers reached similar conclusions. So did the New York Times. A USA Today fact-check rated a similar claim in Michigan as false.  Since then, the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, saying it had received hundreds of complaints from residents, asked the Maricopa County Elections Department for information about the use of Sharpies and any instances of ballots being rejected because of bleed-throughs. But officials and experts have repeatedly knocked down #sharpiegate claims, which have been shared by the president’s son, Eric Trump, among other Republicans. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted on Nov. 4:  ""IMPORTANT: If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!"" A letter dated Nov. 4 to voters from the Republican chairman and the only Democratic member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors explained why Sharpies were recommended and provided to voters. ""We did extensive testing on multiple different types of ink with our new vote tabulation equipment. Sharpies are recommended by the manufacturer because they provide the fastest-drying ink,"" it said. ""The offset columns on ballots ensure that any bleed-through will not affect your vote."" The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s website addressed the Sharpie falsehood in a ""Rumor vs. Reality"" column about the election.  ""If a ballot has issues that impact its ability to be scanned, it can be hand counted or duplicated, or adjudicated by election officials, who use defined procedures such as chain of custody to ensure ballot secrecy and integrity,"" the website states. The Election Integrity Partnership, whose members include Stanford University and the University of Washington, was tracking #sharpiegate as it emerged on social media platforms. It called bleed-throughs rare and easily remedied per state ""voter intent"" laws. ""There is no evidence of a plot to disenfranchise voters by passing out Sharpies at polling stations,"" the group wrote. Katina Granger, spokeswoman for Election Systems and Software, a voting system vendor, told PolitiFact: ""We recommend black pens but, to be clear, black felt-tip pens such as a Sharpie are fine as long as there’s not heavy bleed-through. Bleed-through is only an issue if the ink should bleed through to an oval on the back of the ballot. Should that occur, that is easily recognizable to the voter and the ballot is sorted out for further review."" A Facebook post claimed: ""If you were forced to use a Sharpie"" to fill out your ballot, ""that is voter fraud."" Some in-person voters complained that election officials gave them Sharpie pens at their polling place and that the ink spoiled and invalidated their ballots. In some cases, Sharpies are actually recommended as the best type of pen to use on ballots, and election officials have taken steps to guard against ink ""bleed-through"" on ballots. There is no evidence that elections officials used Sharpies to invalidate ballots.

Dead voters on Detroit’s voter rolls, including person born in 1823? That post is outdated
","A graphic was shared on Facebook the day after the election suggesting that Michigan had thousands of fraudulent voter registrations, including for dead people. The image cited Fox 2 TV news and stated, ""Detroit Voter Roll Lawsuit — Filed by the Public Interest Legal Foundation."" It was followed by four bullet points made the following points: Detroit had 4,788 duplicate voter registrations, 32,519 more registered voters than eligible voters, 2,503 dead people registered, and one voter born in 1823. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As Michigan continued to count ballots, we found similar claims on social media that suggested these dead people on Michigan’s voter rolls were a sign of voter fraud. On Twitter, one referred to the image as an example of ""more Detroit corruption,"" while another tweeted ""Bro the fraud is hilarious.""  The social media posts falsely suggest that the problematic registrations were tied to the Nov. 3 election. But the lawsuit was dropped months ago after elections officials took steps to clean up the voter rolls. The Fox 2 report about the lawsuit aired in December 2019. The lawsuit was filed by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, an organization which has filed lawsuits nationwide seeking to get jurisdictions to keep voter rolls up to date or to oppose expansions of voting by mail. J. Christian Adams, who served on President Donald Trump’s defunct voter integrity commission, is president and general counsel of the foundation. In December 2019, the foundation filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Detroit alleging it failed to maintain accurate and current voter rolls. The lawsuit didn’t allege that live humans impersonated dead voters and cast ballots. The lawsuit compared the state’s voter file with death records and found more than 2,500 dead people, including one born in 1823, years before Michigan joined the Union. The foundation also found individuals who were registered two or three times with matching or substantially similar names, for a total of 4,788 registration files for duplicate and triplicate concerns. Six months later on June 29, the foundation dropped their lawsuit after concluding that election officials had worked to fix their voter rolls. ""Defendants have taken action on the list of likely deceased registrants provided by the Plaintiff. Further, almost all of the duplicate registrations that Plaintiff brought to Defendants’ attention have been corrected,"" the foundation’s lawyers wrote. We reached out to Janice Winfrey, Detroit’s City Clerk and a defendant in the lawsuit, and did not hear back. When the lawsuit was dropped, Winfrey told the Detroit News that Detroit’s updated voter rolls were largely a result of regular maintenance. However, Winfrey said her office looked into the allegation that one registered voter was born in 1823. ""We did do some extra digging because that is ridiculous and we wanted to see what was going on there,"" Winfrey said. ""The conclusion was that that was a typographical error."" The fact that dead people remain on voter rolls in Michigan or any other state does not itself equal fraud — it’s only a crime if someone then fills out a ballot in the name of a dead voter and sends it in.  The likelihood that voter fraud can happen because of dead people on the rolls is very low, Thessalia Merivaki, an expert on voter administration and political science professor at Mississippi State University, previously told PolitiFact. ""Election administrators verify a lot of information prior to processing a ballot, be it by mail or in person,"" Merivaki said. Michigan officials said one step they take to verify ballots is signature verification. States including Michigan have significantly improved keeping their registration records up to date by joining the national Electronic Registration Information Center, which sends reports to member states showing when voters have moved within their state or out of state, when they have died and flagging when they may have duplicate registrations.  It is typical to see a number of absentee votes deemed ineligible in an election, because voters die after casting their ballot. In the November 2016 election, Michigan rejected more than 1,780 absentee ballots because the voters died after they cast their votes. State elections officials previously told us that rather than indicating instances of fraud, the rejected ballots show the state’s ability to detect and discount ineligible ballots. We have fact-checked many misleading claims about dead people on the voter rolls this year including in Michigan, Virginia, Nevada and Wisconsin. A Facebook post stated Detroit has ""2,503 dead people registered"" including ""one voter born in 1823."" The post cites a TV news report in December related to a lawsuit filed that month by the Public Interest Legal Foundation. In June, the foundation dropped their lawsuit after they concluded that Detroit elections officials had taken action to fix the voter rolls. The person on the rolls born in 1823 was a typographical error, according to the elections office. The Facebook post misleads by suggesting that dead people on the voter rolls are tied to the current counting of ballots for the Nov. 3 election. Also, dead people on the rolls doesn’t automatically mean fraud, and elections officials take steps to make sure that ballots aren’t cast in the name of dead voters.

Biden netted more votes in Michigan than Trump
","Several news organizations including the Associated Press called Michigan for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden by the afternoon of Nov. 4.

Here’s an archived version of the page from when it was updated at 9:37 p.m. on Nov. 4. Yet the Associated Press had declared Biden the winner in Michigan nearly four hours earlier.  How is that possible?  The AP, which in 2016 was 99.8% accurate in calling U.S. races and 100% accurate in calling the presidential and congressional races in each state, explained in a story helpfully titled: ""Why AP called Michigan for Biden."" After conducting an analysis of votes that were counted and the number of ballots left to be counted, the outlet concluded that there weren’t enough votes left in Republican-leaning areas for Trump to win. At that time, Biden had a 70,000-vote lead, according to the AP, and the ballots that remained to be counted were from overwhelmingly Democratic areas. The AP tracks the vote and ballot numbers using a network of reporters across the country who are in touch with local election officials. Those reporters record the tallies and call them into an AP clerk who enters that data into the AP system. The AP also gathers results from county and state websites.  When the AP called the Michigan race for Biden, it did so based on data that was not yet posted on the secretary of state’s website. A spokesperson for the office told us that its website is always the last place election results are updated, and that people should check county websites first for more up-to-date information.  ""We only update the website when counties report their complete counts to us. Even after counting is finished in individual counties ... there are still administrative and procedural things they need to do before the transmission happens, so sometimes it takes time,"" the spokesperson said. ""This delay is no way indicative of fraud or cause for concern."" Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said at 8 p.m. on Nov. 4 that all the counting had been completed statewide, the Detroit Free Press reported. By about 8:30 a.m. on Nov. 5, the secretary of state’s website showed Biden winning by about 150,000 votes, more than twice the size of the lead he had when he was declared the winner.

There’s nothing fraudulent about ballots being counted after midnight in Michigan — as long as they’re received by 8 p.m. Election Day. In-person voters who are in line by 8 p.m. that day also have the right to vote. In fact, we’ve known for weeks before Election Day that counting ballots and reporting results would take longer than in previous years. As the federal Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency recently noted, ""this does not indicate that there is any problem with the counting process or results. Official results are not certified until all validly cast ballots have been counted, including ballots that are counted on election night."" More people across the country opted to use a mail-in ballot because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in Michigan, a 2018 state constitutional amendment allowed all voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason. A record of more than 5.2 million Michigan voters cast a ballot in the 2020 election, including about 3.26 million absentee ballots. In 2016, about 4.87 million people cast a ballot in the presidential election, including about 1.27 million absentee ballots.  Mail ballots take more time and resources to process than ballots cast at the polls. Most states allow election officials to start processing mail-in ballots in the weeks leading up to Election Day, but officials in Michigan couldn’t begin that work until Nov. 2, under a new law that allotted officials in larger juristictions a 10-hour early window to process such ballots. They were still barred from counting any ballots until Election Day, so even with that extra time to start processing, officials warned that final election results wouldn’t be known on Nov. 3.  The morning after Election Day, Secretary of State Joceyln Benson told CNN that absentee ballots in the state’s biggest cities were still being counted. ""Workers who have been counting them throughout the night continue to count them today,"" she said.  By about 8 p.m. that day, all of Michigan’s votes had been tabulated, Benson said, and counties were in the final stages of reporting them out for the canvassing process to begin, the Detroit Free Press reported.    We rate this Facebook post False.

No, Wisconsin voter turnout did not jump from 67% in 2016 to 89% in 2020
","The long wait for presidential election results has created a void where citizens are seeking information on how we got here — a void being filled often with poorly researched information. Donald Trump Jr. was among the many on social media the day after the election reacting to voting numbers without first considering or researching whether they’re legitimate. The president’s son tweeted ""I’m calling bull****,"" at about 2 p.m. on Nov. 4, sharing another tweet that claimed turnout in Wisconsin jumped from 67.34% in 2016 to 89.25% in 2020. (Eric Trump, another of the president's sons, posted the same thing on Facebook, saying, ""Looks like fraud!"") It fed into the false narrative swirling among conservatives that Wisconsin and other key states went to Democratic candidate Joe Biden as a result of voter fraud. The turnout claim — retweeted based on Trump Jr.’s share more than 13,000 times — is absurd and based on a misunderstanding of basic election math. Twitter has since suppressed the original tweet, noting it ""might be misleading about an election."" It is misleading. Wisconsin had more than 3.6 million registered voters heading into Election Day, and more than 3.2 million Wisconsinites voted in the presidential race. But those aren’t the numbers used to calculate turnout here. For starters, Wisconsin allows same-day voter registration, so that number of registered voters goes up throughout the day. In 2016, for example, 12.7% of voters registered on Election Day, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Even more important, registered voters is the wrong figure entirely for calculating turnout. Voter turnout in a same-day registration state is based on the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot. So when you divide the number of votes cast in Wisconsin — 3,278,963 as of Nov. 5 — by the voting-age population in Wisconsin (4,536,293 as of 2019, according to the elections commission), you get a turnout rate of 72.3%.  That’s the highest rate ever behind the 2004 election, but solidly in the range of past presidential contests here. Recent presidential election turnouts in Wisconsin: 2020 — 72.3% 2016 — 67.3% 2012 — 70.4% 2008 — 69.2% 2004 — 72.9% 2000 — 67% It is also worth noting that while Biden received about 250,000 more votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did in 2016, Trump exceeded his own 2016 totals by 14.6% percent, or about 200,000 votes.  So, a good chunk of the increased turnout was due to his supporters. Trump Jr. shared a claim that Wisconsin’s turnout jumped from 67% in 2016 to 89% in 2020, and intimated it is due to fraud or something nefarious. But it’s due to bad math. Turnout is measured as a percentage of eligible voters, not registered voters. Trump Jr.’s figures use eligible voters for the 2016 figure but registered voters for 2020. Using the proper denominator for 2020 shows a turnout around 72%, firmly in the range of past presidential elections.

No, Wisconsin did not take a break from counting election results
","Misinformation about Wisconsin is flooding social media after yet another presidential race was decided in the key battleground state by a razor-thin margin.  Democratic nominee Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump by roughly 20,000 votes in Wisconsin, according to unofficial results reported by the Associated Press. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in a similarly close battle for the state four years ago, and Biden’s win will undoubtedly shape the outcome of the national race.  But an influx of absentee ballots cast in Wisconsin because of the coronavirus pandemic meant results took longer than usual to come in — allowing rumors and false information to fill in the gaps.  ""Wisconsin took a break, and when they returned, Biden coincidentally came back ahead by 100k,"" stated a tweet posted early on Nov. 4, 2020.  The tweet was cited in a viral Facebook post that claimed several key states with Democratic governors took a break from counting votes on election night.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). And no part of it is accurate. Election results in Wisconsin Election officials worked all night and into the early morning to count more than 3.2 million ballots, said Reid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. That included an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots that workers could not start counting until Election Day, per state law.  By the morning of the election, more than 1.9 million people had returned absentee ballots.  Trump enjoyed a lead of more than 100,000 votes in Wisconsin early in the night, but the picture quickly changed after the City of Milwaukee’s central count finished processing mail-in votes around 3:30 a.m. Milwaukee and 38 other municipalities tally all of their absentee ballots at one location, instead of individual polling places. It’s perfectly legal, but has the practical effect of large numbers being added at the same time. Other municipalities in the state count absentee ballots at the precinct level, so they are tallied along with in-person votes.  The late boost for Biden from Milwaukee was expected, especially because mail-in ballots tend to skew toward Democrats and Milwaukee is a Democratic stronghold.  After Milwaukee reported those returns, Biden jumped ahead of Trump by about 8,000 votes. His lead widened to around 20,000 after Green Bay reported in-person and absentee results and Kenosha finished its tally. So, two things: Biden was never up by 100,000 votes, and he will certainly not win Wisconsin by that much. It’s also ridiculous to suggest Wisconsin election officials ""took a break"" when they spent all night processing ballots. A delay in results does not mean the counting process stopped.  What’s more, people were permitted to observe the counting of absentee ballots in Wisconsin;  and Green Bay and Milwaukee even live-streamed the process online.  ""I think that it’s insulting for local election officials to say yesterday’s election was anything but an incredible success that was the result of years of preparation and meticulously, carefully following the law,"" Meagan Wolfe, the commission’s director, said in a news conference the morning after the election. The Facebook poster did not respond to a request for comment.  A viral Facebook post cites a tweet that claimed, ""Wisconsin took a break, and when they returned, Biden coincidentally came back ahead by 100k."" The Democratic nominee never held that great of a lead in Wisconsin, even when the Associated Press called the race. And some of the state’s election results arrived late due to an influx of mail-in ballots — not because officials ""took a break.""
