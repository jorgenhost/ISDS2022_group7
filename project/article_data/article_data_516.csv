Is Jim Justice right about a record surplus in 2019?
","Shortly before the start of the 2019 legislative session, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice touted the state’s improved budget position for the 2019 fiscal year. In a tweet sent on Jan. 8, Justice wrote, ""Another month of record-breaking revenue numbers! For December, we had a $44.8 million surplus. Year-to-date we are $185.9 million above estimates. This is the largest cumulative surplus for the first six months of any fiscal year in state history!"" Another month of record-breaking revenue numbers! For December, we had a $44.8 million surplus. Year-to-date we are $185.9 million above estimates. This is the largest cumulative surplus for the first six months of any fiscal year in state history! More: https://t.co/m56vOv3YZw pic.twitter.com/Uxz0gKCR5y Is that correct? Justice’s office didn’t respond to inquiries, but we were able to find supporting evidence. The tweet linked to a press release from the that detailed the list of revenues and expenses from the general revenue fund, and data from West Virginia State Budget Office supported the information in the press release. The general revenue fund for December -- the most recent completed period at the time of Justice’s tweet -- had a $44.8 million dollar surplus, with collections totaling $185.9 million more than had been estimated. That’s in line with Justice’s tweet. But is this actually the largest first-six-month surplus of any fiscal year in state history? Numbers from WV Checkbook and the West Virginia State Budget Office, with information dating back to 1999, confirm that through the first six months of the 2019 fiscal year, West Virginia did indeed have the largest cumulative surplus since 1999. The previous post-1999 high occurred in 2011,  when the budget surplus hit $159.9 million more than estimated. According to the governor’s office, the rise in collections can be attributed to an increased rate of growth in a number of taxes including severance tax, corporation net income tax, consumer sales tax and personal income tax. It’s worth noting that every year, West Virginia’s economy grows bigger, so comparing budget figures across time, as Justice did, is tricky. The state’s gross domestic product, when adjusted for inflation, was 14 percent bigger in 2017 than it was in 1999. Justice said for fiscal year 2019, West Virginia had ""the largest cumulative surplus for the first six months of any fiscal year in state history."" We checked the historical data and found that he’s correct going back to 1999. However, that’s not the entire history of the state. We couldn’t confirm any data prior to 1999, so it’s conceivable that there was a larger surplus prior to that year. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9BFD780>],/factchecks/2019/mar/06/jim-justice/jim-justice-right-about-record-surplus-2019/

Would one fentanyl seizure be able to kill every West Virginian 32 times over?
","When President Donald Trump announced that he would go around Congress to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border by declaring a national emergency, U.S. Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., tweeted a video supporting the idea. In the Feb. 15 video, Miller said, ""West Virginia has been hit especially hard by illegal drugs smuggled across our southern border. Just two weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl to kill every person in West Virginia 32 times over."" My statement regarding the President’s Declaration for a National Emergency to address the security and humanitarian crisis at the Southern Border: pic.twitter.com/XWckEhqx30 There’s no question that West Virginia has been hit hard by the opioid crisis -- PolitiFact West Virginia has previously reported that the state ranked No. 1 in the nation for opioid overdoses per capita. But what about the idea that a single federal seizure of fentanyl could have killed every West Virginian 32 times over? We took a closer look. Miller's office told us that they were referring to late January seizure of 254 pounds of fentanyl by Customs and Border Protection at the Nogales port of entry in Arizona. The drugs -- which were ""concealed within a special floor compartment of a trailer that was laden with cucumbers,"" according to the the agency -- represented the largest fentanyl seizure in the agency’s history. Miller’s office also walked us through the math they used to arrive at their figure. The seizure of 254 pounds converts to 115.2 kilograms. In turn, 115.212 kilograms equals 115.212 million milligrams. Miller’s office said it used 2 milligrams as a lethal dose of fentanyl, citing information from the Drug Enforcement Administration that 2 milligrams is ""a lethal dose for most people."" Meanwhile, 115.212 million milligrams works out to 57.606 million lethal doses of 2 milligrams each. West Virginia’s population in 2018 was 1,805,832. If you divide 57.606 millon lethal doses by 1,836,843, it means that amount of fentanyl could theoretically kill every West Virginian 31.8 times over. Rounded up, that works out to the 32 times that Miller cited. To make sure the 2 milligram threshold was sound, we checked with Timothy J. Pifer, the director of the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory, an expert on fentanyl and its lethality. ""Based upon research, toxicology reports and information from other agencies, two to three milligrams of fentanyl in its purest form could be fatal,"" Pifer said. However, he added that the technical details make a difference. For one thing, if you use the 3 milligram threshold instead, the Nogales seizure would be enough to kill every West Virginian about 21 times over, not 32. There would also be a difference in lethality depending on the age, body size, and health of the individual in question. In addition, Pifer added that ""is not clear whether or not the 254 pounds is pure fentanyl or fentanyl that has been already diluted for sale or distribution on the street."" The average degree of purity would make a difference in its lethality. One final point: Miller used the statistic to support the case for constructing a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the fentanyl was seized at a port of entry. A wall wouldn’t prevent that type of smuggling through established checkpoints.   Miller said, ""Just two weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl to kill every person in West Virginia 32 times over."" If you consider 2 milligrams to be a lethal dose -- which the Drug Enforcement Administration does -- then Miller’s estimate is very close to correct. The only caveat is that differences in purity and the health and size of the potential victim can make a difference. That said, there’s no question that the fentanyl from the seizure, spread evenly and effectively through the population, could have killed every West Virginia resident many times over. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD3CD80>],/factchecks/2019/mar/06/carol-miller/would-one-fentanyl-seizure-be-able-kill-every-west/

Cooper calls attention to aging North Carolina schools during annual address
","North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper called for more money to renovate the state’s aging public schools during his State of the State address on Feb. 25. ""Right now, four in 10 public schools in our state are at least 50 years old,"" Cooper said. ""That means they’re still using the schools you and I went to."" We wondered whether the state’s public schools are actually that old, so we decided to check out Cooper’s numbers ourselves. As it turns out, the data is not so easy to come by. We started with Jamal Little, the governor’s spokesman, who told us that the information about the ages of public schools came from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, which collected that data in 2016 while compiling its most recent survey on school facility needs. Little gave us a table that said 949 of 2,306 public schools that reported construction dates were at least 50 years old (325 schools did not report their dates). He said the table came from the Department of Public Instruction but was not publicly available online.  According to the table, about 41 percent of the schools that reported construction dates are more than 50 years old. But Drew Elliot, communications director for the Department of Public Instruction, said he could not confirm the table came from his department. He said he believes his office ""could get those numbers or something very close to it"" but could not validate them without a week’s time. ""We have no reason to think that his numbers are off,"" he said. ""Nothing in there looks anomalous to what we know about the age of school buildings in North Carolina."" We wanted more definitive evidence, so we asked Elliot for the data the state did have. He sent us a copy of the department’s list of construction dates so we could crunch the numbers for ourselves. That wasn’t easy. The list assigns multiple construction dates to each school, and it’s not immediately clear what each date refers to. But Elliot said the dates correspond to construction of ""separate structures"" and that the earliest date listed for each school would offer the best approximation of the school’s age. So, we did our best to sort through the raw numbers. It turns out that the number of old schools may actually be larger than Cooper claimed. Out of 2,631 total schools, we counted 2,299 that had construction dates listed beside them. And judging by the earliest dates listed for each, 1,118 of those 2,299 schools were built during or before 1969, making them at least 50 years old. That means that, by our calculations, nearly half the public schools are greater than 50 years old. But because the dates on the list were not labeled, even our calculations may be imperfect. Also, the totals could change with more information about the schools that did not report their ages for the 2016 survey. And there’s potentially a big caveat because some schools have been renovated since their original construction, making them ""newer"" than their age suggests. Cooper said, ""Right now, four in 10 public schools in our state are at least 50 years old."" The raw numbers from the department — the best information available — put Cooper’s statement in the right ballpark and showed it may even be an underestimate. But there are some uncertainties. So we rate this statement Mostly True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

No, Bernie Sanders didn't march with Fidel Castro in Cuba
","Editor’s note: This fact-check has been updated with additional information about the photo. A Facebook post identifies a man marching with Fidel Castro in Cuba as U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. It isn't really Sanders. ""Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and a young Bernie Sanders marching in Cuba,"" states the cutline underneath a black and white photo of a group of men marching together with their arms linked. The post, published on Facebook on Feb. 28, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo has a red arrow pointing to a man the Facebook post identifies as Sanders. But we found no evidence that it is Sanders. Sanders’ campaign spokesman Josh Orton told PolitiFact that Sanders never met with Castro or Guevara. We found the same photo with a different caption using a reverse image search. The caption said, ""Fidel Castro Left next to Osvaldo Dorticós (President of Cuba from 1959 until 1976) with Che Guevara at a 1959 parade in Havana."" The photo is credited to the World History Archive/Alamy Stock archive. Castro ruled Cuba for decades until 2008. Guevara was a major figure in the Cuban revolution led by Castro in the late 1950s. Where was Sanders in 1959? That’s the year he graduated from high school in Brooklyn. His spokesman said Sanders did not get on an airplane until 1961, when he attended the University of Chicago. The same photo of the men marching with a claim that one is Sanders appeared on an undated article by Gishop Gallop, which identifies itself as an entertainment website and has this warning in jest: ""Please do not let your children use this site. If something in one of the stories you see here is not true, that would mean it’s fiction. You can still do that without censorship – create fiction. You may see satire and that’s okay, too. If this offends you, you may want to look at a better use of your time than run-of-the-mill indignation. Your Chi will improve. This sentence legally follows the one preceding it."" Another sign that the Gishop Gallop story isn’t authentic is the bio for the author, ""Cleveland Sam,"" which is filled with silly anecdotes about his alleged heroism, such as rescuing a girl from the ""clutches of a herd of llamas"" and saving children from near deaths from ""freak ice cream truck accidents."" The undated story about Sanders in the photo also contains a number of other ridiculous statements about Sanders, including that he was born in Cuba but later fled on a trunk lid of a 1960 Chevrolet converted into a boat. After we posted this fact-check, we received an email from American University professor William LeoGrande, an expert on Latin American politics, about the identity of the man in the photo that the Facebook post falsely identified as Sanders. LeoGrande told us that the man in the photo was Regino Boti León, minister of the National Economic Council in the first Cuban council of ministers after 1959. The photo was taken March 5, 1960, during a march in memory of the victims of the explosion of the munitions ship La Coubre that Castro believed was sabotaged by the CIA, he said. He pointed to a more famous photo from the same march found on Wikimedia. It doesn’t show Boti León’s name in the description but he is listed in the categories at the bottom of the page. Another article about him also shows a photo of him in the march. Boti León came to the U.S. with Castro in April 1959 with the expectation of negotiating an economic aid agreement, LeoGrande said. ""But Castro forbid his advisers to ask for help and the State Department refused to offer it, so Castro went away empty handed. As the revolution radicalized, Boti was moved off center stage, but he remained loyal to the revolution, serving in a variety of positions until his death,"" he said. Professor Ted Henken, a Latino studies professor at Baruch College City College of New York, also confirmed that the photo is of Boti León. A cutline under a photo said that Bernie Sanders marched with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in Cuba. The same photo appeared on an entertainment website. A reverse image search showed that the historical photo includes Castro and Guevara at a 1959 parade in Havana, but we found no no evidence that Sanders is one of the men in the photo. Experts told us the man is Regino Boti León at a parade in 1960.

No, the 'Momo challenge' isn't real
","Warnings about a terrifying cyberbullying threat called the ""Momo challenge"" have spread like wildfire on the internet over the last week. It’s been confusing for any parent who has dared to peek at social media in that time. That’s because news reports about the challenge warned parents that a ghoul-like figure known as ""Momo"" was targeting unsuspecting children through the internet and encouraging them to hurt themselves. Some stories even included interviews with parents who said their children had seen this Momo creature while they were online. But it didn’t take long for news reports to reconsider the online warnings their seemingly legitimate news stories seemed to be perpetuating: Did the threat of the ""Momo Challenge"" have any grain of truth to it? Or was it a fear-preying hoax gone viral? We will cut to the chase: It’s all hype and hoax. The warning posts, such as this one, were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Try as we did, we could not find the actual ""challenge"" itself online. The only content that we found are the warning posts being shared by frightened parents, and news stories about it. Still, swaths of parents are claiming that they, or their kids, have seen Momo appear. While we couldn’t find the challenge on any platform, it doesn’t mean reinvented versions of the hoax won’t pop up. Unfortunately, pranksters, cyber bullies and copycats pick up on viral trends like this one, using them to frame their own set of challenges. Regardless, there is no evidence the threat is real. Depending on what you read, the challenge can take several forms. This is common when viral crazes spread at a rapid rate. Most of the warnings about Momo feature a photo of a ghoulish character with bulging eyes and dark stringy hair. The creepy Momo character is actually a sculpture called ""Mother Bird,"" the creation of a Japanese special effects company called Link Factory, which is not associated with the challenge. The piece was put on display at Tokyo’s horror art Vanilla Gallery in 2016, according to The Atlantic. A post shared by 𝐁𝐄𝐓𝐖𝐄𝐄𝐍 𝐌𝐈𝐑𝐑𝐎𝐑𝐒 (@between.mirrors) on Jul 15, 2018 at 9:33am PDT The warnings claim the character cuts into kids programs on YouTube and asks the viewer to text a phone number (sometimes using the WhatsApp application) that appears on the screen. Other warnings claim that contact is initiated by the participant when they search for the special phone number online and then send a text or WhatsApp message. Whichever way contact is made, the gaunt doll supposedly asks the viewer to complete challenges that may include waking up in the middle of the night to hurt themselves or others -- and, the claim goes, may even tell the viewer to commit suicide. Momo started as an internet urban myth in a subreddit thread in July 2018 and was thrust into the media spotlight later that month when a newspaper wrote that the game was linked to the suicide of a 12-year-old girl in Buenos Aires. Not long after, the suicides of a 12-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy in Colombia were also speculated to be connected to the challenge. But none of these circumstantial reports linking the game to the suicides have been proven. The challenge surfaced again in a Feb. 17 warning by a parent on a Facebook group for the town of Westhoughton, England. That warning turned into an article in a local paper before being picked up by national tabloids like the Daily Mail and Daily Star. It eventually made its way into more legitimate outlets such as the BBC. As the social media warnings multiplied, it didn’t take long for the viral story to catch on with news media in the United States. A flurry of local news stations hopped on the story, amplifying it to millions of parents. Media critics and others have criticized the coverage, chastising the news organizations that produced those segments for irresponsible reporting that gave the hoax fuel, adding to parents’ hysteria. The startling Momo image has become so recognizable due to the viral nature of this post, it would not be a stretch for a child to tell their parents that they have heard or seen Momo. Nor would it be unusual if a child reported finding the creature scary. That does not, however, mean that the child interacted with Momo online in the manner described in these online warnings. One upside to the Momo craze is that it may be spurring needed conversation among parents about their children’s internet use and the subjects that they are exposed to online. Parent Zone, a London-based organization that seeks to give parents the support they need help their children navigate the internet safely, says the reports and warnings about the challenge themselves can cause distress to children. ""It’s important that parents talk to their children about it. The best way to start is to ask a general question about whether they have seen anything online that upset or worried them,"" the organization said. ""Explain that there are often things that happen online that can be misleading or frightening and that some things are designed to get a lot of attention."" But Dr. Richard Freed, a child and adolescent psychologist and author of the book Wired Child, suggests that the conversation should go further than that. In an email to PolitiFact, Freed said he would like to see the Momo situation spark more parental introspection about the fact that children who spend long periods of time in front of screens are doing so at the expense of engaging in real-world activities. ""The upshot from many of the Momo stories is to tell parents to talk with their kids about problem content,"" he wrote. ""So, in essence, I think the matter can get too focused on making content better when in fact a lot of it is so compelling or potentially addictive for kids that they refuse to do much else."" In a Feb. 27 tweet, YouTube said it had no evidence of videos promoting the challenge. It has since demonetized content with the signature Momo image. We want to clear something up regarding the Momo Challenge: We’ve seen no recent evidence of videos promoting the Momo Challenge on YouTube. Videos encouraging harmful and dangerous challenges are against our policies. Any Momo-related content -- meaning even videos warning people about Momo -- is now being marked on the platform as ""identified by the YouTube community as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences."" If a restricted mode is placed on a child’s account, this content will not show up. Warning posts and news accounts flooding social media warn parents about the ""Momo Challenge,"" saying it is infiltrating kids’ programs online and encourages them to harm themselves or others. Some version of the challenge may exist now, with cyberbullies or copycats picking up on the viral trend, but there is no evidence to support that this challenge is real and there has been no confirmed link between the game and any deaths. Child psychologists and internet safety groups say the most important thing for parents to do is to consistently monitor their children’s internet use and to communicate frequently about the content their children are encountering online. We rate this internet rumor Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD58400>],/factchecks/2019/mar/05/facebook-posts/no-momo-challenge-isnt-real-its-just-another-inter/

No, the Black Panthers did not create the WIC program
","The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, has provided nutritional assistance and education to low-income malnourished mothers and children for nearly 50 years. Lately, posts on social media are circulating that claim the program was actually created by the Black Panthers. The posts say, ""Never forget WIC ‘women, infant and child’ was created by black panthers to help feed single mothers and their children in their communities."" It features a photo of Bobby Seale, co-founder of the Black Panther Party, standing among rows of paper grocery bags. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim that the Black Panther Party created the federal program made its way around the internet a few years ago, and appears to link it to the group’s free breakfast program. While it is possible the Panthers’ breakfast program may have helped inspire WIC, or other similar federal programs, the two are not one in the same. There is also no evidence that the party operated a program called WIC, or something similar. The federal government created WIC in 1972 as an amendment to the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. The legislation was sponsored by Sen. Hubert Humphrey and it was initially funded as a two-year pilot program. In 1975, legislation established WIC as a permanent national health and nutrition program. The motivation behind WIC has long been credited to various studies throughout the 1960s that identified malnutrition as a major national problem. The 1969 White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health, reported that hunger and poverty existed on a ""disgraceful scale"" in the United States and recommended that special attention be given to the nutritional needs of low-income pregnant women and preschool children. The Black Panther Party’s Free Breakfast for Children Program started in the group’s Oakland headquarters in 1969 and quickly expanded to party outposts nationwide, feeding thousands of children per day. Party members and volunteers reportedly went to local grocery stores to ask for donations, consulted with nutritionists on healthy breakfast options for children, and then prepared and served the food. The government’s 1966 Child Nutrition Act (that WIC was added to later on as an amendment) also established the pilot School Breakfast Program, which provided low-cost or free breakfasts to children in public schools. This was in operation three years before the Panthers’ breakfast program began. Social media posts claim the Black Panther Party created the federal nutritional assistance program WIC. The party did run many community initiatives, including its successful Free Breakfast for Children Program. While some believe the effort may have inspired the federal government to make its school breakfast program permanent, and by extension WIC as well, there is no evidence that the party created or ran WIC. The statement is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC05CB80>],/factchecks/2019/mar/05/facebook-posts/no-black-panthers-did-not-create-wic-program/

Was Bernie Sanders mute on race, gender at the top of his 2020 kickoff speech?
","If past is prologue, then Bernie Sanders’ efforts to win over African-American voters may prove challenging, especially as the Independent Vermont senator competes for the Democratic nomination against the most diverse candidate field in history. In 2016, black voters favored Hillary Clinton over Sanders by an astonishing 50 percentage points (though he had a slight lead among those under 30). But according to pundit and former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer Zerlina Maxwell, Sanders’ speech announcing his 2020 bid didn’t do much to shore up his support. Maxwell, speaking on MSNBC following Sanders’ remarks, said the senator had buried any mention of race and gender until deep into his 2020 presidential kickoff speech. ""I clocked it. He did not mention race or gender until 23 minutes into this speech,"" Maxwell said March 2. ""As somebody who is a black woman ... I was looking to hear messaging specifically for my community, and I did not, at least until 23 minutes into the speech. "" Later, she delivered the same message to her more than 150,000 Twitter followers — in a tweet that has since been deleted. But a review of the tape shows Sanders made mention of these constituencies earlier in his speech, a reference Maxwell now says she accidentally overlooked. Sanders staged his first 2020 campaign rally in Brooklyn, several miles from his birthplace. In opening remarks, he thanked his family and acknowledged several key supporters. Within the first five minutes of his speech, Sanders proposed a re-ordering of America’s governing principles, and made specific reference to race and gender (emphasis added): ""At our very first rally, I want to welcome you to a campaign, which says loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, hatred and lies. It will not be racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia and religious bigotry. It will not be tax breaks for billionaires and efforts to throw millions off the health care that they currently have. ""This campaign is going to end all of that. The principles of our government will be based on justice. On economic justice, on social justice, on racial justice, on environmental justice."" Sanders referenced race and gender again around 21 minutes into his speech. Sanders pledged a campaign to unify the country, he said, in contrast to President Donald Trump, who ""wants to divide us up based on the color of our skin, based on where we were born, based on our gender, based on our religion or our sexual orientation."" MSNBC aired the roughly 37-minute speech in its entirety. Afterwards, host Alex Witt turned to the panel for their reaction, at which point Maxwell claimed Sanders had been mute about race and gender until 23 minutes in. ""And just for point of comparison, I went back and looked at Elizabeth Warren’s opening speech,"" Maxwell said. ""She mentions race and gender in the first paragraph. So that’s a big difference."" Maxwell’s claim met with quick pushback. Journalist Glenn Greenwald noted that Sanders had been introduced by a series of speakers that included three African-Americans (among them was Greenwald’s colleague at the Intercept, Shaun King), each of whom highlighted the senator’s record as a champion of racial justice. Responding to criticism on Twitter, Maxwell walked back her initial claim. (She later deleted the erroneous initial tweet.) ""Ok. I’ve rewatched since yesterday and while I can acknowledge that I missed the passing line at 6 minutes I stand by my point since talking about criminal justice is not the same thing as talking about race and gender and if you don’t get why Bernie won’t win....again. ✌🏾"" she tweeted.

It’s worth noting that Sanders delivered another campaign speech March 3 that addressed race in more explicit terms. After commemorating the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Ala., Sanders delivered a speech in Chicago that called to ""end the institutional racism which permeates almost every aspect of our society."" Maxwell said, Sanders ""did not mention race or gender until 23 minutes into this speech"" announcing his 2020 presidential run.

Do 70% of the benefits from Trump's tax law benefit the wealthiest 1%, as Sen. Sherrod Brown says?
","U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown says he will decide by the end of March whether he will run for president in 2020. In the meantime, he’s been on a ""listening tour"" of early primary and caucus states such as Iowa and New Hampshire for more than a month. As the Ohio Democrat travels, one of the targets of his criticism is the Republican-backed tax-cut bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in December 2017. Brown, who along with all other Democratic senators voted against the bill, said of it: ""We need to throw out President Trump’s tax law — just completely throw it out and rewrite our tax code to put people first. We know what this last tax law did — 70 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent."" He made virtually the same statistical claim in at least two other interviews. It’s partially right. When PolitiFact evaluated the bill just before Trump signed it, we found that every income group would pay less in taxes in 2019, but that the benefits would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers. And by 2027, every income group below $75,000 would see a tax increase, while only those income ranges above $75,000 would still see a cut. The primary reason for that is some of the individual tax cuts phase out after 2025, because of congressional rules. By allowing some tax cuts to expire, the Republicans needed only 50 votes instead of 60 votes to change tax law. In this case, the tax changes that benefit lower-income people expire, while the measures that largely affect higher incomes do not. So-called reconciliation has been done numerous times in the past, by Democrats and Republicans, when their majorities in the Senate were strong enough only to meet the 50-vote threshold. Brown actually understated his claim, according to his Senate office. The office, citing a Vox news article, told us the senator should have said that 80 percent, not 70 percent, of the benefits of the tax law went to the wealthiest 1 percent. That article even went a bit further, saying nearly 83 percent of the law’s benefit would go to the top 1 percent. But that figure represents only one point in time for a law that spans 10 years. We’ve already rated as Half True a claim that 83 percent of the tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1 percent. That claim, like the Vox article, relied on an analysis that the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, did for three years. In two of the years studied, 1 percenters  — in 2018, those with income of more than $733,000 per year  — got an estimated 20.5 percent of the tax law’s benefits in 2018 and will get 25.3 percent of the benefits in 2025, according to the  analysis. Only in 2027 would an estimated 82.8 percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent of tax filers. Again, the shift occurs because most of the individual tax cuts end after 2025. That leaves corporate tax cuts, which do more to help upper income earners. (Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker and FactCheck.org also rated 83 percent claims and came up with conclusions similar to our Half True.) James Hines Jr., a University of Michigan professor of economics, told us that the Tax Policy Center is well respected for such estimates, but he also pointed to estimates done by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. In 2019, according to the committee, the top 1 percent get an estimated 23.4 percent of the tax law’s benefits — similar to the Tax Policy Center’s estimate of the early impact of the tax law. By 2027, the 1 percent would actually get more than 100 percent of the tax law’s benefits, by the committee’s calculation. That’s because the joint committee included in its analysis the impact of the tax law effectively repealing the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate in 2019. The repeal means lower- and middle-income taxpayers lose tax credits they would have received by buying health insurance on the health law’s exchanges, the Tax Policy Center’s Joseph Rosenberg told us. A final note: Adam Michel, a tax policy and federal budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that the two sets of estimates appear accurate for what they measure, but that it only makes sense that people with larger incomes would get larger tax cuts in terms of total dollars. But Michel said that many lower-income people get more than a 15 percent cut in their taxes paid, while wealthier people may only get an 8 percent cut in their taxes. Brown says that with the Trump tax law, ""70 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent."" One nonpartisan analysis estimates that in 2027, the top 1 percent will receive 83 percent of the benefits of the law that Trump signed. And another analysis puts that figure even higher for 2027. But both analyses estimate that through 2025, the 1 percent gets about 20 percent to 25 percent of the tax cuts. Brown’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important information. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC88F500>],/factchecks/2019/mar/05/sherrod-brown/do-70-benefits-trumps-tax-law-benefit-wealthiest-1/

Meme wrong about Somali-Americans in Ilhan Omar's district
","Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., hasn’t been in Congress long, but she has already inspired controversy among both Republicans and Democrats. Omar, who took her seat two months ago, is one of two newly elected Muslim women in Congress, and her comments about Israel have drawn official and unofficial rebukes. In one case, she tweeted that support for Israel in Congress is ""all about the Benjamins."" A Republican motion to condemn anti-Semitism, widely seen as a rebuke of her comment, passed the House, 424-0, and she apologized. A few weeks later, however, Omar said at a public event, ""I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country."" This led the House Democratic leadership to pursue another vote denouncing anti-Semitism. Amid the controversy, Omar has become a target for conservatives on social media. One image read, ""Obama settled 43,000 Somalian refugees in Minnesota. As of 2016, there were around 80,000. No wonder Ilhan Omar was elected. It was planned."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Minneapolis area is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, hub for Somali-Americans in the country, and many of them came as refugees. Omar herself came to the United States as a refugee in 1995. However, the post is wrong on multiple levels. For refugee resettlement figures on Obama’s watch, we turned to an interactive website from the Refugee Processing Center that provides data going back to 2002. As it turns out, 6,320 refugees from Somalia were resettled in Minnesota between 2009 and 2017, when Obama served as president. That’s about one-seventh of the amount claimed in the meme. That’s fewer than the number settled in Minnesota during the final seven years of the George W. Bush presidency. From 2002 to 2008, the government resettled 9,858 Somalis in Minnesota. During the Obama years, 54,514 Somali refugees were resettled nationally, meaning that Minnesota accounted for about 11.5 percent of the national total. During the Bush years, the national total was 46,439, making Minnesota’s share higher under Bush than it was under Obama, at 21.2 percent. There aren’t even 80,000 Somalis living in Minnesota -- much less 80,000 Somali refugees living there, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau’s five-year estimate found between 42,400 and 55,200 Somalis living in Minnesota, in 13,000 to 16,500 households. ""Numbers vary, largely because of census undercounts and secondary migration that might not document people properly,"" said Stefanie Chambers, a Trinity College political scientist who has studied the Somali-American community in the United States. Omar won the Democratic nomination with 65,237 votes, which was 24,081 votes ahead of her closest competitor. (In such a strongly Democratic district, the Republican nominee ended up losing to Omar, 78 percent to 22 percent.) So was the Somali-American electorate in the district the main reason she won the all-important primary? We don’t have exact figures, but we were able to reverse-engineer some answers. According to the refugee resettlement data, we found that the major jurisdictions of the 5th district -- mainly Minneapolis, but a few others as well -- received roughly half of the Somali refugees who were resettled in the state under both Bush and Obama. If we use the high end of the Census Bureau’s statewide estimate for Somali Americans in Minnesota -- 55,200 -- then this means the 5th district was probably home to about 27,600 Somali Americans. So, Omar won more than 65,000 primary votes in a district that likely had about 27,600 Somali-Americans. This means she had to have won tens of thousands of votes from non-Somalis. And even this probably overstates the impact of Somali-American voters. Not all of the 27,600 Somalis in the district are able to vote, since Minnesota’s Somali population skews young. In addition, even those who were eligible to vote may not have turned out at the polls. The district as a whole saw only 18.8 percent of the population turn out to vote in the primary. If the district’s Somali population turned out at that rate, no more than about 5,000 Somali voters would have cast a primary ballot. And 5,000 votes would have been less than one-tenth of Omar’s primary vote total, and only about one-fifth of her margin of victory. The idea that Omar’s victory was preordained by demographics is ridiculous. No one forced the voters of the 5th congressional district of Minnesota to vote for Omar.  As we’ve shown, the pattern of Somali settlement in Minnesota long predated Obama’s tenure in the White House. So the viral image has no grounds for singling out Obama. The viral image said, ""Obama settled 43,000 Somalian refugees in Minnesota. As of 2016, there were around 80,000. No wonder Ilhan Omar was elected. It was planned."" The meme significantly overstates the number of Somali refugees settled under Obama in Minnesota, the total number of Somali refugees in the state, and the impact that Somali voters could have had on the primary election results, much less the lopsided general election. In no way can Omar’s victory have been ""planned,"" by Obama or anyone else. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB864580>],/factchecks/2019/mar/05/viral-image/meme-wrong-about-somali-americans-ilhan-omars-dist/

No, this isn't a photo of the Sundance Kid
","As Americans recognized Black History Month in February, an incorrect claim about a famous outlaw appeared on Facebook. ""The ‘Sundance Kid’ was an outlaw and member of Butch Cassidy’s Wild Bunch in the American Old West,"" reads the text over what looks like an old portrait of a black man and woman. ""He is pictured here with girlfriend Etta Place."" The post, which was published on Facebook on Feb. 26, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Etta Place was the girlfriend of the Sundance Kid, né Harry Alonzo Longabaugh. In the 1969 movie ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" Longabaugh was played by Robert Redford and Place was played by Katharine Ross. But a photo of the real-life pair does not resemble the Facebook post. Sundance, by historical accounts, had white skin. The picture posted on Facebook is not Longabaugh and Place. Some history: Longabaugh got his nickname after stealing a horse near Sundance, Wyo., in 1887. He met Place in the mid 1890s and the duo dovetailed with Butch Cassidy after taking up in a tent at Robbers Roost, an outlaw hideout in southeastern Utah, according to History.com. Longabaugh was supposedly the best shot and fastest gunslinger in the Wild Bunch, a group of ""robbers and rustlers who ranged through the Rocky Mountains and plateau desert regions of the West in the 1880s and ‘90s,"" a post on Britannica says. In the introduction to a 2009 book about Longabaugh, one of his descendants, Paul Ernst, writes that an ancestor of the outlaw emigrated from Germany to the Colonies in the 1770s. (PolitiFact wrote the publisher of the book in hopes of reaching Ernst or his wife, Donna Ernst, who wrote the biography, but we did not immediately receive a response.) We couldn’t find the origins of the photo on Facebook. A Reddit post from last year describes the image as a couple in the late 1800s. In 2015, a Twitter account named Black History Heroes calls it a ""vintage tintype photograph of African American couple, circa late 1800s."" In the 19th century, according to PBS, ""the Wild West drew enslaved blacks with the hope of freedom and wages."" African-Americans made up at least a quarter of cowboys, the broadcasting system said in a post about black history facts, and it’s believed that the real ""Lone Ranger"" was inspired by a black man named Bass Reeves. Of course, we can’t tell someone’s race from a photo. But two photos here of Longabaugh, including one from the Library of Congress, do not look like the image that appeared on Facebook. Neither does this one. When we asked John Barton, a history lecturer at Utah State University, about the Facebook post he said: ""good picture, but not Sundance and Etta."" He shared several photos of the actual couple, including one taken in New York before they went to South America with Butch Cassidy. ""He was not black,"" Barton said. ""The Sundance Kid,"" by Donna Ernst, ""is quite clear on his early years. There was a black outlaw named Isom Dart that rode with Butch and Sundance from time to time. That might be the confusion.""

Evers reverses course on pledge to ‘raise no taxes’
","""Read my lips: no new taxes."" George H.W. Bush made the pledge while accepting the Republican nomination for president in 1988. It became one of the most famous broken promises in history after Bush struck a deal with a Democratic Congress and raised taxes in 1990. Is there an echo in the 2018 Wisconsin governor’s race? Gov. Tony Evers spent months on the campaign trail saying he would consider raising taxes if elected, before a pre-election pivot. ""I’m planning to raise no taxes,"" the Democrat told The Washington Post on Nov. 1, 2018. ""I’m planning on raising no taxes,"" he told WISN-TV on Nov. 4, 2018. But when Evers revealed his budget to state lawmakers Feb. 28, 2019, it included more than $1 billion in tax increases across the two-year period. So we are returning to our Flip-O-Meter, which we use to gauge whether a politician has changed his or her position. Our standard reminder: We are not rating whether any change is good or bad politics or policy — just whether the politician has been consistent. Polls showed Evers in a dead heat with incumbent Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, in early November when he changed his tune on tax increases. RELATED: Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers flips position on dissolving WEDC Evers had said throughout the campaign he would consider raising taxes if elected, but on at least two occasions in early November he pledged that would not be the case. The Washington Post described an exchange this way in a Nov. 1, 2018 story: Evers said he would give $1.5 billion in state aid to school districts if he is elected. Walker says Evers would raise taxes to do all he is pledging to do. Evers, in a telephone interview, responded by saying: ""He is a liar. . . . I’m planning to raise no taxes."" Evers spokesman Sam Lau said afterward that Evers' quote in the Post was a reference to a plan to cut income taxes for the middle class and scale back a tax break for farmers and manufacturers, though the story did not reference any such context. Three days later, Evers made a nearly identical pledge in an interview on WISN-TV’s UpFront with Mike Gousha. Gousha asked about Walker’s claim that Evers would have to raise taxes to fund his promises. ""I’m planning on raising no taxes,"" Evers said. ""The idea that somehow he’s put me in this position of saying I’m going to tax, that’s just crazy. I’ve never said that. We’re going to be working on making sure that the middle class of the state of Wisconsin is protected with a tax cut."" That brings us to the position of the now-governor. Evers introduced a two-year, $83 billion budget that would repeal the state’s right-to-work law, raise the minimum wage and expand the BadgerCare Plus health care program through Obamacare. And it would raise the gas tax by $485 million and other taxes by more than $550 million. Evers’ plan — which Republicans show no sign of supporting — aims to balance out an 8-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase by ending the state’s minimum markup law, which in most cases makes retailers raise the price 9.18 percent above the wholesale price. The governor was asked March 1, 2019, how that budget fit with his prior pledge not to raise taxes. ""I understand there’s some tax increases. Obviously one of them’s the gas tax, but the reason the budget is the way it is is that we listened to the people of Wisconsin,"" Evers told reporters in Appleton. ""They said they wanted better schools, more adequately resourced schools. They said they wanted health care, and affordable and accessible health care. And they said they wanted to fix the roads. So those issues, basically there’s a cost involved in that."" Three days later, Evers doubled down on the need for tax increases, saying a funding increase for the University of Wisconsin and major interstate improvements likely wouldn’t happen without the tax increases Republicans oppose. ""We have to have revenue,"" Evers said. Asked about the reversal, Evers’ staff didn’t dispute the change but defended the rationale and results.

""Under the governor’s proposal, the median family of four will save more than $1,000 on their income taxes this biennium,"" Melissa Baldauff, Evers’ deputy chief of staff, said in an email. ""To help fund this needed tax relief for the middle-class, the governor limits tax provisions that benefit a narrow sliver of taxpayers to bring them more closely in line with other claimants."" With the election bearing down in November, Evers told Wisconsinites he wouldn’t raise taxes. Now his first budget as governor includes proposals that would raise taxes by more than $1 billion. He offered an explanation for the increases and in one case is seeking to negate an increase with other changes. But that all still adds up to a tax increase. And that’s a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC863DC0>],/factchecks/2019/mar/05/tony-evers/tony-evers-reverses-course-pledge-raise-no-taxes/

GOP has put more blacks on key Va. House committees than Democrats did in their day
","The General Assembly recently took strides to change how Virginia draws its political maps, despite opposition from most black delegates. It passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would create a commission of citizens and lawmakers to draw congressional and state legislative districts. The process has long been in the sole hands of the legislature, leading to charges of gerrymandering. Although the resolution unanimously passed the Senate and cleared the House on an 83-15 vote, 11 of 14 black delegates voted against it. Several said the proposed amendment - which must approved by the legislature again next before it’s put to voters - offers no guarantee of black representation on the redistricting commission. They also complained that black legislators weren’t included in negotiations between the House and Senate that ironed out the final version of the redistricting resolution. That brought Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, to his feet. Jones, who is white, has been a  delegate for 21 years. He urged passage of the resolution and said Republicans, during two decades of controlling the House, have a strong record empowering black delegates. ""Republicans have had more African-Americans on key committees than when the Democrats were in control,"" he said. We wondered if Jones is right. Background Jones told us the ""key committees"" he was referring to are the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee, and the Commerce and Labor Committee, which controls business regulations. The House has an informal rule that no member can serve on both. Jones is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We also spoke Del. Lamont Bagley, D-Richmond, chairman of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus. He agreed with Jones’ definition of ""key committees."" The last time Democrats controlled the 100-seat House was 1997, when there were 52 Democrats, 47 Republicans and one independent. This year, Republicans have 51 seats; Democrats, 49. The party in power chooses the speaker, who controls all committee assignments. Delegates lobby to serve on prestigious panels and committee chairmen often urge the speaker to assign certain lawmakers to their groups. The final decision, however, rests with the speaker. In 1997, the speaker was Tom Moss, a Democrat from Norfolk. This year, it’s Kirk Cox, a Republican from Colonial Heights. It’s important to note that the number of black delegates has increased. In 1997, there were 10; now there’s 14. If strict proportionality was a House rule (which it’s not), then blacks would have occupied 10 percent of each committee’s seats in 1997, and 14 percent this year. Numbers In 1997, three black lawmakers served on the 22-member Appropriations Committee, which was roughly proportional to their House membership. This year, six black members  are on the panel - double their proportion in the House. In 1997, two black legislators served on the Corporations, Insurance and Banking Committee - which became the Commerce and Labor Committee. This year, four are on the panel. That’s one more than they would have under proportionality. A side note: In 1997, Democrats didn’t have today’s informal rule that no one serves on both Appropriations and Commerce and Labor. One black legislator - the late William Robinson Jr., D-Norfolk - served on both panels. In other words, only four of 10 black delegates had seats on a key committees. This year, 10 of 14 black delegates sit on a key committee. Other House committees Here are the minority breakdowns of the other House committees in existence since at least 1997, although they do not influence this fact-check. We list the year, the number of blacks on the panel, and the number of seats on the committee. We asked Bagby, chairman of the Black Caucus, if he had concerns about minority committee appointments in the House. ""No arguments there,"" he said. The Senate We wanted to give you the state Senate numbers, although they, too, don’t count in this fact-check. Partisan control of the chamber, unlike the House, has fluctuated this century. The last time Democrats controlled the 40-member Senate was 2011. There were five black senators then, the same number as today. In the budget-writing Finance Committee, minority members fell from 3 of 15 in 2011 to 2 of 16 this year.  The 15-member Senate Commerce and Labor Committee rose from two blacks in 2011 to three this year. Here are the other Senate committee breakdowns: Our ruling   Jones said,  ""Republicans have had more African-Americans on key committees than when the Democrats were in control."" He later said he was referring to the House  Appropriations Committee and the Commerce and Labor Committee - a delineation that the chairman of the Black Caucus agrees with. There were three black members of Appropriations in 1997 - the last time Democrats controlled the House. Now there are six. There were two black legislators serving on the committee that became Commerce and Labor; now there’s four. We need to consider that the number of black delegates in the 100-member House rose from 10 in 1997 to 14 today. In other words, while black representation in the House rose by 40 percent during that span, it increased by 100 percent on Appropriations and 50 percent on Commerce & Labor.

Chicago ID card does not allow voting by immigrants in the country illegally

""So, to be clear: the same Democrats who want to impeach President Trump for colluding with foreigners to interfere in our elections, are illegally colluding with foreigners to interfere in our elections.""

The post appears to be referring to Chicago’s ""CityKey,"" an optional, valid, government-issued ID card available to all Chicago residents — regardless of immigration status. Chicago’s city council in April 2017 passed an ordinance authorizing the implementation of the CityKey program. The card is for identification purposes and also serves as a library card and transit card. It can also be used to get discounts at museums, certain businesses and sporting events. Since it’s an identification card, U.S. citizens can also use it to register to vote. But that doesn’t mean it ""allows"" immigrants in the country illegally to also register or participate in the election process. ""The law has not changed: only U.S. citizens who meet other eligibility requirements such as age can register to vote. Possessing a CityKey does not change that,"" said Janece Ortiz, director of Chicago CityKey, within the city clerk’s office. ""To be perfectly clear, this office would never encourage any person who is ineligible to vote to do so."" Federal law prohibits non-U.S. citizens from voting for candidates seeking federal offices, such as the presidency or a seat in Congress. A few municipalities across the country let non-U.S. citizens vote in local elections if it’s allowed by a state constitution, statute or local ordinance. (Non-U.S. citizens includes immigrants with lawful permanent residence and immigrants here illegally.) But Chicago is not one of these cities. Non-U.S. citizens cannot vote for city offices or state offices, said Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Elections. Regardless of their immigration status, parents in Chicago can vote for Local School Councils at the school level, Allen said. Traditional Local School Councils include the principal, parents, community representatives, teachers, a non-teacher representative and a student representative. (Chicago Board of Education members are appointed by the mayor.) ""Local School Council elections are nothing like standard elections,"" Allen said. ""LSC elections do not involve voter registration, they are not governed by the Election Code, and they are not managed by election authorities.""

Glenn Beck host says Obama may soon be able to shut down the Internet
","We've gotten a lot of e-mails from readers asking us to weigh in on the claim that President Barack Obama may soon be able to use a ""kill switch"" to shut down and take over the Internet. The rumors, which are spreading like wildfire through the technology blogosphere, are tied to a bill currently pending in Congress that would allow the president to implement ""short-term emergency measures"" to protect the United States from a cyber attack. Discussion about the bill came up on a June 28, 2010, segment of the Glenn Beck show, guest-hosted by Judge Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News contributor. Napolitano argued that the bill is a ""power grab"" by the government, and that private companies are more than capable of protecting themselves against cyber-attacks. ""There are mechanisms in place to shut down the Internet privately,"" said Napolitano. We wondered whether Napolitano is right that private Internet providers have it all under control. First, however, a little primer on cyber attacks. The most common are ""penetration attacks"" and ""denial of service"" attacks. The former consist of an unauthorized individual or group accessing a computer network. The latter entails crippling system functionality, which can result in a network shutdown. As an example, malicious hackers can take entire websites offline by generating so many access requests that the server comes to a halt. In August 2009, hackers used a denial of service attack to temporarily bring down Twitter. We should note that ""shutting down the Internet"" is just one of the many ways to respond to a cyber attack, and probably not the best one at that. Michael Locasto, a computer security expert from University of Calgary, told us that in most cases, eliminating the Internet infrastructure ""would be the absolute worst course of action system defenders could take,"" since it would make it much more difficult to coordinate efforts against a large-scale threat. A much better option would be to filter certain kinds traffic that was deemed harmful, said Mark Rasch, a technology expert and a former Department of Justice attorney. That may be what Napolitano had in mind when he made the claim, but the wording of his statement makes it seem as though service providers could just take every network in the country offline and the problem would be solved. Beyond that, the several experts we spoke with agreed that it is technologically possible for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to significantly limit the flow of Internet traffic. ""If 'shutting down the Internet' means denying network access to everyone outside the U.S., or to everyone inside the U.S., then there is no fundamental scientific or technological barrier to achieving it,"" said Steven Low, professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology. Although the Internet consists of tens of thousands of computer networks, the core infrastructure is largely controlled by a few large providers, so-called Tier-1 ISPs. If these providers decided to stop routing Internet traffic or dropped connections with their peers, we'd see major disruptions in connectivity. There are, however, a few caveats. First, experts disagree on how difficult it would be for service providers to coordinate with one another during a widespread cyber attack. ""We've never had a widespread cyber attack against the U.S., and no one has ever had to coordinate any response to such an event. In fact, it isn’t clear we have any proper response strategy as a nation,"" said Salvatore Stolfo from Columbia University. Michael Locasto told us that the network operator community is fairly tight-knit, so ""it is conceivable that (network operators) could coordinate a response to a major event and terminate basic connectivity within a matter of minutes."" Network operators who maintain the Internet backbone share cell phone information, have regular meetings, and often work together through established channels in emergencies. Still, such a move would necessarily involve coordination by many people and groups. By design, the Internet does not have any form of ""central authority."" During an attack, private providers, who are often required by legal contracts to supply Internet access, would have to jointly agree to cut service. Some of our experts said that an attempt to put large segments of the Internet offline would most likely require some form of political and military involvement, not to mention corporate approval. ""I don't think that it can be done without some kind of government mandate (or) state of emergency,"" Christopher Kruegel of University of California Santa Barbara said. Additionally, government agencies and the military use Internet networks that are only loosely connected to the wider network available to the public to browse websites and send e-mail. These limited-access networks are owned by private companies, but the providers are under strict contracts and regulation. So any attempt to cut off those connections would almost certainly require government involvement. Napolitano claimed that ""there are mechanisms in place to shut down the Internet privately."" The experts we spoke with told us that it is technically possible for large service providers to severely limit Internet connectivity. Moreover, there are both formal and informal channels for network operators who manage the Internet backbone to communicate with each other in times of emergencies. Still, there was disagreement among our experts on how difficult it would be for ISPs to coordinate with one another and whether the government would have to get involved. It is clear, however, that the government would have to participate in order to shut down its own networks, and there is an argument to be made that ""shutting down the Internet"" might hurt the response to a cyber attack more than it would help.

Senor inflates Japan's interest payments
","It's hard to talk about the economy without mentioning debt. That point was clear during this week's segment of ABC's This Week. Talking about stimulus spending and unemployment benefits, the round-table discussion eventually turned to the question of debt and long-term fiscal sustainability. ""You begin to get in a situation where the interest payments on the debt become unsustainable, the debt becomes unsustainable, and there's a lot of uncertainty. There's uncertainty now about the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, the impact that'll have on the economy, the impact on health care, the Obamacare spending, what impact that will have, possible cap and trade. And people are just sitting on the sidelines saying, 'Where does this end?'"" said Daniel Senor, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Bush administration official. To demonstrate his point, Senor brought up Japan as an example of a country whose debt is unsustainable. ""I mean, if you look at just the interest payments alone that the Japanese government pays, it accounts for 25 percent -- the interest on its own debt, 25 percent of its national budget,"" said Senor. That comment caught the attention of Paul Krugman, a Princeton economist who was also at the round-table. ""That's just not right,"" objected Krugman. Jake Tapper, the show host, moved the argument along, but not before inviting PolitiFact to act as an objective judge. So we decided to investigate. We'll leave the debate about Japan's financial stability to economists, however, and focus on the numbers. Is a quarter of Japan's budget going solely to the interest payments on its debt? The details of Japan's fiscal condition are nicely summarized in a document put out by the Japan Ministry of Finance in February 2010. Page two of the report indicates that Japan spends 22.4 percent of its budget on ""national debt servicing."" Debt servicing consists of interest rate payments and bond redemption, which is essentially a repayment of the loan principal. Looking at interest rate expenses alone, that percentage is 10.6 percent. One can also look at the percentage as compared with the budget that does not include debt-related expenditures. That works out to 13.7 percent. Either way, Senor was off by a significant amount. We checked with Senor, who told us that even if we go with the 13.7 percent, his broader point stands -- Japan's debt is not sustainable. As we said before, that's a mess we'll leave to the economists. Our goal was to see if Senor was using the correct figures, and we found that he wasn't. Even if we go with the higher of the two figures, Senor missed the target by nearly half. For that, we give him a False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACABAC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/06/daniel-senor/senor-inflates-japans-interest-payments/

Obama deported more people in his first year than Bush did in his last, Spanish-language news anchor says
","On the July 4, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, Jorge Ramos -- a prominent news anchor for Univision, the Spanish-language television network -- said that ""President Barack Obama has deported more people in his first year in office than George W. Bush in his last year in office."" With immigration policy a hot political topic these days, we thought Ramos' statement was worth checking. When we contacted Ramos, he said the information had come from the White House. The White House, in turn, referred us to the Department of Homeland Security. A DHS spokesman provided us with the deportation statistics updated through June 7, 2010, though not all the numbers have been officially released yet. In fiscal year 2008 (which ran from Oct. 1, 2007, through Sept. 30, 2008), there were 369,221 deportations. During fiiscal year 2009 (which ran from Oct. 1, 2008, through Sept. 30, 2009) there were 387,790 deportations. That's an increase of 18,569 from one year to the next, a jump of about 5 percent. So, using these numbers, Ramos is correct. It's worth mentioning a few caveats however. • The fiscal years do not square precisely with presidential years. Fiscal year 2008 was entirely under Bush, while fiscal year 2009 consisted of four months under Bush and eight under Obama. So using the raw fiscal-year figures doesn't quite prove the Bush-Obama comparison.  • It's not clear that Obama policies deserve credit (or blame, depending on your perspective) for any increase in deportations, as Ramos implies. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesman for the Migration Policy Institute, said that ""deportation numbers have been on a steadily upward trajectory"" since 2002, due to a number of policy changes initially undertaken during the Bush administration. Indeed, between 2002 and 2008, deportations rose by 117 percent.  • DHS also provided totals for part of fiscal year 2010 -- the portion from Oct. 1, 2009, through June 7, 2010. That number was 227,163. If you prorate that amount to a full 12 months, you get a full-year total of 330,419 -- which is less than each of the two previous years. However, immigration experts said that deportations are not spaced equally throughout the year, meaning that prorating is not necessarily valid.  In our view, these caveats add a bit of uncertainty to Ramos' otherwise clear comparison. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAB00C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/06/jorge-ramos/obama-deported-more-people-his-first-year-bush-did/

Democrat Jeff Weems says Republican foe has been an out-of-sight groundhog since March primaries
","  Houston lawyer Jeff Weems, the Democratic nominee for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, says his November opponent is so low, he’s below ground.  ""I’m running against a groundhog,"" Weems said June 26 at the Texas Democratic Party’s convention in Corpus Christi. ""He saw his shadow on the primary day, and no one has seen him since."" Say what?  Weems had already flashed a flair for appellations; he called his opponent a ""potted plant"" in June 25 remarks to the convention’s United Auto Workers caucus. Later, he told us in an e-mail he’s crossed paths with GOP nominee David Porter only once since the March 2 primaries; the two spoke separately at an April event in Wichita Falls. Weems said Porter’s campaign website and Facebook page reflect ""a similar lack of activity."" He said the online Texas Tribune ""has been trying to schedule a debate or meeting or panel discussion with the two of us, but his campaign will not return their phone calls."" Michael Blunk, Weems’ campaign assistant, followed up in an e-mail, saying: ""We call David a groundhog because he's not showing his face any more, he went back into hiding."" Porter, a CPA who lives in Giddings but has long practiced in Midland, hasn’t proved a media hound before or after upsetting the better-funded GOP incumbent, Victor Carrillo, in their primary, a search for news articles suggests. Shortly after the primary, the Midland Reporter-Telegram quoted Porter, who had long been a local businessman, insisting he wasn’t running a stealth campaign; the candidate was quoted saying he’d done mailouts, in-person campaigning and made online efforts to reach voters before the primary. Using the Nexis search tool, we found 17 articles about Porter and the railroad commission published from January until the March primary. From then through June, there have been 41 articles or blogs mentioning Porter and the commission, most of them reflecting on Carrillo’s loss. Our search yielded one mention of a Porter campaign stop; on April 18, the Wichita Falls Times Record News included a sentence about Weems and Porter appearing at the April 21 Alliance of Energy Producers meeting in Wichita Falls. Of course, minimal news coverage doesn’t prove a candidate is deliberately out of sight. A Nexis search for articles on Weems and the commission from January through June delivered 34 results. Down-ballot candidates nearly always draw less attention than, say, aspirants for governor or the U.S. Senate. To get a feel for Porter’s online outreach, we read his Twitter posts. Snippets: On March 3, Porter announced Barry Williamson, a former railroad commissioner, as his campaign chairman; on May 20, the candidate said he was heading to a GOP meeting in Lee County; on June 17, he hailed the backing of Michael Williams, current commissioner; and on June 28, Porter wrote: ""Last week was busy with several meetings in Houston, and Austin and ending up Saturday night at the Bastrop Tea Party with about 250 people."" About 15 minutes later, he wrote: ""Know of an event I should attend? Please email [email protected]"" Seeking other signs of campaign activity, we looked at Porter’s campaign site, which didn’t list any events. So, stealth candidate after all? Not so, said Corbin Casteel of Austin, Porter’s general consultant. Casteel said Porter has been balancing a wind-down of his accounting business with politics; during May and June the candidate made 33 campaign stops in nine counties including Bastrop, Travis, Tarrant, Dallas and Harris. ""It’s all energy (group) meetings and GOP leader meetings,"" Casteel said.  Casteel declined to share details of the stops, saying that would play into Weems’ hands. ""We’re not going to let him bait you into us releasing (Porter’s) political activity,"" Casteel said. Ahead, Casteel said, Porter plans to attend events hosted by the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association and natural gas companies and he’ll make a tour of more than 40 counties.  Casteel called Weems’ claim Porter has not returned the Tribune’s calls ""a lie."" Ross Ramsey, the Tribune’s managing editor, said it hasn’t had communication difficulties with either campaign. One event Porter likely won’t join: a debate. ""Jeff Weems is a litigator,"" Casteel said. ""David Porter is an accountant. Why would we put our candidate in that position, to stand in front of a podium?"" We asked about Porter’s infrequent Twitter posts. Casteel said: ""David is being true to himself and who he is as a person and candidate. He’s not going to use social media in a way to produce faux activity."" Trying another tack, we contacted officials with groups that watch the commission closely. Bill Stevens, executive vice president of the energy alliance, said that since the primary, Porter has participated in a 30-minute conference call with the alliance and came to its Wichita Falls meeting. Wayne Hughes, executive vice president of the Panhandle Producers & Royalty Owners Association, said Porter provided answers for a questionnaire printed in the group’s May newsletter. Asked if the GOP hopeful has otherwise seemed out of sight, Hughes replied: ""We don’t have any guidelines for judging Mr. Porter’s appropriateness as a candidate. We feel like we have a clear picture of what Mr. Weems is all about and his appropriateness as a candidate. Can I stop there?"" We informed Weems of the activities summarized by Porter's campaign. He stood by his convention critique. Our suss: Porter has kept a low profile, but that does not a Punxsutawney candidate make. The Democrat's statement is Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE6CE00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/06/jeff-weems/democrat-jeff-weems-says-republican-foe-has-been-o/
"['Georgia', 'Candidate Biography', 'Rob Teilhet']","
Did lawmaker from Cobb represent the entire state?
","Politicians are always looking for an edge in a close race. In the contest between the two Democrats for attorney general, candidate Rob Teilhet is using his time under the Gold Dome to try to claim an advantage over his opponent, Ken Hodges.Elected four consecutive times since 2002 to serve a portion of Cobb County in the Georgia Legislature, Teilhet said in a questionnaire that he ""represented"" the entire state.""As the only Democratic candidate (for attorney general) who has represented the entire state of Georgia, I'm uniquely positioned to introduce and implement groundbreaking public policy designed to curtail crime, consumer fraud and public corruption,"" Teilhet wrote.We were curious about this one. Teilhet explained.""You are elected to represent a district, but you also serve the state of Georgia,"" he said.Teilhet pointed us to the oath of office for the 180-member state House of Representatives.Here's the first part of the oath: ""I do hereby solemnly swear or affirm that I will support the Constitution of this state and of the United States and, on all questions and measures which may come before me, I will so conduct myself, as will, in my judgment, be most conducive to the interests and prosperity of this state.""So does Teilhet represent the entire state as he claimed?Teilhet was elected by voters from a portion of east Cobb County that includes Marietta, Smyrna and the Dobbins Air Reserve Base. He has been in the Legislature since 2003. The Hodges camp duly noted the boundaries of Teilhet's district as part of its argument against his claim.""It's the first line in his campaign bio,"" Shannon Marietta, Hodges' campaign manager, wrote in an e-mail.Hodges, who served 12 years as Dougherty County's district attorney, had to pledge that he would support the Georgia Constitution.The state constitution says representatives should be elected from ""representative districts of the state."" They have the power to write local legislation and the mandate to approve a balanced budget. They do not have the power to approve contracts or regulate charges for public utilities.Teilhet worked with other House members on about two dozen pieces of legislation earlier this year that were designed to have an impact across the state, such as a bill to take DNA samples of people accused of felonies -- that bill failed. A handful focused on issues that were of particular interest to Cobb residents, such as a bill imposing up to 20 years in prison for theft in a disaster area. Cobb County was hardest hit during September's record flooding. He also wrote about a dozen resolutions that ranged from commending the county manager, David Hankerson, to honoring the South Cobb High School marching band for performing at President Barack Obama's inauguration.George Hooks, whose 20 years in the Georgia Senate is longer than that of any of his colleagues, said lawmakers have dual roles of representing the district and constituents across Georgia. Sometimes, Hooks said, he supports legislation that people in his South Georgia district may not like, but it benefits the state, such as a bill earlier this year that could offer new funding sources for transportation.""I voted for it because I see it as benefiting the state,"" Hooks said. ""If it benefits Atlanta, it will benefit the state.""University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, whom Teilhet said was one of his college professors, said some representatives work as ""trustees,"" serving the interests of everyone. Others act as ""delegates,"" taking care of the people in their home district.Steve Anthony, who has worked at the state Capitol and is a lecturer at Georgia State University, believes Teilhet is ""playing loose with verbiage."" ""If he had said he represented the interests of the state of Georgia, he would be correct,"" Anthony said. ""He didn't represent Georgia. He represented the interests of Georgia.""Anthony also took issue with the second part of Teilhet's statement, saying the candidate cannot introduce legislation as attorney general. ""He can get some friend to introduce it for him.""Teilhet replied: ""By that standard, the governor has never introduced a bill.""Teilhet and others have different interpretations about the role of members of the Georgia House of Representatives. The state constitution does not say whether representatives are elected to serve the entire state. The oath does say that representatives should work toward goals that are ""conducive to the interests and prosperity of this state."" Teilhet said he has talked on the campaign trail about the oath of office directing representatives to serve the interests of the state. ""Maybe that would have been a little tighter [to say in the questionnaire],"" Teilhet said. We agree that Teilhet would have been better served if he said he represented the ""interests"" of the state. As even Hooks said, Teilhet's statement is ""broad."" We rate Teilhet's statement as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA43800>],/factchecks/2010/jul/06/rob-teilhet/did-lawmaker-cobb-represent-entire-state/

Barton says two GOP House chairs did events helping Democratic Rep. Ellen Cohen
","In a letter distributed June 12 to delegates to the Republican Party of Texas state convention, David Barton of Aledo depicts allies of Joe Straus of San Antonio, the GOP speaker of the Texas House, as too likely to help Democrats. Among nearly 20 points he raises: “Straus lieutenants (Reps.) Dan Branch and Jim Pitts are helping Ellen Cohen against her Republican challenger, doing events with her in her district.” Background: Branch and Pitts, supporters of Straus for speaker, were appointed by him to chair major committees. To back his Branch charge, Barton pointed us to 25 photos posted online in March by Cohen, a Houston Democrat. The photos, arrayed under the header “Higher Education Forum,” include a shot of Branch, R-Dallas, standing at a lectern in front of a slide headlined “Planning For A Budget Shortfall.” Barton later elaborated in an e-mail: “It is not (standard operating procedure) to do such events in settings in which Republicans help make a single Democrat look favorable to her constituents -- especially when it is in the midst of the campaign cycle rather than the policy/legislative cycle.” Branch and Cohen each told us that Cohen, a member of the House Higher Education Committee, invited Branch, the committee chair, to speak to residents at a public forum on Feb. 25. Branch said whenever a member of the higher education committee extends such an invitation, he’s got to give it consideration, and that he and Cohen took pains to keep the forum non-political. “I told her I didn’t think it would be helpful to do it once the general election process was in place,” said Branch. The forum took place before Cohen’s Republican opponent, Sarah Davis, was nominated in the March 2 primary. “Most Republicans who understand the facts will realize I did the right thing,” Branch said. He also said he has not endorsed Cohen: “I have not campaigned for her, I have not given her a contribution.” What of Republican Pitts helping Cohen? Barton pointed us to a Web post by Cohen’s campaign inviting visitors to a 90-minute “Appropriations Forum” on May 6 featuring Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, on which Cohen sits. Cohen writes in the Pitts-related post: “I respect Chairman Pitts’ leadership and value his insights as we are face critical days of current cuts and budget shortfalls. I appreciate his willingness to travel to Houston and be a part of this forum.” Pitts told us he might have erred by agreeing to speak at the forum in an election year. “I didn’t go there to help Ellen, that wasn’t the purpose. But I learned my lesson. I am going to be very careful. My timing probably should be before a primary, or even before people file” their candidacies in December and early January before the primaries. Pitts said Davis’s husband approached him after he spoke to question his remark that “Ellen and I have our hands full next session”-- implying Pitts expects Cohen to win re-election. “I did say that; I guess I’m guilty,” Pitts said. Kent Adams, the GOP nominee’s husband, later told us he took note of Cohen campaign signs outside the Pitts’ engagement and campaign literature at the Branch event. Tammi Wallace, Cohen’s chief of staff, said the signs were put up so audience members could find their way in. Adams said Cohen campaign workers and campaign literature were at both events. Wallace said there was no literature as such, though campaign-funded constituent survey cards were put out and Cohen campaign staff members attended the forums “because the campaign staff is expected to pitch in and do whatever they need to do to help out.” Would Pitts accept invitations to speak at forums hosted by Democratic House incumbents facing Republican challengers this November? “I would pass,” Pitts said. “I don’t want to send the wrong signal. I would go any place (to speak) but I don’t want to do it with a Democrat and I’m not going to do it for any Republican against an incumbent Democrat.” His rationale: He’ll need the support of members of both parties to advance the next state budget. “We’ve got to pass a bill,” Pitts said. Are Branch and Pitts “helping” Cohen against her GOP opponent by speaking to her constituents, as Barton claims? Adams, Davis’s husband/campaign manager, said that Cohen obviously intended for the GOP speakers to boost her campaign, but few people turned out for Branch, he said, and tax talk at Pitts’ stop was off-putting. “They were inconsequential,” he said. For her part, Cohen characterized the appearances by Pitts and Branch as informational instead of political. “The story to me is the fact that two Republican chairs of committees I serve on willingly agreed to come in and educate my district,” she said. What we find: Barton’s statement accurately refers to the GOP House members appearing at events with Cohen at her invitation, in her district. But the two forums weren’t political rallies--and even her opponent’s campaign manager saw no boon for Cohen. We rate Barton’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD4CF40>],/factchecks/2010/jul/05/david-barton/barton-says-two-gop-house-chairs-did-events-helpin/

GOP's David Barton says Republican legislator did ads for Democrat Mark Strama of Austin
","In an open letter distributed June 12 to delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention, former party vice chairman David Barton of Aledo depicts Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, a San Antonio Republican, as part of a Democrat-friendly cabal that needs to be shaped up or shipped out. Barton’s letter excoriates instances of Republican House members pitching in to help Democrats win re-election. An excerpt: “Straus Republican lieutenant Jim Keffer did mail pieces for Democrat Mark Strama to help him defeat his Republican opponent.” Keffer hails from Eastland, some 160 miles northwest of Austin, whose legislative delegation includes Strama. Did a rural Republican really back the re-election of an urban colleague from the other party? When we asked for elaboration, Barton shared copies of what he said were two political leaflets from a Strama re-election campaign. One of the documents includes pro-Strama quotations from former State Comptroller John Sharp, a Democrat; the Democrat-leaning Austin Chronicle; a resident of Strama’s district and Keffer, who’s quoted saying: “Mark Strama serves his district, not any one political party.” In the other document, Sharp and Keffer are also featured. Keffer is quoted saying Strama “worked with Republicans to cut property taxes and keep our public schools open. We don't always agree on every issue, but we agree on the need to put the interests of Texas ahead of partisan politics.” Responding to our query, Keffer confirmed he’d given Strama a hand, saying: “Whether you’ve got an R or a D behind your name doesn’t mean you are most qualified.” Finally, we contacted Strama, who told us by e-mail that Keffer, who had authored school funding legislaton that Strama co-sponsored, “didn’t ‘do’ mail pieces in the sense of paying for them,” but agreed to be quoted in a mailer “funded by my campaign about my bipartisan approach to the school finance bill.” Though Strama paid for the campaign materials, Keffer willingly helped out his Democratic colleague.

Hayworth claims McCain was a lobbyist too -- for the U.S. Navy
","The primary isn't until Aug. 24, 2010, but the two Republicans facing off in this fall's U.S. Senate race -- John McCain, the incumbent, and J.D. Hayworth, the former House member who's challenging him -- are already engaged in bare-knuckled combat in their campaign ads. It all began in June, when McCain produced an ad that hits Hayworth for serving as a lobbyist. ""J.D. Hayworth says he's an outsider, but after he was voted out of Congress he became a registered lobbyist,"" the narrator intones in the McCain ad. ""Hayworth was paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on."" When we analyzed the ad, we found disclosure forms filed with Congress that confirmed that Hayworth served as a lobbyist, so we ruled the statement True. In response, the Hayworth camp tried to label McCain as a onetime lobbyist, too -- a charge that McCain proceeded to attack in a second ad. In this item, we'll check the charge made by the Hayworth camp that was cited in McCain's second ad. McCain's second ad revolves around footage showing an unnamed Hayworth spokesman saying, ""Sen. McCain started out as a lobbyist in Washington when in 1976 he was the liaison for the Navy to the United States Senate."" We tracked down a similar quote from Hayworth spokesman Mark Sanders in a June 8, 2010, Associated Press report. Sanders told the AP that McCain ""began his career in Washington as a lobbyist when he was appointed in 1976 as the Navy's liaison to the United States Senate. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black."" So the question before us is whether someone holding the position of Navy liaison -- as McCain did for several years in the 1970s -- should be considered a lobbyist. There's evidence to back up both sides. In Hayworth's favor, Washington insiders do informally call the position a lobbyist for the Navy. The first mission listed on the home page of the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs -- the office that includes the position McCain once held -- is to ""plan, develop, and coordinate relationships between representatives of the (Department of the Navy) and Members of the United States Congress and their committee staffs, which are necessary in the transaction of official government business, except appropriations matters, affecting (the Department of the Navy)."" That does sound a lot like the job description of a lobbyist employed by a private-sector company. A 2008 New York Times account of McCain's tenure in that position solidifies the notion that McCain did many of the same things that private-sector lobbyists do. ""One of several military liaisons assigned to the Senate as advocates for their services and escorts for official travel, McCain quickly emerged as the senators' favorite,"" the Times' account said. ""He had a thick head of hair as white as his dress uniform and he showed a natural politician's gift for winning over an audience. He excelled at leavening official business with a spirit of fun -- telling deadpan stories about his years 'in the cooler' (as a prisoner of war), playing marathon poker games on flights overseas or surprising senators at a refueling stop in Ireland with a side trip to Durty Nelly's, a 17th-century pub. He was the epitome of cool, one senator's son recalled, with a pack of Marlboros in one hand and Theodore White's memoir 'In Search of History' in the other. He relished the push-and-pull of legislative battles, eventually even plunging into defense budget fights with a personal agenda that was sometimes at odds with the Carter administration's Secretary of the Navy. He built personal friendships and professional collaborations across ideological divides, a hallmark of his later Senate career. And he applauded the Senate's leading hawks as they waged what they considered an epic struggle with the Carter administration over America's place in the post-Vietnam world."" But McCain also has a point when he draws a distinction between what he did and what private-sector lobbyists do. For starters, there's a very specific legal definition of a lobbyist that is narrower than the more informal one sometimes applied to the Navy liaison. According to the most recent version of the Lobbying Disclosure Act, a lobbyist is ""any individual (1) who is either employed or retained by a client for financial or other compensation (2) whose services include more than one lobbying contact; and (3) whose lobbying activities constitute 20 percent or more of his or her services’ time on behalf of that client during any three-month period."" Typically, lobbyists fall into one of two categories. One is a free agent who represents one or more clients before the government, usually from a position within a law firm or a specialized lobbying firm. Usually these types of lobbyists are paid a monthly or yearly retainer, though sometimes they may represent a client on a volunteer basis. The other is an in-house employee at a corporation, labor union, trade association, university, membership group (like the AARP or the National Rifle Association) or other interest group. These lobbyists are typically full-time, salaried employees who lobby only for their employer. Neither describes the position McCain held. McCain was a federal employee, representing the Navy, and he was paid a federal-scale salary. The Lobbying Disclosure Act didn't exist in the 1970s, but the people occupying McCain's old job today are not required to register as lobbyists. We should also note that lobbying is not the only aspect of the liaison job. The home page of the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs also lists non-lobbying responsibilities, including replying to requests for information by lawmakers and ""supporting and hosting congressional visits and travel."" Finally, we think it's reasonable to look at the implication of Hayworth's charge that McCain was a lobbyist. Even if McCain was in some informal sense a ""lobbyist"" for the Navy, the position he held diverges in significant ways from the popular perception of lobbyists. Unlike an experienced lobbyist in the private sector, McCain would not have been highly paid or had a substantial expense account. If anything, as a federal employees, particularly career military officials, operate under stricter restrictions on partisan activities than a typical private-sector lobbyist would. All told, the Hayworth camp isn't entirely wrong to describe John McCain in his old position as a lobbyist. In many ways, the advocacy duties he carried out in that position are quite similar to what private-sector lobbyists do. On the other hand, the impression created by labeling his old position as a lobbying job is misleading, since in-house federal lobbyists are neither lobbyists by official definition nor are they able to rely on the same tools as private-sector lobbyists can, especially deep pockets. So we rule the Hayworth camp's claim to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9BC680>],/factchecks/2010/jul/05/jd-hayworth/hayworth-claims-mccain-was-lobbyist-too-us-navy/

GOP activist says three Republican House members did radio spot to re-elect Democratic Rep. Mark Homer
","All wasn’t back slaps and hugs at the Republican State Convention in Dallas last month. Party delegates switched to a new chairman in Houston lawyer Steve Munisteri. And a critic of House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio distributed a letter the morning of June 12 all but indicting Straus and his closest GOP House allies as dangerously beholden to Democrats. The letter from David Barton of Aledo, the state party’s former vice chairman, lists nearly 20 indicators he says show Straus working against both conservative Republicans and the advancement of a conservative legislative agenda. Talk about a Truth-O-Meter dream. If every politico issued such missives, we’d postpone vacations, double up staff, contemplate a reality show. But we digress—and are reviewing just a handful of Barton’s statements, starting with this: “Straus Republican lieutenants Charlie Geren, Jim Keffer, and Byron Cook aired radio ads supporting Democrat Mark Homer over conservative Republican Kirby Hollingsworth, helping the Democrat to a narrow win.” Background: Barton’s statement refers to three GOP House members endorsing an East Texas Democratic incumbent facing a Republican foe. Homer, of Paris, prevailed with 52 percent of the 2008 vote, according to the Texas secretary of state. To our request for back-up information, Barton passed along a copy of a newspaper ad with pro-Homer quotations from the cited GOP House members plus audio of a radio ad narrated by then-Rep. Brian McCall, a Plano Republican recently appointed chancellor of the Texas State University System. The newspaper ad, headlined “Republican Representatives Endorse Mark Homer,” quotes Geren, R-Fort Worth, saying Homer “works with everybody to bridge divides;” Cook, R-Corsicana, calling Homer a “problem solver;” McCall rating Homer “one of the best” and Rep. Tommy Merritt, R-Longview, saying: “The only team Mark is on is yours.” The radio spot features McCall saying: “During campaigns you hear a lot of talk about breaking gridlock. Candidates all talk about it. Some even mean it. Mark Homer has done it. Mark works with everybody, Republicans, Democrats, doesn’t matter. He works for you...” McCall then identifies himself as a Republican House member and says he’s joined by Keffer, Cook, Geren and Merritt “urging you to re-elect” Homer. “Mark bridges divides, he looks for common ground, creates solutions,” McCall says in the ad. “...So this time, send a problem solver back to Austin. The only team he’s on is yours.” That certainly sounds like several House Republicans touting a Democratic colleague. Anything askew in Barton’s recap? When we reached them, Homer, McCall and Keffer each confirmed the Republicans pitched in after Homer asked for help, though each man bridled at parts of Barton’s description. For starters, Homer said, his 1,899-vote win was not the squeaker Barton suggests. “For him to call it narrow is stretching it,” he said. Also, he said, the Republicans didn’t air the radio ad, or pay for it, as Barton’s letter says. Instead, Homer said, his campaign wrote the script, which each Republican approved. Homer said his campaign also bought air time. And was the ad a difference-maker, as Barton suggests? We don’t know how to gauge that. Homer said: “It certainly contributed... If I didn’t have it, could I have won? I feel strongly I could have won. But it was nice to have it.” Homer said he’s lined up similar commitments from Republicans this year. Like who? “I am not ready to say,” Homer said. “I don’t want to say yes (about who’s endorsing me) and if it doesn’t work out for some reason, I don’t want that to become a campaign issue.” Keffer noted that Homer was vice chair of a House committee that Keffer chaired. He said of his endorsement: “We are not so polarized and partisan (in the House) that we can’t look at good members on either side of the aisle . . . I am not afraid to do that. We need the best people we can get down in Austin.” McCall questioned the part of Barton’s statement calling Homer’s GOP helpers lieutenants of Speaker Straus. At the time of the 2008 election, McCall pointed out, Straus wasn’t yet the House speaker; he didn’t launch his unexpected candidacy for the post until later. McCall said he doesn’t know if Straus knew about the pro-Homer ad.Upshot: The radio spot wasn’t aired by the Republicans, as Barton puts it, and only one Republican voice -- McCall’s -- was heard. Also, Straus wasn’t House speaker when the ad aired in 2008, so he had no “lieutenants.”But the GOP members Barton named have proven to be Straus allies. And they earlier joined hands in a radio ad for Homer, their Democratic colleague. Barton’s statement is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFFB180>],/factchecks/2010/jul/05/david-barton/gop-activist-says-three-republican-house-members-d/
"['Bipartisanship', 'Texas', 'David Barton']","
David Barton says powerful Demcrats teamed with unions to raise money for GOP Speaker Straus
","Writing delegates to the Texas GOP’s state convention, Aledo activist David Barton depicted House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio as out of line in his bipartisanship. Barton, a former party vice chairman, levels nearly 20 charges in his letter, including: ""Powerful Houston Democrats Sylvia Garcia (Democrat county commissioner in Harris County) and Elyse Lanier (wife of the former liberal Democrat mayor Bob Lanier) sponsored a Democrat fundraiser for Speaker Straus with numerous Democrat officials and high-ranking union officials."" Democrats passing the hat for the Republican speaker? We wanted details. Barton subsequently told us in an e-mail: ""I knew several of the key Democrats who put it together (including the head of the union based in Houston who was a principal in the event) and I also heard about it from influential business leaders who were invited to the event by Garcia and Lanier."" He said guests were summoned by phone or e-mail. Straus’s spokeswoman, Tracy Young, confirmed that Straus raised money for his campaign at a May 4, 2010 party held at the Laniers’ Houston home. Young said, though, the event was hosted by Harris County’s entire House delegation—not just Democrats. Also, she said, Garcia, the county commissioner, did not attend. We reached Garcia, who said she was invited to the party, but couldn’t attend -- nor did she call or e-mail anyone to invite them. Barton’s suggestion that she did so, Garcia said, ""is just not true."" Asked if she’s a Straus supporter, Garcia replied: ""Not really ... The only campaign I am worried about is the Sylvia Garcia re-election campaign."" By e-mail, Young forwarded a document inviting recipients to the ""Bayou Tribute to Speaker Joe Straus."" Under ""Honorary Host Committee"" it lists 29 Houston-area House members, 17 Republicans and 12 Democrats. Young also shared a document titled ""Host Committee"" listing more than 30 sponsors of the event including Bob Perry and tort-reform advocate Dick Weekley, Houston homebuilders and major GOP donors; super-lobbyist Mike Toomey of Austin; beer distributor and donor John Nau of Houston and political action committees for law firms, pilots and oil and energy-related firms. The listed sponsors include a PAC for the United Transportation Union. The Laniers are among eight identified underwriters of the party. While mayor of Houston, Bob Lanier was viewed as a Democrat, though the office is filled via non-partisan elections. The May event at the Lanier’s home, Young said, ""wasn't a Democrat(ic) fundraiser - it was a bipartisan fundraiser."" How does all this add up? Without a subpoena, we can’t determine whether Garcia invited others to the fundraiser, though it appears she did not attend.  The rest of Barton’s statement is notable for what it leaves out. For instance, it’s fair to say the Laniers sponsored the party. But so did more than two dozen other backers, including GOP benefactors. While ""numerous"" Democratic officials were listed as honorary hosts, so were many Republican officeholders. As for ""high-ranking union officials,"" we identified one union’s role. On the other side of the political spectrum Barton did not mention hosts such as Anadarko Petroleum PAC. That committee’s parent company is a partner BP oil well that blew in the Gulf of Mexico. It’s also the biggest single corporate donor to Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. We weren’t given a list of guests so we could not assess their partisan affiliations. At the least, the Straus event does not appear to have been planned as the Democratic fundraiser Barton portrays. To the contrary, it may have underscored a reality of Texas politics: It behooves players of all stripes to make merry with the speaker. We rate Barton’s sally Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFFB400>],/factchecks/2010/jul/05/david-barton/david-barton-says-houston-democrats-teamed-raise-m/
"['Rhode Island', 'Taxes', 'Democratic Governors Association']","
Democrats say Chafee would tax amputee veterans
","
There are few things that tug at the heart strings more than hungry children, students who need textbooks and homeowners struggling to keep their families warm.

Except maybe veterans who’ve lost limbs to war. 

On a Chafee attack website it launched this spring, the Washington, D.C.-based Democratic Governors Association accuses the independent candidate for governor of taking aim at all of them. 

Here, with spelling errors intact, is what the website said: 

""Now former-Senator Chafee wants Rhode Island taxpayers to fix the state's budget deficit with a wide-ranging tax on previously untaxed items like textbooks, school meals, heating fuel, and, shockingly, the equiment [sic] that amuptee [sic] veterans need to opperate [sic] a car,"" it tells readers. 

PolitiFact Rhode Island has already checked Lincoln Chafee’s claim that putting a 1-percent tax on items that are now exempt from the state’s 7-percent sales tax would generate more than $89 million a year in state revenues. 

It turned out to be Mostly True. 

But when we saw the association’s claim that the list of exempt items that Chafee would tax includes equipment that enables amputee veterans to drive, it sounded too strange not to check. 

The Democratic Governors Association says it pulled the list directly from Chafee’s campaign website. 

They’re right. The site features a line-item roster of tax-exempt items, along with a calculation of how much revenue each would generate if taxed at 1 percent. Textbooks, school meals and heating fuel are all there. And yes, so is the driving equipment for amputees. 

When we contacted the Chafee campaign to ask about the claim, they didn’t flinch. Eliminating all sales-tax exemptions is a way to balance the budget and erase Rhode Island’s massive deficit, said campaign manager John R. Pagliarini. 

OK, but kids and amputees?

""Rather than get into a situation where we’re judging one priority over another, we’re saying why don’t we apply it uniformly so it’s equitable, so we’re not pitting one interest or one item against another,"" Pagliarini explained. 

The Democratic Governors Association slammed Chafee’s proposal. ""The idea of taxing the men and women who have served our country and had an amputation in the course of their service? I couldn’t find a single person that thinks that’s a good idea,"" said spokeswoman Emily DeRose. 

But Pagliarini called it ""very candid"" of the former senator to recognize that the state’s budget problems demand dramatic solutions and said Chafee would undoubtedly revisit the exemptions issue once the state is ""back on solid footing.""  
He bristled however at the suggestion that Chafee doesn’t care about veteran’s service. 
""To say that he doesn’t appreciate the contributions of men in uniform is not fair. His father was a decorated war veteran,"" Pagliarini said. (Chafee’s father, the late Sen. John Chafee, served with the Marines in World War II and the Korean War.) 

Chafee’s views on veterans aside, the Democratic Governors Association is correct about whom and what the gubernatorial candidate has proposed taxing. We find its claim True, though we suggest they make better use of spell check next time around.   
  
UPDATE: After this item was published, we learned that the driving equipment for amputee veterans would be paid for by the federal government for those injured in the line of duty. In such instances, the veterans are not taxed. However, because the Chafee campaign acknowledges that he would tax all items on a list of exemptions, it does not change the assertion that the former senator would tax the driving equipment. Therefore, the ruling stands.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBB0DC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/05/democratic-governors-association/democrats-say-chafee-would-tax-amputee-veterans/
"['Georgia', 'Ethics', 'Gail Buckner']","
Financial disclosure becomes an issue in the Democratic race for secretary of state
","The race for the Democratic nomination for Georgia’s next secretary of state has turned downright ugly.A June 27 debate on Georgia Public Broadcasting between the five Democratic candidates seeking the party’s nomination turned into little more than a prime-time mudslinging. The debate was sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. State Sen. Gail Buckner (D-Jonesboro) quickly found herself on the defensive when she was accused of not filing a personal financial disclosure report as required by the state Ethics Commission. Challenger Gary Horlacher alleged Buckner had not filed within the seven days required after she qualified to run for statewide office. Buckner, a 18-year veteran of the state Legislature, shot back that she had. Buckner was in the state House of Representatives 16 years and has served two in the state Senate. “I have filed every disclosure that has ever been required,” she said. So who’s right?Horlacher, a metro Atlanta attorney, said Buckner was required to file a personal financial disclosure report within seven days after she qualified to run for secretary of state. But the only disclosure she filed was back in January, before she qualified to run for statewide office. She qualified to run for secretary of state in April.The state Ethics Commission Web site has this to say about the required filing:“A Personal Financial Disclosure Statement covering the period of the preceding calendar year shall be filed no later than the fifteenth day following the date of qualifying as a candidate. Candidates for statewide office file not later than seven days after qualifying for office. Only one Personal Financial Disclosure Statement is required per calendar year.”That seems clear-cut. But not so much in this case, according to Stacey Kalberman,  executive secretary for the Ethics Commission. Kalberman said Buckner filed a “statewide form” earlier this year that effectively covers her subsequent decision to run for secretary of state. That fulfills the Ethics Commission’s requirements, Kalberman said.“She filed a statewide form in January, so she’s good,” Kalberman said. A check of the Ethics Commission’s Web site shows Buckner electronically filed the form on Jan. 8 at 8:04 p.m. It lists everything from Buckner’s salary, to the value of her home and vehicles. Horlacher said he still thinks Buckner has violated the letter and intent of the filing requirement. And he vowed not to drop the issue.“I am down to deciding whether to formally request an advisory opinion from the [Ethics] Commission,” he said. “I think the state might be better off just to get clarification on this so it is not repeated.” But as of now, Buckner appears to have done what is required of her. We give her a rating of True on this one. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBFF280>],/factchecks/2010/jul/05/gail-buckner/financial-disclosure-becomes-issue-democratic-race/
"['Georgia', 'Voting Record', 'Brian Kemp']","
Secretary of State Brian Kemp says challenger didn't vote in Republican primaries
","There's no shortage of sniping in the Republican primary for Georgia secretary of state. Candidates have traded accusations of political careerism, incompetence and dishonesty for months. This time around, seven-month incumbent Brian Kemp and opponent Doug MacGinnitie are squabbling over their voter registration histories. Kemp said in a speech posted on YouTube that MacGinnitie failed to vote in Republican primaries for two decades. MacGinnitie countered by posting a commercial that says Kemp's record shows he voted for Democrats. They have both accused each other of ""hypocrisy."" The brawl made its way from the Internet to the airwaves when reporter Lori Geary confronted the rivals on WSB-TV June 28. They repeated their attacks and piled on a couple more. A separate Truth-O-Meter item will focus on MacGinnitie's attack on Kemp. This one addresses Kemp's attack on MacGinnitie. Kemp bashed his rival during a Cobb County GOP breakfast June 5. His campaign posted a recording of Kemp's speech on YouTube. “I’ve got a solid conservative record. But when you look at my opponent, he doesn’t tell you that he hadn’t voted in a Republican primary for almost 20 years until 2008,” Kemp told the crowd. That's a long time for a Republican to opt out of voting Republican. We requested MacGinnitie's voter history from the Georgia secretary of state, which keeps voting records. Records show that MacGinnitie voted 23 times in Georgia since 1988. Six were in the Republican primary process: in 1988 for president; 1996 for president; 1996 in the general primary runoff; 2000 for president; 2008 for president; and 2008 in the general primary. MacGinnitie voted twice in Democratic primaries: the 1988 general primary runoff; and the 1992 presidential primary. In those races, he was using the ""Rush Limbaugh playbook"" -- voting for the weakest Democrat to boost Republican chances for victory, his spokesman said. Six votes in Republican primaries is a bit more than none. We contacted the Kemp campaign for an explanation. They said that while MacGinnitie did vote in presidential Republican primaries, he didn't start voting in state Republican primaries until 2008, when he was gearing up to run for higher office. This is a major failing on MacGinnitie's part, a Kemp campaign consultant contended. In areas such as their opponent's heavily Republican neighborhood, the party primary can be even more important than the general election because Democrats are such a long shot. ""In those areas, the state Republican primary is the entire election. It decides who wins, not the general election,"" campaign consultant Joel McElhannon told PolitiFact Georgia in an e-mail. What's worse, MacGinnitie sat on the sidelines at a time when local and state Republicans needed supporters, McElhannon said. For much of the past 20 years, the party was in the midst of a resurgence that made it possible for the GOP to dominate Georgia politics for the first time since the Reconstruction. MacGinnitie's spokesman acknowledged that his candidate's voting record has room for improvement. It's correct that primaries often decide elections in areas that lean heavily toward one political party, and MacGinnitie did not vote in state and local races that were important to the Republican Party. But the attack Kemp made on MacGinnitie has serious problems. During the Cobb breakfast, Kemp could have told voters that MacGinnitie did not vote in a state Republican primary for 20 years. This would have been accurate. Instead, he said his opponent did not vote in a ""Republican primary."" There's no mention of state primaries. Kemp's campaign countered that most Republican voters in party strongholds understand that ""Republican primary"" means ""state Republican primary."" They added that typically, Kemp does specify in speeches and campaign e-mails that he is talking about state Republican primaries, not national ones. Yet Kemp's speech in Cobb was not a one-time misstep. His campaign has made the same inaccurate claim over and again. A flier and list titled ""Doug MacGinnitie's Documented Lies"" his own campaign e-mailed to PolitiFact Georgia contained the same accusation. We rule Kemp's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA74B40>],/factchecks/2010/jul/04/brian-kemp/secretary-state-brian-kemp-says-challenger-didnt-v/
"['Children', 'Texas', 'Carol Morgan']","
Morgan says we're No. 1 in child hunger
","
Carol Morgan, the Democrat facing Republican John Frullo for a Texas House seat representing Lubbock, says Texas often beats out other states, not always for the better. 
""We’re a state of contrasts right now,"" she said June 25 to the Non-Urban Caucus at the Texas Democratic Paty’s state convention. ""We are (rated) No. 1 in business by every business magazine, and I (am) steadfastly committed to maintaining that. But you know, we’re No. 1 in child hunger."" 
How Texas ranks, in categories great and not-so-great, is often campaign fuel. We’ve noted previously that Texas is No. 1 in wind power, and among the lowest-ranking states for high school graduation rates and mental health care. Texas has the nation’s top share of minimum-wage workers and is also home to the most Fortune 500 companies. 
Scoping Morgan’s statement, we came across a Republican rendition of the same concern. Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, urging mayors to participate in a summer program providing meals to needy children, said in June 2009: ""Texas ranks first in the nation in children who are food insecure."" 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ""food insecurity"" means that at some point in a year, someone in a household went hungry because the household couldn’t afford food. JC Dwyer, state policy director for the Texas Food Bank Network, told us: ""It doesn’t mean everyone’s going hungry every night. It doesn’t mean ‘starving.’"" 
Morgan sent us a write-up on the website of KXAS, the NBC TV affiliate in Dallas-Fort Worth, which says ""Texas leads the nation in child hunger."" She also pointed us to the Texas Hunger Initiative website, which says ""Texas has the highest food insecurity rate among children in the nation."" The initiative, based at Baylor University, develops strategies to end hunger across the state. 
Neither of Morgan’s cited websites explains what it means to be No. 1 in child hunger. 
Dwyer pointed us to data on food insecurity collected by the federal government. Every year since 1995, the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey has collected data on food insecurity which the USDA uses to produce a report on its prevalence. 
The bureau estimates the rate of food insecurity in households by weighing responses to 18 questions including yes-no queries such as ""In the last 12 months did you or other adults in your household ever not eat for a whole day because there wasn’t enough money for food?"" Other questions require participants to say how true a statement is, such as ""The children were not eating enough because we just couldn’t afford enough food."" 
About 44,000 households answered the 2008 survey. The USDA Economic Research Service, which analyzes the responses and weights them appropriately to reach conclusions for each state and the nation, concluding that at some time that year 17.1 million — 14.6 percent — of U.S. households were food insecure. About 49 million people lived in food-insecure households, including 16.7 million children. 
Looking at combined census data from 2006 through 2008, USDA reported in November that the estimated rate of food insecurity ranged from 6.9 percent in North Dakota to 17.4 percent in Mississippi. Texas had the second-highest rate of food insecurity at 16.3 percent. 
But what about focusing on hungry children, as Morgan does? 
An earlier USDA report focused on food-insecure households where children were living. Looking at data from 2001 through 2007, the report found 21.5 percent of Texas households with children sustained food insecurity — placing the state first nationally. Neighboring New Mexico had the next most food-insecure households with children, at 21 percent, while New Hampshire had the lowest rate, with 10.1 percent of households with children facing hunger. 
In May 2009, Feeding America, a nonprofit national network of more than 200 food banks, had explored a related angle. The network, tapping data from the census bureau and USDA for 2005 through 2007, estimated the share of children facing hunger in each state. Its conclusion: 22.1 percent of Texas children lived in food-insecure households. The Texas rate was followed by that of Tennessee (20.5 percent), South Carolina and Arizona (20.2), and Missouri and Louisiana (20). 
The lowest rate? North Dakota at 10.9 percent. 
Texas did not have the greatest number of children facing hunger. California, the most populous state, had about 1.6 million food-insecure children. Texas had the second most with about 1.47 million. 
Since Morgan made her child-hunger claim, Feeding America has released a new study using census bureau and USDA data from 2006 through 2008. It found that Arkansas had the nation’s highest rate of children facing hunger, at 24.4 percent. Texas was a close second, with 24.3 percent of its children in food-insecure households. 
Our sense: It’s most reasonable to stack up the states based on their rates of children in hunger, rather than raw numbers. Based on its rate, Texas was No. 1 in child hunger from 2005 through 2007. It placed a close second to Arkansas in the latest study, but that wasn’t public when Morgan spoke. 
We rate her convention statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAF5440>],/factchecks/2010/jul/03/carol-morgan/morgan-says-were-no-1-child-hunger/

Charlie Crist camps out on Florida's Emerald Coast
","Charlie Crist and pop icon Jimmy Buffett shoulder to shoulder before a crowd of Parrotheads at Pensacola Beach. Charlie Crist, hands on hips, standing next to President Barack Obama in view of another sugar-sand coast. Charlie Crist, bent low, inspecting just washed-up oil gook with a stick. Charlie Crist, barefoot and in shorts, holding hands with a chain of anti-drilling protesters near the shore. For Floridians, images of the governor's furrowed brow and tawny, beach-ready complexion have become as much of a symbol of the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster as BP's ubiquitous underwater video footage. The media frenzy makes Twilight heartthrob Robert Pattinson look underexposed in comparison, growl critics, who paint Crist as an opportunist more interested in having his picture taken than helping the fishermen, hoteliers, boaters and restaurateurs who are losing customers because of the gushing oil. Future Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Melbourne, complained Crist was doing more harm than good. ""It drives tourists away,"" he said. ""It looks like Florida is having the same problem as Louisiana.""We could check whether Louisiana's problems of oil on the beach, fishermen out of work, and coastal businesses hurting are different than Florida's, but Haridopolos isn't our subject today. Besides, Crist counters that his motivations are purely altruistic. ""My first duty is to do my job and I'm going to do it,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee Bureau.But, that doesn't mean Crist, a former Republican running as an independent for the U.S. Senate, is above pointing out just how much time he has devoted to the oil crisis in recent weeks. ""I have become sort of a pseudo resident of the Panhandle lately and am enjoying it very much,"" he told a crowd of government leaders at a Florida Association of Counties conference in Tampa on July 1, 2010. ""I've been in Escambia, Santa Rosa, Wakulla and Apalachicola, got some oysters out of the bay there, and I will tell you some of the most resilient people in this state reside there.""Minutes later he added, ""I have spent virtually every weekend since Memorial Day in the Panhandle.""To be sure, Crist landed in the Emerald Coast long before that patriotic holiday announcing summer's unofficial beginning. He held his first press conference on the coast on May 1 and went back three more times the next week. He returned the following weekend, meeting with Apalachicola fishermen and Destin hospitality leaders.But, Crist's statement zereod in on his post-Memorial Day activities, so we did, too.An official calender kept by the Executive Office of the Governor quickly revealed Crist had spent every weekend since Memorial Day on the Emerald Coast, and many, many more days in between. Turns out, in this instance ""virtually,"" meant ""literally.""The fun started on Saturday, June 5, when Crist joined Buffett on a hunt for signs of tar at Pensacola Beach. The following weekend Crist called for green energy in a CBS News Face the Nation interview from Panama City on Sunday, June 13. A week later, he toured the boom staging area in Port St. Joe both by foot and by sea on Sunday, June 20. The next weekend was especially busy. Crist opted to stay overnight in Pensacola starting Friday, June 25. He began with a briefing on the shoreline cleanup at Pensacola Beach Pier, followed by a tour of Pensacola Bay Friday afternoon. On Saturday, Crist attended a 6 a.m. communications briefing in Pensacola, then stopped by the Santa Rosa Yacht & Boat Club for a briefing with Mike Sole, the state's Department of Environmental Protection Secretary. Sole and Crist toured the gulf on the Orion, a Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission patrol vessel, then sat through another briefing at the Pensacola Beach Gulf Pier. Crist's last stop was at a Hands Across the Sand demonstration at Pensacola Beach's Navarre Pier, where he joined hands with anti-drilling protesters. On Sunday, Crist could be found surveying Pensacola Beach Gulf Pier. He then hopped on a plane with Major General Emmett ""Buddy"" Titshaw of the Florida National Guard to get an aerial view. The weekend ran long. Crist and Sole met in Pensacola again on Monday before Crist returned home for the night. But Crist returned to Pensacola the next day for an incident briefing. He then held a media availability at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.And that's not all. Crist also made sure to stop by and shake hands with the natives during multiple weekday visits. He held a press conference on the spill from the Tallahassee Emergency Operations Center on Wednesday, June 2, before arriving in Pensacola for a coastline fly-over at noon. The next day, after a quick jaunt back to Tallahassee, Crist overlooked Pensacola's beaches from a plane alongside Attorney General Bill McCollum. He then made his way to the Escambia County Emergency Operations Center for a briefing. That might be enough to satisify someone else, but Crist's appetite for the oil disaster persisted, so he continued on to another briefing, this time at the Santa Rosa County Emergency Operations Center. The following week, he attended a 5 a.m. and a noon communications briefing at Pensacola Beach, Friday, June 11.Then there was the photo opportunity that outshined all other photo opportunities. Crist chatted oil with President Barack Obama at Pensacola Beach on June 15.Days later, Crist met with Phillippe Cousteau, grandson of the oceanographer icon Jacques Cousteau, in Pensacola on Wednesday, June 23. He then shook hands with U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Robert Papp at the Pensacola Regional Airport, before taking an aerial inspection of the gulf coast shoreline. Crist followed his plane ride with a walking tour of the beach. We think it is also worthwhile to note that even on the days when he stayed away from the Emerald Coast, his schedule remained peppered with spill-related meetings and events.Friday, June 4, was a big day for Crist, who started the morning with interviews with Good Morning America, CNN's American Morning and CBS' The Early Show. He then made his way to the Big Easy to listen to Obama promise results at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport.He got more television time on Sunday, June 6, when he gave interviews from Tallahassee to Candy Crowley of CNN's State of the Union, and Fox News' Geraldo Rivera. Crist returned to Pinellas County, his hometown area, Monday, June 7, for a meeting with fishing and tourism leaders first in Madeira Beach, then St. Petersburg Beach. He then stopped for lunch at Leverock's Seafood House in St. Petersburg to promote Florida seafood.On Wednesday, June 9, Crist's day started with a call to the White House from Tallahassee and ended with a visit to the Deepwater Horizon command post in Miami. He headed south again to meet Miami Beach tourism leaders worried about the spill on Monday, June 14.Crist was in Tallahassee on Wednesday, June 16, when he began his day with a call from the White House for a review of the oil response.He squeezed in a Deepwater Horizon briefing at the Tallahassee Emergency Operations Center on Monday, June 21. Most recently, he met Obama's BP claims czar at Tampa International Airport to discuss the emerging payout process on Thursday, July 1. Crist's zigzagging travels are hard to add up. But we think that's at least 10 news conferences, 19 briefings, 8 beach tours, 4 aerial tours, 5 national networks, and gobs of quality time with Buffett, Obama, Cousteau and Geraldo -- all since Memorial Day. To break it down another way, Crist's Panhandle visits come to six weekend days and eight weekdays. He spent another eight days on oil-related meetings and events. That's more days than many people get to spend with their mother each year. In times like this, we wish the Truth-O-Meter had a ""Duh"" option in its ruling categories, but we will just settle for True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB1FB80>],/factchecks/2010/jul/02/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-camps-out-floridas-emerald-coast/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Barack Obama']","
U.S. has more border patrol agents on the border with Mexico than ever, but debate goes on
","President Barack Obama gave a lengthy speech on the need for immigration reform at the American University School of International Service on July 1, 2010, making a case to change the way the law handles immigrants. Obama avoided specifics in favor of several general points: Government needs to secure the borders, but it also needs to reduce red tape and backlogs for legal immigrants. Businesses need to obey laws that forbid the hiring of illegal immigrants. And illegal immigrants need to register with the government, pay taxes and fines, and learn English. Obama said government efforts to secure the border are farther along than some might think.""Government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders,"" Obama said. ""That's why I directed my Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano -- a former border governor -- to improve our enforcement policy without having to wait for a new law. Today, we have more boots on the ground near the Southwest border than at any time in our history. Let me repeat that: We have more boots on the ground on the Southwest border than at any time in our history."" Just because someone repeats something doesn't mean it's true, so we decided to check it out.According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there are approximately 21,000 border agents charged with monitoring the country's borders. Most -- but not all -- are assigned to the Southwest border, that is, the land border that stretches from California to Texas. The number assigned to the area has been dramatically increasing in recent years. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a division of DHS, told us that 17,057 agents are now assigned to that border, up dramatically from 6,315 in 1997.Additionally, a report from the Congressional Research Service documented a steep increase in border agents, increasing every year since 1992. ""The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration,"" the report concluded.The impact of the additional agents, though, has been difficult to gauge, the report noted. For several years, from 1994 to 2000, apprehensions of illegal immigrants near the Mexican border increased. In other years, the number of apprehensions decreased, seemingly along with downturns in the U.S. economy, the report noted. And in 2009, apprehensions reached a 17-year low. We checked in with groups that favor low levels of immigration to see what they thought of Obama's statement. They said the fact was accurate, but pointed out that President George W. Bush was responsible for adding many of the agents on the ground now. Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies said that the Obama administration could do more on enforcement in the interior of the country, such as stricter checks on employees' immigration status or a new entry-exit monitoring system for people here on temporary visas. ""Border patrol without interior enforcement is like locking your front door and leaving the back door open,"" he said. We thought we were done here, but then the history buffs at PolitiFact brought up the Mexican-American War of 1846 and the lesser known Mexican Expedition of 1916. Should those military activities count as ""boots on the ground on the Southwest border?"" We decided that the Mexican-American War should not count -- this was a war that happened after the United States annexed Texas in 1845, so it was more of a battle to define the border than defend it. The Mexican Expedition was a little different, though. Those events occurred during the Mexican Revolution, when Pancho Villa launched a surprise attack inside the United States at Columbus, N.M. History books say that President Woodrow Wilson sent somewhere between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the border in 1916. The historians we asked, though, said the Mexican Expedition isn't directly comparable with the border situation today. ""During the Mexican insurrection, Pancho Villa raided into U.S. territory. It was, then, not about attempts by Mexicans to get into the U.S. individually for various personal reasons, or drug smuggling, etc.,"" said Richard H. Kohn, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an e-mail interview. Another historian, Paul Christopher Anderson of Clemson University, agreed that today's concerns with stopping immigration are very different from the worries of the early 1900s. ""The U.S. involvement on the border and in Mexico from 1913 to 1917 was tied primarily to questions of diplomacy, imperialism, and Mexican sovereignty,"" he said via e-mail. Arguments about immigration enforcement will no doubt go on, but Obama's statement on border agents is sound in the context of today's debate. ""Today, we have more boots on the ground near the Southwest border than at any time in our history,"" he said. We do have more agents than anytime since the early 1990s. But there have been times in our history when the U.S sent troops to the border, and many more people than are there to guard the border today. We want to allow for that complicated history, and so we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7AFDC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/02/barack-obama/us-has-more-border-patrol-agents-border-mexico-eve/

Clegg claims federal deficit is growing at a rate of $3 million every second
","The national debt is just over $13 trillion. That's $13 million million. If you divide the number by the U.S. Census Bureau’s world and U.S. population figures, that's nearly $42,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States and almost $1,900 for every human being on the planet. So it's understandable that a lot of candidates would want to talk about it, especially after Congress passed a landmark health-care bill that, critics contend, will add to that deficit.One is Bill Clegg,  one of four Republicans who have filed to run for Congress against incumbent Democrat Rep. James Langevin in the 2nd District. On the ""Federal Spending"" tab of his ""Issues"" page, Clegg talks about how the cost of government has increased, beginning with a reference to the speaker of the House.(The web posting was written before the health-care bill passed, so the “over $12-trillion” number in the following quote was true at the time.) ""And so Nancy Pelosi announced to the world her sophisticated rationale for a horrible health care bill that our elected officials attempted to ram down our throats. That was the first time when the so-called reform legislation contained such noxious provisions as mandated coverage, free rides for certain officials for their votes (think Nebraska and Senator Ben Nelson), and sleight-of-hand accounting that would add trillions to the deficit -- which is already over $12 trillion and increases at $3 million per second. As I write this, we have yet to see the fate of the latest 'bi-partisan' health legislation but you can bet it won't be cheap.""What intrigued us was the assertion that the deficit was increasing by $3 million each second.(Actually, Clegg was referring to the national debt. As readers pointed out to us after this item was published, the deficit is typically used to refer to how much the government is in debt at the end of each fiscal year, terms we confused as well.) Anyway, we did some math.Three million dollars per second, times 60 seconds in a minute, times 60 minutes in an hour, times 24 hours in a day, times 365 days in a year totals out to $94.6 trillion in debt per year, more than seven times the actual debt.Clearly, $3 million per second claim is off base.So we emailed Clegg, and asked where he got it from.""I am not near my files at present so I'll get back to you but I suspect it's a math error,"" he responded. When we asked him a few days later if he had any luck tracking down the number, he said, ""No, but it has to be an error so I'm going to revise it.""By July 1, he had a new website where the ""issues"" page didn't have that claim, but the old page was still available.In the meantime, we checked out a few of the online “national debt clocks” that purport to track the debt and found something interesting: they don't agree, and the difference can be dramatic.We froze three of them at 3:54 p.m. on June 25. The tally was $13,109,715,680,330 at USDebtClock.org, $13,104,984,133,395 at BabylonToday.com ($4.7 billion lower), and$13,026,442,384,744 ($78.5 billion lower still) at DefeatTheDebt.com.We also checked how long it took for the clocks to add $3 million to the tally. They ranged from as little as 65 seconds for BabylonToday.com, to as long as 261 seconds for DefeatTheDebt.com, with USDebtClock.org coming in the middle, at 129 seconds.So what's the real number?That’s a good question.We found a federal debt table published by the Office of Management and Budget that listed a deficit of $11.876 trillion at the end of 2009. We subtracted it from the debt of $13.787 trillion projected for the end of 2010. That left $1.911 trillion. Dividing that by the number of seconds in a year gives a national debt that is increasing by $60,597 per second, and it takes just under 50 seconds to add $3 million to the debt.Or you can look at how fast the debt has actually been accumulating, according to the Bureau of the Public Debt, a small agency within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Data from its web page, which allows you to see how the debt has increased during any time frame since 1993, shows that from June 1, 2009 to June 1, 2010, the debt went from $11,379,966,189,575.05 (yes, they calculate it down to the penny) to $13,050,826,460,886.97, an increase of $1.67 trillion for the year, or $52,982.63 per second. So, using these historical numbers, it takes just under 57 seconds to rack up $3 million.For the record, the two agencies don’t agree on what the debt was last Dec. 31. OMB says the debt was $11.876 trillion. The Bureau of Public Debt - which says it uses a daily tally, not estimates - reports that it was $12.145 trillion, a difference we couldn’t immediately resolve.In any case, neither number is even close to the candidate's claim of $3 million added to the debt each second.So in the final tally, the Truth-O-Meter rates it as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC64F00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/02/bill-clegg/clegg-claims-federal-deficit-growing-rate-3-millio/
