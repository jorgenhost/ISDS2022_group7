FBI director warned about white supremacist violence
","At an NBC town hall in Miami, a woman asked former Vice President Joe Biden what he would do to stop white supremacist groups as president. ""No. 1, the president's own FBI chief has said the greatest domestic threat to terrorism are white supremacists,"" Biden said. ""And when you have a president saying to one particular group of white supremacists that, in fact, stand down but stand by, that is like a clarion call to get ready."" Biden was referring to President Donald Trump’s debate comments for the far-right Proud Boys group to ""stand back and stand by."" The next day Trump said he didn’t know who the Proud Boys were and that ""they have to stand down, let law enforcement do their work."" We found that Biden is correct. FBI director Christopher Wray singled outwhite supremacists during a Sept. 17 House Homeland Security committee hearing. RELATED: In context: Donald Trump’s ‘stand back and stand by’ debate comments on white supremacists During the hearing, Wray testified broadly about the FBI’s investigation of terrorism threats and security issues and answered questions about antifa, Black Lives Matter and white supremacists. U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a former CIA analyst, asked Wray to discuss the number of investigations into white supremacist groups versus groups on the left. Wray replied that the FBI has roughly 1,000 domestic terrorism investigations a year, though it is a ""good bit north of a thousand this year.""  ""Everything from racially-motivated violent extremists to violent anarchist extremists, militia types, sovereign citizens, you name it. Of the domestic terrorism threats, we last year elevated racially-motivated violent extremism to be a national threat priority commensurate with a homegrown violent extremists,"" Wray testified. ""That’s the jihadist-inspired people here and with ISIS."" Slotkin pressed further and asked how many of the cases or arrests involved white supremacists. ""What I can tell you is that, within the domestic terrorism bucket category as a whole, racially-motivated violent extremism is, I think, the biggest bucket within that larger group, and within the racially-motivated violent extremists bucket, people subscribing to some kind of white supremacist-type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that,"" Wray said. ""So the white supremacists are the largest chunk of the racially-motivated domestic terrorists?"" Slotkin asked. Wray replied ""yes"" part way through her asking the question. Then Wray explained: ""Racially-motivated violent extremists over recent years have been responsible for the most lethal activity in the U.S. Now this year, the domestic terrorism, lethal attacks we’ve had have, I think, all fit in the category of anti-government, anti-authority, which covers everything from anarchist violent extremists to militia types. We don’t really think in terms of left, right."" The Biden campaign also pointed to Wray’s testimony to a Senate committee Nov. 5, 2019, when he made similar comments. ""A huge chunk of those domestic terrorism investigations involve racially-motivated, violent extremist-motivated terrorist attacks,"" Wray said. ""And the majority of those, of the racially-motivated, violent extremist attacks, are fueled by some kind of white supremacy. And I would say that the most lethal activity over the last few years has been committed by those type of attackers."" Experts on terrorism pointed to other information from the federal government or independent sources that back up Biden’s statement. ""I think Biden’s interpretation of Wray’s statements is correct, and it is supported by a separate threat assessment done recently by the Department of Homeland Security,"" said Michael Jensen, principal investigator at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. Jensen pointed to a Sept. 4 article by Politico that a draft report from the Department of Homeland Security identified white supremacists as the gravest terror threat to the United States. Two later drafts of the same document used slightly different language about the threat of white supremacists. PolitiFact did not directly see the drafts; however, the final report in October stated that among domestic violent extremists ""racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists — specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs) — will remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland."" Data sets maintained by think tanks and university researchers match the federal government’s warnings about white supremacy. START’s Global Terrorism Database shows that from 2015-19, white supremacists were responsible for more attacks in the U.S. than other types of extremists.  A separate study of terrorist incidents by the Center for Strategic and International Security in June 2020 found ""the most significant threat likely comes from white supremacists, though anarchists and religious extremists inspired by the Islamic State and al-Qaeda could present a potential threat as well."" An expert also pointed to the Sept. 23 testimony by Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that white supremacists have become the ""most persistent and lethal"" internal ""threat"" to the U.S. ""White supremacist extremists, from a lethality standpoint over the last two years, particularly when you look at 2018 and 2019, are certainly the most persistent and lethal threat when we talk about domestic violent extremists,"" Wolf said. Brian Levin at the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, said last year his center found at least 29 suspected white supremacist/far right extremist motivated homicides. The number represented the third consecutive increase, constituting a clear majority of all extremist homicides in 2019. In 2020, domestic extremist homicides are down so far, but far right/white supremacist homicides are again the most lethal, Levin said. RELATED: Tucker Carlson says white supremacy is a hoax. Here are 5 reasons why that’s wrong Biden said that the FBI director said ""the greatest domestic terrorism threat are white supremacist groups."" In September, Wray testified to that general effect, and he made similar comments in 2019.

Fighting for patient protections while attacking ACA — hard to have it both ways
","Throughout the 2020 election cycle, candidates’ positions on health care have been particularly important for voters with underlying and often expensive medical needs — in short, those with preexisting conditions. It’s no surprise, then, that protections for people who have chronic health problems like diabetes and cancer have become a focal point for candidates nationwide — among them, Matt Rosendale, the Republican contender for Montana’s only U.S. House seat. On Sept. 22, Rosendale’s campaign hit airwaves and online streaming services with an ad featuring a Whitefish resident named Sandee, whose son was diagnosed with a life-threatening disease. Sandee told the story of how Rosendale came to her family’s aid, concluding that ""Matt fights for everyone with a preexisting condition."" As is often the case with health care policy, however, the truth is far from simple. Rosendale and many other Republican congressional candidates face the challenge of convincing voters they support these safeguards even as they oppose the Affordable Care Act, which codifies those safeguards. Polls show broad public support for keeping the ACA’s preexisting condition protections. We decided to investigate. Rosendale is up against Democrat Kathleen Williams for the congressional seat now occupied by Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte, who has entered the state’s gubernatorial race. The open seat has been controlled by the GOP for the past 12 terms, but this year’s race is expected to be close. Williams, who also ran for the seat in 2018, has made health care her top campaign issue. We contacted the Rosendale campaign to find out the basis for his ad’s claim. Campaign spokesperson Shelby DeMars listed a range of health policies backed by the candidate that would help people with preexisting conditions directly or indirectly by holding down health care costs. She specifically pointed to Rosendale’s work on the state’s reinsurance program as Montana’s state auditor and insurance commissioner, a post he was elected to in 2016. ""Matt Rosendale is a champion for those with pre-existing conditions and he has the record to prove it,"" DeMars said via email. ""It is because of the Reinsurance program he implemented that Montanans with pre-existing conditions can access the affordable healthcare coverage they need."" In a nutshell, Montana’s reinsurance program is designed to help insurers cover costly medical claims with a mix of federal pass-through dollars and funding generated by a premium tax on all major medical policies in the state. Gov. Steve Bullock announced the formation of a bipartisan group tasked with developing reinsurance program legislation in fall 2018, and the state’s legislature approved the plan in 2019, allowing Rosendale to apply for and receive the necessary waiver under the Affordable Care Act. Subsequent news accounts indicated the idea worked. In-state insurers credited the program with lowering premiums by 8% to 14% for 2020. As Montana Health Co-op CEO Richard Miltenberger told MTN News shortly after the 2019 legislative session, ""It allows the insurance companies to have rate stabilization for those really big claims, the ones that are the earthquakes in health insurance."" He went on to say that this stability ""brings the cost down for the consumer."" More to the point, the American Medical Association has also stated that reinsurance not only serves to subsidize high-cost patients but ""protects patients with pre-existing conditions."" But there’s a rub. The reinsurance program that Rosendale touts wouldn’t exist without a state innovation waiver created by the ACA, which Rosendale says he’ll work to repeal. That effort will doubtless continue to fuel pitched battles in Congress, and how the U.S. Supreme Court may rule on a pending ACA challenge remains a point of speculation. One thing is clear, though: If the entire ACA is thrown out, the reinsurance program goes with it, along with Montana’s Medicaid expansion and the ban on insurers from excluding people with health problems from affordable coverage. When asked about the resulting elimination of the reinsurance program, DeMars reiterated that Rosendale’s work as auditor has created a system that will ensure protections for preexisting conditions ""regardless of what happens to the ACA."" She did not elaborate or explain what protections would remain if the ACA were repealed. In defending his stance on preexisting conditions, Rosendale continues to be haunted by another health care policy specter from his political past. During his unsuccessful challenge against Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester in 2018, Rosendale faced criticism for promoting short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans. Unlike plans offered on the individual marketplace, these short-term plans are exempt from the ACA’s ban on excluding people with preexisting conditions. And, under a 2018 regulatory change pushed by the Trump administration, the length of these short-term plans has been extended from three months to 12, with the potential to renew for up to three years. As state auditor, Rosendale included those plans in his March 2020 roundup of year-round options for immediate coverage. They often exclude coverage for a variety of higher-cost benefits. In Montana, for example, a review by KFF found that of four short-term plans available in Billings in 2018, none offered coverage for maternity care, mental health, substance abuse or prescription drug services. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) Historically, short-term plans were designed to help individuals fill gaps in health coverage. According to Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, the role short-term plans play on today’s health insurance landscape is to attract younger, healthier individuals seeking low-cost options to cover catastrophic events. That splits insurers into two pools — those who are less likely to incur medical expenses, and those who are more likely to incur them. Costs on the individual market go up as a result, leaving people with preexisting conditions no other option than to pay higher premiums. Short-term plans are, Palanker said, ""actively hurting people with preexisting conditions."" ""Promoting short-term plans and stumping on supporting protections for preexisting conditions are mutually exclusive,"" she continued. Asked whether the cost-lowering effect of a reinsurance program would be enough to offset the effects of short-term plans, Palanker said the only way such an offset would be enough is if the program encompassed short-term plans. She hasn’t seen that happen anywhere. A campaign ad says that Rosendale ""fights for everyone with a preexisting condition."" While it is true that health insurance premiums have dropped during Rosendale’s tenure as state auditor, the choice to establish Montana’s reinsurance program ultimately fell to decision-makers in the state’s legislature and the governor’s office. Since his ad’s claim simply states that he ""fights"" for people with preexisting conditions, his testimony in support of that program and role in securing the state waiver do seem to fit the bill. In the long-term, however, Rosendale’s positions begin to run counter to the claim. His support for short-term, limited-duration plans poses a considerable threat to keeping health insurance affordable for all, and absent a solid plan from Congress to ensure that state reinsurance programs survive, his stated goal of repealing the ACA would actually serve to unravel the very protection he’s built his case on. We rate this statement as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973813C0>],/factchecks/2020/oct/06/matthew-rosendale/fighting-patient-protections-while-attacking-aca-h/
"['Corrections and Updates', 'Michigan', 'Gary Peters']","
Fact-checking Gary Peters’ ad on James’ abortion stance
","In a Facebook ad, Democratic incumbent Sen. Gary Peters says that when it comes to abortion, his Republican challenger John James is ""out of touch and too extreme"" for Michigan. ""John James opposes abortion, even refusing to make an exception when a woman’s life is at risk"" and ""wants to make it a felony even in cases of rape and incest,"" Peters’ ad claims. Peters is hoping to hold on to his seat in a state that President Donald Trump narrowly won in 2016. There is no question that James is on the record as opposing abortion. But we wanted to take a closer look at Peters’ characterizations. We found that James has repeatedly dodged questions when asked whether he would make an exception to abortion prohibtions in cases where a mother’s life is at risk. Meanwhile, James favors overturning Roe v. Wade. The 1973 Supreme Court case invalidated Michigan’s 1931 law that makes it felony to administer an abortion in all cases except when the mother’s life is at risk. This law is still on the books and could be enforced if Roe v. Wade is overturned. James has not said whether he supports Michigan’s pre-Roe abortion ban.  James anti-abortion stance is clear. In a 2018 tweet, James wrote, ""I am 100% #ProLife because I believe life begins at conception and ends at a natural death. We will not stop fighting until we end abortion, for it is our sacred duty to protect the most vulnerable among us: the unborn."" During a July 13, 2018, campaign event, James called abortion a form of ""genocide,"" according to audio released by the Michigan Democratic Party. Whether James supports an exception when a mother’s life is in danger is less clear. When James ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2018, his campaign said he supports an exception in such cases, but neither James nor his campaign have answered questions on his position since. Ahead of the 2018 primary election, when James was asked in a WILS-AM 1320 interview whether he supports exceptions in cases where the life of the mother is at risk or preganancies resulting from rape or incest, he answered: ""I believe the focus should be given to maintaining and protecting life and exhausting every remedy to wrap our arms around both the mother and the baby, making sure that we eliminate situations that put our women in these terrible situations that no one wants to be in."" Asked again in that same interview whether he would criminalize abortions in cases where the pregnant woman’s life was in jeopardy and the pregnancy needed to be terminated to ensure the mother’s survival, he responded, ""if somebody’s life is in danger, you’re going to the hospital. You’re not going to Planned Parenthood. You’re creating a false dilemma."" During his 2020 campaign against Sen. Peters, James’ campaign has continued to avoid the matter. In an interview on WXYZ-TV Detroit Oct. 4, James was asked whether is pro-life. James responded, ""I am pro-life and I will always vote to protect life, especially the life of the mother."" But he did not specifically say that the life of a mother would be cause for an exception. During his 2020 campaign against Peters, James’ campaign has continued to avoid the matter. James’ campaign has stood out for not taking clear positions on a range of issues. Campaign spokesperson Abby Walls did not clarify whether James opposes exceptions to abortion for cases where a mother’s life is at risk when asked by a reporter for MLive. Walls declined to respond to a request for comment on James’ position from PolitiFact Michigan. But she did send a statement criticizing the ad: ""As a 30-year career politician, Sen. Peters’ lies and half-truths are so frequent, it’s almost impossible to keep track."" Peters campaign press secretary C.J. Warnke defended the ad in an email: ""John James has said in his own words that he is ‘100% pro-life’ and does not support Roe v. Wade — that means outlawing abortion and putting a woman’s life at risk."" With Republicans in the Senate hoping to vote on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, activists on both sides of the issue are preparing to mobilize voters. In 2016, Trump promised to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. The Detroit Free Press reported in 2018 that ""James made it clear he couldn't support any judge who didn't openly call for abortion to be outlawed except in almost all cases."" James has also received a number of endorsements from pro-life groups, including the Susan B. Anthony List, Right to Life of Michigan and the Family Research Council Action’s PAC.  Peters’ claim that James wants to make administering an abortion in cases of rape or incest a felony needs context. James has said Roe v. Wade should be overturned. If that happened, abortion regulations would revert to individual states. ""Michigan has a law on the books from 1931 that criminalizes virtually any form of abortion. It’s unconstitutional right now because of Roe,"" said Merissa Kovach, policy strategist for ACLU of Michigan. ""We could very quickly overnight become a state where virtually all abortion is criminalized."" Michigan is one of only nine states in the U.S. with a pre-Roe abortion ban that has not been repealed. Michigan law stipulates that any person who administers an abortion is guilty of a felony. The law makes an exception in cases where the abortion is administered to save a woman’s life but makes no exception in cases of rape or incest. That said, James has not said whether he specifically supports Michigan’s pre-Roe ban. A Gary Peters campaign ad says ""John James opposes abortion, even refusing to make an exception when a woman’s life is at risk"" and ""wants to make it a felony even in cases of rape and incest."" This lacks context. While James’ campaign stated in 2018 that he supports exceptions to abortion prohibitions in cases where the mother’s life is at risk, he has not provided a clear answer about where he stands now. Neither James nor his campaign have reiterated his support for such an exception, but neither he nor his campaign have said he would oppose them either. Meanwhile, James’ has been clear in his stated support for overturning Roe v. Wade, an action that would result in abortion regulations reverting to individual states. Michigan’s pre-Roe abortion ban makes administering abortion a felony except in cases where it is necessary to save a woman’s life. But James has not said whether he supports Michigan’s pre-Roe ban. The ad’s claims are partially accurate but leave out important details or take things out of context. We rate the ad’s claims Half True. UPDATE, Oct. 9, 2020: This story has been updated to reflect James’ comments on Oct. 4 , 2020, to WXYZ-TV Detroit. The ruling is unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978B4980>],/factchecks/2020/oct/06/gary-peters/fact-checking-gary-peters-ad-james-abortion-stance/

Claim that ex-coach Tommy Tuberville ‘quit on his players’ is exaggeration
","Name recognition, particularly for a first-time candidate like Tommy Tuberville, is all important. The Alabama Republican gained his through 21 years as a Division 1 college football coach before deciding to run against Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. So, it was no minor attack when Jones blitzed Tuberville with an ad calling Tuberville ""a quitter,"" saying that each of the four times Tuberville left head coaching jobs, he ""quit on his players."" The wording suggests Tuberville betrayed his players all four times. But while two of his departures were abrupt, that wasn’t what happened in two other cases.  Tuberville had his greatest coaching success while at Auburn University in Alabama from 1999 to 2008. Though he considered a 2018 run for governor he decided against it, citing family concerns and challenges over his residency.  Jones is an attorney who in 2001 and 2002 prosecuted two attackers in Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church bombing of 1963 that killed four young girls. He won his Senate seat in December 2017 in a high-profile race against Judge Roy Moore after the position was vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions, who became President Donald Trump’s first attorney general. The outcome of the Nov. 3 race between Jones and Tuberville could help determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats.  The race is rated as ""lean Republican"" — meaning the race is competitive but with the GOP having an advantage — by the Cook Political Report. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. In November 1998, Tuberville’s fourth year as head coach at the University of Mississippi, Alabama newspapers reported that Tuberville had struck a deal to become the head coach at Auburn. Tuberville denied the reports, saying if he did leave, ""it'll probably be in a pine box. Somebody will have to take me out of here."" Two days later, it was announced he was taking the Auburn job. ""It's not like we didn't know he was leaving,"" Ole Miss cornerback Timothy Strickland said the next season, just before his team played Auburn. ""He just hadn't told us. Him not telling us is what hurt."" Tuberville later said he left because, the day after his ""pine box"" comments aired, the chancellor at Ole Miss told him he could not commit to funding for football. ""It kind of forced my hand a little bit,"" Tuberville said. Tuberville coached Auburn for 10 years, including one undefeated season, and won five bowl games. He announced his resignation in December 2008, after informing his players, as the University of Alabama eclipsed Auburn’s success. ""In 2008, (Alabama coach) Nick Saban and Alabama took the state back as Tuberville's Tigers faltered, and that was enough to make Auburn want a change in leadership,"" ESPN reported. The end was clear after Auburn lost seven of its final nine games that season. Tuberville and the school’s athletic director ""reached an amicable parting in talks that began Monday and ended Wednesday afternoon, according to people familiar with the discussions,"" the Birmingham News reported. ""The talks began with Tuberville laying out his vision for the program, but, by Wednesday, Tuberville had decided a departure was best."" In backing the ad’s claim, Jones’ campaign provided testimony Tuberville gave in a 2013 deposition in a lawsuit unrelated to his coaching. Asked whether anyone in the Auburn administration had asked him to stay, Tuberville said yes but that he decided to leave anyway. Even though Tuberville resigned, Auburn paid him a $5 million buyout. After taking a year away from coaching, Tuberville joined Texas Tech University’s football program, which he led for three years before resigning in December 2012. The Associated Press reported at that time: ""Tommy Tuberville wasn't expecting a call from an old acquaintance. A few hours later, he was headed north for a new job"" at the University of Cincinnati. ""Texas Tech athletics director Kirby Hocutt was stunned when Tuberville called to tell him he was leaving,"" the AP reported. ""The first indication I got was at 10:32 this morning when he called me,"" Hocutt said. ""Tommy and I have talked a number of times since the conclusion of the Baylor game this year, and as recently as yesterday he looked me in the eye and gave me his commitment and dedication to Texas Tech football and leading this program forward."" The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal said the hiring came together in a matter of hours"" and shocked players, including Texas Tech tight end Jace Amaro, who tweeted: ""Never felt more anger in my life."" Tuberville coached at the University of Cincinnati for four years, three of them winning seasons. He resigned after the disappointing 2016 season that left the Bearcats missing out on a bowl appearance for the first time since Tuberville took the reins. Tuberville pledged to continue coaching, but did not leave for another coaching job. Tuberville ""was under intense pressure from some UC fans"" because of the team’s poor performance in 2016, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. ""It’s something we’ve worked on together,"" Cincinnati athletic director Mike Bohn said at the time. ""It was very professional, very candid."" Three players quoted by the newspaper said they were disappointed to hear Tuberville was leaving. Jones claimed Tuberville ""quit on his players"" all four times that he was a college football coach, suggesting he betrayed the players. But the circumstances of his departures are not that cut and dried. Tuberville shocked players and university administrators when he abruptly quit Mississippi and Texas Tech in order to take new coaching jobs. But he resigned from Auburn and Cincinnati after disappointing seasons that led the schools to look for new coaches.  We rate the claim Half True.

Big Ten leaders say testing and medical advice brought back football season
","Before President Donald Trump and several others close to him tested positive for coronavirus, there was the presidential debate.  And in the debate, there was a claim — one that may have caused college athletes, parents, coaches and athletic conference leaders to scratch their heads.  Amid a discussion on the economy at the Sept 29, 2020 debate in Cleveland, Trump said:  ""I’m the one who brought back football, by the way. I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it."" Even prior to the debate, more than 20 versions of an advertisement asserting that the president ""brought back"" college football were being shared on various Trump campaign Facebook pages in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and other Big Ten states — some of which are crucial for his reelection. The problem with that assertion is that Big Ten leaders don’t seem to agree.  Let’s dig in. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for backup for the president’s claim, so we are left with what we know from past statements and media coverage of the matter.   To be sure, Trump had been vocal with his opinion that college football should carry on as usual despite the coronavirus pandemic, and had been hard on the Big Ten for its initial decision to delay the start of the season.  On Sept. 16, 2020, the day the conference announced it would return to fall football, Trump  tweeted that it was his ""great honor to have helped"" and said on a Fox Sports Radio segment that the season was ""totally dead"" before he called Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren to discuss the matter.  The president did speak with Warren on Sept. 1, 2020 and labeled the conversation ""productive,"" according to a Washington Post article posted that day.   Various other reports said the league was offered federal assistance, presumably around testing of players and coaches, but those same reports in USA TODAY, the Washington Post and CBS Sports said the league had not requested and was not given any such assistance.  Warren has said that the Big Ten itself will pay for the approximately 150,000 coronavirus tests needed to keep the season going from its planned Oct. 24, 2020 start through December.  According to a Sept, 16, 2020 Washington Post article, conference officials and university leaders disputed Trump’s claim, saying that medical advice and increased availability of rapid testing drove the decision to bring the season back, not politics.  ""For me, it wasn’t about political pressure,"" Northwestern University president Morton Schapiro told reporters on a Sept. 16, 2020 conference call. ""It wasn’t about money. It wasn’t about lawsuits. It wasn’t about what everyone else is doing. It’s about the unanimous opinion of our medical experts. That sort of evolved over the course of weeks."" Added Ohio State team physician James Borchers, co-chair of the conference’s Return to Competition Task Force medical subcommittee: ""Our ability to test consistently and uniformly amongst the conference and provide that was really important."" Penn State athletic director Sandy Barbour said: ""If it was possible to get there safely, we were going to find a way. And that’s what happened."" According to a Sept 16, 2020 tweet from NBC White house correspondent Peter Alexander, a Big Ten university president told him that Trump’s urgings did not impact the deliberations and that Trump’s name came up in a negative light because ""no one wanted this to be political.""  Big Ten conference officials did not respond to our request for comment on the issue. Before we close, two notes about the way Trump phrased his claim. Big Ten football was never canceled. The initial decision — the one that was reversed — was to postpone the games until spring. Likewise, ""football"" was never canceled. Several major conferences — most notably the Big Ten and Pac 10 — had delayed seasons, but others including the SEC, ACC and Big 12 were already playing before the Big Ten decision came. So, in addition to inflating his role, Trump overstates the accomplishment he is boasting about. In the presidential debate, Trump claimed he ""brought back Big Ten football."" But school and conference leaders jumped in to dispute that claim, saying that opportunities for continued rapid testing of players and other medical advice led them to undo their decision to play in the spring instead of the fall. It’s clear that Trump urged the Big Ten to return this fall, but far less clear that his urging played into the final decision. We rate his claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F0D80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/06/donald-trump/big-ten-leaders-say-testing-and-medical-advice-bro/

The post continues in another image, specifying, ""Enrique Tarrio is the Florida state director of Miami-based Latinos for Trump, and the national chairman of Proud Boys."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post came from an unverified Instagram account called Cubanos con Biden, translated Cubans with Biden in English. A spokesperson for former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign said the post was not official campaign communication. Here’s what we know: Tarrio is the current chairman of the Proud Boys, according to the New York Times and the Anti-Defamation League. He is also listed as the Florida state director of a group called Latinos for Trump, which is run by organization president Bianca Gracia. Tarrio ran to represent Florida’s 27th Congressional District, but he struggled with fundraising and ultimately dropped out of the race before the August primary. But here’s where things get nuanced: the Latinos for Trump group that Tarrio is involved in is not directly associated with the official Trump campaign, as its name might suggest.  Garcia and Tarrio’s Latinos for Trump site includes a small but important disclaimer at the bottom of its homepage: ""Latinos for Trump is not affiliated with, authorized, or sponsored by Donald J. Trump, Inc. which is the principal campaign committee of President Donald J. Trump."" Ken Farnaso, a spokesperson for the official Trump campaign, also confirmed Tarrio holds no position within Trump’s official campaign organization. ""Mr. Tarrio is not affiliated with the Trump Campaign, the family, or our official Latinos for Trump coalition,"" he said. ""He is also not the state director of our coalition and is not on our advisory board."" The Trump campaign has sent cease and desist letters to the unofficial Latinos for Trump group. Among other things, the letters requested the group include ""prominent disclaimers"" on each page of its website and on its marketing and promotional materials that indicate the group is not affiliated with the official Trump campaign. The official Latinos for Trump campaign website lists its advisory board members, and Tarrio is not among them. An Instagram post says, ""The leader of Proud Boys is the Florida state director of Latinos for Trump."" Enrique Tarrio, who is chairman of the Proud Boys, is also the Florida state director of a group called Latinos for Trump. However, the Latinos for Trump group Tarrio helps run is not affiliated with the official Trump campaign in any way.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context: there are two Latinos for Trump groups — one sanctioned by the Trump campaign and another outside the campaign’s purview. This post inaccurately suggests the Trump campaign hired a leader of the Proud Boys to run some campaign operations in Florida. That’s not what happened.

Does Sri Kulkarni attend notorious desert drug parties?
","A new attack ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to elect a GOP majority in the House of Representatives, suggests a Texas congressional hopeful lives a hard-partying lifestyle.  ""What do we really know about Sri Kulkarni?"" the ad asks. ""About the notorious desert drug parties he attended? His cocaine arrest? Kulkarni’s personal behavior is reckless."" Republican groups have made these claims on several other platforms, setting up a website and sending out mailers that depict Kulkarni as drug-addled and impulsive. We wanted to see if the facts of this attack line held up to scrutiny. We found that both of these claims – that Kulkarni was arrested for cocaine possession and that he attends ""notorious"" drug parties – leave out important context and paint a misleading portrait of Kulkarni’s experience with illegal drugs. We’ll tackle them one by one. Sri Kulkarni was once arrested for cocaine possession 23 years ago, when he was 18 years old.  In 1997, Kulkarni was arrested for possessing less than a gram of cocaine but was never convicted. Although he pleaded guilty, his charge was dismissed by a Harris County judge after ""deferred adjudication.""  Jennifer Laurin, a professor of criminal law at the University of Texas School of Law, explained to PolitiFact that ""deferred adjudication"" is a disposition that allows a defendant to have their charge dismissed after a period of supervision. Kulkarni paid a $500 fine and served two years of probation before his charge was thrown out.  Kulkarni has addressed his arrest before, telling the Houston Chronicle that it occurred during a stressful time when his father was dying of leukemia. ""We should not be stigmatizing our youth for the rest of their lives,"" he told the paper.  Jack Doyle, Kulkarni’s communications director, noted that Kulkarni served in the United States Foreign Service for 14 years. As a State Department employee, he had top secret security clearance and was subject to randomized drug testing.  In an attempt to show that Kulkarni has continued to engage in the same ""reckless"" behavior of his adolescence, the Congressional Leadership Fund also claims that he attended ""notorious desert drug parties.""  The phrase piqued our interest. But when we drilled down into the basis of the claim, and after speaking with the Congressional Leadership Fund, we found that the reality is less salacious than the ad makes it out to be. Turns out, the ""notorious desert drug (party)"" that Kulkarni attended was Burning Man, the days-long arts and spirituality festival in the Nevada desert.  Kulkarni has attended Burning Man in the past and is a member of several Burning Man-affiliated Facebook groups. There’s no denying the fact that drug use is common at Burning Man, and that illicit substances are part of the festival’s public reputation. However, people go to Burning Man for a wide variety of reasons, and it’s a stretch to say that the primary focus of the festival is to provide a space for illegal drug use.  More than 70,000 people went to Burning Man in 2018. The event aims to provide a venue of ""radical inclusivity,"" providing a space for people to make art, dance, give gifts, meditate, and collaborate with one another in building an environment separate from normal society. The event is annual, legal, and widely advertised, and in past years, many celebrities have attended, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Grover Norquist.  ""It’s unfair to say that everyone is at Burning Man to do drugs,"" said Brian Doherty, a senior editor at Reason and author of This Is Burning Man, a book about the festival. ""That’s not its purpose, and we can’t just presume that you did drugs there.""  An ad released by a Republican super PAC claims that Sri Kulkarni was arrested for cocaine possession and attended ""notorious desert drug parties."" Overall, these claims are partially accurate. Kulkarni was arrested for cocaine possession. But the arrest was 23 years ago when Kulkarni was 18. He pleaded guilty, but the charge was later dismissed.  The notorious desert drug party is, in fact, a music festival called Burning Man. The Congressional Leadership Fund is taking a small fact — that Kulkarni attended the festival — to make an unproven assertion that Kulkarni is reckless. We rate these claims Half True. ​",[<zip object at 0x0000028097299E00>],/factchecks/2020/oct/06/congressional-leadership-fund/does-sri-kulkarni-attend-notorious-desert-drug-par/

It’s the ""most sweeping federal intervention into law enforcement in years,"" the New York Times said. ""It would eliminate legal protections that shield police officers from lawsuits, make it easier to prosecute them for wrongdoing, impose a new set of restrictions on the use of deadly force, and effectively ban the use of chokeholds."" It would also create a national registry to track police misconduct, require law enforcement agencies to report use of force data, ban no-knock warrants in federal drug cases, require officers to use more body and dashboard cameras, and tie some federal grants to law enforcement agencies adopting anti-discrimination training and practices.  House Republicans said the bill overreaches, and it has stalled in the Senate. President Donald Trump has also threatened to veto the legislation if it did reach his desk.   In June, Floyd’s brother urged the United Nations to investigate racism, police brutality and police killings of unarmed Black people in the United States, the New York Times reported.  But this bill in no way empowers the United Nations to run police boards in dozens of cities in the United States.

Biden wants to use land banks for farmers, and similar programs already exist
","Facebook users are calling out Joe Biden’s plans for American farmers. Posts like this one say Biden wants farmers to put their land into government-owned land banks and would tell them what sustainable plants they can grow.  ""Biden wants American farmers to put their farmland into Gvt ‘land banks.’ Gvt would then tell farmers what ‘sustainable’ plants they could grow. Are you ok with this,"" says one text post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The claim appears to be based on an answer Biden gave during a Sept. 17 CNN presidential town hall meeting. During the televised event, Julie Masser Ballay, a Pennsylvania farmer and Republican, asked Biden how he plans to decrease the regulatory burden for farmers. Ballay referenced the threat of increased regulation of farms, particularly through the proposed Green New Deal. Biden answered: ""Number one, we should provide for your ability to make a lot more money, as farmers, by dealing with you being able to put land in land banks, and you get paid to do that to provide for more open space and provide for the ability of you to be able to be in a position that we are going to pay you for planting certain crops that in fact absorb carbon from the air,"" according to a transcript of the event.  Agricultural programs similar to land banks already exist in the United States. For example, the Conservation Reserve Program administered by the Farm Service Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture pays farmers a yearly rental fee if they agree to ""remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that will improve environmental health and quality,"" according to the Farm Service Agency. Similarly, the Conservation Stewardship Program that Biden vowed to expand already includes a grasslands conservation initiative that pays farmers to turn cropland into grass or pasture.  Biden’s remark that ""we will pay you for planting certain crops that in fact absorb carbon from the air"" is likely a reference to his proposal to expand the Conservation Stewardship program to pay farmers for ""practices to protect the environment, including carbon sequestrestration,"" according to his answer to the Presidential Candidate Questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau. Certain crops, including ""cover crops,"" are important to carbon sequestration, according to Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, part of USDA. We contacted Biden’s campaign for comment but did not receive a reply.  The programs are voluntary, not mandatory. So to the extent a hypothetical Biden administration is telling farmers what plants to grow, it’s only because the farmers agreed to do so in the first place. The Facebook post says Biden ""wants American farmers to put their farmland into Gvt ‘land banks.’ Gvt would then tell farmers what ‘sustainable’ plants they could grow."" The claim is partially accurate. Biden does support land banks for farmers — and similar programs already exist — and paying farmers for growing certain crops.

Claim that Maine Sen. Susan Collins acted to help her husband’s firm falls short
","In a Maine race that could help determine whether Republicans keep their Senate majority, attack ads have drawn in the candidates’ husbands. First, Republican incumbent Sen. Susan Collins attacked her Democratic challenger, Sara Gideon, by alleging that Gideon’s husband’s law firm ""took up to $2 million"" from the same federal program that Gideon ""falsely"" attacked Collins over.  Collins’ points were partially accurate, and we rated it Half True.  Now Gideon returns fire in an ad that charges that Collins has a conflict of interest and ""pushed for policies that benefited her husband’s lobbying business."" But the ad is misleading in that two actions Collins’ conflicts were general in nature and did not target her future husband’s business — or even lobbying firms — specifically. And for the record, Collins took these actions before she was married.  Even the news article on which the ad sources its information provides context that could undermine the severity of Gideon’s attack. Collins has been a senator since 1997. Gideon has served in Maine’s state House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016.  Many news accounts say the race could help decide whether Republicans, who control 53 seats in the Senate, keep their majority. The Cook Political Report has rated the race a tossup. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. Gideon’s ad relies on a Sept. 1 news article in the Huffington Post, showing quotes from the story while a narrator voices the nearly identical claim that Collins ""pushed for policies that benefited her husband’s lobbying business."" According to the article, Collins began dating Thomas Daffron, formerly the chief operating officer of Jefferson Consulting Group, a lobbying and consulting firm, in 2010 and married him in 2012.  Daffron last registered as a lobbyist in 2006 and retired from the firm in 2016, according to Collins’ campaign. Two actions Collins took in 2011 ""could have directly benefited her future husband’s business,"" the Huffington Post article says.  Repealing 3% withholding tax on government contractors:  This needs context. Collins voted to repeal a 3% withholding tax on government contractors. But the repeal — approved 95-0 in the Senate — was not specific to Daffron’s firm, nor even specific to lobbyists. And the tax, which was estimated to collect $11.2 billion over 10 years, had never actually been implemented.  The tax had been signed into law by President George W. Bush to encourage government contractors to fully pay their taxes. Small businesses argued the tax would make small firms less able to compete for government contracts ""due to the anticipated cash flow issues"" and higher costs. The tax was widely criticized by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers who said it placed an unfair burden on a majority of government contractors who paid taxes on time, and it was never even implemented before being repealed, the Associated Press reported. Leading effort to stop Obama administration rule on contractors’ financial disclosures:  Collins did lead a push to stop President Barack Obama’s administration from implementing a rule requiring federal contractors to disclose their political giving, including introducing a bill to ban such a rule. The administration abandoned the effort. Collins’ campaign said Collins sent a bipartisan letter to the administration saying the rule would create ""the appearance that this type of information could become a factor in the award of federal contracts."" Indeed, the article that Gideon relies on says that attacks such as those on Collins’ two actions in 2011 show ""Democrats are prepared to turn even relatively routine, bipartisan elements of Collins’ four terms in the Senate into fodder for attack ads."" Gideon claimed Collins ""pushed for policies that benefited her husband’s lobbying business."" Neither piece of evidence cited in the ad proves Collins acted to benefit the business directly. Two actions taken by Collins, prior to marrying her husband, were bipartisan and broad. While her future husband’s lobbying firm, Jefferson Consulting Group, could have been affected by the measures, there is no evidence Collins acted specifically to benefit him. The vote to repeal a withholding tax received broad bipartisan Senate support and resulted in a 95-0 vote. Her push against an Obama initiative involving financial disclosures was on the grounds that such a rule could unduly influence federal contract awards. Neither action was directed specifically at helping her husband’s firm, nor were they even directed at lobbyists, but rather federal contractors generally. We rate the statement Mostly False.

Roger Williams says foe has never voted in congressional district and doesn't live there
","
Newly stumping for a U.S. House seat, Roger Williams told a Weatherford crowd that opponent Michael Williams lacks local grounding. The two Williamses (unrelated) are both Republicans who recently dropped U.S. Senate bids to run in the same newly created North Texas House district.

""My opponent does not live in the district,"" Roger Williams said June 28, according to The Weatherford Democrat. ""My opponent has never voted in the district.""

Not living there? Never voted there? 
Per the U.S. Constitution, a citizen does not have to live in a congressional district to hold its House seat, though they must be an inhabitant of the same state. If a candidate doesn't live in the district, though, their opponents are likely to point that out. 
In this episode, Roger Williams was questioning his foe's ties to the 33rd Congressional District just drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Its map of the state’s 36 congressional districts awaits Gov. Rick Perry’s approval.

Michael Williams’ campaign disputed Roger Williams’ charge in a June 30 press release. The release says Michael Williams and his wife, Donna, ""have owned and claimed a homestead exemption on the same home"" in the district since 1995 and, it says, Williams has voted in Arlington many times.

In an interview, Will Fullerton, Michael Williams’ campaign manager, told us Williams lived in an Austin condominium while serving on the Texas Railroad Commission, from 1999 to this spring, to satisfy a state constitutional provision requiring statewide elected officials to live in the capital. He said too that Williams has lived in his Arlington home since resigning from the commission as of April 2. 
Williams was registered to vote in Austin while serving as a commissioner, Fullerton said, though he laid plans to register in Tarrant County after stepping down.

We turned next to government sources.

According to a clerk with the Tarrant County Appraisal District, Michael and Donna Williams have claimed a homestead exemption on an Arlington residence since 1995. A county elections clerk, Rita Castillo, told us the county fielded a voter registration application from Michael Williams on June 24 and it’s being reviewed by the Texas secretary of state’s office, which oversees elections. Castillo said a state database lists Michael Williams as currently registered to vote in Austin.

Responding to our open-records’ request, Tarrant County later provided information indicating that Michael Williams went to the county’s polls 10 times from November 1994 through November 1999.

To our inquiry, Roger Williams’ spokesman Colby Hale stressed by email that Michael Williams admits to living in Austin for a decade and to making Austin the ""principal location where he votes."" He later added that Roger Williams intended to say that for more than a decade, Michael Williams lived, worked and voted in Austin.

Far as we can tell, this amended description is about right. However, Michael Williams has also lived in Arlington, where he has claimed a homestead in Arlington for more than 15 years. And contrary to his foe’s published statement, Michael Williams also has voted in the 33rd district and lives there now.

All told, the essence of Roger Williams’ statement — that Michael Williams is a carpetbagger — doesn’t hold up. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809728EEC0>],/factchecks/2011/jul/05/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-foe-has-never-voted-congressio/

Gov. Chris Christie says New Jersey is second in the nation for Medicaid spending
","
Gov. Chris Christie likes to tell people how New Jersey leads the nation or comes close in various fiscal categories, but when it comes to Medicaid spending, the Republican issued the wrong diagnosis.

During the June 16 broadcast of On the Line, host Steve Adubato was pressing Christie about why the governor wouldn’t support a tax increase for higher income earners. Adubato argued that revenue could support health benefits for struggling families.

Christie said New Jersey already faces high taxes and offered this extra dose of reasoning:

""We have the second-richest Medicaid program in America. Only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey. Steve, at some point, we have to say no to certain things.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that New Jersey’s Medicaid expenses in recent years were higher than most of the country, but not as high as Christie said they were.

According to three separate analyses -- covering the current federal fiscal year and the two previous ones -- New Jersey has ranked ninth each time in overall state spending on Medicaid. A Christie spokesman later pointed to older fiscal year numbers to back up the governor’s statement.

Based on data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, two analyses were performed by PolitiFact New Jersey and the other by the California-based Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy.

First, let’s start with the older numbers.

According to the foundation’s website -- www.statehealthfacts.org-- the state share of Medicaid spending in New Jersey between October 2008 and September 2009 was about $3.9 billion, putting it in ninth place among the 50 states and Washington, D.C.

A similar result turned up when we looked at more recent numbers.

Tony Salters, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, provided us with data on Medicaid expenses from fiscal year 2010 as well as the first two quarters of fiscal year 2011.

Based on that data, New Jersey ranked ninth among the states for overall state spending on Medicaid between October 2009 and September 2010. For the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, New Jersey also ranked ninth among the states, according to the federal data.

In each of the three fiscal years, the states ahead of New Jersey were New York, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts and Ohio, according to the federal data.

If we go further back and look at a different measure, New Jersey still doesn’t rank second.

Joel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, said he prefers the measure of total Medicaid spending per person below the federal poverty level. Based on that measure, New Jersey ranked 13th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in federal and state spending combined in federal fiscal year 2008, Cantor said.

After being presented with some of our findings, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak pointed to a different analysis performed by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

That analysis shows that New Jersey ranked second among the states behind Alaska in Medicaid payments per adult in federal fiscal year 2007. Those payments represent federal and state shares.

""Of course, who we are second to is less relevant than the essential point that this is one more area where New Jersey ranked near the top in something (like taxes), and not in a good way,"" Drewniak wrote in an email.

But Medicaid payments for adults accounted for about 8 percent of total payments in New Jersey in federal fiscal year 2007, marking the smallest percentage among four enrollment groups, according to the foundation.

When we look at per-person payments for elderly and disabled residents -- the two largest groups benefiting from Medicaid funding -- New Jersey ranked 16th and fifth, respectively, among the 50 states and Washington, D.C., according to the foundation.

Let’s review:

In discussing his opposition to raising taxes on higher income earners, Christie said, ""Only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey.""

Yet federal data going back nearly three years has shown that New Jersey consistently ranks ninth in overall state spending on Medicaid. A Christie spokesman said New Jersey ranked second behind Alaska in payments per adult, but the least amount of Medicaid payments went towards that enrollment group.

New Jersey lands in the top ten for Medicaid spending in many cases, but the governor was wrong in his specific assertion that New Jersey ranked second. We rate Christie’s statement False.

Did you get this e-mail? It says President Barack Obama said the troops ""whine about bearing the costs of their choice"" and that ""Nobody made these guys go to war.""

We've gotten many copies of these e-mails forwarded to us by readers. It's similar to another chain e-mail we fact-checked awhile back, but since this new version keeps arriving, we thought we'd look at it again. It's still Pants-on-Fire wrong. 

This particular e-mail seems aimed at veterans and their friends and family members.

If someone has to explain this to you, You are not a veteran. ... He [Obama]  doesn't seem to have much respect for the military. Maybe in the future our leaders should be veterans.

THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SEE THIS!! THE MOST STUPID STATEMENT EVER BY A PRESIDENT.

Bad press, including major mockery of the play by comedian Jon Stewart, led to President Obama abandoning his proposal to require veterans carry private health insurance to cover the estimated $540 billion annual cost to the federal government of treatment for injuries to military personnel received during their tours on active duty. The President admitted that he was puzzled by the magnitude of the opposition to his proposal.

""Look, it's an all volunteer force,"" Obama complained. ""Nobody made these guys go to war. They had to have known and accepted the risks. Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice? It doesn't compute.."" 

""I thought these were people who were proud to sacrifice for their country,"" Obama continued. ""I wasn't asking for blood, just money. With the country facing the worst financial crisis in its history, I'd have thought that the patriotic thing to do would be to try to help reduce the nation's deficit.. I guess I underestimated the selfishness of some of my fellow Americans.""

If he thinks he will ever get another vote from an Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard service member or veteran of a military service he ought to think it over ... If you or a family member is or has served their country please pass this to them.

To begin with, President Obama never said these words. 

They actually come from the humorist John Semmens, who writes satire on the news. 
In fact, we've fact-checked two other chain e-mails that we've found to be rip-offs of Semmens' pieces, passed off as real facts. One chain e-mail claimed Rep. Gabrielle Giffords urged the military to stab or club their opponents instead of shooting them, as a way to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment. Another said Obama wanted to change the national anthem to ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing."" We awarded both chain e-mails Pants on Fire ratings.

In the case of this chain e-mail, Semmens wrote his report in March 2009 after the White House abandoned a plan to bill veterans' private insurers for their war-related injuries. It was intended as a cost-savings measure, to save the Veterans Administration $540 million a year. 

By the way, note that the chain e-mail changes that price tag to $540 billion, with a ""b"". That too is inaccurate.

Veterans groups opposed the plan, and the White House scuttled the idea. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a press release on the matter on March 18, 2009:

""The President demonstrated his deep commitment to veterans by proposing the largest increase in the VA budget in 30 years and calling VSO (Veterans Service Organizations) and MSO (Military Service Organizations) leaders into the White House for an unprecedented meeting to discuss various aspects of the budget proposal,"" Gibbs said. ""In considering the third party billing issue, the administration was seeking to maximize the resources available for veterans; however, the President listened to concerns raised by the VSOs that this might, under certain circumstances, affect veterans and their families' ability to access health care. Therefore, the President has instructed that its consideration be dropped. The President wants to continue a constructive partnership with the VSOs and MSOs and is grateful to those VSOs and MSOs who have worked in good faith with him on the budget proposal.""

Not only have we fact-checked this before, but our friends at other fact-checking organizations -- Factcheck.org and Snopes-- have also debunked it. 

In fact, the chain e-mail is pretty much the opposite of Obama's actual comments about the troops. 

For example, here's what he said to troops in Afghanistan on March 28, 2010.

""You've been there for us, tour after tour, year after year, at a time when too many American institutions have let us down, when too many institutions have put short-term gain in front of a commitment to duty and a commitment to what's right,"" Obama said. ""You've met your responsibilities, you've done your duty -- not just when it's easy. That's why you've inspired your fellow Americans. That's why you inspire me. That's why you've earned your place next to the very greatest of American generations. And all of you represent the virtues and the values that America so desperately needs right now: sacrifice and selflessness, honor and decency.""

Or what he said to troops at Fort Cambell on May 6, 2011, in the days after Osama bin Laden was killed.

""And today, here at Fort Campbell, I had the privilege of meeting the extraordinary Special Ops folks who honored that promise. It was a chance for me to say —- on behalf of all Americans and people around the world —- 'Job well done.' Job well done. They're America's 'quiet professionals' -- because success demands secrecy. But I will say this. Like all of you, they could have chosen a life of ease. But like you, they volunteered. They chose to serve in a time of war, knowing they could be sent into harm's way. They trained for years. They're battle-hardened. They practiced tirelessly for this mission. And when I gave the order, they were ready.""

Or what he said to troops at Fort Drum on June 23, 2011.

""The reason that I know many of you continue to do the outstanding work that you do is not only love of country but it's also love for each other, and your commitment to making sure that those sacrifices were not in vain. So the main message I have for all of you here today is that the American people understand the sacrifices you're making; they understand the sacrifices that your families are making. ... So, for all the sacrifices that you've made, I want to say thank you.""

The chain e-mail that purports to be Obama's comments on troops is maliciously false. It's particularly egregious for trying to ply veterans with false information. We rate this one Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3A9D00>],/factchecks/2011/jul/04/chain-email/barack-obama-said-troops-whine-and-nobody-made-the/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Trade', 'Transportation', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama said you don't see American made cars in South Korea
","
President Barack Obama criticized Congress at a Wednesday press conference for not passing legislation that would help the economy. One example, he said, was that Congress needs to approve pending trade agreements. 

""I think these trade deals will be important because right now South Korea, frankly, has a better deal when it comes to our trading relationship than we do. Part of the reason I want to pass this trade deal is you see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea. So let's re-balance that trading relationship. That's why we should get this passed,"" he said.

We decided to fact-check Obama's statement about cars in the United States and Korea. 

Our first stop was to look at the statistics on auto imports and exports. We turned to numbers compiled by the U.S. Commerce Department. The numbers show that the United States exported 16,659 vehicles to Korea in 2010. Korea, meanwhile, exported 515,646 vehicles to the United States. That means that for every car we sent to Korea, the Koreans sent more than 30 to us. And we should note the 16,659 represented a six-year high; between 2005 and 2010 the number was even lower. 
It's true that South Korea has a smaller population than the United States, with about 48.8 million people there and 313.2  million people here. But that is an imbalance of about 1 to 6, significantly smaller than the disparity in auto sales. 
So Obama's larger point about a significant trade imbalance for cars is correct. Experts we spoke with also said he was largely correct that South Korea has ""a better deal"" when it comes to our trading relationship.

Still, Obama's statement requires a few qualifications, they said.

For one thing, there are not clear categories of American cars and Korean cars. Kia Motors, for example, has a large auto plant in Georgia, and Hyundai Motors has a plant in Alabama. It's possible that some of the cars the United States sold to Korea could be Korean-branded cars.

Meanwhile, General Motors owns the Korean auto company Daewoo, which it purchased back in 2001. One estimate we saw said GM sold 90,000 Korean-made cars in Korea in 2008. This year, GM decided to end the Daewoo brand and operate as GM Korea. The Korean-made cars it now sells in the country carry typical American brands like Chevrolet. 

Additionally, the experts we spoke with presented a more nuanced picture of whether the trade agreement would actually help U.S. automakers sell more cars in Korea. Koreans tend to favor smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, and the government there maintains strict standards for fuel efficiency and other things that make it hard for American companies to compete, even if tariffs between the two countries are reduced. 

To look at it more optimistically, though, they said the proposed trade agreement would not make things worse for U.S. automakers.

""I don't think we can get any worse,"" said Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the independent Center for Automotive Research. ""The Koreans are doing all the damage they can do right now.""

Finally, we wanted to address the point of whether American made cars are rarely seen in Korea. David Straub, who leads the Korean Studies Program at Stanford University, lived in Seoul in 2007, so we asked him if he ever saw an American branded car while he was there. He said the statistics show that there are indeed some American cars are in South Korea. ""But did I ever see an American car? I don't recall seeing one,"" he said.

It's worth noting that Obama's press conference didn't do much to prod Congress to act on the trade agreement. The day after his remarks, Senate Republicans boycotted a hearing on the trade agreement, arguing that the trade agreement should not include $1 billion in additional spending to help workers who become unemployed as a result of international trade.

Overall, though, we found little dispute that Obama's statement, ""You see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea,"" is largely correct, if you account for the complexity of international trade. Korean companies are building cars in America, while American companies build cars in Korea. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3CC280>],/factchecks/2011/jul/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-you-dont-see-american-made-cars-/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Nina Turner']","
State Sen. Nina Turner says more than 14,000 voters cast ballots in the wrong precinct in 2008
","
An elections reform bill approved in June by the Ohio Senate had plenty of troubling new provisions for critics of the proposal, namely Democrats.

The bill contained a number of changes to Ohio’s voting and election procedures, some of which may lead to voter suppression, opponents of House Bill 194 argued before the Republican-controlled Senate passed the bill along party lines.  

For example, one provision added by the Ohio House barred poll workers from helping voters find their correct precinct for voting if they end up in the wrong place.

Current law mandates that poll workers direct voters to their correct voting location. That’s important because casting a ballot in the wrong place means your vote doesn’t count.

""Voting in the wrong precinct led to over 14,000 registered voters statewide to lose their vote in 2008,""  state Sen Nina Turner, a Cleveland Democrat, said during a floor speech on June 22.

""But I guess the loss of votes for some doesn’t matter,"" she sarcastically concluded, suggesting that Republicans were deliberately trying to suppress valid ballots in urban and impoverished areas of the state where mixing up precincts most often occurs.

It’s a powerful charge. And one can see Turner’s concern for those who are legitimately confused as to where they are suppose to vote. But Politifact Ohio wanted to know if there really were more than 14,000 ballots thrown out during the November 2008 elections — a presidential election, making it more significant — as she claimed.

First, it needs to be noted that bills are ever-changing before they become a finished product, and so, too, was this one. The House added the provision blocking poll workers from helping voters, an idea that was not supported by Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted.  House Republicans said they were merely trying to protect poll workers and county boards of election from being legally liable for giving voters wrong information that might lead to a ballot not being counted.

But the time the bill received final passage, that provision was removed. So to, though, was another mandate.

""As the bill now stands there is no strict prohibition on them directing voters to their correct precinct and there’s no mandate that they do, either,"" explained Maggie Ostrowski, a spokeswoman for Husted.

That still concerns Turner and other opponents of the bill — which will soon become law — because it removes the mandate for poll workers to help.

But, what about the figure Turner quoted?

Turner cited information supplied by the secretary of state’s office. Former Secretary Jennifer Brunner compiled a report for the governor, legislature and state residents compiling statistics and analysis of how well the state’s election process worked. It is a routine report following major elections.

Provisional ballots are required when a person shows up to vote but does not have the documentation to verify their identity as a registered voter. Poll workers then allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until their identity is proven and at that point the ballot will be counted.

According to the secretary’s report, there were 206,859 provisional ballots cast during the November 2008 election. But 39,989 of those ballots were not counted for a number of reasons, most commonly because the person casting the ballot was not registered to vote in the state of Ohio.

But the second most common reason the ballot was not counted was because while the person was properly registered to vote in Ohio, they cast the ballot in the wrong county or precinct. In all, 14,335 such ballots were not counted for this reason, according to the Brunner report.

Of those 14,000-plus ballots, 3,423 were cast in Cuyahoga County, home to Turner’s district and by far the county with the most uncounted provisional ballots during the November 2008 elections due to wrong place filings.

The irony here, given Turner’s fight to get poll workers to assist voters, is that the casting of provisional ballots in the wrong place is most often the fault of the poll workers themselves — not voters.

A voter cannot get a provisional ballot unless given one by a poll worker. Remember, under current law, the law in place in November 2008, poll workers were mandated to get voters to the right location even if they are voting provisionally. Ostrowski noted that it is not always poll workers fault because sometimes voters insist they are in the right location and demand a provisional ballot.

Regardless, data from the secretary of state’s office supports Turner’s claim. In the November 2008 election ballots from more than 14,000 registered voters weren’t counted because they were cast in the wrong place.

Her claim is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Turner’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F0900>],/factchecks/2011/jul/04/nina-turner/state-sen-nina-turner-says-more-14000-voters-cast-/

 Charles Perry says $6 billion projected to accumulate in the state’s rainy day fund is already used
","
The latest state budget signed into law by GOP Gov. Rick Perry is expected to leave $6 billion-plus in the state’s so-called rainy day fund, right?

Nope, says first-term state Rep. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, who told the Texas Tribune for a June 24 article that while the $6 billion indeed went unspent in the 2012-13 budget, that’s not the whole story.

""We’ve got to get the message right,"" said Perry, who’s of no relation to the governor. ""There’s been a lot of misinformation out there that there’s $6 billion in the fund that’s not been used. It’s been used.""

Eh?

Some background: In January, state Comptroller Susan Combs predicted the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, would have a balance of $9.6 billion by the end of August 2013. That figure was later whittled to $6.4 billion after legislators used $3.2 billion to cover a deficit in the current budget, which runs through August.

The governor recently told a New Orleans audience that Texas lawmakers balanced the budget while leaving $6 billion in a rainy day fund--a claim we rated Half True this week because his claim didn’t acknowledge some costs that lawmakers put off paying until 2013.

""That’s the governor’s message,"" Rep. Perry told the Tribune. ""That’s not Charles Perry the legislator’s message.""

In an interview with us, the representative conceded the Republican-guided Legislature did not earmark the money expected to pile up in the fund, which has a current balance of $5 billion. But, he said, that doesn’t mean it couldn’t have covered existing needs.

Rep. Perry, informing us he’s a CPA by trade, said underfunding Medicaid by $4.4 billion and postponing $2.3 billion in payments to school districts to the fiscal year starting in September 2013 amount to obligations that can’t be denied.

""It’s not accurate to say that (rainy-day) money is not restricted,"" he said. ""We know we’re going to have to pay it.""

In separate interviews, Rep. Jim Pitts of Waxhachie and Sen. Steve Ogden of Bryan, who chair the respective House and Senate budget-drafting committees, agreed lawmakers left the cited items dangling. Both cautioned, though, that much could change to ease pressures by 2013. The state’s economy could out-perform expectations, Medicaid caseloads might fall short of projections, Congress could even reduce what it expects states to chip in.

Rep. Perry reminded us those are uncertain speculations. Plus, he suggested, it’s likely ""we are going to see less and less money from the feds,"" noting that Congress is in talks to reduce federal spending and besides, states will ultimately be expected to pick up a share of the costs of the federal health care overhaul approved in 2010.

Our take: Rep. Perry’s statement overreaches because the money projected to pile up in the fund has not been used. Still, the 2011 Legislature adjourned amid expectations that when legislators next gather, they will lean on the fund to cover $6 billion in unpaid expenses.

We rate his claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C52900>],/factchecks/2011/jul/04/charles-perry/charles-perry-says-6-billion-projected-accumulate-/
"['Environment', 'New Jersey', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Corporations', 'Jeff Tittel']","
Jeff Tittel says RGGI factored into Anheuser-Busch’s decision to stay in New Jersey
","The ""King of Beers"" has reigned in Newark for more than half a century.

But according to Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser brewery may have been seeking a new home.

Soon after Gov. Chris Christie announced plans to pull New Jersey out of a regional cap-and-trade program, lawmakers, state officials, business leaders and environmental leaders debated the merits of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, during a state assembly committee hearing.

In response to testimony that RGGI, known as ""Reggie,"" was one of the reasons businesses were leaving the state, Tittel said, ""When we talk about businesses, and I know this from first hand, one of the reasons that Budweiser stayed in New Jersey is the money they got from RGGI to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs.""

RGGI caps the amount of carbon dioxide power plants can emit in 10 states. Credits can be bought or sold if plants need to release more or less carbon dioxide. Proceeds from the sales help participating states fund clean energy initiatives.

PolitiFact New Jersey questioned whether the St. Louis-based beer company had ever considered abandoning its throne in the Garden State and if a reduction in energy costs from solar panels funded by RGGI was one of the reasons that convinced them to stay. Neither was true.

First, let’s note that Anheuser-Busch’s Newark brewery had solar panels installed on its roof.

A May 17, 2010 news release issued by Anheuser-Busch announcing the installation said more than 3,000 photovoltaic solar panels, covering 65,000 square feet, would be capable, at peak production, of ""covering nearly five percent of the brewery's electricity demand."" Orion Energy Systems installed and operate the solar panels, according to the release.

Anheuser-Busch officials quoted in the release talked about how the installation is an example of the company’s commitment to alternate energy sources. There is no mention of the solar panel project swaying the company to stay in New Jersey.

So the brewery had solar panels installed on its roof, but did the beer company receive RGGI funds for the project?

Tittel said his statement was based on a conversation he had with Al Komjathy, a lobbyist with the firm Komjathy & Stewart, which represents Anheuser-Busch, among other companies.

But Komjathy said he never spoke with Tittel about the issue. ""I never had that discussion with him,"" he told PolitiFact New Jersey.

And Anheuser-Busch told us in a statement: ""Our Newark brewery did not receive funding from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for the solar panel project and there were no plans to relocate the brewery.""

It’s worth noting that Anheuser-Busch applied for funding for a cogeneration power plant at its Newark brewery through the Clean Energy Solutions Capital Investment initiative, a financing program funded by RGGI proceeds and controlled by the state Economic Development Authority. Laura Jones, a spokeswoman for the state Economic Development Authority, said the agency approved Anheuser-Busch’s request, but that the beer company never used the funding.

Tittel said at the time he made the claim about the solar panels, ""I thought it was accurate."" Now, he said, ""most of what I said was accurate but not 100 percent.""

Most? Try little to nothing.

The only thing Tittel got correct in his statement is that solar panels were installed on the roof of Anheuser-Busch’s Newark brewery. Funding for the project did not come from RGGI and the company said it was never considering leaving the state.

Tittel tried to argue that although the brewery did not receive funding through RGGI, legislation, often called ""the RGGI law,"" helped the project.

As part of the project, PSEG Power agreed to purchase solar renewable energy certificates produced by the solar panels, according to PSEG spokesman Fran Sullivan.

Tittel said he was referring to Section 13 in ""the RGGI law"" -- the section allows electric and utility companies to charge ratepayers for investments they make in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.

However, a spokesman for the state Board of Public Utilities  told us that because PSEG Power is not regulated, Section 13 does not apply.

Let’s recap.

Tittel claimed one of the reasons Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser brewery in Newark stayed in New Jersey is because they received funding through RGGI to install solar panels, thereby reducing their energy costs.

Anheuser-Busch told us they weren’t planning on relocating the brewery and that they did not receive funds through RGGI for the solar project.

We rate Tittel’s claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.",[<zip object at 0x000002809707D700>],/factchecks/2011/jul/04/jeff-tittel/new-jersey-sierra-club-president-jeff-tittel-says-/

Rhode Island lighthouse group says its fundraising license plate was voted best specialty plate in U.S.
","
Specialty license plates are all the rage. In some states, you can choose from as many as 200 kinds.

Rhode Island is no exception. You can pick from five specialty plates, with more on the way, not counting traditional ones for firefighters and the military. They’ve become so prominent that one -- promoting Plum Beach Lighthouse -- appears on a billboard on a stretch of Route 95 traveled by 100,000 motorists a day.

""Voted the ‘best specialty plate in American,’ "" the billboard reads.

Now that’s license to brag!

But is it true? We looked to our own navigational beacon, the Truth-O-Meter, to guide us.

Our voyage first took us to the billboard near the Providence-Pawtucket line, best visible to southbound motorists. It shows the license plate, with its idyllic image of the Plum Beach Lighthouse surrounded by placid blue waters and two sport fishermen in a boat.

""Get yours now!"" reads the billboard, directing people to a Web site. ""Thousands sold!""

The license plate is a fundraising tool for Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse, which acquired the 1897 lighthouse 22 years ago with the goal of preserving it. The spark-plug style lighthouse, off North Kingstown in Narragansett Bay’s West Passage, was abandoned following construction of the Jamestown Bridge in 1941.

Seeking to raise funds to paint the lighthouse, the organization got General Assembly approval in late 2009 for a license plate commemorating the landmark. Since then, the group has sold nearly 4,300 plates, the most of any specialty plate in Rhode Island, president David Zapatka told us.

Specialty plates cost $41.50, with $20 going toward the sponsoring group. So far, $86,000 has been raised for the lighthouse, some of which was used to paint the landmark and install solar-powered lighting, Zapatka said.

Following the debut of the lighthouse tag, a local license plate lover nominated it for a competition held by the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association (ALPCA). Every year, its 3,000 members nominate license plates -- only new ones, by the way -- and then vote on the best.

ALPCA announced that its members selected from 12 finalists from 2010. Half were so-called ""general issue"" plates, the kind that states redesign every few years and which most motorists get when they register their vehicles. The other half were specialty plates.

New Mexico’s bright turquoise and gold plate took first. Plum Beach Lighthouse got second. While it was honored as the runner-up, it received no accolades for ""best"" anything.

So we asked Zapatka to shine some light on the billboard’s claim.

""I figured we might get called on that,"" he said immediately.  ""Rather than put up on the billboard, ‘We are the second best plate in America,’ we changed the wording to say we are the ‘best specialty plate in America.’ Did they officially come out and say, ‘You are the best specialty in America’? No.""

But, he insisted, Plum Beach Lighthouse beat out the other five specialty plates, not to mention all but one of the other plates.

""Is it a stretch? Yes,"" he acknowledged. But, he said, ""there is no other specialty plate that finished higher than us in the competition. … It’s a marketing scheme.""

What does ALPCA think about how the Rhode Island group is tooting its horn?

Contest coordinator Gus Oliver, who didn’t vote since he was running the contest, called it a ""misnomer"" and said Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse ""may be stretching"" the contest results in making its claim. A few years ago, there was a separate category for specialty plates, he said, but not anymore.

""The most accurate statement is that, of the specialty plates, it scored the highest or the best,"" said Oliver, who’s from Tulsa, Okla.

But Oliver didn’t take issue with the billboard.

""They put a positive spin on it,"" he said, adding, ""if there had been separate voting [for the two kinds of plates], I feel certain it would have represented the outcome.""

Zapatka, who works in media and is quite familiar with PolitiFact, asked, ""Are you going to light our pants on fire?""

Hmmm, we can see it now: a Plum Beach Lighthouse plate that reads PANTS-AFIRE.

Nah. You just can’t go around tossing matches at non profit groups that are trying to raise money for causes as cherished as lighthouses. Besides, the license plate got more votes than any other specialty tag.

Still, the lighthouse group knew it was making a claim that wasn’t quite accurate.

That’s why we’re stamping their plate BRLY-TRU.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says 2 years ago, we had “the largest deficit ever in Wisconsin”

","
In recent weeks, there has been a lot of talk about the state’s ""structural"" deficit, and how Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature eliminated it in the 2011-13 budget.

During the 2010 campaign, Walker railed against the use of one-time budget maneuvers, which pushed problems into future budgets. Walker returned to the topic in a June 21, 2011, appearance as a guest host on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box,"" touting his own approach.

""We had two years ago the largest structural deficit ever in Wisconsin,"" Walker said. ""One of the things where in many ways they were kicking the can into the future, delaying payments, pushing things off, raided transportation funds and took stimulus money.""

He added: ""And in this budget we wiped that out and put in place structural changes.""

Among the changes: The controversial collective bargaining bill, which requires state workers to contribute more for their pensions and health insurance. In effect, it is a pay cut for workers, which means a savings for taxpayers. From a fiscal perspective, the change is viewed as permanent, rather than a one-time change, said Robert Lang, director of Wisconsin’s non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

But what about the claim that two years ago, under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, the structural deficit was at its largest point?

The structural deficit is a projection that measures the future imbalance between spending and tax revenue as laid out in state law. The fiscal bureau started calculating the structural deficit with the 1997-99 budget.

The structural deficit differs from budget shortfalls caused, for instance, by reduced tax collections due to a poor economy. By law, the two-year budgets must be balanced when approved. But because they are based on projections, things frequently change when expenses rise (or fall) or revenue comes in lower (or higher) than anticipated.

If you look back two years, the structural deficit for the 2009-11 state budget -- when Doyle was in office -- was $1.682 billion, according to a June 13, 2011 fiscal bureau report.

But that’s not the largest ever measured.

Rather, it’s the third highest in the 14 years that the agency has compiled the reports. The worst: a $2.867 billion structural deficit from the 2003-05 budget.

We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie about the governor’s statement. He referred us to the Walker’s executive budget, submitted earlier this year and had no further comment.

That document includes a chart that shows -- without attribution -- structural deficits as calculated by the fiscal bureau. It takes the extra step of showing which governor was in charge for each deficit. Under the largest structural deficit is the name McCallum.

That would be Gov. Scott McCallum, a Republican.

So what’s the bottom line?

Appearing on a national cable TV show viewed by some 269,000 people, Walker said the state’s largest structural deficit had come two years earlier, under his Democratic predecessor. He was off by seven years and a political party.

We rate his statement False.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Alberta Darling']","
State Sen. Alberta Darling says the 2011-13 state budget eliminates the structural deficit “for the first time in decades.”
","
Republicans who control the state Legislature are touting their just-completed work on the 2011-2013 state budget.

State Sen. Alberta Darling, a co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, has been especially vocal about the virtues of the $66 billion spending plan. As one of nine senators facing recall elections over their actions on the separate collective bargaining bill, she’s also been the target of criticism for her votes.

""I think this budget really does put us in the right direction -- phenomenally,"" Darling said in a June 20, 2011, meeting with Journal Sentinel editors and reporters. ""It’s phenomenal what’s been accomplished in terms of debt and deficit reform and restructuring.""

Darling added: ""We’re in the black for the first time in decades.""

To be clear, the budget has to be ""in the black"" every year when it is passed. The state constitution says it must be balanced. Darling was talking about the ""structural deficit,"" which is a relatively new way of measuring the state’s future fiscal health.

The structural deficit measures the future imbalance between spending and tax revenue as laid out in state law. So you can have a balanced budget, but one built upon assumptions that are projected to result in a deficit later on.

We’ve been hearing about that problem for years.

Darling, Walker and others argue their predecessors made the state budgets balance by using one-time maneuvers -- such including the state’s share of federal tobacco settlement money, and diversions of funds for transportation and medical malpractice insurance.

""All these approaches only delayed the day of fiscal reckoning to make the budget balance, leading to the structural deficit,"" said Walker, in the message accompanying his budget introduction.

So, is Darling right?

Did Walker and the Legislature resolve -- for the first time in decades -- the underlying problems, as well as balance spending for the two-year period that begins July 1?

The size of the structural deficit is determined by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, considered by both parties to be a neutral scorekeeper on budget matters. The agency started doing the projections with the 1997-99 budget.

The agency takes a look at the budget as proposed, amended and passed, said agency director Robert Lang. He begins his estimates with a baseline -- the second year of the current budget, which is adjusted based on previously approved law changes or legal commitments. The new budget is then factored in.

""It takes out speculation,"" Lang said of the structural deficit estimates. ""It puts out a marker based on current revenues and projections.""

Agency reports show for the past 14 years show the highest structural deficit was $2.8 billion for the 2003-05 budget, and the lowest was $1.49 billion for the 2007-09 budget.

A report issued June 13, 2011, said the 2011-13 budget as approved by the Joint Finance Committee would result in a $306 million surplus.  The Legislature changed very little of the committee’s work. Lang’s office will evaluate the budget again now that Walker’s vetoes are completed and the budget signed.

Here was Lang’s assessment based on the earlier action: ""We’ve had structural deficits since I started doing this, and now there’s a structural surplus.""

So Darling’s right on that account: the budget has a structural surplus and not a deficit.

The budget does include the changes in pension and insurance payments state workers -- a law enacted before the budget was considered that did not take effect until after it passed -- that helped reduce the budget gap. Those changes are viewed as permanent, not one-time fixes, Lang said.

Lang’s office has only 14 years of records covering a total of nine budgets, including the most recent one. No budget in this time frame showed a surplus, until the current one.

In making her statement, Darling said the structural deficit was fixed for the ""first time in decades."" When we talked to her, she said she misspoke when she said ""decades.""

As aide Bob Delaporte said: ""The point was that it’s in the black for the first time in a long time.""

Fair enough.

Since the structural deficit was not measured before 1997-99, we can’t say just when the structural deficits began.

What’s the bottom line?

In talking about the structural deficit, Darling claimed lawmakers delivered a budget ""in the black for the first time in decades."" The budget lawmakers sent to Walker is projected to have a $306 million surplus. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau report on structural deficits says there’s not been a budget with a structural surplus dating back to when it started recording such things 14 years ago. Darling may have overstated how far back the problem goes, but no one knows for certain and that does not change the underlying point of her statement.

Former U.S. Rep. Richard Swett says Huntsman flip-flopped on stimulus
","
A week and a half ago, New Hampshire Democrats took aim at a former Republican governor they say has a deep history of flip-flopping. And no, it's not the one you think.

Minutes after former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman officially launched his campaign for president, New Hampshire Democratic leaders took to the phones, accusing him of flip-flopping on key issues.

Taking part in a New Hampshire Democratic Party conference call for political reporters, former U.S. Rep. Richard Swett criticized Huntsman for switching his stance on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the federal stimulus package.

""Gov. Huntsman has left diplomacy for a reinvention tour that would make even Mitt Romney blush,"" Swett, a former ambassador to Denmark, said in the June 21, 2011, conference call. ""In 2009, Huntsman said that the Recovery Act wasn't large enough and as governor he asked for $14.4 billion in federal stimulus funds. Now he's saying that he never supported it.""

So, is Huntsman backtracking? Or is Swett off base? To sort it out, we reviewed Huntsman's comments on the stimulus over the past two years. We used statements provided by the Democratic Party and the Huntsman campaign as well as some that we found in our own research.

Together, they reveal that Huntsman was ready and willing to accept the federal money when it was made available, but that he has not retreated the way the Democrats claim.

News accounts from the Salt Lake Tribune show that he requested more than $14 billion worth of stimulus funds for state projects, and he predicted the money would help create more than 124,000 jobs over the next five years, according to the Deseret Morning News.

By October 1, 2009, six weeks after Huntsman left office, Utah had been awarded $1.5 billion in stimulus funds, and state officials had formally accepted $624 million during that time, according to the federal Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which tracks stimulus spending.

But, even as he accepted the money, Huntsman expressed concerns over the $787 billion  Recovery Act, including questions about the size of the bill (too small) and the amount of tax cuts (too few).

Let’s go to the transcripts.

Jan. 19, 2009, Huntsman to Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, supporting the stimulus for state projects:

""Well, if stimulus money is going to be invested in the U.S. economy, why don't those dollars follow projects that are ready to go?

""Our state has more shovel-ready projects than any state in America right now. And you’ve got to remember, we're now the fastest growing state in America, which surprises a lot of people. …

""We need to electrify. We need to move toward renewable opportunities. We need highways. We need everything that the rest of the country is talking about, but we need it sooner because of the way in which we're growing demographically and economically.""

Feb. 24, 2009, to Cavuto, saying he would have opposed the stimulus because it was too small:

""Well, if I were in Congress, I probably would not have voted in favor (of the Recovery Act), because it didn`t have enough stimulus and probably wasn`t big enough to begin with.

""But it is where it is. And I`m not going to quibble with a 1 or 2 percent of the entire package. We are trying to make our states run. We are going to take receipt of it. And we are going to try to actually focus some of the unallocated money on our own stimulus ideas in our states that might create some of the industries of tomorrow.""

 Feb. 24, 2009, to Politico.com’s Alexander Burns, questioning the lack of tax cuts:

""I guess in hindsight we can all say that there were some fundamental flaws with (the bill). It probably wasn’t large enough and, number two, there probably wasn’t enough stimulus effect. For example, a payroll tax exemption or maybe even a cut in the corporate tax … for small and medium-sized businesses for three years, for example.

""I’m not sure it’s the stimulus money that will necessarily allow the economy to recover … It will help to fortify our budgets, frankly, to ensure that there isn’t as much backsliding in the areas of education and healthcare, for example. But economic recovery must be earned. And it will be earned by entrepreneurs and it will be earned by small businesses.

""The size of about a trillion dollars was floated by Mark Zandi, who’s a very respected economist. I tend to believe what he is saying about the size of the package, which didn’t necessarily hit the mark in terms of size.""

April 27, 2009, to 2009 Milken Institute Global Conference, calling the stimulus flawed but helpful:

The stimulus has helped by ""building our core capacity to attract brain power, and to build our industries of tomorrow around innovation. Even when times are bad, we've invested in engineering and our science and technology undertaking, and are reaching out to name brand universities around the country and try to steal talent, to put it very crassly.  So building these core areas of innovation, which we're not throttling back on at all, and some of the stimulus dollars have, in fact, allowed us to kind of move forward.

""(There’s) too little focus on meaningful and relevant infrastructure that would have enhanced our entire nation and our ability to compete, whether delivering products or getting people from point A to point B. In other words, the overall enhancement of needed infrastructure in our country, which is desperately needed, so maybe you have 25 percent infrastructure, 75 percent all other categories. It should have been reversed in my mind, so that coming out of the stimulus phase, we actually could have maybe achieved a better, stronger, more 21st century infrastructure in our country. So that is my one gripe. There wasn't vision and direction in terms of where those dollars went.

""Stimulus, to be sure, that was needed. We needed to sort of kick start the economy and infuse it with some liquidity. It was the targeted end points that I would sort of question, and whether or not that was done in a way that, longer term, will be meaningful for our citizens.""

May 19, 2011, to ABC’s George Stephanopolous, reflecting on his past criticisms of stimulus:

""My take was, let's stimulate business. Let's look at tax cuts, let's look at payroll tax deductions. If you read on in the (2009) interview, that's exactly what I said. But more than that, George, a specific focus as opposed to just giving dollars to states. And let's face it, every governor took it.

""Mark Sanford in South Carolina was the only one who stood up and said, ‘I'm not going to take it,’ and in the end, he ended up taking it too. We as governors, our states, we all make contributions to Washington. And when stimulus dollars are coming back, you ultimately found that every governor took those dollars.

""(There’s) a regret that it was not properly focused around that, which would really stimulate the economy, tax cuts, and it was not focused around enhancing our infrastructure, and preparing ourselves for the future.""

 Our ruling

Huntsman's comments on the stimulus have been all over the map. He said from the start he would have voted against it -- because it wasn't big enough -- and then he's offered different explanations that have emphasized the need for more infrastructure spending or more tax cuts.

Swett was right in saying that Huntsman requested $14 billion in stimulus funds, and that he offered his support for a figure even larger -- $1 trillion.

But Swett's account is too one-sided. The record shows Huntsman has continued to raise questions about the stimulus all along, even as he accepted the money.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'New Jersey Democratic State Committee']","
New Jersey Democrats say Gov. Chris Christie owes the state money for “extra Gorgonzola cheese.”
","
If New Jersey voters thought Gov. Chris Christie’s helicopter rides to his son’s baseball games were inappropriate, Democrats have another example of personal spending on the public dime -- Gorgonzola cheese.

Two days after Christie took a helicopter for the second time to one of his son’s baseball games, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee issued a press release calling on the Republican governor to disclose information about previous taxpayer-funded travel for Christie and his staff.

""Previous public records requests have yielded a significant number of blacked out pages with redactions,"" according to the June 2 press release. ""However, these documents do show that the Governor continues to owe thousands of dollars to the state for his travel, as well as for amenities like extra Gorgonzola cheese for his staff on these trips.""

The press release concluded with a link to dozens of documents provided to the Democrats by the governor’s office, showing travel expenses between February and October 2010.

PolitiFact New Jersey started scanning those documents for the suspect cheese and found copies of receipts for it. For two trips in July 2010, Daniel Robles, an aide to the governor, sought reimbursements for a total of two roast beef sandwiches with Gorgonzola cheese.

What did each topping of Gorgonzola cheese cost New Jersey taxpayers? Ninety-nine cents.

Jason Springer, communications director for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee and the author of the press release, acknowledged that Democrats erred in claiming Christie should reimburse the state for Gorgonzola cheese. That reference was meant to illustrate the type of information being disclosed, compared to the redactions, he said.

""I’m apologizing as well. It was my responsibility for the inaccuracy,"" Springer told us.

State regulations show that Robles could be reimbursed for the roast beef sandwiches.

For the two days when Robles bought the sandwiches, he sought reimbursements for $28.54 and $7.57 in meal expenses, respectively. Robles could have sought reimbursement for up to $71 per day for meals and incidental expenses on those trips, according to data on the U.S. General Services Administration’s website.

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said staff members traveling with the governor are subject to the same per-diem limits as other state employees, and expenses are scrutinized.

""Are you under the impression that staff traveling with the governor can go to swank restaurants and charge drinks and fine dining to the state?"" Drewniak wrote in an email. ""They cannot and they do not.""

Now, let’s take a quick look at the Democrats’ overall claim that Christie ""continues to owe thousands of dollars to the state for his travel.""

According to Springer, that claim is based on research done by Courier Post columnist Jeremy Rosen. In an April 28 column, Rosen wrote that public records show Christie's administration still owed the state about $2,488 for personal expenses on trips last fall.

But here’s the problem: the Democrats’ press release didn’t mention Rosen, leaving readers with the impression that the Democrats’ own public records show Christie owes money. Springer said those records were provided in the press release to illustrate the redactions made by the governor’s office.

In a Nov. 23 letter to the Democratic State Committee -- included in the documents linked to in the press release -- Raymond Brandes, assistant counsel to the governor, wrote, ""certain records have been withheld or redacted on the basis of the executive privilege and the security risk exception to (the Open Public Records Act).""

Most of the expenses outlined in the documents included in the Democrats’ press release show business-related items. According to those documents, the governor and first lady submitted two checks to the state totaling about $1,800. About $125 still had to be repaid to the state, according to those documents.

Let’s review:

The New Jersey Democratic State Committee said in a press release that Christie owed the state money for ""extra Gorgonzola cheese for his staff on these trips."" A Democratic spokesman told us that statement was inaccurate, and state regulations support reimbursement for those meals.

The Democrats’ claim that Christie owes money is based on a newspaper column, but that’s not cited in the press release. The Democrats’ own records prove that information has been withheld by the governor’s office, but don’t show that Christie owes much money.

PolitiFact New Jersey enjoys a roast beef sandwich just as much as the next person, but to claim that the governor should fork over dough for Gorgonzola cheese is just wrong. We rate this statement False.

"['Corporations', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Mark Warner']","
Mark Warner says corporate taxes as share of U.S. revenue have fallen by half in 30 years
","
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has spent months trying to fashion a bipartisan plan to slash the federal debt through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases.

In a June 27 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Warner seemed confident that the two parties would reach an expedient budget deal that will increase the national debt limit before an Aug. 2 deadline when the U.S. faces possible default on it loans.

But Warner questioned the will of Congress and business to repair long-term structural problems in the federal budget that have caused debt to soar. ""I get discouraged when I hear some of my friends say we need to ease the tax burden on business,"" he said, stating that corporate income taxes make up a much smaller percentage of total U.S. revenue than they did a generation ago.

""If you look at our tax mix, the share of corporate revenues as a percentage of our overall revenue mix has declined by about half over the last 30 years,"" Warner said.

We reported in Junethat the U.S. tax rate on corporate profits, at 35 percent, is the highest among industrialized democracies. The effective corporate tax rate, a calculation of the average rate businesses actually pay after deductions, is 27.6 percent and ranks fourth highest among international economies.

Warner’s comments raised a new question on the topic: Did the corporate contribution to U.S. revenues really shrink by 50 percent?

Kevin Hall, Warner’s spokesman, said the senator compared Congressional Budget Office figures from 2009 to those in 1979. In 2009, corporate payments made up 6.6 percent of total government revenue, down from 14.2 percent in 1979. So that is a reduction of more than half the earlier share.

Both years were times of economic gloom. The earlier year saw an oil crisis and gasoline shortages in the wake of the Iranian revolution. In July, President Jimmy Carter called on the nation to reduce oil imports and energy use during his ""crisis of confidence"" speech.

And in 2009, the recession-wracked nation was combating its worst economy in 75 years. The Dow Jones Industrial average bottom out at 6,626 points, about 47 percent beneath its current level.  The unemployment rate hit 10.1 percent in October.

By choosing 2009 as a year of comparison, Warner is cherrypicking his statistics. Businesses struggled that year, and the 6.6 percent share of federal revenues paid by corporations was the lowest mark in 26 years.

Had Warner used 2010 as the end date of a 30-year comparison, he would have come up with less sensational numbers. In 1980, when the top corporate rate was 46 percent, income from those payments made up 12.5 percent of all revenue, compared with 8.9 percent in 2010.

In fiscal 2011, which ends in September 30, corporate payments are expected to make up 9.1 percent of revenue, compared with 10.2 percent in 1981.

What about the three fiscal years before 2009? How did corporate taxes compare to the figure from 30 years earlier?

*2008: 12.1 percent, compared with 15.0 percent in 1978

*2007: 14.4 percent, compared with 15.4 percent in 1977.

*2006: 14.7 percent, compared with 13.1 percent in 1976.

So in the three years before 2009, the share of corporate tax revenue was barely changed from the levels of 30 years ago. The gap in 2010 shrunk substantially from the gap in 2009, and this year’s gap is projected to be even smaller.

But if you go further back, from 2001 through 2003 the corporate revenue was half of that 30 years before. In 2004, payments were about 33 percent lower then 1974, and in 2005 the decrease was about 13 percent.

In the decade stretching from 2001 through 2010, corporate taxes averaged 10.3 percent of total federal revenue. During the stretch from 1971 to 1980, those taxes averaged 14.2 percent of revenue. So the decline from 30 years ago is really more like one-fourth, not the one-half cited by Warner.

Let’s review.

Mark Warner says corporate taxes, as a share of total government revenue, have fallen by half in 30 years. He has focused on 2009, which creates the biggest gap, but Warner’s statement holds true for three other years in the last decade compared with 30 years earlier.

But for the majority of years in the last decade, Warner’s statement does not hold up. The decline over the last 30 years -- comparing averages from the 1970s to those of the last decade -- is 27.7 percent.

Warner is right about the overall trend of corporate taxes providing a smaller share of government funding. But by focusing on 2009, he exaggerates the decline.

We rate his statement Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280966746C0>],/factchecks/2011/jul/02/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-corporate-taxes-share-us-revenue-/
"['Jobs', 'Florida', 'Rod Smith']","
Top state Democrat claims job losses, not gains taint Gov. Rick Scott's first year
 ","
Florida Democrats are countering Gov. Rick Scott's claims about creating jobs, by saying the first-term governor is in fact killing them.

Since at least April, the Florida Democratic Party has repeated in news releases, in e-mail to supporters, on their website and with social media a particularly appealing fact: Scott has destroyed 100,000 jobs. Here's one example from a mass e-mail June 28, 2011, from the chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, Rod Smith:

""Rick Scott has destroyed over 100,000 jobs, gutted the education budget, and remains completely out-of-touch with Floridians.""

We wondered, what's behind that 100,000?

Back in April, Democrats launched a website, www.WhereIsMyFloridaJob.com, to ""hold Rick Scott accountable."" But when we tried to visit it in June, it showed a single sentence: ""Site maintenance in progress.""

So we asked Eric Jotkoff, spokesman for the Florida Democrats, to explain how they are getting their numbers.

He explained it was a ""pretty conservative estimate"" based on expected teacher layoffs, cuts to local police, firefighters and other public employees, cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates, cuts to university spending, the planned privatization of South Florida prisons, the rejection of federal funding for high-speed rail, the shift of funding from a transportation trust fund expected to affect construction projects, a change in how water districts are funded, and Scott's refusal to meet with a biotech company (Jackson Labs) that ultimately didn't locate a new project in the state. Jotkoff also left the door open for other job-killers he wasn't thinking of just then. (At the time we asked, he also included possible death of SunRail — which a few days later the governor actually allowed to move forward.)

To recap: budget cuts, prison privatization, high-speed rail, Jackson Labs.

Rather than a spreadsheet, Democrats say they kept an informal tally that shifts as time passes. In April, the 100,000 was based on the governor's proposed budget. Now that the legislative session has passed, it's based on the state budget as signed by the governor, with a few other actions for good measure.

In any case, it's always been close enough to round up to 100,000, Jotkoff said.

(We did throw his estimates into a spreadsheet, and with SunRail they came close, to around 96,000 jobs. Several items had wiggle-room that could have pushed the number above 100,000.)

But no matter what the estimates say on any given day, the Democrats' claim has several problems:

• ""Has destroyed"" makes it sound like jobs are already gone — but the analysis is almost entirely based on jobs that are expected to be lost.

• ""Has destroyed"" also makes it sound like Scott's policies have eliminated 100,000 jobs that already existed. But that's only the case for some of the jobs included in Jotkoff's tally, such as cuts leading to layoffs of state and local employees. Others, from high-speed rail to highway construction to biotech jobs, didn't yet exist — and may never have materialized.

• In the same way it's troublesome for Scott to take credit for job creation, it's also problematic for Democrats to singularly blame Scott for job losses. The Legislature debated and passed the budgets that reduce funding for local districts, and signed off on a reduction to the state workforce. Ultimately, they share some responsibility for those jobs losses as well.

There's one more significant problem with basing this claim on expected changes: Nobody knows how many jobs may actually be shed, much less the Democrats. In at least half the categories Jotkoff gave us, the estimates were ""thousands"" or ""tens of thousands."" In some cases (transportation trust fund, Medicaid spending) projections were based on estimates by industry and interest groups. In others (Jackson Labs) the promises of new jobs were so ethereal, local governments weren't even certain they would come to be — yet Jotkoff blamed Scott for the loss of the maximum number of jobs the company thought it might create over 20 years, about 3,000.

Jotkoff told us he was pressed for time to make his case -- though we gave him several days to respond to our questions. Here at PolitiFact Florida, we dare to dream that if you routinely repeat a number for months, you've got the goods to prove it.

It's entirely possible that when the dust settles, Scott — who advocates cutting government jobs to encourage job-creation in the private sector — will have hurt employment in the state by 100,000. But this evidence doesn't prove that. And that's not even what Democrats charged — they said he has already destroyed 100,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the best evidence we do have, survey estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, show the state has actually added 76,800 net jobs since January.

We know that the budget passed by the Legislature and signed by Scott contains real pain for Florida families, in particular teachers and state workers. But Democrats should focus on claims they can prove, and this isn't one of them. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3A3600>],/factchecks/2011/jul/01/rod-smith/top-state-democrat-claims-job-losses-not-gains-tai/

Gov. Rick Scott claims Florida led country in job growth in May
","
With nearly a million Floridians struggling without jobs in the wake of the Great Recession, Gov. Rick ""Let's get to work!"" Scott has the right message.

And May's job numbers gave him a new talking point. 
On June 23, 2011, as news media gathered at the state Capitol for his signing of a tort reform bill, he repeated it: ""In May we generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined: 28,000 jobs in May for the state, 54,000 for the entire country."" 
The unemployment rate in May dipped to 10.6 percent, a near two-year low after five straight months of improvement. Brag-worthy, right?

But we were curious: Just how good was May for job creation in Florida?

We checked with Scott's office and the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks employment across the country. According to a standard measure of employment in April and May, Scott nailed the numbers -- Florida gained 28,000 jobs. (Ohio was second, gaining 12,000 jobs.)

That standard look comes from a monthly survey of businesses to ask how many jobs they have. (It's different from the survey that informs the unemployment rate, which is a survey of households.) The business survey helps economists estimate a total number of jobs — in a county, in a metro area, in a state, in the nation. Those numbers can be sliced and diced any number of ways, but Scott picked a useful, mainstream measure: ""total nonfarm employment"" that had been ""seasonally adjusted.""

Farms are commonly excluded because that workforce swings so dramatically (you don't need many farm workers if there's no harvest this week). And it's helpful to look at estimates that have been ""seasonally adjusted"" because formulas make up for differences between months such as the number of weeks, holidays and seasonal employment patterns.

Feeling pretty good about Scott's grasp of the situation, we chatted with a few economists. And that's where it got weird.

It turns out that while seasonal adjustment is typically a useful tool to make meaningful comparisons over time — allowing you to compare jobs progress during, say, a long, holiday-heavy December with a short February — there are some pretty good reasons it wasn't so helpful in May.

Seasonal adjustment formulas are constantly updated based on recent years, to take into account ""normal"" over-the-month change. David Denslow, a research economist at the University of Florida, pointed out that when you have enormous changes, as with the recent housing boom and bust (remember that?) and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, seasonal adjustment ""becomes extraordinarily difficult."" 
So, what did the unadjusted survey numbers show? 
According to estimates that weren't adjusted for the season, Florida didn't gain 28,000 new jobs from April to May — it actually lost 3,000 jobs. Across the country, the United States added 682,000 jobs when not adjusted for the season (compared to 54,000 jobs when adjusted).  
A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist said the bureau attempted to minimize the affect ""recent events"" might have had on the seasonal adjustment calculation by putting more weight on earlier years than the more recent, irregular years. 
""In essence the irregular years do still have some influence on the seasonal adjustment factors for this year, however, by putting more weight on its history, the influence will be diminished,"" said Jonathan Hamburg, an economist who works with state and local statistics. 
We're so used to seasonally adjusted numbers as the gold standard for comparing one month to another, we ran Denslow's concern by another economist who regularly chats with PolitiFact, Gary Burtless with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.

""One resolution of the problem,"" he said, ""is simply to mention both sets of statistics to your readers and leave it for them to decide whether it is fair to say Florida 'generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined' in a month when the best BLS estimate suggests the actual number of Florida jobs declined while the actual number of jobs in the nation as a whole increased.""

But he acknowledged we may all consider that a copout.

So he pressed on to explain that with seasonal adjustment being the difference between job gains and losses, even a small error in the Bureau of Labor Statistics formula could make the governor’s claim ""wildly off base.""

""It may be true, and perhaps revisions in the raw data or the seasonal adjustment factor may someday increase the probability that it is true,"" he said. ""But based on the evidence at hand, I would say the governor has made a very silly claim.""

Where does this leave us? Scott accurately repeated an official statistic. But there's also a strong argument that the wild economic ride of recent years has made it challenging to accurately account for seasonal changes. Two economists we talked to say this undermines the credibility of Scott's claim — though we should note two others didn't mention the issue. But in light of a common federal statistic that shows the state may have actually lost jobs in May, the governor should have been more measured in his public trumpeting. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772B6C0>],/factchecks/2011/jul/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-claims-florida-led-country-job-grow/

Gov. Rick Scott touts better job numbers as sign of success
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who campaigned on a promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years, routinely touts the state's progress.

A classic Scott-ism: ""This is a contest to make our state the No. 1 place to do business, and that's what I'm going to do."" 
So on June 17, 2011, the day Florida released its jobs numbers for May, Scott released this statement:

""Florida is leading the nation in job creation and our unemployment rate has dropped for the fifth straight month, a huge win for Floridians. It is unfortunate the federal government can’t say the same thing for the rest of the country.

""Our efforts to make Florida the most business friendly state are clearly paying off and we are bucking the national trend.

""Since I took office, we’ve created 76,800 jobs for parents, recent graduates, workforce veterans and all Floridians who have been struggling to get back on their feet.

 ""Texas is still leading the country in job growth this year, but Florida is trailing right behind at number two. We are gunning to be the number one state for job growth and I will not rest until Florida surpasses Texas for the top spot."" 
Whether Florida led the nation in job creation in May is the subject of a separate fact-check. Here, we'll take a look at another of Scott's claims, that since he took office Jan. 4, ""we've created 76,800 jobs."" (Scott repeated the claim on July 1 during a speech to the Florida Society of News Editors.) 
We checked in with Scott's press secretary, Lane Wright, and Florida's Agency for Workforce Innovation, which among other things prepares labor statistics for the state. The 76,800 job figure quickly checked out. Scott used a mainstream estimate from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics: ""total nonfarm employment"" that had been ""seasonally adjusted.""

Farms are commonly excluded because that workforce swings so dramatically. And it's helpful to look at estimates that have been ""seasonally adjusted"" because formulas make up for differences between months such as the number of weeks, holidays and seasonal employment patterns. Now, in our fact-check of the May numbers, we point out that some economists caution about relying too heavily on seasonally adjusted numbers right now. The jobs world has been so turbulent, it's very difficult to adjust for ""normal"" seasonal swings. So they also take a look at estimates that haven't been seasonally adjusted — the ones based directly on a survey of about 140,000 U.S. employers each month.

Remember that these estimates don't account for things like number of weeks or holidays in a particular month — or seasonal shifts such Florida's tourist season — and so aren't considered a good way to compare change between months or over time.

But in pursuit of a fuller picture, we checked the non-seasonally adjusted numbers, as well, and found they work in Scott's favor: Instead of showing 76,800 more jobs than when he took office in January, it showed 119,700 more jobs.

So not only does Scott accurately cite federal statistics, looking at the numbers a second way still supports his underlying message -- Florida is creating jobs.

But we're not done. At PolitiFact, we look at statistical claims like this one in two parts:

1.) Have jobs increased by 76,800 under Gov. Rick Scott? (By one official measure, they have.)

2.) Is Scott responsible?

As University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith put it, ""The numbers are easily verifiable. ... What I guess is implied is who's responsible for the creation of those jobs.""

Scott also invited this question when he added, ""Our efforts to make Florida the most business friendly state are clearly paying off.""

We wondered: Already?

As you might have guessed, this is where things get trickier. (And there's some fun journalism out there about whether politicians can really take credit.)

First, Scott has only just started to implement his agenda. Should he get credit for jobs in January? In February? A small decrease to the corporate income tax passed this legislative session, for example — less than 1/10th of what Scott sought — but has yet to add any money to employers' bottom line.

Second, it's too soon to identify a trend.

""It is far too early to tell whether Gov. Scott's policies are having any effect on jobs in Florida,"" said David Denslow, an economist at University of Florida.

He pointed out that recent history shows huge swoops in job creation — way, way up since 1990, with some leveling off in the early 2000s, then another climb, then the familiar sickening dive marking the Great Recession. The few jobs added since January 2011 barely register as a change on that roller coaster ride. So it's impossible to see yet whether there's a positive trend since then, he said.

Third, Florida was projected to start adding jobs no matter who took office. In the 2011-12 fiscal year, for example, state economists have estimated we'll add 130,500 jobs, then 175,000 the year after, with diminishing but hefty additions as years pass. (In other words, if the governor who campaigned on a promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years takes credit for every job created, he'll meet the goal easily. But if they would have happened without him, can you give him credit for creating them? We'll weigh this issue as we decide how to measure his promise on our Scott-O-Meter.)

""There's one thing you can't criticize about Gov. Scott, and that's his sense of timing,"" Snaith said. ""He's coming into office at the perfect time on a platform of job creation. You couldn't time it better.""

Now, Scott does get some credit from economists for marketing the state for business, something he's done ever since he was elected in November 2010. Snaith of the University of Central Florida and Mark Vitner, an economist with Wells Fargo, noted that he's worked to get the word out that his policies will be pro-business. And taking a hard line on the state budget showed he'll act on his platform, Vitner said.

""He's pretty much stuck to his word since he's been in office,"" Vitner said. ""I think that gives businesses some confidence that they've got a partner.""

So where does that leave us? Scott got the number right, sticking to mainstream federal statistics. But he jumped the gun and overreached in claiming credit for those jobs. That's a pretty important clarification, and knocks him down a peg. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809770AD00>],/factchecks/2011/jul/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-touts-better-job-numbers-sign-succe/

Rep. Michele Bachmann says she's never received a penny from family farm that got federal crop subsidies
","
In an interview on Fox News on June 26, 2011, host Chris Wallace asked Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann about a story that appeared in the Los Angeles Times the day before that accused her of being hypocritical in her opposition to farm subsidies because her late father-in-law's farm, in which she and her husband own a partnership stake, has received nearly $260,000 worth of crop subsidies.

""Regarding the farm,"" Bachmann said. ""The farm is my father-in-law’s farm. It’s not my husband’s and my farm. It’s my father-in-law’s farm and my husband and I have never gotten a penny of money from the farm.""

The farm in question sits on 949 acres in Independence, Wis., and was operated by Bachmann's father-in-law, Paul Bachmann. The congresswoman told The Associated Press that her husband became a trustee of the farm because his father had dementia before he died in May 2009, and that her husband ""oversees the legal entity.""

However, records show the Bachmann Farm Family Limited Partnership was formed in 2001, and Rep. Bachmann and her husband have a stake in it. All of Rep. Bachmann's financial disclosure forms, filed with the Clerk of the House, list the Bachmann Farm Family LP as an asset of hers worth between $100,000 and $250,000.

Paul Bachmann received nearly $260,000 in farm subsidies between 1995 and 2007, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data compiled by the Environmental Working Group. The lion's share, about $250,000 of it, was corn and dairy program subsidies. There are no records of any crop subsidies after 2007.

In December, 2010, Bachmann told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that any subsidies going to the farm were for her in-laws. ""I'm very proud of them,"" she said. ""They came to the United States essentially to get away from socialism in Europe.""

Despite hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies applied for, and awarded to, her father-in-law, Bachmann has consistently positioned herself against them. In 2008, for example, she voted against a $290 billion, five-year farm bill (which passed despite the veto of President George W. Bush).

""It exemplifies the very worst of Washington's ways,"" Bachmann said in a May 23, 2008, Gannett News Service story. ""It is loaded with unbelievably outrageous pork and subsidies for agricultural business and ethanol growers.""

""Americans are being squeezed by taxes and rising living costs, and Congress wants them to pick up the tab for pet earmarks and wealthy landowners,"" she said.

As she did in her Fox News interview on June 26, 2011, Bachmann told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune last December that she has never received ""one penny"" from her in-laws' family farm in Independence, Wis.

But her congressional financial disclosure forms say she has.

According to her 2009 financial disclosure form, the Bachmann Farm Family LP brought her income between $15,001 and $50,000. The form even has ""farm income"" written in to describe the type of income. The 2008 form shows the same thing, farm income between $15,001 and $50,000. The 2007 also lists farm income, but the online copy does not make clear which income range Bachmann checked that year. The 2006 form lists farm income between $2,501 and $5,000.

In other words, at a minimum Bachmann has received somewhere between $32,503 and $105,000 in farm income between 2006 and 2009, according to her disclosure forms. That's a lot of pennies.

We got no response to queries sent to the Bachmann campaign. But Matt Lewis of the Daily Caller reported on May 15, 2011, ""Bachmann’s team tells me the family farm was put in a trust in order to provide for succession, which means that while the financial disclosure paperwork shows her as benefiting by virtue of her role as trustee, she has not received any of the money and is not involved in any operational decisions.""

But that doesn't add up, according to several campaign finance experts we spoke to.

""I don’t know of any other possible explanation for her financial disclosure reports (other than that she received income from the farm partnership),"" said Brett Kappel, a lawyer with the firm Arent Fox LLP who specializes in campaign finance law. ""If she was just a trustee and received no income she would have to report her position as a trustee, but wouldn’t have had to report any income from the farm.""

Said Jock Friedly, whose website Legistorm tracks data on congressional salaries: ""There does appear to be a conflict between her claims to the AP, to Fox News and on the financial disclosures. In particular, if her husband 'oversees the legal entity' but she and her husband and dependents have no personal stake, they need not report it as far as I can see from reading the House ethics manual. As a practical matter, I have seen some people report on the financial disclosures that they oversee assets but point out that they are not their own and that they have no personal stake in them. Most people will report it in the 'Agreements' or 'Positions' section of their disclosure instead of under assets, since that’s where it really belongs if you are entrusted with managing someone else’s money.""

Friedly said it's possible that she technically didn't get a penny because the profits may have been treated as retained earnings and invested in things such as new tractors.

""But the key point here is that while she may not have received a distribution yet, that’s because in theory the entire enterprise is more valuable, with more money in the bank account or in farm equipment. She will get it later on. So from her perspective, she hasn’t gotten one penny. And even worse than that from her perspective, she’s stuck with the tax bill of having to report it on her 1040 Schedule K as a partnership distribution.  And while it may seem unfair to get taxed and not get benefit, presumably over time that money will actually come into her bank account and she won’t have to report the distributions.""

In short, something's not right here. Either Bachmann reported something that didn't need to be disclosed or she got money from the farm at the same time it was benefiting from crop subsidies. Perhaps, as Friedly said, Bachmann won't see her first penny until she draws down the assets of the limited partnership. 
If that's the case, and it's a matter of delayed earnings, we still think it would be misleading for Bachmman to claim she hasn't made any money from the farm. Unless or until Bachmann steps forward to explain the discrepancy between her financial disclosure statements and her public pronouncements, we have to rely on the disclosures, which say she received at least $32,501 in income. So we rate her claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C460280>],/factchecks/2011/jul/01/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-says-shes-never-received-penn/
