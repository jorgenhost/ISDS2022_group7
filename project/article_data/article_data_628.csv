Police union criticizes new bail law
","Changes in New York’s bail laws have been hailed by some nonprofit criminal justice organizations as a way to reduce inequities and mass incarceration. The changes will allow people who have been charged with certain crimes to stay out of jail while waiting for their trials without having to come up with money to post bail. But some in law enforcement are critical of the changes, which eliminate money bail for offenses that account for approximately 90 percent of arrests statewide.  The union that represents active and retired police officers in New York City made a claim about the new law, which takes effect Jan. 1. In a Twitter post, the New York City Police Benevolent Association said, ""Defendants charged with producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child will be arraigned & set free.""  #NoBailNYOn Jan 1st,when the new bail reform law takes effect,defendants charged with producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child will be arraigned & set free.Our elected leaders are putting kids in harm’s way by making child porn a bail-free crime pic.twitter.com/XsKCekEZLl As evidence for its claim, the police union included in its tweet a section of state law regarding child pornography. The union cited section 263.10 of the penal code, which states: ""A person is  guilty of promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child when, knowing the character and  content thereof, he produces, directs or promotes any obscene performance which includes sexual conduct by a child less than seventeen years of age. Promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child is a class D felony."" We’ve heard many claims about what the new law will do, and we wondered if the police union’s claim is accurate.  The new law has a list of ""qualifying"" offenses for which a judge can set bail. These qualifying offenses are serious crimes, and some involve child pornography. Judges are permitted to impose bail under the new law for these offenses: facilitating a sexual performance by a child with a controlled substance or alcohol, use of a child in a sexual performance, or luring a child for the purpose of committing a crime against him or her. On April 1, 2019, when the new law was passed, three people with these qualifying offenses were in jail awaiting trial in New York City, according to a report from the Center for Court Innovation, which advocates for alternatives to incarceration.   But not every child pornography charge described in the statute is a qualifying offense.  A person charged with the offense cited by the union -- ""producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child"" -- would have to be released and bail would not be imposed. New York’s pretrial law - the current one and the one that takes effect Jan. 1 - does not allow judges to evaluate whether a person is dangerous to the community when deciding whether that person should be held before trial. Unlike in other states, judges can only consider whether a  defendant is likely to return to court. In cases where a judge has doubts about whether the defendant is likely to return, the judge would have to ""release the principal"" and select a non-monetary option, such as pretrial supervision or travel restrictions, and choose the least restrictive option ""that will reasonably assure the principal’s return to court,"" according to the law.       We spoke with legal experts, some who specialize in prosecution and others in criminal defense. Many agreed with the police union's tweet.   But several pointed to what they call a more realistic legal scenario. Taryn Merkl, a former federal prosecutor who led a human trafficking task force in Brooklyn, said that it is hard for her to imagine a set of facts in which a prosecutor would charge only this crime and not something more serious that would require bail.  ""This doesn’t strike me as the main charge one would bring,"" said Merkl, who is senior counsel in the Justice Program & Law Enforcement Leaders at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. The Brennan Center is in favor of ending mass incarceration.  We looked at arrest records from New York City since 2006 to get a sense of how often police charge this specific crime. We found that in at least 135 arrests, approximately 10 per year, this charge was the top charge. Merkl noted that that the charges that prosecutors decide to bring in a complaint or indictment can be different from those charges that a police file during an arrest. In addition, charges other than the ""top charge"" for these defendants could require detention, even if the top charge does not, according to the Center for Court Innovation.  Rebecca Town, a criminal defense attorney at the Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, which assists low-income people, said the charge cited by the police union is ""almost always"" accompanied by a sex offense under Article 130 of the state penal code, which allows a judge to set cash bail. ""If the individual accused is directly responsible for creating such material, they will be charged with something that is directly a sex offense that would still trigger money bail,"" Town said.   The New York City Police Benevolent Association tweeted that under the state’s new bail reform law, ""defendants charged with producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child will be arraigned & set free."" Defendants facing this charge will be released as they await trial. We know from New York City arrest data that there are cases where this is the top charge at the time of arrest. In cases where the judge deems a defendant to be a flight risk, some pretrial supervision outside of a jail can be imposed. If a defendant is charged with this and certain other, more serious child pornography charges, bail may be imposed.   We rate this claim Mostly True. ","[('Twitter, @NYCPBA, Dec. 2, 2019.\xa0', 'https://twitter.com/NYCPBA/status/1201534882054324226?s=20'), ('Email conversation, Jason Conwall, Gov.

Twitter bots spread white supremacist’s bogus story about Virginia’s proposed assault weapons ban
","Ahead of a potential vote on an assault weapons ban in Virginia, some Facebook users are posting misinformation about the legislation. The source of the false information is a white supremacist with a rap sheet and a history of spreading conspiracy theories. One post published Dec. 16 includes a screenshot of a tweet from user @cindyseestruth, which appears to be an automated account. The tweet claimed Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, is planning drastic measures to take away guns. ""WARNING… VIRGINIA GOV RALPH NORTHAM SET TO.. Cut off electric… telephones… faxes… cellular phones & cellular data, Internet, so #Virginia residents cannot reveal what is happening once gun confiscation begins to take place,"" the tweet reads. The Facebook post, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times, was flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) There’s no evidence for this disconnected conspiracy. While a variety of gun control legislation has been introduced in Virginia, one bill is particularly relevant to the Facebook post and tweet: Virginia Senate Bill 16. The measure, which was introduced in late November, would ban the possession, transport and sale of assault weapons. The bill includes six definitions for ""assault weapons,"" which include anything from a semi-automatic rifle to a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. Democrats will take control of both the Senate and the House of Delegates in January, which helps the chances for passage. But there’s no evidence that Northam would cut off the state’s electricity to enforce the legislation or suppress news about enforcement. SB 16, which would make the possession of an assault weapon a felony, does not spell out how it would deal with firearms that Virginians already own. Northam has said he would call on law enforcement to enforce the bill, and he’s pushed back on resolutions that deem certain cities ""Second Amendment sanctuaries.""  ""We're not going to take people's guns away,"" he told reporters Dec. 11. RELATED: All statements involving Guns In its tweet, which got more than 2,000 retweets, @cindyseestruth linked to a story published Dec. 13 by the Hal Turner Radio Show. Other Twitter bots have also amplified the article, according to Hoaxy, a tool that tracks automated accounts. Hal Turner is a white supremacist who uses internet and radio broadcasts to float conspiracy theories and hate speech. In 2010, he was sentenced to 33 months in prison for threatening three federal judges over their decision to uphold handgun bans in Chicago. The story contains the tweet’s claim about shutting down cellular infrastructure almost verbatim. In an email, Alena Yarmosky, Northam’s press secretary, said that it is ""absolutely false."" ""People who spread lies like this should be ashamed of themselves,"" she said. We reached out to Turner for more evidence to support his site’s claim, but we haven’t heard back.

Bernie Sanders is wrong — twice — in claim about defense budget voting record
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders isn’t a big fan of President Donald Trump’s latest defense spending bill. Tuesday morning, the U.S. Senate voted 86-8 in favor of the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2020, sending it to the president for his signature.  The day before senators passed the legislation, Sanders published an op-ed in the Washington Post panning the proposal, writing he opposes the bill as he as ""all previous Trump military budgets."" Hours after the Tuesday vote, the Vermont senator and Democratic candidate for president doubled down, posting a video to his campaign’s social media accounts, in which Sanders explained how cutting defense spending could pay for his proposed social programs. Sanders begins his video with a claim about his voting record on Trump’s defense spending proposals. ""I am very proud that I am the only candidate in the Democratic primary to have voted against all of Trump's defense budgets,"" Sanders says in the campaign video. But Sanders, like many other candidates who also serve in the Senate, missed this week’s vote. So how can he claim to have voted against it? And is he actually the only anti-Trump presidential candidate in the Democratic field who has voted against all of the president’s defense budgets? Sanders’ presidential campaign declined to comment on the statement, referring questions to Sanders’ Senate office. Keane Bhatt, Sanders’ Senate spokesperson, pointed to the Vermont independent’s votes against the defense budget bill for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.  Bhatt deferred back to the campaign on the first part of Sanders’ claim that he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary to vote against all of Trump’s military spending bills. The campaign did not respond with evidence to support this part of the statement.    Sanders has voted against the last three national defense authorization bills but he was not present in the Senate for Tuesday’s vote on the bill he has publicly opposed. Sanders’ Senate office also said his vote against the defense spending bill fiscal year 2017 was evidence he has voted against all of Trump’s military budget bills. However, the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017 was signed by former President Barack Obama on Dec. 23, 2016, and not by Trump. A survey of Sanders’ record on Trump’s defense spending bills has him voting against the first two but missing the vote earlier this week. The Vermont independent also missed the chance to vote on this year’s military spending bill in June when the Senate moved it to the House of Representatives. Sanders also claims he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary who has voted against all of the president’s defense budgets. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., all missed this week’s vote on the military spending bill. Warren voted against last year’s defense budget, but supported Trump’s first national defense authorization proposal. Booker and Klobuchar have supported both of Trump’s previous military budget bills. However, there is one other candidate in the crowded Democratic field who has cast votes in opposition of all three of the president’s defense authorization bills. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii — who is polling between 1% and 3% nationally and has remained in the race as others have started dropping out — was one of 48 House members to vote against the current $738 billion spending proposal. Gabbard has also cast no votes on the legislation in 2018 and 2017 — Trump’s two other military budgets.  The House member from Hawaii also voted against President Obama’s last defense spending budget in 2016. In a campaign video that has been viewed almost 320,000 times on Twitter alone, Sanders made the statement that he has voted against all of Trump’s defense budgets and that he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary to do so. It is true the Vermont senator has publicly opposed all of the president’s military spending packages, but he has not voted against all of them. Sanders is also wrong to say he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary who has voted against the proposals. In fact, Gabbard is the only candidate who can make that claim.  We rate this statement as False.","[('Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign video.

Congress put roadblocks in front of efforts to close Gitmo, as Biden said.
","Former Vice President Joe Biden is usually first to bring up the record of the Obama administration in his 2020 presidential campaign. But at the Democratic debate in Los Angeles, Biden had to defend an area where the administration failed. Obama left office without closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.  The facility remains open under President Donald Trump, housing about 40 detainees at an annual cost of about $540 million. Biden said that the Obama administration tried to close Guantanamo. But it was missing one thing. ""You have to have congressional authority to do it,"" Biden answered Dec. 19.  One way Obama wanted to close the facility was by moving detainees to U.S. facilities, which Congress blocked through legislation. Some have argued that Obama did have other options to close Guantanamo, but they were unpopular even within his own party, and it’s not at all clear they would have been successful. We’ll recap the history. On Jan. 22, 2009, Obama issued an executive order calling for Guantanamo’s closure within one year. That year was Obama’s best chance to close Gitmo since he held large majorities in the House and Senate.  But Obama angered lawmakers after he transferred a detainee to New York, announced a plan to bring the terrorists responsible for 9/11 to the United States, and planned to purchase a facility in Illinois for detainees.  Obama’s moves led Congress to repeatedly bar the use of funds to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States.  Obama officials discussed the possibility of using executive authority to close the detention camp, but ultimately ruled that out.  Obama was forced to ""choose between two politically unsavory options: Invoke executive power to relocate the remaining detainees in defiance of a statute, or allow history to say he never fulfilled his promise to shutter the prison,"" wrote New York Times reporter Charlie Savage in November 2015. Obama’s Office of Legal Counsel never bought the argument that these the congressional restrictions were unconstitutional, said Avril Haines, a legal adviser for the National Security Council during the Obama administration. (She was part of efforts to try to close Gitmo but not within the Office of Legal Counsel.)  Legal experts were divided about whether the restrictions Congress imposed were constitutional.  While some during the Obama administration argued that the congressional ban on transfers prevented Guantanamo from closing, Gregory B. Craig, White House counsel in 2009, and Cliff Sloan, special envoy for Guantanamo closure in 2013 and 2014, wrote a Washington Post op-ed in November 2015 arguing that Obama did have authority to close the facility. ""Under Article II of the Constitution, the president has exclusive authority to determine the facilities in which military detainees are held,"" they wrote. ""Obama has the authority to move forward. He should use it."" Their op-ed set off a debate among legal scholars and political experts. Obama did decide on one approach for removing Gitmo prisoners: transferring them to other countries. But he ran out of time.  During the final days of his administration, Obama announced the four final transfers to other countries bringing the total number of international transfers from Guantanamo under Obama to about 200. On Jan. 19, 2017, Obama wrote a letter to Congress stating that the restrictions ""make no sense"" given the lack of escapes at supermax and military prisons. The next day Trump was sworn into office. He has kept his promise to keep Guantanamo open.  Cully Stimson, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs during President George W. Bush’s administration, said it was the Obama White House that soured relations with Congress from the beginning. ""Instead of working behind the scenes with members of the president’s own party to forge an acceptable closure plan, the administration took unilateral action, which in turn soured its relationship with Congress,"" Stimson wrote. The Obama administration also could have been more aggressive about transferring prisoners to other countries. ""Biden ignores the fact that you can close Guantanamo without bringing them to the U.S. and violating a congressional statute,"" Stimson said. ""It’s always been an option and preferred option to send detainees to their home countries and third party countries. Any administration including this one could do that today. It’s difficult, it presents challenges, but it is possible."" Asked why the Obama administration didn’t close Guantanamo, Biden said, ""You have to have congressional authority to do it."" Congress made it hard for Obama to fulfill his promise, blocking Obama from transferring detainees to U.S. prisons. Obama was allowed to transfer detainees to other countries, and did transfer many of them. But he ran out of time at the end of his presidency, keeping the prison open with 41 detainees. Some legal experts said Obama had the legal right to close Guantanamo but lacked the political willpower. Others questioned if he truly had that power. Ultimately the Obama administration didn’t take that tack, so we’ll never know. Certainly what Congress did made the task much harder.  We rate this statement Mostly True.  ","[(""Lawfare, President Obama's NDAA Signing Statement on Guantanamo, Nov. 30, 2015"", 'https://www.lawfareblog.com/president-obamas-ndaa-signing-statement-guantanamo'), ('Politico, Obama slams Congress for blocking efforts to close Gitmo, Jan. 19, 2017', 'No link'), (""Politico, Obama's incredibly shrinking chance to close Gitmo, Feb. 22, 2016"", 'https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/obama-congress-guantanamo-bay-233859'), ('Human Rights First, NDAA Provisions Undermine President’s Ability to Close Guantanamo, May 13, 2016', 'No link'), ('New York Times, The Cost of Running Guantánamo Bay: $13 Million Per Prisoner, Sept. 16, 2019', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/obama-cuba-closing-guantanamo-219650'), (""NPR, Trump Inherits Guantanamo's Remaining Detainees, Jan. 19, 2017"", 'No link'), ('Washington Post op-ed by Gregory B Craig and Cliff Sloan, The president doesn’t need Congress’s permission to close Guantanamo, Nov. 6, 2015', 'https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/press-release/ndaa-provisions-undermine-president-s-ability-close-guantanamo'), ('LawFare, The Great Guantanamo Showdown, Nov. 9, 2015', 'No link'), ('Washington Post editorial, Obama cannot go it alone on Guantanamo, Nov. 20, 2015', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/us/politics/guantanamo-bay-cost-prison.html'), ('Just Security, [UPDATED] GTMO at the End of the Obama Administration: 31 uncharged detainees remain, Jan. 19, 2017', 'No link'), ('Georgetown University Law Center professor Marty Lederman in Just Security, The insoluble Guantánamo problem (Part Three: Executive disregard of the GTMO-to-U.S. relocation prohibition is not a solution) Nov. 13, 2015', 'https://www.npr.org/2017/01/19/510448989/trump-inherits-guantanamos-remaining-detainees'), ('New York Times, Guantánamo Is Leaving Obama With Choices, Neither of Them Simple, Nov. 1, 2015', 'No link'), ('Heritage Foundation’s Charles ""Cully"" Stimson, Closing Guantanamo: A Legal and Policy Analysis of the Senate Provision, Sept. 28, 2015', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-president-doesnt-need-congresss-permission-to-close-guantanamo/2015/11/06/4cc9d2ac-83f5-11e5-a7ca-6ab6ec20f839_story.html'), ('Cardozo law professor Deborah Pearlstein, Constitutionality of Congressional Restrictions on Guantanamo Prisoner Transfers, Oct. 27, 2015', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, Closing the Guantanamo Detention Center: Legal Issues, May 30, 2013', 'https://www.lawfareblog.com/great-guantanamo-showdown'), ('NBC, Will Obama Use Executive Order to Close Guantanamo Bay?

Congressman says his Silicon Valley district has higher GDP than Russia. Wrong
","Just how insignificant is Russia in the global economy? Quite insignificant, argued Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., in a Dec. 20 interview with MSNBC’s Hallie Jackson. Khanna was discussing President Donald Trump and his warm relations with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Khanna told Jackson that he was mystified why Trump would pick Putin as a global partner. ""Here is what is so shocking,"" Khanna said. ""Russia is not even a top-10 economy any more. I mean, my district in Silicon Valley has a higher GDP than Russia."" (GDP refers to gross domestic product, or the sum of all economic activity in a given jurisdiction.) Does a single California congressional district with 777,468 residents really outpace an entire nation of 144 million people?  No, and Khanna acknowledged that after PolitiFact contacted him. ""I misspoke,"" Khanna said in an email. ""What I meant to say is that two companies in my district — Apple and Google — have a higher market capitalization, $2 trillion, than Russia’s economy, and that California has a higher GDP."" Let’s look at the numbers. Russia’s GDP in 2018, according to the World Bank, was $1.66 trillion. That ranks 11th in the world, behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, India, Italy, Brazil, and Canada. As for Khanna’s congressional district, California’s 17th, we were able to find a calculation by the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. Earlier this year, the think tank calculated GDP for every congressional district in 2018 and published summary numbers in the Wall Street Journal. The article doesn’t include individual figures for every district, but Brookings researchers provided a figure for Khanna’s district: $103.9 billion.  So Russia’s GDP is about 16 times bigger than the GDP for Khanna’s district. The entire state of California, meanwhile, had a GDP just shy of $3 trillion in 2018, so California as a whole does outpace Russia in GDP. What about Khanna’s point about market capitalization?  Market capitalization is the total market value of all outstanding shares in a company. It’s a different measurement than GDP, which measures all economic activity within a locale. So the two aren’t directly comparable, but they can give a rough sense of scale. Apple’s market capitalization was $1.25 trillion on Dec. 20. Google’s was $932.3 billion. So the total for the two companies is $2.2 trillion. Khanna said the California congressional district he represents ""has a higher GDP than Russia."" That’s wrong, as Khanna acknowledged. Russia’s GDP is about 16 times larger than that of California’s 17th congressional district. When a speaker we’re checking acknowledges their error before publication, we note their comments but do not change our ruling, since many more people would have seen the interview with the incorrect information. So we rate the statement False.","[('Ro Khanna, interview on MSNBC, Dec. 20, 2019', 'https://www.msnbc.com/hallie-jackson/watch/rep-khanna-2020-election-irrelevant-to-trump-s-senate-trial-75436101814'), ('Bureau of Economic Analysis, interactive data portal for regions, accessed Dec. 20, 2019', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Democrats and Republicans Aren’t Just Divided.

A Facebook post gives wrong impression of photo of black man with bloody face and two white men
","A popular Facebook post says people should stop talking about former NFL player Michael Vick and dogfighting and instead reflect on a picture that seemingly shows violence against a black man by a smiling white man. ""I am a big animal lover, but stop bringing up Michael Vick when this is in your history!!! The man did his time and constantly gives back. But you want us to forget about this,"" said text above a photo that shows a black man with a bloody face being grabbed up by a white man who appears to be looking at the photographer and either smiling or grimacing. Another white man in a U.S. Army sweatshirt is also in the photo, standing next to the black man and looking at the camera. Vick served time in prison after pleading guilty to charges related to a dogfighting ring run in a property he owned. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The caption in the Facebook post implies that the white men in the photo attacked the bloodied black man and that one smiled about it. That’s not an accurate account. The Associated Press photo is from June 21, 1943. News organizations that have used the photo say the image shows two young white men helping a black man to his feet after he was badly beaten in street fighting during race riots in Detroit. The captions don’t explain why one of the men appears to be smiling, or if he’s actually grimacing. The photo posted to Facebook is also cropped and doesn’t show that the man in the U.S. Army sweatshirt in one hand has a rag, seemingly with blood from the black man. The cropping also doesn’t fully show that the black man is hardly able to stand on his own. Time magazine in 2014 published a slideshow of photos from the 1943 race riots. One of the photos features the three men but in a different setting, walking huddled; in this shot, the man that appeared to be smiling in the other photo has a worried look. The caption says that the white men are helping the black man to safety, and that black people reported many instances of aid from white people during the rioting. A Facebook post claims to show a photo of a white man smiling while holding a black man with a bloody face. The implication is that the black man was beaten and that the white man smiled about it. It’s difficult to tell whether the white man is smiling or grimacing, but the context of the photo isn’t what is implied by the Facebook post. (There are two white men in the photo, one has a stern look on his face.)

The two white men in the photo were actually helping the black man during 1943 race riots in Detroit, according to the caption used by news organizations.

"['Congress', 'Impeachment', 'Wisconsin', 'Jim Sensenbrenner']","
Did 104 Democrats vote for impeachment before the Ukraine letter? No. Sensenbrenner off the mark.
","On Dec. 18, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives took a step it has only taken twice before in the history of the nation: impeaching the president.  The impeachment grew out of a whistleblower complaint filed Aug. 12, 2019 that described a July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to look into activities in Ukraine by Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden’s son Hunter.  The complaint surfaced publicly in late September, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked for a formal impeachment inquiry just days later.  But U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican who has represented a suburban Milwaukee district in Congress since 1979, claimed that more than 100 Democrats took an earlier vote to impeach. On Dec. 11, 2019, Sensenbrenner tweeted an image that read: ""104 House Democrats voted for impeachment before the Ukraine call took place."" He captioned it #ShamImpeachment.  Many Republicans — and Trump himself — have argued Democrats made up their minds long ago on whether to impeach the president. But Sensenbrenner’s claim puts an entirely new framework on it, saying many had already voted for impeachment.  Is he correct? Let’s unpack his argument. Early impeachment talk  The first proposed article of impeachment related to Trump was introduced by U.S. Reps. Brad Sherman, D-California, and Al Green, D-Texas, on July 12, 2017.  It focused on Trump’s firing of FBI director James Comey, who was overseeing an examination looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The measure never moved further than its introduction, but the tide turned when Democrats took over the House after the 2018 midterm elections.  Sherman reintroduced the bill Jan. 3, 2019 — the day the new Congress was sworn in.  It was the same day freshman Rep. Rashida Talib, D-Michigan, made headlines when she declared — at a party hosted by the liberal group MoveOn — that ""we’re going to impeach the motherf*****.""  Green would bring a similar measure back several more times, but Democrats — including Pelosi — generally resisted calls to launch an impeachment inquiry.  The impeachment votes that never were When asked to provide backup for Sensenbrenner’s claim, his communications director Christopher Krepich pointed to three roll call votes in the House as evidence.  The first, which took place Dec. 6, 2017, was on a motion to table a measure from Green calling for Trump’s impeachment for ""high misdemeanors."" The motion passed 364-58, with four voting ""present"" and six not voting, meaning any debate on the bill was suspended.  The second vote, on Jan. 19, 2018, was nearly identical: A bill from Green to impeach Trump was tabled again. The third vote took place just days before the Ukraine call, on July 17, 2019. Yet again, Green’s bill was tabled, this time by a 332-95 vote, with one voting ""present"" and four not voting. Indeed, tallying the ""no"" votes from each of those roll calls and excluding those who either left or lost their seats in the 2018 midterm elections, that number comes to 103 Democrats. So, numerically, Sensenbrenner is basically right. But his characterization is, well, basically wrong.  His spokesman, Krepich, argued a ""no"" vote on postponing the bills equals a vote to proceed on impeachment.  Experts we consulted told us voting against a motion to table isn’t actually a vote in favor of a resolution. ""In voting to oppose tabling a measure, that is literally an expression of support for continuing consideration of a measure,"" said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, in an email. ""It is not technically a direct vote on the substance of the resolution."" That is, there never was a vote on the merits of any of Green’s measures.
  Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri, said it’s more likely the votes against tabling the measures were a way of signalling support for an inquiry — not a vote ""for impeachment."" To be sure, all of the Democrats cited by Sensenbrenner ultimately voted for both articles of impeachment, which now move to the U.S. Senate for trial.  Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said the fact that prior to the Ukraine call Democrats were thinking about impeachment doesn’t have any bearing on the validity of the current impeachment.  ""People who supported impeaching him for his previous wrongdoing are not somehow debarred from doing so in the present case,"" Somin wrote in an email.  Our rating  Sensenbrenner said ""104 House Democrats voted for impeachment before the Ukraine call took place.""  His point was that some Democrats had previously made up their minds on whether Trump’s conduct in prior affairs, such as Comey’s firing, were grounds for impeachment.  But reality gets in the way of the rhetoric. The votes were on motions to table, not the merits of the measures. There was no actual vote on impeachment until the one that ultimately passed. The definition of Mostly False is the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.","[('Twitter, Jim Sensenbrenner account, Dec. 11, 2019', 'https://twitter.com/JimPressOffice/status/1204939270391250945'), ('Email exchange with Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University, on Dec. 17, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Ilya Somin, professor at George Mason University, on Dec. 17, 2019', 'http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll483.xml'), ('Email exchange with Frank O.

U.S. Rep. McCaul misstates childhood cancer mortality statistic
","In a tweet promoting legislation that he says will improve children’s access to cancer treatments worldwide, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul shared a startling statistic about the likelihood of surviving cancer for children born in developing nations. ""A child’s chance of surviving cancer should not be determined by where they are born,"" said McCaul, a Republican from Austin. ""But sadly, this is the case. 80% of children born in developing countries die of cancer each year. That is why I introduced the #GlobalHopeAct so children have access to life saving treatments."" A reader flagged McCaul’s statement about children dying of cancer and asked us to fact-check the statistic — which is inaccurate. We found that his claim is a misquote of a finding by the World Health Organization that just 20% of children with cancer in developing countries are cured. McCaul’s spokeswoman Rachel Walker pointed to the World Health Organization’s fact-sheet on childhood cancer as the source for the congressman’s statement. ""In high-income countries more than 80% of children with cancer are cured, but in many low- and middle-income countries only about 20% are cured,"" reads the fact-sheet, published in September of 2018. If 20% of children with cancer are cured, it is safe to assume that 80% are not, which would explain the figure McCaul cited in his claim. But he applied the number to an entirely different pool of people — every child born in developing countries — and created a new, inaccurate statistic. The World Health Organization finding measured survival rates for children diagnosed with cancer in different countries. It did not measure what percentage of all children born in different countries die from cancer each year. When reached via email, Walker acknowledged that ""a few words were left out in the tweet,"" but the larger claim McCaul made still stands: ""Too many kids die from curable cancers and we are working to change that with our bill."" She also pointed to the video accompanying his tweet and noted that McCaul communicated the statistic differently. ""The mortality rate for children diagnosed with cancer in developing nations is a staggering 80%, matching the survival rate here in the United States,"" McCaul said in the video. We decided to pursue a fact-check of the language in McCaul’s tweet, since it was flagged by a reader and is more readily accessible than the language he used in the video. Plus, it is still visible online and has not been corrected. But we kept the entire context of this statement in mind when issuing our ruling. Other studies on childhood cancer A paper published in the Ethiopian Journal of Health Science in 2016 found that ""cancer is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality across the world but more in developing countries."" But there are barriers to measuring childhood cancers in developing countries. Nearly half of childhood cancer cases around the world are undiagnosed, according to a 2019 analysis published in The Lancet Oncology. The analysis found a clear disparity in where undiagnosed cases appeared worldwide. In western Europe and North America, 4% of cases go undiagnosed, while 49% in South Asia and 57% in West Africa are undiagnosed. But the figures that do exist show that mortality rates for childhood cancer are highest in developing countries. A 2019 study on pediatric cancer published in Science Magazine found that the survival rate for children in lower-middle-income countries is 30%, while the survival rate in high-income countries for children with cancer is 80%. Plus, most cancer cases are present in developing countries to start with: Nearly 90% of children with cancer live in low-income and middle-income countries, according to a different 2019 article in The Lancet Oncology. ""Childhood cancer mortality rates were higher 50 years ago, but can now fortunately be successfully treated in approximately 80% of cases where there is access to modern treatments and robust, supportive care,"" the article reads. ""However, only 10% of the world's children live in high-income countries where effective care is broadly accessible."" Still, researchers behind the article said better data on lower income countries is needed ""to improve outcomes for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer worldwide."" Our Ruling McCaul said in a tweet: ""80% of children born in developing countries die of cancer each year."" This statement is a misquote of a World Health Organization finding that just 20% of children with cancer in developing countries are cured. McCaul’s statistic was more accurate in a video that accompanied his tweet, but data on childhood cancer mortality rates around the world is lacking — both in terms of cases that go undiagnosed and infrastructure in place to measure mortality. Estimates that do exist suggest that the mortality rate for children with cancer in developing countries is between 70% and 90%. These studies look at children within their lifetimes, not mortality rates within a single year, as McCaul’s tweet suggested. Overall, McCaul’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

It doesn’t prove what the website says it does. The article, which was published in December 2017, reported how some political operatives have raised money to support accusers bringing sexual harassment charges against Trump and members of Congress. The story noted how the influx of partisan money could muddy the waters of the #MeToo movement. For allegations made specifically about Trump, the story focuses on two lawyers (and Democratic donors): Gloria Allred and her daughter Lisa Bloom. Both women raised money from ""influential Democrats"" to support women accusing Trump of sexual misconduct, according to the Times. Bloom asked one pro-Clinton super PAC for money to help her vet a claim against the president after he received the Republican nomination. But Bloom told the Times she did not communicate directly with Clinton or her campaign. And the story doesn’t mention Soros. RELATED: Exaggerated post connects Clintons, Russia, uranium deal The other article that Red Pilled News cited was published by the Hill in December 2017.

Warren’s argument that millions can’t afford their Rx drugs holds up
","During a heated exchange over health reform during the December Democratic presidential primary debate Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren turned to the topic of high prescription drug prices. ""Last year, 36 million Americans didn’t have a prescription filled because they couldn’t afford it,"" the Massachusetts senator said.  Drug prices are a persistent hot-button issue, and one of the health issues voters say they most want Washington to take on. So we decided to take a closer look. We contacted the Warren campaign, which directed us to a February survey from the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation headquartered in New York.  The Commonwealth data supports Warren’s point; in fact, it’s a slightly larger number than she said on the debate stage.  In 2018, the researchers estimate, 37 million non-elderly adults went without filling a prescription because they could not afford it. That’s almost 1 in 5 of the U.S. population. Having coverage, the researchers note, doesn’t guarantee you’ll afford medication. The survey makes a point of noting the 87 million non-elderly adults are uninsured, experienced a gap in coverage or ""underinsured"" — which means they had coverage the entire year, but still faced out-of-pocket costs (excluding premiums) that imposed a substantial financial burden. That’s another point Warren — and other candidates — repeated during the debate’s health care portion.  ""Those are people with health insurance, as well,"" Warren added. ""People who can't do the copays, people without can't do the deductibles."" The Commonwealth paper suggests much of this ""underinsurance"" issue comes from deterioration of health plans Americans get through work, which is the way most non-elderly Americans get coverage. Commonwealth isn’t the only organization to look at this question of prescription drug affordability. A November poll from West Health and Gallup surveyed more than 1,000 adults, asking them if, in the past 12 months, they had not had enough money to afford a doctor-recommended medication.  About 23% of respondents reported such an issue — a figure Gallup extrapolated to suggest 58 million Americans experiencing what it called ""medication insecurity."" Meanwhile, a February poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that of adults taking prescription drugs, about one in four reported some difficulty in affording that medication. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) The findings drive home a crucial point: broadly, Warren’s number matches what the data shows.

Yang’s account of Hong Kong’s face-mask ban misses some details
","Entrepreneur Andrew Yang slammed the reaction to ongoing protests in Hong Kong, accusing the government of using new technologies to punish pro-democracy activists for speaking out. ""They banned face masks in Hong Kong,"" Yang said during the presidential debate in Los Angeles. ""Why? Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street, so they can follow up with them and detain them later."" We wondered if Yang’s description of Hong Kong’s artificial intelligence capabilities was accurate, so we decided to dig into the matter.  We found that the ban on face masks has been stalled in the courts, and the facial recognition technology has not necessarily been used in the way Yang suggested. Hong Kong is a part of China but governs itself independently. That ""one country, two systems"" setup has been in place since the United Kingdom returned the former colony to China in 1997. In June, pro-democracy protesters took to the streets to rebel against a Chinese bill that would have allowed for extradition from Hong Kong to China for certain serious crimes. Even after the bill was withdrawn, the unrest has continued, with protesters pushing for larger demands and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam’s resignation. In October, Lam invoked emergency powers to ban protesters from wearing face masks, making the act punishable by fines and jail time. A court in Hong Kong ruled the ban unconstitutional the next month before allowing it to be temporarily reinstated days later. Then, in December, the South China Morning Post reported that a court lifted the ban again, pending an appeal that is set to take place in January.  So currently, there’s no ban in place, but the final decision has not been made. Acting chief judge of the High Court Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor wrote that his ruling to lift the ban for the time being ""in no way determined the appeals one way or the other."" ""If one is to continue to wear masks ... in the meantime, he has to face the inherent risk of having acted contrary to the law should the (government) later succeed on appeal,"" he said. S.Y. Lee, national press secretary for the Yang campaign, told us that Yang’s statement is ""still correct"" in light of the recent court decision to lift the ban. ""The Chinese government moved to ban and still wants to ban face masks, regardless of the court's decision,"" he said. Lee cited articles in the New York Times and Bloomberg to back up the second part of Yang’s claim — that Hong Kong is using facial recognition technology to identify unmasked protesters they can later detain. The New York Times report detailed China’s surveillance powers. The Bloomberg story got more to Yang’s point. That report, which relied in part on anonymous sources, said that law enforcement in Hong Kong has access to artificial intelligence software that can scan video footage and match faces and license plates to police databases.  But the report also said it’s ""unclear"" if the technology has been steered toward targeting Hong Kong’s protesters. The software can be useful for other purposes, such as finding lost children, and Hong Kong’s leaders have not publicly said they are using it on protesters, denying in one case a request from Buzzfeed for information related to its use of the technology. From what we can tell, it’s possible — but not proven — that the government is deploying the technology to monitor protests for suspects to detain. City residents are certainly suspicious. Yang said, ""They banned face masks in Hong Kong. Why? Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street, so they can follow up with them and detain them later."" Yang’s claim is on the right track; the government in Hong Kong has tried to ban the use of face masks, and it is reportedly capable of using facial recognition technology against its protesters. But the ban has been lifted for the time being, and it has not been definitively reported that the city’s law enforcement authorities are using facial recognition to find and hold suspects. Overall, the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True.","[('PBS Newshour on YouTube, ""WATCH LIVE: The PBS NewsHour/POLITICO Democratic Debate,"" Dec. 19, 2019', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHQJeCeQnFM'), ('The New York Times, ""A Surveillance Net Blankets China’s Cities, Giving Police Vast Powers,"" Dec. 17, 2019', 'No link'), ('South China Morning Post, ""Hong Kong mask ban lifted: court refuses government request to suspend earlier ruling that it was unconstitutional,"" Dec. 10, 2019', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/technology/china-surveillance.html?searchResultPosition=1'), ('The New York Times, ""Hong Kong Court Reinstates Mask Ban Before Citywide Election,"" Nov. 22, 2019', 'No link'), ('Reuters, ""Hong Kong court rules ban on face masks unconstitutional,"" Nov. 18, 2019', 'https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3041440/hong-kong-mask-ban-court-refuses-government-request'), ('Reuters, ""Hong Kong extradition bill officially killed, but more unrest likely,"" Oct. 23, 2019', 'No link'), ('Bloomberg, ""Hong Kong Police Already Have AI Tech That Can Recognize Faces,"" Oct. 22, 2019', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/world/asia/hong-kong-mask-ban-protests-election.html'), ('The New York Times, ""Hong Kong Banned Masks at Protests.

Yang cites maternal mortality stats to talk about race
","In an exchange about racial inequality at December’s Democratic presidential primary debate, businessman Andrew Yang  highlighted jaw-droppingly different health outcomes between black and white women, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders picked up that thread.  ""If you're a black woman, you're 320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth,"" Yang said in a discussion about racial disparities between black and white Americans.  Sanders returned moments later, arguing, ""Black women die three times at higher rates than white women."" Those figures, which are roughly equivalent, would speak to glaring inequities in the health care system. So we decided to dig in. We reached out to both the Yang and Sanders campaigns for comment.  The Yang campaign referred us to data from a May 2019 report on maternal mortality disparities from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Based on the context of the debate, we also interpreted Sanders as discussing maternal mortality gaps between black and white women — an issue that public health researchers say is a major concern, and one that’s garnered sizable attention on Capitol Hill. The best data comes from the CDC report Yang’s team cited. The May report outlines maternal mortality disparities, using data from 2011 to 2015 and select data from 2013 to 2017. Per the CDC, 700 women in the United States were reported to die from pregnancy-related complications each year. Non-Hispanic black women were 3.3 times as likely as non-Hispanic white women to die from complications in childbirth — data that roughly tracks with both Yang and Sanders’ stat. So, while their phrasing may have been inelegant, the point is correct. Experts say most of these deaths are preventable.  One issue: Hospitals that predominantly serve black women are often worse-performing than those that serve mostly white women — and that, researchers say, contributes to the gap.  Another issue comes from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It released a comprehensive guide in May on preventing maternal mortality, which provided data showing that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of pregnancy-related death, and it disproportionately affects women of color.  ""Most of these deaths are preventable, but we are missing opportunities to identify risk factors prior to pregnancy and there are often delays in recognizing symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum, particularly for black women,"" said ACOG former president Dr. Lisa Hollier in a press release about the guide.  Black women’s risk of dying from cardiovascular disease while pregnant is 3.4 times higher than that of white women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said this disparity is in part due to racial bias and overt racism in the medical system, with black women’s cardiovascular disease risk not being addressed before they become pregnant.  Dr. Neel Shah, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School, said that both candidates reported the CDC statistics accurately. He also reiterated that this disparity persists irrespective of education or income and stems from medical providers’ implicit bias.  ""When black women express concerning symptoms, particularly pain, the health system is slower to respond,"" Shah wrote via email. ""The reasons are surprising but also apparent to nearly everyone who works in health care. Clinicians are trained to profile people by race — nearly every exam question in medical school tells you the race of the patient and reinforces race-based associations.""   Yang said black women are 320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth, as part of his explanation of disparities between black and white Americans.  The point tracks with non-partisan expert research.

McCain's record on Iraq: eager to attack
","Sen. Barack Obama, speaking to veterans, lashed into his opponent for poor military judgment, alleging Sen. John McCain had fixated on Iraq immediately after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 
""Sen. McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, and that — as despicable as Saddam Hussein was — posed no imminent threat to the American people,"" Obama said on Aug. 19, 2008. ""Two of the biggest beneficiaries of that decision were al-Qaida's leadership, which no longer faced the pressure of America's focused attention; and Iran, which has advanced its nuclear program, continued its support for terror, and increased its influence in Iraq and the region.""
 
Obama's analysis of the war's consequences aside, we checked the record to see whether he had fairly characterized McCain's views about Iraq after 9/11 and in the run-up to the war.
 
As a military veteran and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain was a prominent voice in late 2001 as the nation grappled with how to respond to the attacks.
 
On Sept. 12, 2001, he appeared on

Hardball with Chris Matthews,

where Matthews asked whether the appropriate response should be ""a legal matter or a military matter.""
 
""I think it's both,"" McCain replied. ""As — as we stated, the — a nation has the right to defend itself, No. 1. But No. 2, these organizations could not flourish effectively unless they had the help and assistance and safe harbor of these nations. And it isn't just Afghanistan — we're talking about Syria, Iraq, Iran, perhaps North Korea, Libya and others.""
 
That comment was not particularly specific to Iraq. But in an Oct. 18, 2001, appearance on the

Late Show with David Letterman,

with the nation on edge about the anthrax mailings and in the early stages of the campaign in Afganistan, McCain singled out Iraq.
 
After sharing his views about how events were unfolding in Afghanistan, McCain told Letterman: ""I think we'll do fine. The second phase — if I could just make one, very quickly — the second phase is Iraq. There is some indication, and I don't have the conclusions, but some of this anthrax may — and I emphasize may — have come from Iraq.""
 
In January 2002, while touring the flight bridge of an aircraft carrier on the Arabian Sea, McCain shouted: ""Next up: Baghdad!""
 
He fleshed out his views in a speech at a NATO security policy conference in Munich on Feb. 2, 2002.
 
""Terrorist training camps exist on Iraqi soil, and Iraqi officials are known to have had a number of contacts with al-Qaida. These were probably not courtesy calls,"" he said. ""Americans have internalized the mantra that Afghanistan represents only the first front in our global war on terror. The next front is apparent, and we should not shrink from acknowledging it. A terrorist resides in Baghdad, with the resources of an entire state at his disposal, flush with cash from illicit oil revenues and proud of a decade-long record of defying the international community's demands that he come clean on his programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.""
 
We should note that McCain suggested on several occasions that he would prefer alternatives to full-on invasion and occupation as a means of displacing Saddam Hussein, such as on

Meet the Press

on July 14, 2002:
 
""I have always strongly felt that you must try the option of opposition from within — arming, training, equipping and helping oppositions from within; the Kurds in the North, the Shiites in the South,"" McCain told the late Tim Russert. ""At least try that option before we send Americans into harm's way.""
 
But two days later on

Face the Nation,

he made clear that if it took war to remove Hussein, he was all for it.
 
""Look, we need a regime change in Iraq,"" he said. ""If we can do it on the cheap by having operations involving just Special Forces and some air power and opponents within, either the Kurds in the south, Shiites in the north [sic], then that's fine. But we have to be prepared to do whatever is necessary to bring about this regime change. I think we also ought to prepare the American public in — in — by way of informing them that Saddam Hussein has these weapons, continues to attempt to improve the — their capability and would not be reluctant to export them to other countries.""
 
He continued, ""So we need to keep telling the American people that as well, as well as basically — if I may be so blunt — frightening them — frightening and scaring them every day.""
 
In early 2003, with calls for invasion of Iraq growing more insistent, McCain's was among the most fervent voices.
 
""Sept. 11, 2001 showed that al-Qaida is a grave threat,"" he wrote in a Feb. 14, 2003 opinion piece in

USA Today.

""Saddam Hussein has the ability to make a far worse day of infamy by turning Iraq into a weapons assembly line for al-Qaida's network. ... Saddam is an international felon who has repeatedly violated the terms of his parole and is planning further crimes with his terrorist accomplices. He must be brought to justice once and for all.""
 
The record clearly supports the contention that McCain ""was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11"" — indeed he singled out Iraq on

Letterman

— and became a ""leading supporter"" of the war, as Obama said. We find his claim to be True.

Obama did not take sides in Kenya
","A new book —

The Obama Nation

by Jerome R. Corsi — attacks Barack Obama as a political extremist. Taken as a whole, the book's primary argument is that Obama is a likely communist sympathizer with ties to Islam who has skillfully hidden his true agenda as he ruthlessly pursues elected office.
 
We found factual problems with Corsi's book and question its overall tone;

read our extended story here.

 
Corsi's description of Obama's role in Kenyan politics is filled with errors and innuendo. Corsi focuses on a 2006 trip Obama made to Africa as a U.S. senator. The visit included stops in South Africa, Kenya and Chad.
 
Obama's trip came about a year before elections were scheduled in Kenya. On one side was incumbent President Mwai Kibaki; one of his main challengers was Raila Odinga.
 
Corsi alleges in his book that Obama openly supported Odinga, because Obama wanted to avenge his father's tribe, the Luo, against rival tribes. Corsi also suggests that Odinga is a socialist and was part of an alliance with Muslims to expel Christians in Kenya.
 
There are a number of problems here. First, we reported previously that

Odinga is not a socialist

. The alliance Corsi describes between Muslims and socialists seems conjecture at best. Corsi himself says his case hinges on a secret memo that he admits may or may not exist. Corsi then states that Odinga ""professes to be an Anglican Christian"" but adds that ""concerns even today continue to circulate among Kenya's Christian leaders ... that Odinga intends to pursue an undeclared radical Islamic political agenda."" His argument here is highly speculative.
 
What we can confirm is that Obama has remained neutral in Kenyan politics, and did not support Odinga during his trip. Odinga attended some of Obama's events while Obama was in Kenya, and clearly wanted to associate himself with Obama, but there is no evidence to indicate that Obama ""openly supported"" Odinga. (We previously reported on

a letter from missionaries

that alleged Obama contributed to Odinga's campaign; we rated it

Pants on Fire!

wrong.)
 
For this statement, we decided to scour the public record for evidence that Obama supported Odinga.
We looked to contemporary accounts of the 2006 trip and found a transcript from an interview Obama gave to a Kenyan newspaper that directly contradicts Corsi's allegation.
 
Question: ""As you prepared to travel to Kenya you were obviously conscious of two things. One was about being drawn into local politics. The other was the high expectations of what you could do for Kenya now that you are a senator. How did you handle both?""
 
Obama: ""One of the things we try to do is meet with all parties. I met President Kibaki, I met Uhuru Kenyatta, I was with Raila Odinga. We met the government, met the opposition and met other groups such as human rights activists. What I try to do is give a consistent message on what I think U.S.-Kenya relations should be, but not to suggest somehow that I think one party is better than the other. That's for the Kenyan people to decide.""
 
Also, Obama's gave a high-profile speech the need for the country to move beyond corruption and tribal rivalries. This undercuts Corsi's theory that Obama was motivated by his Luo tribal heritage.
 
""Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop,"" Obama said in his speech at the University of Nairobi on Aug. 28, 2006. ""It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good. It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society. Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing. Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.""
 
Corsi states that Obama ""openly supported"" Raila Odinga. We found public statements from Obama during the trip saying the exact opposite. We found no other evidence to support Corsi's statement, so we rate his statement False.

Obama does not reject his family
","A new book —

The Obama Nation

by Jerome R. Corsi — attacks Barack Obama as a political extremist. Taken as a whole, the book's primary argument is that Obama is a likely communist sympathizer with ties to Islam who has skillfully hidden his true agenda as he ruthlessly pursues elected office.
 
We found factual problems with Corsi's book and question its overall tone;

read our extended story here.

 
Some of the book is a recitation of established facts about Obama that are not particularly in dispute. Corsi quotes extensively and accurately from Obama's memoir

Dreams from my Father,

and then comments disparagingly. In other instances, he gets his facts wrong, as when he says Obama ""rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents.""
 
The statement is in Chapter 3, where Corsi dissects what he describes as Obama's ""black rage."" As evidence for Obama's alleged rage, Corsi cites passages from Obama's memoir where Obama discusses reading

The Autobiography of Malcolm X

while he was a high school student. Malcolm X was a black separatist and a member of the Nation of Islam who rejected nonviolence associated with Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights movement.
 
Corsi quotes Obama's book, in which Obama discusses Malcolm X's multiracial heritage and reflects on his own experience of having parents of different races. Obama's mother was white, his father was from Africa, and Obama was partly raised by his maternal grandparents. ""I was left to wonder what else I would be severing if and when I left my mother and my grandparents at some uncharted border,"" Obama writes.
 
Corsi then concludes, ""At this point, Obama's story of race and inheritance appears complete. His race, he self-determines, is African-American. In making that determination, he rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents.
 
""We do not have to speculate about this. Obama tells this to us outright; his words are direct, defying us to miss his meaning.""
 
But this is a significant misreading of Obama's memoir. Obama just a few pages earlier had written that he felt a disconnect talking about race with his black friends in high school. ""Sometimes I would find myself talking to Ray about

white folks

this or

white folks

that, and I would suddenly remember my mother's smile, and the words that I spoke would seem awkward and false,"" Obama writes.
 
In fact, Obama has positive relations with his mother and grandparents through much of the rest of the book. Obama's mother and grandmother both attended Obama's wedding to Michelle Robinson in 1992. (His grandfather was recently deceased.)
 
The book's final scene is at Obama's wedding, where his half-brother from Kenya, called Abongo, meets Obama's mother and grandmother, who is called Toot.
 
""Toward the end of the wedding, I watched him grinning widely for the video camera, his long arms draped over the shoulders of my mother and Toot, whose heads barely reached the height of his chest,"" Obama writes. ""'Eh, brother,' he said to me as I walked up to the three of them. 'It looks like I have two new mothers now.' Toot patted him on the back. 'And we have a new son,' she said, although when she tried to say 'Abongo' her Kansas tongue mangled it hopelessly. My mother's chin started to tremble again, and Abongo lifted up his glass of fruit punch for a toast. ... I felt like the luckiest man alive.""
 
It's also worth noting that photographs document the Obama wedding and Obama's maternal grandparents visiting him at college. In August 2008, Obama took a weeklong break from the campaign to visit his maternal grandmother at her home in Hawaii.
 
To conclude that Obama ""rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents,"" Corsi has to significantly read against the memoir's stated meaning. We find factual evidence also contradicts this statement, indicating that Obama maintained lifelong relations with his white relatives. We rate Corsi's statement Pants on Fire!

We found factual problems with Corsi's book and question its overall tone;

One of Corsi's attacks on Obama is that Obama advocates nuclear disarmament (

a statement we checked previously

and rated False) and that he wants to reduce the size of the military.
 
Here, we'll check whether Obama ""pledged to reduce the size of the military"" as Corsi charges.
 
We consulted Obama's proposals on defense that are detailed on his campaign Web site. ""Barack Obama supports plans to increase the size of the Army by 65,000 soldiers and the Marines by 27,000 troops,"" says the plan. ""Increasing our end strength will help units retrain and re-equip properly between deployments and decrease the strain on military families.""
 
The policy also discusses building up ""special operations forces, civil affairs, information operations, and other units and capabilities that remain in chronic short supply.""
 
Corsi says Obama has promised to reduce the size of the military, but he seems to be drawing that assumption from Obama's criticism of the Iraq war and Obama's promises to bring more transparency and rigor to the defense contracting process. Obama's written policy proposals say Obama intends to increase the size of the military. We find Corsi's statement False.

""Georgia is an ancient country, at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and one of the world's first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion,"" McCain said in a campaign statement on Aug. 11, 2008.
 
It is true that what is now Eastern Georgia, then known as Kartli, adopted Christianity quite early.

St. Nino



, the Apostle of Georgia, introduced Christianity to the country in the 300s, converting King Marian III in 314, according to Ronald Suny, a professor of history at the University of Michigan and author of the 1988 book

The Making of the Georgian Nation.

 
""When the king converted he forced everyone else to become Christian,"" Suny said. ""That's the year before the Roman Empire became Christian.""
 
So yes, Georgia was indeed an early adopter of Christianity. Note, however, this did not happen in the third century as McCain said. The first century lasted through the year 100, the second through 200, and the third through 300. Georgia became a Christian state in 314, which was the fourth century.
 
Also, scholars quibble with McCain's use of the word ""nation."" In common parlance and under some dictionary definitions, a nation can be any territorial division. But a more subtle understanding is a group of people who believe they are entitled to some form of political representation, and thus give authority and legitimacy to a government. This concept arose in the 18th and 19th centuries. Prior to that, there were empires, dynastic states, theocracies, kingdoms and so forth, but not nations.
 
""To claim that whatever entity 'Georgia' may have been in the third century was a 'nation' is factually anachronistic,"" John Pilch, a professor of biblical literature at Georgetown University told us in an e-mail exchange. (Furthermore, he said, the word ""Christian"" was not fashionable at the time of the Georgian king's conversion — Christians at that time might have referred to themselves as ""followers of the Way."")
 
These are quibbles though. A fair reading of the thrust of McCain's claim is that the place we call Georgia was an early adopter of Christianity, and that's true. He didn't use the word ""nation"" perfectly and he flubbed his centuries, but his claim is still Mostly True.

"['National', 'Energy', 'Barack Obama']","
68 million acres isn't going untouched
","In the debate over how much new oil drilling to allow, Sen. Barack Obama has made a simple but potent-sounding argument against moving too fast. Before opening up new areas to drilling, Obama says, the oil companies should be required to drill the acreage they already have.
 
In an Aug. 4 speech in Lansing, Michigan, Obama said, ""I also believe that in the short-term, as we transition to renewable energy, we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas. But we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but haven't touched. And if they don't use it they should lose it; we should require them to give up their leases to somebody who's going to do something. That's common sense.""
 
Obama was echoing a claim made by the Democratic staff of the House Natural Resources Committee. The Obama campaign pointed to a June report by the Democratic committee staff, which had cited the fiscal 2007 statistics from the Interior Department's Minerals Revenue Management -- which classified 67,055,715 acres of oil and gas leases as ""non-producing,"" along with another 889,378 acres of territory that had been leased for coal, geothermal, or other mineral production.
 
The line sounds good as a Democratic rebuttal to Republican demands that Democrats move to allow drilling in Alaska's protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and offshore areas that also are currently off-limits to the oil and gas companies. A Democratic House bill would bar new oil and gas leases to leaseholders who have not met benchmarks to ""ensure"" oil and gas production within five years on the leases they already hold.
 
But Obama's statement was misleading, inasmuch as it suggests that oil and gas companies have access to 68 million acres of oil and gas fields that they deliberately are not drilling. What Obama did not take into account is the long, complex process that companies most work through, both in federal red tape and in geologic exploration, before leased property becomes a producing oil or gas field. The government classifies that acreage as ""non-producing"" simply because the companies aren't taking oil and natural gas out of it now.
 
David Curtiss, director of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists' Geoscience and Energy Office in Washington, DC, says it's wrong to assume that ""the only lease that is being actively worked is one that has a drill rig on it.""
 
The Interior Department issues leases for onshore territory for 10-year initial terms. The department issues offshore leases for five, eight or 10-year initial terms, depending on the depth of the water. Dave Smith, a spokesman for the department's Minerals Management Service, which handles offshore leases, says those initial terms are calculated according to how long the government thinks it will take oil and gas companies to find and start producing oil or gas.
 
For both onshore and offshore leases, the companies have to comply with government permitting requirements as they undertake a lengthy scientific exploration process that culminates in test drilling to determine whether there is enough oil or natural gas in a particular spot to warrant full-scale drilling. All the while, the companies are paying rent to the federal government for acreage that is classified as ""non-producing.""
 
It can take more than 10 years for a company to start producing oil or natural gas from a leased parcel, but as long as the company can demonstrate that it is making serious efforts to find some, the leases are extended. If the company cannot show that it's actively working the parcel, the lease is not renewed. Sometimes companies don't renew leases if their early work leads them to believe adequate reserves of oil or gas don't exist.
 
It's probably correct to say that some portion of the 68 million acres of non-producing leases truly is not being ""touched."" It's not clear that such a statistic exists and the Obama campaign didn't seem to have it.
 
But Obama's statement, coming from House Democrats, suggests that 'non-producing' acreage where drilling is permitted is land that oil companies are ignoring. That is simply not true. Years of exploration and federal permitting must be completed before leased land yields oil or gas. As a result, we find Obama's claim to be False.

McCain consistently opposed to torture
","
Google ""McCain and flip flop and torture"" and you'll get hundreds of thousands of page hits, just one indication that Sen. John McCain has been hammered for supposedly wavering on the issue.
 
For years, McCain has been one of the most powerful voices in Congress advocating against torture; a position informed by his personal experiences at the hands of the North Vietnamese during 5 years as a prisoner of war.
 
He repeatedly stood up to the Bush administration, opposing such controversial practices as waterboarding as cruel and inhumane. The Bush administration argued that waterboarding is legal under certain circumstances and the Central Intelligence Agency publicly acknowledged waterboarding three people since Sept. 11, 2001 (including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, thought to be the mastermind behind the attacks).
 
In 2005, in the wake of abuses at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and other U.S.-controlled facilities, McCain championed an amendment that required the military to abide by the Army Field Manual, which specifically forbids waterboarding, as well as other actions: forcing a detainee to perform sexual acts or pose sexually, placing hoods over the heads of detainees, threatening detainees with dogs, or using temperature extremes to cause physical trauma, among other things.
 
Although the CIA was not limited to those specific techniques, McCain argued the CIA had to abide by a prohibition against cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment as per the international convention of torture.
 
And McCain has consistently spoken out against torture during his run for president.
 
""Anyone who knows what waterboarding is could not be unsure. It is a horrible torture technique used by Pol Pot and being used on Buddhist monks as we speak,"" McCain said after a campaign stop in Iowa in October 2007.
 
""People who have worn the uniform and had the experience know that this is a terrible and odious practice and should never be condoned in the U.S. We are a better nation than that.""
 
At a Republican debate in St. Petersburg, Fla., in November 2007, McCain again was clear in his conviction that waterboarding and other extreme interrogation techniques are in violation of the Geneva Convention, ""it's in violation of existing law.""
 
""And again, I would hope that we would understand, my friends, that life is not

24

and Jack Bauer. Life is interrogation techniques which are humane and yet effective,"" McCain said. ""And I just came back from visiting a prison in Iraq. The Army general there said that techniques under the Army Field Manual are working and working effectively, and he didn't think they need to do anything else.
 
""My friends, this is what America is all about. This is a defining issue and, clearly, we should be able, if we want to be commander in chief of the U.S. armed forces, to take a definite and positive position on, and that is, we will never allow torture to take place in the United States of America.""
 
With such strong convictions on the issue, many human rights activists were disappointed when, in February, McCain voted against a bill that would have limited the CIA to following the techniques outlined in the Army Field Manual as well. The bill passed anyway, but President Bush vetoed it.
 
A number of McCain's opponents, as well as a few newspaper editorial boards, accused McCain of flip-flopping.
 
But did he?
 
McCain said he opposed the measure on the grounds that the CIA should not have to follow the same guidelines as the Army, and it should have the flexibility to use valid techniques not mentioned in the field manual.
 
""None of those techniques would entail violating the Detainee Treatment Act, which said that cruel, inhumane and degrading treatments are prohibited,"" he told reporters in February, defending his vote.
 
Tom Malinowski, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, said he disagreed with McCain's vote and believes ""it put us in a position where we will have to wait until January to definitively end the country's experiment with torture.""
 
""At the same time,"" Malinowski said, ""I don't think he's been inconsistent.""
 
McCain has never formally supported applying the Army Field Manual to the CIA, Malinowski said.
 
""It undermined a cause he profoundly believes in,"" Malinowski said. ""But I don't question his commitment to the cause.""
 
McCain has continued to speak unequivocally in opposition to torture, as he did in a foreign policy speech in March.
 
""America must be a model citizen if we want others to look to us as a model,"" McCain said. ""How we behave at home affects how we are perceived abroad. We must fight the terrorists and at the same time defend the rights that are the foundation of our society. We can't torture or treat inhumanely suspected terrorists we have captured.""
 
Sounds like the same tune to us. Some may argue that McCain missed a pragmatic opportunity in February to achieve his aim of preventing the CIA from waterboarding — or that he buckled to the administration in an election year. But we think voting against a measure to limit the interrogation techniques of the CIA to those used by the military — a position he held even back in 2005 — is not the same as endorsing waterboarding or torture. We give McCain a No Flip on torture.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'John McCain']","
The distortions cometh
","Taking a page out of recent Obama campaign ads, the McCain campaign released a TV ad on Aug. 15 called ""Taxman"" that cites items from three newspapers to bolster its argument that ""Obama's new taxes could break your family budget.""
 
Exhibit A: The announcer says: ""The press warns the 'Taxman cometh.'""
 
On the screen is a footnoted citation, ""Wall Street Journal 'Taxman Cometh' 7/01/08.""
 
This comes from an editorial, not a news story. Here's a fuller context: ""Ours is the only industrialized country that taxes its citizens even if they live overseas. That hasn't been a big problem as long as U.S. tax rates have been relatively low. But with Barack Obama promising to raise rates to French-like levels, this taxman-cometh policy could turn Americans into the world's foremost fiscal prisoners.""
 
We think it's misleading to cite an editorial from one of the country's most conservative large paper editorial boards and present it as ""the press.""
 
Obama would increase the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. So there's no argument that for the wealthiest Americans the taxman cometh under Obama's plan. But there would be no change in tax rates for families with an adjusted gross income of less than $250,000. Translation: most Americans. Obama also would increase capital gains and dividend taxes rates from 15 percent to 20 percent for those who make over $250,000. Obama also proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles), to offset payroll taxes.
 
In its response to the ad, the Obama campaign cites a host of stories and editorials from major newspapers and political Web sites that conclude Obama's plan would result in a tax cut for most middle class Americans. There's even an opinion piece by Jason Furman and Austan Goolsbee in the

Wall Street Journal

that concludes, ""Overall, Sen. Obama's middle-class tax cuts are larger than his partial rollbacks for families earning over $250,000, making the proposal as a whole a net tax cut and reducing revenues to less than 18.2% of GDP -- the level of taxes that prevailed under President Reagan.""
 
Exhibit B in the McCain ad, ""Obama's taxes mean 'higher prices at the pump' comes again from another editorial, this time from the

Washington Post.

 
The editorial speaks to Obama's call for a windfall profits tax on oil companies.
 
""That cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production, lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders, and higher prices at the pump -- thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help,"" the editorial states.
 
The Obama campaign says this fails to note Obama's call to use the windfall profits tax to support a $1,000 emergency energy rebate to help offset the high cost of gas at the pump as well as the expected rise in home heating costs this winter.
 
Lastly, Exhibit C: ""Obama's taxes a 'recipe for economic disaster.'""'
 
This is another citation from a conservative editorial board, this one from the

Las Vegas Review-Journal.

 
""He wants to raise the tax rate on the top income bracket from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, nearly double the tax rate on capital gains and dividends, and eliminate all tax breaks for the gas and oil industries and private equity firm managers. Talk about a recipe for economic disaster.""
 
The announcer in the McCain ad concludes: ""Higher taxes. Higher gas prices. Economic disaster.""
 
We at PolitiFact have looked repeatedly at McCain's blanket claims that Obama's plan would translate to ""higher taxes"" and have found them misleading. As in this case, the ads never seem to note that the tax increases would only be on the wealthy.
 
But our primary gripe here is with an ad that deceptively tries to lend its message an air of credibility by claiming that it comes from an independent voice, ""the press."" This is becoming more commonplace, particular with the Obama campaign

as we explore in this story.

We examined an Obama ad that uses news citations and

concluded that it was Half True.

 
With MCain, there is a kernel of truth to the claim, in that editorials are part of the press, but voters clearly understand the difference between news reports and articles of opinion.
 
Opinions make the political world go around, but the point is that there are many points of view about Obama's and McCain's tax plans and to present three editorials - two from historically conservative editorial boards - as the voice of ""the press"" is going too far.
 
For those reasons, we rate the ad Barely True.

"['National', 'Patriotism', 'Chain email']","
Airline logo replaced with campaign logo
","A common theme in the many chain e-mails attacking Barack Obama is an allegation that the senator is not patriotic.
 
One e-mail falsely claimed Obama refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance. Another spread a bogus quote from a satirical article that said Obama wanted to replace the

Star-Spangled
Banner

with an old Coca-Cola theme song. (Many people didn't get the joke and forwarded the e-mail to friends.)
 
Now comes another attack on Obama's patriotism that says his campaign replaced an
American flag on the tail of the senator's charter plane with the Obama logo. The e-mail is correct that the tail was changed, but it's important to understand the details: the Obama campaign was painting over a corporate logo that happened to feature an American flag, not eliminating a stand-alone flag.
 
The e-mail, which was sent to us by several dozen PolitiFact readers who wanted to know if it was accurate, has the subject line ""What a Disgrace!!!!!"" or ""Fwd: Disgrace!""
 
It then quotes from The Patriot Room, a conservative blog:
 
""Obama The Patriot — Removes American Flag From His Plane — Barack Obama recently finished a $500,000 total overhaul of his 757. And as part of the new design, he decided to remove the American flag from the tail. What American running for President of the United States would remove the
symbol of his country? And worse, he replaced the flag with a symbol
of himself.""
 
Some versions of the e-mail include an additional comment that does not come from the Patriot Room posting: ""Obama is such a despicable human being. ... Please forward this if you're not ashamed of our country and our flag & if (you) think this is a disgrace.""
 
We have noticed a growing number of the chain e-mails contain that direction, which acts like a reproductive mechanism to ensure the message keeps multiplying.
 
The e-mail is correct that the Obama campaign in July 2008 directed its charter company, North American Airlines, to repaint the plane that shuttles the candidate, his aides and the press corps. (We're not examining the allegation that it cost $500,000 for the changes.)
 
Steve Forsyth, a spokesman for North American, told us that his airline routinely repaints its planes for long-term clients.
 
""It's done all the time,"" Forsyth said.
 
North American, which has five Boeing 757s and five Boeing 767s, has long had the American flag in its logo. The flag logo can be seen on

the airline's Web site

and in

these photos of its planes.

 
In July, the campaign had its plane painted with the Obama logo and slogan. Presidential campaigns often do this because their planes serve as backdrops for photos and video coverage when the candidates arrive or depart from an airport. The campaigns want their own logos in the pictures — not the charter company's.
 

Obama's plane

has his slogan ""CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN"" and his Web address on the side of the plane. On the tail, North American's flag logo has been replaced by the campaign's sunrise logo.
 
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, acknowledged the tail had been changed but added that there is still a flag on Obama's plane, ""it's just closer to the center of the plane."" He was referring to a flag

on the fuselage beside the plane's registration number.

 
Vietor noted that there is no flag on the tail of

the McCain campaign plane.

(But there is a wavy flag on the side of the McCain plane beside the motto ""Reform/Prosperity/Peace."")
 
If flag size on charter planes is important to you as a voter, it's worth noting that the Obama and McCain flags are dwarfed by the stars and stripes on Bob Dole's '96 campaign plane (

big flag on tail),

Bush-Cheney '00 (

bigger flag on tail)

and Kerry-Edwards '04 (

wavy flag on fuselage).

 
But, back to the matter at hand. Yes, the e-mail is right that the Obama campaign replaced the American flag with its own logo, but the flag it covered was a corporate logo, not a stand-alone flag. So we'll take this down a notch to Mostly True.

McCain knows ABBA
","John McCain may not know much about culture, but he knows ABBA.
 
At a town hall at the Aspen Institute on Aug. 14, 2008, McCain conceded that he didn't know a lot about art and music.

New York Times

reporter Katharine Seelye wrote that McCain said if he's ""lacking in anything,"" it is an appreciation for music and art and ""the other great things in life,"" partly because he spent 5 years as a prisoner of war. But then the 71-year-old senator launched into a defense of the Swedish pop band ABBA.
 
""Everybody says, 'I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.' How come everybody goes to

Mamma Mia!

?"" McCain said. ""Everybody goes! They've been selling out for years.""
 
We wondered if McCain was right that

Mamma Mia!,

the musical based on ABBA's recordings, has been ""selling out for years.""
 
First, we will assume that McCain was referring to the stage version, which has been playing on Broadway since 2001, not the movie version, which opened this summer.
 
The Broadway show's Web site says the stage production, which has been performed in eight languages, has been seen by more than 30-million people in over 170 cities. The Web site calls it ""the ultimate feel-good show.""
 
And McCain seems to be keeping up with Broadway box office receipts. TicketNews, which tracks Broadway receipts, reports that

Mamma Mia!

is still selling out. For example, it sold out its performances the weeks ending Aug. 3 and Aug. 10, selling about 101 percent of its seats (the number exceeds 100 because it includes standing-room tickets). A survey of other weeks in the past year found the show nearly sold out or exceeded capacity.
 
Alfred Branch Jr., news editor of TicketNews, told us that the show is ""a virtual sellout most nights.""
 
So McCain is right that

Mamma Mia

has been selling out for years. This claim is True.

The ad then takes a page from movie trailers that steal snippets from movie reviews as part of their advertising campaign.
 
As the image of McCain speaking at a lectern freezes in black and white, the narrator says ""His attacks on Obama...'Not True'"" as the citation, MSNBC 7/28/08, flashes on the screen.

Let's take them one by one. The first quote, from MSNBC, relates to a McCain campaign ad which criticized Obama for his last-minute decision to cancel a visit with wounded troops in Germany during a recent tour of Europe.
 
""He made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops,"" an announcer in the McCain ad states. ""Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras.""
 
We at PolitiFact looked into this claim at the time and concluded that the McCain ad was stretching the truth.

We called it Barely True.

 
In a July 28 television interview with Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., MSNBC reporter Andrea Mitchell called the McCain ad ""literally not true"" and said that she could attest - as a member of the traveling press corps - that Obama had no intention of bringing cameras with him to visit wounded troops.
 
The second snippet, ""False,"" from FactCheck.org also refers to this same alleged snubbing of wounded troops in Germany. ""McCain's facts are literally true, but his insinuation — that the visit was canceled because of the press ban or the desire for gym time – is false,"" the item states. The last quote — ""baseless"" — from

Time

also refers to this same issue. Reporter Karen Tumulty, in the magazine's Swampland blog, wrote ""So how many more times are the McCain campaign and the Republicans going to repeat what is a thoroughly baseless charge?""
 
The ""baloney"" quote from a

USA Today

editorial (and the Obama camp gets points for noting that it was an editorial), relates to a McCain campaign ad that suggests Obama is to blame for the high price of gas.
 
""Even by the elastic standards of political ads, this is more than a stretch,"" the editorial states. ""It's baloney.""
 
The final quote — ""the low road"" — comes from a

New York Times

editorial (again, the ad notes that it is an editorial). Actually, the phrase is borrowed from the headline, ""Low-Road Express."" The editorial takes McCain to task for a litany of what it characterizes as false charges against Obama. Among them, ""that Mr. Obama opposes 'innovation' on energy policy; that he voted 94 times for 'higher taxes'; and that Mr. Obama is personally responsible for rising gasoline prices.""
 
We don't take issue with the fact that these sources used the words that were quoted in the ad. They do. But the ads take evaluations of very specific McCain claims and give them a more far-reaching import.
 
As presented, the ad essentially states, for example, that ""His (McCain's) attacks on Obama (are) false,"" according to FactCheck.org.
 
Jamieson, who works at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication, which produces FactCheck.org, said she felt like the quote was a distortion, and traded on FactCheck.org's reputation.
 
""I saw that and said, 'FactCheck should fact-check that,'"" Jamieson said.
 
No media outlet has a problem with being accurately quoted, she said, but the ad leaves the impression that FactCheck.org has made a blanket determination that ""everything Sen. McCain has said is false."" The article took issue with just one McCain campaign ad. The nonpartisan fact-checking site has found some McCain statements to be true, some false; and the same for statements from Obama. How would Obama like it if McCain ran the same ad with the exact same setup and source citation? she asked.
 
To suggest that these sources have concluded that the entirety of the McCain campaign is deceptive, well, that's deceptive, Jamieson said.
 
We agree. With the exception of the

New York Times

editorial, which faults the McCain campaign for a number of alleged distortions and its overall tone, the snippets refer to very specific statements made by McCain about Obama. We realize that some details must go in a 30-second ad, but the shorthand presents an overall impression that the these media outlets have judged McCain's ad campaign much more broadly than they really have.
 
We rule the source citations Half True.

McCain thinks Yucca site will be more secure
","An ad from Barack Obama zings John McCain about a proposal to store the nation's nuclear waste in Nevada, at a site called Yucca Mountain.
 
The Yucca Mountain project is the result of a quest by the U.S. Energy Department to create a remote, long-term underground storage facility for spent nuclear material and hazardous waste generated by nuclear power plants and weapons development. It has been a controversial proposal, especially in Nevada.
 
As you might guess, many Nevada voters oppose the Yucca Mountain project, and candidates who visit the state are regularly questioned about it. The original opening date was 1998, but opposition has prevented the project from going forward and its fate is unclear. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is a powerful opponent. Obama has urged that the project be shelved.
 
McCain, on the other hand, supports the project. It's more dangerous, he has said, to have nuclear waste stored next to active reactors at multiple sites around the country. The Energy Department says that nuclear waste is currently stored at more than 120 sites in 39 states.
 
The Obama ad, which is airing only in Nevada, includes a brief clip of interview footage with McCain.
 
Here's the heart of the ad's transcript:
 
Narrator: ""Imagine trucks hauling the nation's nuclear waste on our highways to Yucca Mountain? John McCain supports opening Yucca. He's not worried about nuclear waste in our state — only in Arizona.""
 
Interviewer: ""Would you be comfortable with nuclear waste coming through Arizona on its way, you know going through Phoenix, on its way to Yucca Mountain?""
 
McCain: ""No, I would not. No, I would not.""
 
Narrator: ""John McCain. For nuclear waste in Nevada, just not in his backyard.""
 
The interview snippet takes only a brief portion of McCain's remarks. His full answer is, ""No, I would not. No, I would not. I think it can be made safe, and again we have two options here. What people forget is the option of leaving this waste in areas outside, maybe unprotected or certainly not well protected, all over America rather than having it in a safe and secure repository for it. I prefer not having the status quo, and I think it's also a national security issue. I think these areas would be ripe for terrorist attacks.""
 
A bit of controversy has erupted in the Nevada media about the ad and its meaning. The interview is from a syndicated, privately produced news show called ""Nevada Newsmakers,"" hosted by journalist Sam Shad.
 
One Las Vegas columnist believes that McCain misspoke in the interview, that his full answer indicated McCain would be okay with nuclear waste being transported through Arizona. ""Now why would McCain emphasize how the waste 'can be made safe' if he weren't trying to emphasize he would have no worries about the substance passing through Phoenix?"" asked Joe Ralston, writing in the

Las Vegas Sun.

""Obviously, he thought Shad was asking him whether he felt comfortable with waste going through Arizona and answered too quickly. So the central point of the ad — that McCain would be wary of it in Arizona but not in Nevada — is simply false.""
 
Shad, who conducted the interview, disagrees with that interpretation. He said he thinks McCain was answering honestly that he opposes nuclear waste being trucked through a major metro area like Phoenix, and that McCain was simply moving on quickly to a point he preferred to make — that the Yucca Mountain proposal is better than the status quo.
 
McCain would not want to be filmed saying that trucking nuclear waste through his hometown is fine by him, Shad said. ""This is not a stupid guy,"" Shad said. ""This is a very smart guy.""
 
Shad, though, has demanded that the Obama campaign stop airing the commercial. (As of this writing, the footage is still available and presumably airing.) Shad said he hadn't given the campaign permission to use the footage.
 
""It's not a partisan thing,"" he told PolitiFact.com. ""They don't just have the right. It's a copyright issue. It's my video and my audio. Who's going to want to come on the program if they find themselves in a campaign ad later?"" The editing of the video makes McCain appear ""glib,"" Shad said, when his answer was more substantive.
 
So what do we make of all this? We asked the McCain campaign for an explanation on the transportation issue and didn't hear back.
 
What is clear is that the Obama campaign edited the video in a way that omits the main point of McCain's statement. McCain was making a logical case for Yucca Mountain based on issues of safety and security. Whether you agree with his views or not, it's clear from the interview that he supports the project for substantive reasons that have little to do with keeping nuclear waste out of his home state.
 
The ad makes McCain appear to support a simplistic ""not in my backyard"" argument, which distorts his views significantly. For these reasons, we find the statement that McCain is worried about nuclear waste in Arizona but not in Nevada to be Barely True.

McCain's on Georgia's side (so is Obama)
","
Sen. Barack Obama has battered Sen. John McCain throughout the campaign for his ties to Washington lobbyists, arguing that McCain's lobbyist allies have influenced his policy positions.
 
After Russia invaded Georgia on Aug. 8, Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan let loose another such accusation: ""John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government.""
 
McCain's top foreign policy adviser, Randy Scheunemann, has lobbied for Georgia. Scheunemann, a former national security adviser to former Senate Majority Leaders Trent Lott of Mississippi and Bob Dole of Kansas in the 1990s, signed a March 2004 contract — on file at the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act office — indicating that Scheunemann and his firm, Orion Strategies, would assist Georgia in gaining membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in exchange for $150,000 for a year's work. That goal has yet to be achieved — Russia vehemently opposes Georgia's inclusion — so Georgia has renewed the contract several times, most recently in May of this year, at a cost of $200,000 through the end of 2008.
 
Scheunemann took a leave of absence from Orion Strategies earlier this year but it's probably fair to say that he remains invested in his firm, a two-person shop he started in 2001 with Mike Mitchell, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and to which he could easily return if McCain loses the presidency. Mitchell continues to handle the Georgia account.
 
It's clear, too, that McCain has ""mirrored the position advocated by the government"" of Georgia, at least so far. McCain sponsored a nonbinding resolution that the Senate passed unanimously in December 2005 urging the United States to increase its efforts in support of the peaceful reincorporation of South Ossetia into Georgia. The resolution also commended the government of Georgia for devising a peace plan to ""control peacefully and re-establish authority"" in the separatist region.
 
What's cloudier, indeed, is whether McCain's view of the Russian invasion differs substantially from Obama's.
 
Reporters tried to pick apart the candidates' initial statements after Russian forces moved into Georgia on Aug. 8. A

New York Times

report, for example, argued that McCain's first statement was ""immediate and tough,"" since McCain's statement blamed Russia for crossing an ""internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia"" while demanding that Russia ""unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces.""
 
That mirrored what Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili had said Aug. 9, when he said Russia had launched a full-scale invasion and offered an immediate cease-fire.
 
Obama, the

New York Times

said, ""trod more carefully,"" not blaming Russia at first. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that his country had been provoked by Georgia's assault on South Ossetia, an autonomous, ethnically Russian region of Georgia.
 
But as Russia continued its invasion into Georgian territory on Aug. 11, Obama moved toward McCain's position. ""No matter how this conflict started, Russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over South Ossetia and invaded another country,"" he said. ""There is no possible justification for these attacks.""
 
McCain and Obama have both now issued statements supporting Georgia's entry into NATO.
 
There's no evidence that Scheunemann's ties to Georgia have influenced McCain's position, but it is correct to say McCain has supported the view of the Georgia government. The Obama campaign's statement about Scheunemann and McCain is True.

"['National', 'Ethics', 'Democratic National Committee']","
McCain teams up with old rival, scandals notwithstanding
","Critics of Sen. John McCain have seized on news that controversial political strategist Ralph Reed is helping McCain's campaign. The Democratic National Committee piled on in a recent news release.
 
""On the campaign trail, John McCain likes to brag about chairing the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that investigated criminal lobbyist Jack Abramoff's role in the Republican culture of corruption,"" the DNC said in the Aug. 13 release. ""But that is not stopping John McCain from raising campaign cash with one of Abramoff's closest business partners: scandal-plagued conservative activist Ralph Reed.""
 
Reed is the former executive director of the Christian Coalition and currently a principal of the political consulting company Century Strategies. He was credited as a key operative in George W. Bush's sharp-elbowed effort against McCain in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary in 2000. McCain, in turn, chaired the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2006 when it investigated and unveiled Reed's deep personal and business ties to Abramoff, a lobbyist who pleaded guilty to three felonies.
 
So it came as a surprise to many political observers when the

Atlanta-Journal Constitution


recently published

on its Political Insider blog a copy of an Aug. 7 e-mail message from Reed to Republicans around Georgia, inviting them to an Aug. 18 fundraiser for McCain Victory 2008, a committee that supports McCain's presidential run.
 
The paper followed up with

a piece

in which Reed acknowledged he ""sent that e-mail out,"" but said he did so ""in my capacity as a private citizen.""
 
McCain Victory 2008 is a joint fundraising committee made up of the McCain campaign, the Republican National Committee and several state affiliates. Its purpose is to support McCain's presidential run, so it is fair to characterize its fundraising events as McCain campaign efforts.
 
So yes, Reed and McCain are raising cash together. (There is speculation that McCain may cancel the fundraiser, but Reed's e-mail included a contribution form, so McCain's campaign and Reed are indeed actively ""raising campaign cash"" together.)
 
Now for the allegation that Reed is a ""scandal-plagued conservative activist"" and ""one of Abramoff's closest business partners.""
 
It is accurate that Reed was severely tainted, though never charged criminally, as a result of the scandals that enveloped Abramoff. A longtime conservative lobbyist, Abramoff represented Indian tribes in the gambling business, and pleaded guilty in 2006 to conspiring to corrupt public officials and cheating some tribes out of tens of millions of dollars.
 
Reed was friends with Abramoff. Their business ties dated at least to 1998, when Reed e-mailed Abramoff: ""Hey, now that I'm done with electoral politics, I need to start humping in corporate accounts! I'm counting on you to help me with some contacts.""
 
That e-mail and heaps of other information about Reed's ties to Abramoff were unveiled in a

2006 report by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee

, which McCain chaired at the time.
 
Abramoff arranged for Reed and his companies to receive $5.3-million to gin up opposition among Christian groups to gambling operations that would have competed with those of Abramoff's tribal clients, the Senate report said.
 
Abramoff ""had each tribe use conduits to implement their grass-roots campaigns,"" the report said. ""Over time, those tribes became accustomed to (1) paying substantial fees for their grass-roots activities and (2) paying those fees to or through conduits. …The vendor that Abramoff and (Abramoff's partner Michael) Scanlon used, and relied on, the most to implement those campaigns was former Christian Coalition Executive Director and political strategist Ralph Reed.""
 
For example, Reed was hired to help defeat video poker machines at dog tracks, which would have competed with Abramoff's clients' casinos. Reed boasted in a letter to Abramoff: ""Century Strategies has on file over 3,000 pastors and 90,000 religious conservative households in Alabama that can be accessed in this effort,"" the Senate report said.
 
Reed did not return calls for comment on the DNC's news release. He said in a 2006 statement that he agreed to organize antigambling campaigns only after he was assured he ""would not be paid with funds derived from gambling."" Reed subsequently lost a 2006 Republican primary for lieutenant governor of Georgia.
 
Reed's name appears 197 times in the Senate report, which ties him to numerous unseemly Abramoff efforts. So yes, he was one of Abramoff's closest business partners, and he was plagued by scandal as a result.
 
The DNC's news release does not note that the Abramoff-Reed partnership and Reed's scandals are in the past, and it could be read to imply that they continue today. Strictly speaking, however, the release avoids attaching a tense to its charges about Reed. So we find them to be True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'John McCain']","
For the most part, only if you're high-income
","New political ads from Sen. John McCain accuse Sen. Barack Obama of raising taxes on the middle class.
 
""He promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family,"" according to a television ad.
 
The ad bases its claim on the fact that Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the upper-income brackets. So the claim is true if you happen to be a small business, a senior or a family making more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for a single person. Otherwise, it's generally not the case. In fact, Obama advocates eliminating income taxes for seniors with incomes less than $50,000.
 
An important note about seniors: Some seniors will be affected indirectly by Obama's plan to raise corporate taxes. Corporate taxes are expected to depress profits from stocks and dividends, which seniors tend to rely on for retirement income. An analysis from the Tax Policy Center concluded that about a third of seniors would see higher taxes, either because they have high incomes or because of slight increases due to the indirect effect of the corporate tax rate. Overall, seniors would see their federal tax rate go up about 2.5 percent, and that includes steep increases to the top brackets.
 
The ""life savings"" statement, according to the McCain campaign, applies to Obama's plan to raise taxes on dividends and capital gains. Increases to dividends and capital gains taxes will affect people in upper income brackets who have investments in the stock market or mutual funds. But those taxes do not apply to tax-deferred investments like 401(k)s, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and some tax-deferred college savings plans. (We've checked a similar statement previously and

found it False

.)
 
Capital gains and dividends taxes would stay the same for people in income brackets of $250,000 or less, according to the Obama plan. Those higher incomes constitute a small percentage of U.S. taxpayers, mostly the top 1 percent.
 
The ad says that Obama ""promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family."" That sounds like a broad-brush statement of Obama's taxation philosophy. But Obama does not promise those things; in fact, he promises more taxes for taxpayers with the highest incomes. McCain's statement is a distortion of Obama's proposals, and we find it Barely True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
Obama tried to defund troops? Not exactly
","Sen. John McCain went into attack mode in a

recent speech

before the Disabled American Veterans convention in Las Vegas.
 
""With just three months to go before the election, a lot of folks are still trying to square Senator
Obama's varying positions on the surge in Iraq,"" McCain told the veterans in the Aug. 11, 2008, speech. ""First, he opposed the surge. Then he confidently predicted that it would fail. Then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge.""
 
It was a three-pronged attack, and it prompted us to check whether Obama indeed opposed the surge, predicted it would fail, and tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried it out.
 
The first two prongs are clearly true.
 
On Jan. 10, 2007, the day President Bush called for an additional 21,500 troops to try to stabilize Iraq, Obama spoke out against the plan and predicted it would fail to stop the violence.
 
""I am not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in Iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there,"" he told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann. ""In fact, I think it will do the reverse. I think it takes pressure off the Iraqis to arrive at the sort of political accommodation that every observer believes is the ultimate solution to the problems we face there. So I am going to actively oppose the president's proposal.""
 
He followed through on that promise on Feb. 17, 2007, when he voted to support

a bill

expressing that ""Congress disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq."" The motion failed in a vote of 56 yeas to 34 nays, with three-fifths required to move it forward.
 
Obama continued to predict the surge would not prompt the sort of political reconciliation necessary to end violence in Iraq.
 
On July 18, 2007, Obama told Matt Lauer on NBC's

Today Show,

""My assessment is that the surge has not worked and we will not see a different report eight weeks from now.""
 
He continued: ""And it is my assessment and the American people's assessment that this strategy has not worked, that al-Qaida has gotten stronger in Afghanistan and Pakistan, that we are fighting on the wrong battlefield and the Iraqi government has not done the work it needs to do to resolve the civil war in Iraq.""
 
So yes, Obama opposed the surge and predicted it would fail.
 
Now, did Obama try to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge?
 
The evidence the McCain campaign cited to support that claim is Obama's vote of May 24, 2007, against

an appropriations bill

that included funding for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (and passed, 80-14).
 
""That was the moment that Barack Obama voted to cut off funding for the troops who were in Iraq and carrying out the surge,"" McCain spokesman Joseph Pounder told us in an e-mail exchange.
 
First of all, the bill in question funded all of the ongoing military operations in both theaters, not just ""the troops who carried out the surge,"" as McCain's comment implied.
 
Secondly, it's misleading to say Obama didn't want to fund ""the troops."" He said he would support a bill that included a plan for bringing troops home.
""We must fund our troops,"" Obama said. ""But we owe them something more. We owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war. ... We must negotiate a better plan that funds our troops, signals to the Iraqis that it is time for them to act and that begins to bring our brave servicemen and women home safely and responsibly.""
 
If that one vote of Obama's constituted an attempt to ""prevent funding to the troops,"" then almost every Republican in the Senate did the same when they

voted against

a $124-billion appropriations bill on April 26, 2007, that would have funded operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but also required Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq. (McCain missed the vote on that bill, which passed 51-46 and was subsequently vetoed by Bush.) It wasn't the idea of funding the troops that Bush and the other Republicans were opposing, it was the strategy that the bill would have enabled.
 
Likewise, it wasn't ""the troops"" Obama was trying to defund with his May 24, 2007 vote, it was Bush's war strategy.
 
So the first two prongs of McCain's attack were accurate, while the third was not. Since McCain was two-thirds correct, we considered giving him a Mostly True on this one. But the misleading portion of the attack was the most provocative — painting Obama as opposed to the well-being of the troops. We're calling it Half True.

Obama sticks to his Iraq plan
","
The day before the Fourth of July weekend, Sen. Barack Obama talked about the likelihood that he will soon travel to Iraq and what it means for his foreign policy.
 
""I've always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability. That assessment has not changed,"" he said. ""And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground, I'm sure I'll have more information and will continue to refine my policies.""
 
Sen. John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee pounced on those comments, charging Obama with flip-flopping.
 
""Since announcing his campaign in 2007, the central premise of Barack Obama's candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately,"" said Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman. ""Today, Barack Obama reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter. He has now adopted John McCain's position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in Iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground.""
 
""There appears to be no issue that Barack Obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience,"" said Alex Conant, a spokesman for the national Republican Party. ""Obama's Iraq problem undermines the central premise of his candidacy and shows him to be a typical politician.""
 
We reviewed Obama's statements on Iraq from the campaign to try to uncover whether he was backtracking on earlier promises. Iraq was one of the most pressing issues of the Democratic primary campaign, discussed and dissected during more than 20 debates.
 
We found that Obama has made a few points about Iraq over and over again: that he opposed the war ""from the start""; that U.S. troops should leave Iraq quickly and in an orderly fashion (""as careful getting out as we were careless getting in""); and that the United States should not have permanent bases inside Iraq.
 
How quickly should troops leave? His campaign Web site says: ""Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. Obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in Iraq. He will keep some troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats; if al-Qaida attempts to build a base within Iraq, he will keep troops in Iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al-Qaida.""
 
The McCain campaign and the RNC have pointed to the ""16 months"" statement as an indication that Obama favors a ""precipitous withdrawal,"" presumably as early as the middle of 2010. (We checked

that claim earlier here

and found it Half True.) They also point to a March 2007 statement from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe.
 
""On Iraq, he has been very clear,"" Plouffe said. ""He offered a withdrawal plan well over a year ago. It's essential to his candidacy and a rock-solid commitment. ... It will be 16 months at the most where you can withdraw combat troops.""
 
Plouffe's statement appears to be the best evidence to support the McCain campaign's argument. Plouffe was responding to comments from former Obama adviser Samantha Power, who had said the 16-month timeframe was a ""best-case scenario"" that Obama wouldn't necessarily follow once he was in office. Power was forced to resign after calling Sen. Hillary Clinton a ""monster.""
 
But does this mean a 16-month clock starts ticking the moment Obama enters office? We could not find a direct statement from Obama saying that, and found statements he made throughout the campaign that contradicted that.
 
For example:
 
• At a Democratic debate in Hanover, N.H., on Sept. 26, 2007, the late Tim Russert pressed Obama as to whether he would have all troops out by the end of his first term. ""I think it's hard to project four years from now, and I think it would be irresponsible. We don't know what contingency will be out there,"" Obama said. ""I will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy, protecting our civilians and making sure that we're carrying out counterterrorism activities there. I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out.""
 
• At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, Obama said, ""As soon as I take office, I will call in the joint chiefs of staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed.""
 
• At a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said, ""Now, I will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics. Once I've given them a new mission, that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of Iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out, we will not have permanent bases there, once I've provided that mission, if they come to me and want to adjust tactics, then I will certainly take their recommendations into consideration; but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief.""
 
• On

Meet the Press

on May 4, 2008, Russert asked Obama what he would do if advisers thought ""a quick withdrawal"" from Iraq would result in genocide. Obama replied, ""Of course, I would factor in the possibilities of genocide, and I factored it in when I said that I would begin a phased withdrawal. What we have talked about is a very deliberate and prudent approach to the withdrawal — one to two brigades per month. At that pace, it would take about 16 months, assuming that George Bush is not going to lower troop levels before the next president takes office. We are talking about, potentially, two years away. At that point, we will have been in Iraq seven years. If we cannot get the Iraqis to stand up in seven years, we're not going to get them to stand up in 14 or 28 or 56 years.""
 
Taken in their entirety, Obama's comments reflect a philosophy of ""about 16 months"" for withdrawal. He also appears to be willing to take advice from commanders on the ground that might affect the general pace, but not the overall goal of withdrawal. Yet Obama has been artful in his rhetoric. His campaign has clearly emphasized ""16 months"" when speaking to antiwar audiences and ""

about

16 months"" when answering questions from withdrawal skeptics. But Obama never urged a ""precipitous"" withdrawal; even a bill he offered in January 2007 that set a deadline for getting out of Iraq contained an exemption for national security.
 
The Plouffe statement, however, is troubling. Plouffe said the 16-month time frame was a ""rock-solid commitment."" But it's the only statement we found that supports the idea of withdrawal with no allowances made for circumstances on the ground, and it appears to be contradicted by the candidate himself.
 
After the McCain campaign attacked Obama as a flip-flopper, the candidate responded with another news conference the same day.
 
""I intend to end this war,"" Obama said. ""My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in, and I will give them a new mission. And that is to end this war. Responsibly, deliberately, but decisively. And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month. And again, that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months' time.""
 
Weighing all these statements together, we find that Obama has not flip-flopped on Iraq, but that he has emphasized different aspects of his plan under questioning. This rates a No Flip on the Flip-O-Meter scale.
