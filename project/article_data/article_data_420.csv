Is Paul Ryan right that poverty rates haven't changed much since War on Poverty?
","Speaker of the House Paul Ryan rallied the Wisconsin delegation at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, highlighting his ideas to address some of the country’s biggest issues. First on Ryan’s ""A Better Way"" list: Poverty. 
  ""We think there are better solutions to fighting poverty because we see what the War on Poverty has produced,"" Ryan said at the delegate breakfast. ""It produced tens of trillions of dollars in spending. It has been a 51-year exercise and yet the poverty rates in America today are not much better than when we started the War on Poverty."" In his 1964 State of the Union address, President Lyndon B. Johnson launched what became known as the War on Poverty, declaring: ""Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it."" Johnson wanted to expand the federal government’s role to reduce a poverty rate that at the time was about 19 percent. A few major initiatives passed, including measures to establish Medicare and Medicare, give permanency to food stamps and boost funding for primary and secondary education.  In January, PolitiFact National checked another claim from Ryan on poverty. He said, ""today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago."" An analysis of income and educational-attainment data backed up Ryan’s point showing that ""intergenerational mobility"" has ""remained extremely stable."" The claim was rated True. Is Ryan right with this claim too? Measuring poverty The federal poverty rate, calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau, compares pre-tax cash income against the poverty threshold. The threshold is based on three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation. For 2016, the poverty threshold is $24,300 for a family of four. Anyone falling under that threshold is considered in poverty. In 2014, the last year for which data is available, more than 46 million Americans were living in poverty. With a population of more than 315 million, that means the poverty rate was 14.8 percent. That’s a decrease of about five percentage points from when Johnson declared the War on Poverty. It’s not a huge drop, but it’s not insignificant either. Most of the drop came in the first few years of the War on Poverty. By 1967, the official poverty rate dropped from 19 percent to 14.2 percent -- slightly lower than today. Some of the drop can be attributed to general economic expansion in the 1960s following a recession in 1960 and 1961. Since 1967, the rate has fluctuated between 15 and 11 percent. Shortcomings in the data Some issues exist with the official poverty rate, as it doesn’t take into account efforts to reduce poverty. For example, income is defined as the total pre-tax income of all family members. Assistance programs like tax credits for low-income workers or food-purchasing assistance benefits are not included, so it does not capture all the income of a family from programs aimed at addressing poverty. Rachel Sheffield, a policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, said Ryan is on target saying the poverty rate is nearly unchanged in the last 50 years. ""Part of the reason the poverty rate is nearly the same today as it was 50 years ago is that most welfare spending is not accounted for when measuring poverty,"" she said. Christopher Wilmer, co-director of the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, said the official poverty rate does not paint a full picture.  ""It’s misleading to use trends in the official poverty measure when it’s not including measures taken to address poverty,"" Wilmer said. An alternative measuring stick Another metric, the supplemental poverty rate, was created by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010 to give deeper understanding of economic conditions and policy effects. It takes information about what people spend on basic needs like food, clothing and shelter to calculate a poverty threshold. The measure adds non-cash benefits from the government such as the school lunch program or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Wilmer and other researchers used the supplemental poverty rate to show historical trends in poverty, finding results more favorable than the official measure suggests. The team found that with government programs, poverty fell from 26 percent in 1967 to 16 percent in 2012, a 10 percentage point drop. So government spending has had an effect -- and a larger one than Ryan suggests. Our rating Ryan said, ""the poverty rates in America today aren’t much better than when we started the War on Poverty."" The official poverty rate has dropped from 19 percent in 1964 to about 15 percent today. Another measure, the supplemental poverty rate, suggests the rate of poverty decreased 10 percentage points over roughly the same time period. So, over time living conditions have improved with government assistance, but the measure of self-sufficiency has been relatively stagnant. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAA2C00>],/factchecks/2016/aug/05/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-poverty-rates-havent-changed-much-/

Barack Obama says Vietnam 'presenting unprecedented labor reforms' thanks to TPP
","At a press conference with Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Loong, President Barack Obama said the Trans-Pacific Partnership would improve global labor rights. Specifically, he said Vietnam had agreed to improve its labor policies as a condition of entering into the 12-country trade agreement, which has been contentious this election cycle. ""Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time,"" Obama said. We fact-checked another TPP claim from the press conference, on tariffs, elsewhere. Here, we look at Obama’s Vietnam claim. Labor law Before diving into what the TPP asks of Vietnam, let’s look at what protections Vietnam already affords workers. The 2013 Vietnamese Constitution provides for ""break policies,"" ""equal and safe"" work conditions and protects against ""discrimination, forced labor"" and under-age workers. It also establishes trade unions to represent workers and protect their legal rights. According to a 2012 ""Law on Trade Unions,"" however, this is an entity ""placed under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam."" Essentially, all trade unions must affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour. We consulted various law firms that cover Vietnamese labor law, and they detailed Vietnam’s already-existing labor protections. According to the the Southeast Asian law firm Tilleke & Gibbins, Vietnam sets a maximum of 48 hours per week and provides mandatory rest periods of at minimum 24 consecutive hours per week. Employers are required to provide protective equipment, and there is maternity leave typically around four months. The labor law firm Fisher Phillips  classified Vietnam’s labor law as ""employee-friendly."" We spoke to White House representatives who acknowledged Vietnam had such provisions. So, what then, was Obama referring to as ""unprecedented"" labor reforms? Work-in-progress The White House pointed us to a ""consistency plan"" negotiated as part of the TPP, titled the ""United States — Vietnam Plan for the Enhancement of Trade and Labour Relations."" Key to the plan is the decoupling of labor unions from the government. Workers must be allowed to spontaneously form a grassroots labour union. The union must be registered, but not affiliated with, the government, thus allowing it to operate by its own rules and procedures. ""Vietnam shall ensure that its law does not mandate a labour union registered with the competent government body to operate according to the Statutes of Vietnam General Confederation of Labour,"" the plan states. Experts we spoke to said the term ""unprecedented"" is valid. ""The workers can form their own unions,"" said K. William Watson, a trade policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""That's going to be a big change for Vietnam just because of the way it currently regulates labor unions. It’s not going to be compatible with the TPP at all."" John Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said independent unions are the first step to having workers enforce their own rights. ""This other stuff about minimum wage and working ours, all of that, is meaningless if you don’t have unions,"" he said. ""Without unions, without the capacity to organize, whatever workers’ rights are written down on paper don’t have teeth."" Changes to labor laws are still going through the country’s legislative process, they said. While acknowledging that might be the case, Sifton said Obama’s claim was ""premature"" for suggesting current changes. ""They’ve signed up to a whole lot of things and if President Obama had simply said, ‘Vietnam has promised and must do a whole bunch of things under the TPP,’ then he would have been perfectly accurate,"" Sifton noted. ""But he made it sound like Vietnam has already started to do things and that’s just not true."" Enforcement Changing the law is one thing, but actually implementing it is another. Prior to the TPP entering into force, Vietnam must change its labor code to correspond with the side agreement, the White House explained. The plan also provides a review mechanism after-the-fact whereby the United States can impose higher tariffs on Vietnam if the provisions are not being implemented. Nonetheless, experts questioned both the likelihood of Vietnam implementing the new rules and of the United States enforcing them. Both Sifton and Watson noted America’s poor track record in enforcing other free trade agreements’ labor provisions. ""They have a terrible record of enforcing labor chapters as evidenced by the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Colombian Free Trade Agreement,"" Sifton said. ""So he says they’re enforceable and that’s true on paper and its true technically, but it doesn’t mean it would be be enforced."" Watson, on the other hand, said it is in Vietnam’s economic interest — due to their significant gains from the TPP — to abide by the proposed legal changes. In order to attract investors, they have to follow the rules and won’t be too antagonistic to the agreement, he explained. ""It’s not a situation where this was something that they didn’t want and now they’re going to try to sidestep it,"" he said. ""Vietnam is — economically — the country that will benefit the most from the TPP."" Vague language in the consistency plan could also hinder implementation, said Angie Ngoc Tran, a professor at California State University. In an article in New Mandala, she criticized the deal for not offering enough protection for independent unions and other procedural issues. On the flip side, Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the TPP has made progress to address past failures. The Peterson Institute for International Economics has been described as a pro-trade economic policy group.  ""Although the TPP does not address all the concerns of labor rights advocates, it represents an important step forward,"" Cimino-Isaacs wrote. ""The bilateral plans negotiated alongside the TPP are a major innovative component, targeted to address the substandard labor conditions of most concern. Implementation of the mandated reforms would deliver signiﬁcant improvements in Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The monitoring mechanisms attached to Vietnam’s plan in particular seem more proactive than past U.S. efforts."" Our ruling Obama said ""Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms"" and is ""changing their constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time."" There are some problems with the claim. Experts said actual changes to the law have not happened yet but acknowledged the drafting process might be underway. They did agree, however, that the changes proposed would qualify as ""unprecedented."" More critically, they said it’s hard to enforce the changes being described and the United States has a particularly poor track record of doing so. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b4621f6-693f-412e-9d5f-d66f11d089be (Update Aug. 5: This fact-check was updated to include Cimino-Isaacs' comments.)",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7A4940>],/factchecks/2016/aug/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-jumps-gun-discussing-tpp-and-vietname/

Paul Ryan blames Dems for Zika stalemate, omits key detail
","The latest poster child for gridlock in Washington is congress’ inability to pass a Zika funding bill. Florida has home-grown cases and has started aerial spraying. Meanwhile, a $1.1 billion aid package sits on ice. House Speaker Paul Ryan put the blame squarely on the shoulders of Democrats. In an USA Today op-ed, Ryan said his side compromised plenty to move the bill forward. The Senate passed a bill that called for $1.1 billion, all in ""new"" money, that is, not pulled from existing funds. The House wanted much less. When the two sides got together to resolve the differences, the House came up to the $1.1 billion mark and paid for it with a mix of new and existing money. ""Unfortunately, when this plan went to the Senate for a vote, Democrats derailed it,"" Ryan wrote. ""This was despite months of calling for action, and even voting in favor of that exact funding level just weeks prior. They blocked our plan not once, but twice — a blatant ploy in an election year. Because of their actions, this funding is in limbo."" Ryan has the sequence of events right, but he leaves out one part. When House and Senate negotiators got together in their conference committee, Republicans added a clause to block any money going to an affiliate of Planned Parenthood in Puerto Rico. On the Senate floor in June, Florida Democrat Bill Nelson argued that this would limit access ""to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus and prevent terrible birth defects."" He said the House measure was not ""a serious solution."" Without Democratic support, the bill never made it to a straight up or down vote. We previously fact-checked Nelson’s claim that the Planned Parenthood ban would limit access to care. Here’s a map of the clinics that would get money under the bill.  While this shows a few areas without a clinic, it turns out the Planned Parenthood affiliate doesn’t fill any of those gaps. A public health researcher told us that Planned Parenthood reaches younger and poorer women, but on balance, we rated Nelson’s claim Half True. There would be some reduction in access, but not based on where women live. In theory, they could find care elsewhere in their community. So where does that leave us with Ryan’s claim? He is correct that Senate Democrats agreed to a $1.1 billion plan. But the bill they approved did not have the Planned Parenthood funding ban. To that extent, the bill they rejected was a different bill. Those differences were anti-abortion measures inserted by House Republicans. There were other changes, but the Planned Parenthood element was the one mentioned most often. Our ruling  Ryan said Democrats blocked the Zika funding bill after agreeing on the dollar amount. That part is accurate, but the main reason Democrats gave for their action was the Republican addition of language that barred a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico from receiving government funds. Democrats could have chosen to accept that provision and passed the bill. On the other hand, Republicans could have chosen not to add it during the conference committee. It took two to tango. Accordingly, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a3846eb7-58d6-406b-8b3e-648407f92f9e",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB4DDC0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/04/paul-ryan/ryan-blames-dems-zika-stalemate-omits-key-detail/

Sister of Border Patrol agent killed near Arizona border claims there are few agents
","The Arizona-Mexico border became a brief focal point during day one of the Republican National Convention. Live from the border via video, Kelly Terry-Willis and Kent Terry, relatives of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, who was killed in a shootout with Mexican bandits near the border in December 2010, bashed President Barack Obama for leaving Border Patrol agents ""thinly equipped."" ""In Arizona, for example, there are only one and a half agents per every 10 square miles,"" Kelly Terry-Willis said July 18. ""This is unacceptable."" Kent Terry continued, ""Only one candidate is serious about border security, and that’s Donald Trump."" Here at PolitiFact Arizona, we wondered, is immigration enforcement really as unmanned as Kelly Terry-Willis claimed? Linear vs. square miles We did not hear back from Terry-Willis, but found the numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Arizona spans a total of 113,998 square miles and 4,795 agents for the two sectors along the Arizona-Mexico border. We did the math using square miles and found that there is actually one Border Patrol agent per every 23.77 square miles in Arizona. That comes out to .4 agents per every 10 square miles. So Terry-Willis’ math is off. But Border Patrol notes that trying to use the state’s total square miles as a statistic is irrelevant since most agents are deployed far to the south, closer to the border. The number of agents per linear mile is much higher. In fiscal year 2015, the Tucson, Ariz., sector had 3,991 Border Patrol agents covering 262 linear miles of border. That’s just over 15 agents per mile. The Yuma, Ariz., sector had 804 Border Patrol agents covering 126 linear miles of border. That’s just over six agents per mile. Both sectors cover the more than 360 total miles along the Arizona-Mexico border, as well as the rest of the state. Border Patrol also notes that agents are deployed to areas based on the threat of criminal activity. In their 2012-16 strategic plan, they even outline a ""risk-based approach"" to patrolling the border. Michael Lytle, a criminal justice professor and border security expert at the University of Texas at Brownsville, notes that there are some agents in more places along the border than others. Technology, terrain and other barriers could be at play. ""Patterns of activity shape a section of the border, and may not necessitate the presence of an officer on that particular milemarker,"" Lytle said. Our ruling Terry-Willis said, in Arizona,""there are only one and a half (Border Patrol) agents per every 10 square miles."" Based on our calculations, she actually overestimates the number of Border Patrol agents compared to square miles. But that’s still misleading -- and leaves out important context. Most Border Patrol agents survey areas closer to the Arizona-Mexico border, not the rest of the state. The number of agents per linear mile is much higher. We rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/09e06b8f-2783-494a-bf52-bfb4f264e462",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC92C400>],/factchecks/2016/aug/04/kelly-terry-willis/sister-border-patrol-agent-killed-near-arizona-bor/

Donald Trump exaggerates youth unemployment in Reddit AMA
","In Donald Trump’s Ask Me Anything (AMA) on the web-forum Reddit, the Republican presidential nominee was asked what he thought was the most important issue facing American young people. ""The question most young people ask me is about the rising cost of education, terrible student debt and total lack of jobs. Youth unemployment is through the roof, and millions more are underemployed. It's a total disaster!"" Trump wrote. Among the concerns Trump addressed in this answer, his assertion about youth unemployment stood out. If true, it would mean that youth employment was bucking the downward trend of the overall unemployment rate since 2010. To get a sense of whether youth unemployment is unusually high, we looked at a couple of questions. Is youth unemployment in the United States rising? Is it high historically? Is it high compared with other wealthy countries? The answer to each of these questions, we found, is no. A note on measures of unemployment: As we’ve explained before, there are different ways to look at the unemployment figures put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The most commonly quoted figure measures people who cannot find work as a percentage of the labor force. This does not include people not looking for work, including retired people, many students, stay-at-home parents and people too discouraged to look for work. We’ll mostly look at this headline number, but other broader measures of the unemployment generally map onto the trends we’ll outline, according to Tara Sinclair, associate professor of economics at the George Washington University and chief economist for the job site Indeed. We’ll try to use apples-to-apples comparisons to get a sense of whether the U.S. rate is unusually high. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is the government agency that tracks the unemployment rate. It gets its numbers from a Census Bureau survey of 60,000 households. The numbers we’ll be using are then adjusted to take into account seasonal hiring. The unemployment rate for June for people 16 to 24 is a little more than twice as high as the overall unemployment rate. This is not unusual historically, Sinclair said. Young people typically take longer when looking for work than people with more experience, and a person looking for their first job will always be counted as unemployed while people who look for a new job while still working will not, to give two possible explanations. To determine whether today’s youth unemployment rate stands out, we need to compare it with youth unemployment rates in other times and places. The unemployment rate for people 16 to 24 peaked at 19.5 percent in April of 2010. In June of this year, the rate was a little more than half that—10.7 percent. The number fluctuates from month to month, but has trended downwards for years. The unemployment rates for people 16 to 24 have not yet reached its low from the mid 2000s. But it is close—less than one percent higher. The current rate is lower than some pre-crisis months between 2006 and 2008. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has collected youth unemployment data since 1948. The current rate is below the average for that whole period, and below the average rates for each of the last four decades. Data released by the International Labor Organization allows us to compare youth unemployment across countries. In 2014, the U.S. unemployment rate they reported for people 15 to 24 was essentially identical to their international rate. It was higher than the rate in Germany and Canada but lower than the rate in the United Kingdom and the overall rate for other high income countries and the European Union. The worst-off high income countries—Spain and Greece, each dealing with budget crises—have youth unemployment rates almost four times as high as the United States. France’s is twice as high. Youth unemployment affects the population unequally, and the rates for African-Americans and Hispanics are higher than the rate for the population as a whole. We looked at this disparity when Trump inflated the black youth unemployment rate in June. There are other ways of looking at the labor market for young people—other than unemployment—that are less positive. The labor force participation rate, which measures the portion of the population that is working or looking for work, fell during the recession and flat-lined during the recovery. The ratio of employed people to the entire population (including students and those not looking for work) 16 to 24 years old is improving but has not recovered from the recession and remains low by historical standards. Our ruling Trump said, ""Youth unemployment is through the roof."" Individual young people he speaks to may be worried about unemployment, but Trump is wrong to say that youth unemployment is exceptionally high. It is, at worst, average, in historical and international terms. We reached out to the Trump campaign, but they did not respond. This does not mean the job market works well for every young person, or that every statistical measure of the job market is positive. But his statement, in regards to unemployment, is still False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3fba3a88-41b9-49ce-8e8a-4bf8ab289f3f",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA31380>],/factchecks/2016/aug/04/donald-trump/ama-trump-exaggerates-youth-unemployment/

Durbin claims 40 percent of drug overdose deaths in Illinois involve heroin
","U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has been one of the most vocal members in Congress in the fight against the growing heroin and opioid epidemic in Illinois and across the country. Durbin has introduced a handful of measures to expand and improve access to treatment programs for heroin addiction, as well as legislation that would curtail the amount of prescription opioid medication on the market. In a July 20 press release discussing new initiatives to combat heroin and prescription opioid addiction, Durbin highlighted some startling statistics to hammer home just how big a problem opioid abuse has become in Illinois: ""Illinois suffered 1,652 overdose deaths in 2014... of which 40 percent were associated with heroin. Illinois is ranked number one in the nation for a decline in treatment capacity between 2007 and 2012, and is now ranked the third worst in the country for state-funded treatment capacity."" Those are some pretty shocking numbers and there are a lot of them, so we wanted to take a closer look. Drug overdose deaths in Illinois Durbin’s press secretary John Normoyle said in an email the senator was using overdose statistics provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that the figures cited came from a provisional report for 2014 and the number of drug overdose deaths were not revised to reflect the most recent count. Data on drug overdose deaths is readily available on the CDC website, which shows there were a total of 1,705 drug overdose deaths in 2014, compared to 1,288 in 2010 -- a 32.4 percent increase over that four-year period. However, the Illinois Department of Public Health, which reports preliminary and final drug overdose deaths to the CDC, puts the 2010 total at 1,284 and 1,700 in 2014 -- a slight discrepancy but not unusual when reporting overdose deaths as they often get revised. For that reason, Divya Little, a public information officer at IDPH, said the state’s finalized data is more accurate, though the difference is negligible with regard to some of the other statistics presented in Durbin’s claim. Of the roughly 1,700 drug overdose deaths, 711 were heroin-related, accounting for nearly 42 percent of all drug overdose deaths in 2014. While the percentage of drug overdose deaths associated with heroin would be a little more than 1 percentage point higher using the provisional 1,652 figure, Normoyle said the 40 percent statistic was pulled from a Reboot Illinois article that uses final data for 2014. It’s important to note that prior to 2013, counties did not specifically test for heroin in overdose deaths, so tracking deaths involving heroin cannot be reliably determined, according to IDPH. Durbin’s use of outdated numbers from the CDC neither misleads nor drastically alters the claim. If anything, it helps Durbin in making his point that heroin and prescription opioid abuse and addiction continues to get worse. Dwindling state-funded treatment capacity A report published in August 2015 by the Illinois Consortium on Drug Policy at Roosevelt University, or ICDP, shows state-funded treatment capacity in Illinois fell by 52 percent from 2007-2012, the largest decrease in the nation.   Durbin, who used statistics from this study, is correct when he says Illinois led the nation in the decline for state-funded treatment capacity. In 2007, Illinois ranked 28th in state-funded treatment capacity before dropping to No. 44, or third worst in 2012, behind Tennessee and Texas, respectively, according to the report. Kathie Kane-Willis, co-founder and director of the ICDP, told Politifact Illinois the state’s budget woes are making the situation much worse, and Illinois already was in ""pretty dire straits"" long before the political tug-of-war between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Democratic-controlled Legislature ensued. Illinois hasn’t had an actual budget for more than a year and the majority of the state’s social service providers that offer drug treatment programs haven’t been funded or received payment since July 1, 2015, leading many to cut programs, turn away people seeking help or shut down entirely. Although a six-month stopgap budget was passed on June 30 that appropriates $667 million for human services, including nonprofits and other social service providers, that only amounts to 65 percent of the cost of those services since last July. ""When you look at Illinois, we have a crumbling treatment infrastructure,"" Kane-Willis said. ""We do not have the capacity to treat the people who need it."" Kane-Willis, a former heroin user, said that in light of these fiscal issues, Illinois probably now is second-worst in the U.S. when it comes to treatment capacity as Tennessee has improved and expanded treatment programs and capacity since the study was released. Treating those in need Durbin notes that as the state's treatment capacity shrinks, the vast majority of Illinoisans who are in need of treatment do not receive it.  A report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, ""Behavioral Health Barometer: Illinois, 2014,"" found ""individuals aged 12 or older with illicit drug dependence or abuse, about 32,000 individuals (12.7 percent ) per year in 2009–2013 received treatment for their illicit drug use within the year prior to being surveyed."" Our ruling  Durbin said, ""Illinois suffered 1,652 overdose deaths in 2014 ... of which 40 percent were associated with heroin. Illinois is ranked number one in the nation for a decline in treatment capacity between 2007 and 2012, and is now ranked the third worst in the country for state-funded treatment capacity."" The drug overdose figure Durbin uses came from provisional data provided to the senator by the CDC. In 2014, drug overdose deaths totaled 1,705, or 1,700 if using statistics from IDPH, which tend to be more accurate. As for the other figures, the percent increase from 2010 is slightly more than 32 percent, and drug overdose deaths in 2014 that were associated with heroin is about 42 percent. But as IDPH notes, tracking overdose deaths involving heroin cannot be reliably determined as counties’ coroners did not specifically test for heroin prior to 2013. We don’t see these discrepancies as an attempt to mislead in making his case for heroin and prescription opioid addiction treatment legislation he is advocating. If anything, it underscores the growing epidemic that’s not only gripping Illinois, but the rest of the country. We rate Durbin’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECD05180>],/factchecks/2016/aug/04/richard-durbin/40-percent-drug-overdose-deaths-involve-heroin/

Barack Obama: Trans-Pacific Partnership eliminates 18,000 tariffs on American goods
","Speaking with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Loong, President Barack Obama emphasized America’s renewed commitments to the Asian Pacific region. It didn’t take long for the conversation to focus on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade deal pending Senate approval that has been highly contentious in the 2016 election. Defending the deal, Obama made several claims regarding its benefits for American workers. Obama portrayed the deal as having wide-ranging influence —  improving American manufacturing by removing tariffs, promoting labor rights in Vietnam and combatting human trafficking in Malaysia. ""Number one, it knocks out 18,000 tariffs that other countries place on American products and goods,"" he said. ""So if everybody agrees that we're going to have lower tariffs, that's good for American businesses and American workers. And we should want that, we should pursue it."" In this fact-check, we’ll look at the claim about tariffs. Eliminating tariffs We found Obama cited the right numbers, but first we need to explain a few things. Section 2-D of the TPP agreement provides for the gradual elimination of tariffs. As part of the agreement, each country has a ""tariff elimination schedule,"" with some tariffs removed immediately and others phased out over as many as 30 years. The White House calculated 18,000 tariffs by subtracting countries already subject to a free trade-agreement, leaving only Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and Vietnam. They used a World Trade Organization report to figure out how many goods those countries subject to tariffs, and then calculated the TPP would remove 98 percent. We spoke to trade experts who told us Obama’s number is likely accurate. ""It is wholly reasonable for the agreement to eliminate 18,000 tariffs,"" said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute who specializes in trade policies. ""There are obvious caveats to the economic effect of those tariff cuts, but the simple question of whether the TPP does that is very cut and dried."" So, yes, the agreement eliminates 18,000 tariffs. But there’s a qualification. The White House informed PolitiFact that in calculating the 18,000 number, it did not exclude goods the United States does not currently export. They did so because reducing tariffs could lead to new goods being exported in the future, and said that was consistent with Obama’s statement. Put simply, the 18,000 figure includes tariffs on American goods that would be removed, and tariffs on products that America isn’t yet exporting but might. ""TPP cuts over 18,000 tariffs,"" said Matthew McAlvanah, assistant U.S. trade tepresentative for public and media affairs. ""Those who argue for a lower number do so by undercounting the tariff cuts on current exports and ignoring the reality that tariff cuts expand exports -- including into areas where countries do not export, especially if it's because prohibitively high tariffs block trade on otherwise competitive goods."" Lincicome agreed with the White House assessment, saying only counting currently exported goods is a ""myopic"" view of free trade. Jeffrey Frankel, an economics professor at Harvard University, said including future exports is the ""right"" measure. Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the 18,000 number is accurate but could have benefited from additional qualification. ""I think that there will be some products that the U.S. does not now export to specific countries that would be traded after TPP, but the number is unknowable,"" Bosworth said. ""I think it would be good to say how many of the 18,000 currently appear as a U.S. export to at least one of the other participating countries."" If one interpreted the claim as referring to tariffs on goods currently exported by the United States, the White House said the number is 11,467 tariffs. Economic impact Experts also said the economic effects of the tariff cut are debatable. The effects will be lessened because the United States does not have a comparative advantage on all goods.  According to comparative advantage theories, countries produce and export what they can produce more efficiently. As such, Lincicome said, not all of the 18,000 tariff cuts will be as significant for some goods as for others. Agricultural products, higher-end manufacturing products and chemicals are likely to benefit the most from the agreement. Also absent from Obama’s claim was a time-frame. Lincicome noted that some tariffs are phased out over several years, and that others don’t go all the way to zero. ""You combine those two legal aspects and you’re not just looking at the immediate elimination of 18,000 tariffs,"" Lincicome explained. ""That’s not a bad thing, that’s very standard for United States free trade agreements, for all free trade agreements."" J. Bradford Delong, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley, also said the number was likely correct. He added, however, that most of those tariffs being eliminated are small to begin with, which saying ""18,000 tariffs"" doesn’t capture. Lincicome told us the average TPP tariff reduction is estimated to be from 7 to 15 percent to between zero and 2 percent. Another clarification Lincicome added was that the 18,000 tariffs do not apply to 18,000 different goods, because multiple countries apply tariffs on the same goods. A White House guide on how the TPP would affect state exports, while not comprehensive, only lists around 250 goods. Our ruling Obama said the TPP removes 18,000 tariffs that other countries place on American goods. That number is one reasonable estimation, though it’s leaving out a lot of context. The 18,000 number includes tariffs on goods the United States doesn’t currently export but could in the future. We rate the claim Mostly True.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1a77eb5a-b05a-4542-94f3-38d3b270a70a",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA47EC0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-trans-pacific-partnership-eliminates-/
"['State Budget', 'Illinois', 'Kelly Cassidy']","
Never mind the constitution: In Illinois, where there's a will there's a way
","The bitter, partisan acrimony that has defined relations between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Democrat-dominated Illinois General Assembly blew up in the final hours of the spring legislative session on May 31. After insisting for more than a year that he would not endorse anything short of a full-year budget that included some of his Turnaround Agenda’s business and political reforms, Rauner changed his position on the session’s final day when he -- through the Republican leaders in the General Assembly -- introduced bills to fund P-12 education for a full year and to fund basic state government services through the end of the calendar year. When Democrats declined to take up Rauner’s bills, the governor and Republican lawmakers held a press conference at the grand staircase in the Capitol rotunda at which Rauner declared the spring session a ""stunning failure by the supermajority Democrats who control our Legislature."" Speaking six hours before the midnight deadline, Rauner called on Democrats to pass the GOP budget bills before the scheduled adjournment of the House and Senate. ""We have seen the majority Democrats introduce 500-page bills and vote on them within an hour or two,"" Rauner said. The GOP press conference stoked partisan tensions and prompted this Facebook post from state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago:  Cassidy’s post expressed frustration felt by many Democrats who had been working behind the scenes with their Republican counterparts on a possible budget compromise. But it also implied that the governor was unaware of parliamentary procedure in the General Assembly: ""Then, the Republican leader theatrically introduced new bills with stopgap budget language, declaring that we could stay until midnight and pass this compromise. Except under our constitution, a bill has to be read on 3 different days, so that's not possible."" Were Rauner and Republican leaders really advocating the impossible? We decided to check. By the book Article IV, Section 8, subsection d of the Illinois Constitution defines the reading requirement for bills in the Illinois General Assembly: (d)  A bill shall be read by title on three different days in each house. A bill and each amendment thereto shall be reproduced and placed on the desk of each member before final passage. Going by that requirement, Cassidy is correct. Bills debated at 6 p.m. could not be passed by the House and Senate by midnight. In fact, it would take five calendar days, says Kent Redfield, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois-Springfield. But once a bill is introduced and its title read in the House and Senate as required by the constitution, it can be held throughout a legislative session and amended at a moment’s notice. Such a bill is called a ""shell"" or ""vehicle"" bill, and the amendment tacked onto it can be an entire bill itself. Therefore, the GOP budget text could have been added as an amendment to a shell bill that already had fulfilled the constitutional reading requirement. ""It's sort of like a freight train; the boxcars can be empty all along the route, station after station, then suddenly get filled at the last minute before the final stop,"" says Charles Wheeler, director of the Public Affairs Reporting graduate program at the University of Illinois-Springfield. At the May 31 press conference, Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno addressed the procedural question. ""It is true we have introduced new bills but there are vehicles in both chambers that can get the job done by midnight,"" Radogno said. ""We’ve seen in hundreds of examples, where there’s a will there’s a way."" Cassidy said she believed otherwise when she made her Facebook post. ""From what I was hearing, we were out of shells,"" she said. Practical and political In his quote above from May 31, Rauner noted that shell bills often have been used in Illinois by Democrats to drop large and often controversial bills onto Republicans’ desks with very little time for review and debate. Having shell bills readily available can serve a practical as well as a political purpose. It allows swift passage of legislation to respond to an emergency, for example. State constitutions vary in their methods, but they generally allow some provision for lawmakers and governors to speed up the legislative process. (A list of the states’ reading requirements for passing bills is here.) ""A lot of constitutions have waiver language so in emergencies they have the ability to compress the time frame,"" says Brenda Erickson, senior research analyst with the National Council of State Legislatures. ""The two-word synopsis of legislative processes is ‘it varies.’"" Illinois does not allow lawmakers to waive the three-reading requirement, so keeping shell bills in reserve for quick amendment and passage is the fallback. The only limitation is that the bill be limited to a single subject, though it grants lawmakers wide latitude. The Republicans’ budget bills on May 31, for example, needed to go on shell bills for appropriations. That would not have been a problem on the evening of May 31, had Rauner and the General Assembly’s Democratic leaders -- House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton -- managed to hammer out an agreement in the final hours. ""Cullerton and Madigan had several vehicles in place, and were able to use them… for the ultimate deal that passed on June 30,"" Wheeler said.  The bill ultimately amended to become the stopgap budget, SB 2047, was a shell bill originally introduced in March 2015 to appropriate $2 to the General Assembly’s Legislative Research Bureau. It needed only a third reading in the House for approval. The amendment that contains the spending plan, House Amendment 5, was introduced, passed and signed into law in a single day on June 30. Our ruling  Cassidy said Rauner ""theatrically introduced new bills with stopgap budget language, declaring that we could stay until midnight and pass this compromise. Except under our constitution, a bill has to be read on 3 different days, so that's not possible."" She is correct from a strict interpretation of the rules in the state constitution, in which it takes a minimum of five calendar days from introduction to passage of a bill. But the Illinois Constitution in theory and Illinois lawmaking in practice at times operate more as distant cousins than identical twins. As Wheeler notes, the use of ""shell"" or ""vehicle"" bills is a common practice in Springfield, and Madigan and Cullerton used the procedure to make SB 2047 into the stopgap plan a few weeks later -- when Democrats and Republicans managed a fragile truce in their ongoing battle. Cassidy is no novice in the workings of the General Assembly. Before joining the House in 2011, she had served as a legislative aide to Cullerton and a lobbyist for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. It’s reasonable to believe she should have known it was highly unlikely that the General Assembly would have no shell bills available in the final hours before the budget deadline. As Republican Leader Radogno said on May 31, ""Where there’s a will there’s a way."" We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDCF3080>],/factchecks/2016/aug/04/kelly-cassidy/never-mind-constitution-illinois-lawmaking-where-t/

Trump: China and Russia 'doing naval exercises together'
","At a rally in Columbus, Ohio, Donald Trump again made the case for improved relations with Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Wouldn’t it be great if the United States and Russia got along, combined, knocked out ISIS, maybe did other positive things?"" Trump said Aug. 1, 2016. ""We forced them through stupidity into an alliance with China, you know why? Because China needs oil. We were driving them both crazy, they formed -- and from the time I was a young guy I always learned, don’t ever let China and Russia get together,"" Trump said. ""We forced them together, Obama forced them together ... because you didn’t get along with either and then eventually China came in and said, ‘Let’s make a deal on oil.’ They’re together. In fact they’re doing naval exercises together someplace."" For this fact-check, we’re evaluating Trump’s claim that Russia and China are ""doing naval exercises together,"" and that Obama ""forced them together."" As neighbors, China and Russia have a complicated relationship. Relations were certainly cold while Russia was part of the Soviet Union, and a small skirmish broke out between the two war powers in 1969. The relationship improved dramatically when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Their symbiosis since the early 1990s has been largely weapons-related -- with China buying advanced Russian weaponry. The calculation changed in 2014, when Russia seized control of Crimea in Ukraine. The action led to crippling sanctions organized by the United States, European Union and Canada that led a buckling of the Russian economy and a need for Russia to advance its relationship with China. Joint naval exercises following the sanctions have ""a new level of seriousness,"" according to Lyle J. Goldstein, associate professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I.. A 2014 exercise in the East China Sea choreographed two submarines and 14 surface ships. A year later in the Black Sea, nine ships practiced anti-submarine warfare. ""Russia is trying to prove to the United States, and to the EU as well, that they have other options, that they can go to their other friend and make serious deals,"" said Laicie Heeley, an expert from the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank. This includes deals on oil, as Trump said. Russia shipped 4.65 million tons of oil to China last March, and such exports have more than doubled over the last five years. This, too, has to do with the sanctions that have limited Russia’s exporting options. ""Unfortunately for Russia, the partnership is much more political than economic,"" Heeley said. ""China still represents a rather small portion of their exports, and they haven’t really been able to make the big deals or encourage the private investments that would really help their economy. They haven’t been able to come to the kind of partnership that, rhetorically, they’d like to be able to say they have."" In July, a tribunal in the Hague issued a rebuke of China, siding with the Philippines in the country’s dispute over territory in the South China Sea. China is salty over the ruling, and diplomatic leaders anticipated some response. But China’s naval drills with Russia are nothing more than fist-shaking, said Heeley. ""China is trying to demonstrate that they are a responsible country, and they’re not just going and conducting military drills with Russia to make everyone angry,"" Heeley said. ""This is a measured and careful response by the country. They could be doing something much more to truly anger the international community, but instead they’re not."" Our ruling Trump was correct in his claim that Russia and China are ""doing naval exercises together someplace."" He was right, too, that the countries have increased their oil trading, though not because ""China needs oil,"" as Trump said. It’s more because Russia needs another oil buyer, due to limitations from sanctions. Finally, Obama did not single-handedly force Russia and China together. Both the sanctions against Russia and the tribunal’s decision against China are the result of multinational diplomatic efforts.

Patrick Murphy ad misleads about whether Marco Rubio missed vote for his own bill
","U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, who hopes to win the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Marco Rubio, has frequently attacked Rubio’s absence from many of the chamber’s votes when Rubio was running for president in 2015 and 2016. Murphy hammered away at this theme in an ad released Aug. 1, 2016. The ad starts with a narrator asking, ""Marco Rubio, how can you protect us when you fail to show up for work?"" The ad then excerpts a pro-Rubio ad that boasted,""Rubio wrote the toughest sanctions on Hezbollah ever passed."" (Hezbollah is an Islamist group based in Lebanon and designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 1997.) Then, the narrator of the Murphy ad counters, ""Wait a second, Marco Rubio didn’t show up for that vote. Missed more votes than anyone in the entire U.S. Senate last year."" In March, we rated Mostly True the claim that Rubio ""has the No. 1 absentee record"" in the Senate. But is Murphy correct that ""Marco Rubio didn’t show up"" for a vote on his own bill to tighten sanctions against Hezbollah? It’s a little complicated. Let’s recap what happened. The floor action The Rubio camp argues that Murphy is constructing a straw man, since there wasn’t a formal ""vote"" on the Hezbollah sanctions bill. Rather, it passed by unanimous consent -- a procedural mechanism in which senators are given an opportunity in advance to object to a bill or other action. Under unanimous consent, if no advance objections are made, then the measure proceeds to the floor. At a prearranged time, a senator requests unanimous consent to consider the bill passed, and -- if the presiding officer hears no objection from senators in the chamber -- so orders. No individual votes are recorded and no other senators need to be present. The bill in question was passed by unanimous consent on Nov. 17, 2015. (It was eventually signed by President Barack Obama and became law.) We turned to the C-SPAN archives and the Congressional Record to nail down exactly what happened that day. At 6:30 p.m., the Senate was in the aftermath of a vote. Most senators appeared to have left the floor, as can be seen in this screenshot.  A few minutes later, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., was given the floor to call for consideration of H.R. 2297, The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015. Technically, he was there to ask that an existing bill be renamed and filled with newly agreed-upon text addressing the Hezbollah sanctions. Daines said he was seeking unanimous consent that the measure be ""agreed to ... as amended"" and ""passed."" Here’s a screenshot of Daines making that request.  Following what is usually a carefully choreographed procedure, the presiding officer, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said, ""Without objection, it is so ordered."" Here’s Gardner:  And the deed was done. What experts say Experts in Senate procedure said it’s misleading for Murphy to say that Rubio ""didn’t show up"" for the vote on his bill, because it was not a formal vote in which all senators were supposed to be present so their individual votes could be recorded. In this case, there appear to be only a handful of senators in the chamber at the time -- Daines, Gardner and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who was waiting for his turn to deliver a floor speech. The main chance for Rubio -- or any other senator -- to weigh in on the measure would have been as the unanimous consent proposal was being circulated before the bill reached the floor. In fact, under the kinds of Senate attendance tallies that Murphy cited elsewhere in the ad, a senator’s absence from a unanimous consent vote would not even count as an absence, experts said. ""It's not unusual for the Senate to pass bills by unanimous consent,"" said Sarah A. Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. ""Given the Senate's byzantine floor rules and senators' schedules, the Senate relies on voice votes to get non-controversial measures passed. So Sen. Rubio's absence, even for a bill that he sponsored, strikes me as within the norm of Senate practice. The harder work of most bills is getting a bill to the floor and securing bicameral and presidential agreement."" Binder added that ""a challenger's campaign is certainly on the mark to challenge an incumbent's voting participation, but I'd be hesitant to highlight a bill that passed (this way) as the best evidence of low attendance."" Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, also called the assertion in Murphy’s ad ""misleading"" and added that none of the Senate cosponsors -- a mix of Democrats and Republicans -- were on the floor, either. When we contacted the Murphy campaign, spokeswoman Galia Slayen said that Rubio ""is campaigning on passing a bill, but when that bill passed, he was not present."" The campaign also noted that Rubio was fundraising on the day of the vote, which is supported by contemporary coverage in the Tampa Bay Times. Our ruling Murphy’s ad said that Rubio ""didn’t show up"" for a vote on his own bill on sanctions against Hezbollah. Some may perceive it as embarrassing for Rubio to have missed that moment on the floor to chase donors instead, but on the substance, Murphy’s assertion is distinctly misleading. The bill in question passed under unanimous consent, a commonly used Senate procedure in which individual senators’ votes are not tallied, and in which most senators -- even bill sponsors and co-sponsors -- are not typically in the chamber. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAF97C0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/04/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-ad-misleads-about-marco-rubio-missi/

Democrat correctly points out Tarkanian's long-held abortion opposition
","After a hard-fought primary battle in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, Republican candidate Danny Tarkanian is now taking flak from Democrats over his stance on abortion. At a recent roundtable with female congressional members, Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen attacked Tarkanian saying he ""wants to defund Planned Parenthood and would outlaw a woman's right to choose, even in cases of rape or incest."" As Tarkanian and Rosen vie for one of the most competitive House seats in the nation, we wanted to dig deeper into this line of attack. Tark’s record Despite never holding office, Tarkanian has nonetheless amassed a lengthy record of public positions on abortion and Planned Parenthood funding that largely align with Rosen’s claims. He is squarely pro-life, saying in a 2012 debate that he believes ""life starts at conception, and if life starts at conception you have to do what you can to preserve life."" Tarkanian has consistently said he’d support removing federal funding from Planned Parenthood and that he opposed abortion with the sole exception if the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother. Most recently, he answered a pre-2016 primary voter guide saying he would support defunding Planned Parenthood and support legislation ""to protect the right to life of every person from conception to natural death,"" with an exception if it’s necessary to save the life of the mother. In addition to the questionnaire, Tarkanian told a reporter in March 2016 that he would ""absolutely"" support defunding the reproductive health care provider. ""Why do we have to give $800 million to an entity that is providing such a divisive service as abortions and then coming out and seeing how they’re selling body parts and all those other things?"" he said. (PolitiFact rated a similar claim that Planned Parenthood sold aborted fetus body parts for profit as False, and the group has been cleared of any wrongdoing in many states, including Nevada.) Tarkanian has been been less direct on abortions for rape and incest victims. The closest he’s come to addressing the issue was during a June 2016 radio interview, where he reiterated his opposition to abortion with the only exception being if continuing the pregnancy would threaten the life of the mother. ""That’s the only time I think there should be the ability to terminate the life of an unborn,"" he said. During his 2012 campaign for a different congressional seat, Tarkanian was the target of an ad that strongly implied he supported tea party Republicans who wanted to ""criminalize a woman’s right to choose even in cases of rape or incest."" Tarkanian’s campaign manager, James Fisfis, said the campaign didn’t disagree with the claims but emphasized the Republican isn’t pushing for any specific abortion-related legislation and would continue supporting full funding for women’s health programs through groups other than Planned Parenthood. Tarkanian hasn’t avoided using abortion as an issue in earlier campaigns — he ran radio ads attacking a Republican primary opponent in 2009 for allegedly flip-flopping on the issue. Our ruling Rosen said Tarkanian ""wants to defund Planned Parenthood and would outlaw a woman's right to choose, even in cases of rape or incest."" Tarkanian is ardently pro-life and has consistently said on multiple occasions he’d support defunding Planned Parenthood and only supports allowing abortion access if continuing the pregnancy would threaten the mother’s life.

Candidate for district attorney doesn't say she worked as a prosecutor, but radio ad says she did
","A third-party radio ad supporting Verona Swanigan, a lawyer who is trying to unseat 10-year Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, claims Swanigan ""has worked as a prosecutor.""  That would be a key credential, given that Swanigan is trying to become the county’s top prosecutor by winning the two-way Democratic primary on Aug. 9, 2016. No Republican is running. But although she worked with prosecutors in the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office in California, even Swanigan doesn’t say she worked as a prosecutor. Neither does the office. What the ad says The ad is sponsored by Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance, which the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has described as a secretive group led by longtime conservative political operative Craig Peterson. In the April 2016 City of Milwaukee elections, the group ran attack ads against Mayor Tom Barrett, who easily won re-election, and backed the opponents of at least two Milwaukee aldermen, both of whom were re-elected.  Swanigan’s latest campaign finance report, filed in July 2016, says Peterson printed $476 worth of campaign brochures for her. Her previous report says Peterson contributed $250 to her campaign and provided $1,681 in printing and food and beverages for a Swanigan fundraiser. The ad makes several attacks on Chisholm before making the claim we’re checking. It was included in this section: ""Verona Swanigan is licensed to practice law in five states, holds a master’s degree in forensic psychology, has worked as a prosecutor, and a probation and parole officer, and she is the daughter of a 32-year veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department. She has never lost a trial. The current DA has never even taken a bar exam."" (The Journal Sentinel reported that in the only Wisconsin felony case Swanigan ever tried, a jury found her client not guilty of sexual assault of a child. As for the allusion to Chisholm, graduates of the University of Wisconsin Law School and Marquette University Law School do not have to take the bar exam to practice law in Wisconsin. Chisholm is a UW law graduate.) As for the claim we’re checking, Peterson told us that while employed by the Fresno DA, Swanigan ""filed cases, extradition motions and documentation,"" and made court appearances, which sounds like some of the things prosecutors do. What they say Fresno County Assistant District Attorney Steve Wright told us Swanigan was classified as a legal assistant/paralegal when she worked in the office from March to December 2006. He said he did not know her job duties, but that she was not a sworn prosecutor. Swanigan had earned her law degree from Northern Illinois University in 2005, but hadn’t yet passed the California bar exam when she was hired in Fresno. She said that under the program she worked in, she filed criminal complaints, although they were done in the name of a sworn prosecutor; and made court appearances on her own, though under the supervision of a prosecutor. Unlike Peterson, Swanigan said she would not call herself a former prosecutor. ""I personally would not describe it that way,"" Swanigan told us, referring to the ad. ""He could make a legal argument for it to be described that way, but I would not."" Indeed, the biographical section of Swanigan’s campaign website says she worked at the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office, but no position is listed. Our rating Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance says in a radio ad that Swanigan ""has worked as a prosecutor."" Swanigan made court appearances and assisted prosecutors in other ways when she worked in the the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office in California.

Trump falsely accuses Colorado fire marshal of ‘incompetence’ over crowd restrictions
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blasted fire marshals across the country over crowd-size restrictions at venues, including accusing marshals in Colorado and Ohio of incompetence or political skulduggery within three days. The latest fireworks began July 29, at Trump’s rally at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs. The billionaire real estate developer entered the Gallogly Events Center to a cheering crowd. But he quickly launched into an attack on Colorado Springs Fire Marshal Brett Lacey. ""This is why our country doesn't work,"" Trump said. ""We have thousands of people in (an overflow) room next door. We have plenty of space here. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. And we have a fire marshal that said, 'Oh we can't allow more people.' ... And the reason they won't let them in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing."" Trump continued to blame the fire marshal for the ""disgraceful situation"" during his one-hour address. He decried Lacey’s ""incompetence,"" saying ""he's probably a Democrat"" and ""maybe they're a Hillary person."" Our research shows Trump is wrong on several counts. Public records show Lacey is a registered Republican, and fire officials were following standard guidelines for crowd limits. Standing room Trump’s account of what went wrong at the rally and who was to blame is questionable. There were 1,100 people -- not ""thousands"" as he said -- in the overflow room who watched his speech on a TV screen. There was a line of people left outside, but it’s unclear if included ""thousands of people,"" as he said. What about Trump’s claim that ""We have plenty of space here,"" to let more people into the events center?   Colorado Springs Fire Department spokesman Steve Wilch told PolitiFact the Trump campaign was aware a day before the rally that Lacey, the fire marshal, had limited the events center to 1,500 spectators and the overflow room to 1,000 spectators.   UCCS Chancellor Pam Shockley-Zalabak told the Colorado Springs Gazette, ""The campaign handled all the ticketing and more tickets were issued than the space available."" PolitiFact requested comment from the Trump campaign but received no reply. In an interview after the rally, Lacey told PolitiFact partner Denver7 that he based his crowd restrictions on a Thursday walk through of the event center and the overflow room, where he double-checked the exits, the size of the space and potential obstructions like crowd-control barriers, the stage and platforms for news cameras. Lacey also reviewed the original construction design plans for the building, which had passed international fire and building codes. These plans include a ""life-safety sheet,"" detailing the building’s intended use, square footage, capacity and exits. The fire code, which most fire agencies rely on, is ""based on the premise that every space can hold a certain number of people based on the square footage, and then based on the number of people we're going to provide the proper number of exits,"" Boulder Chief Fire Marshal Dave  Lowrey told PolitiFact. What the building is used for is key to determining space requirements known as the ""occupant load factor."" Restaurants are required to provide 15 square feet per person, because they have tables and chairs that people need to get around while fleeing an emergency, Lowrey said. At a political rally, where people are sitting on folding chairs, the code requires 7 square feet per person. If it’s standing-room-only, the requirement is 5 square feet per person. Emergency exits are a key ‘life-safety factor’ But the most important ""life-safety factor"" is the number of exits. ""If you can't get out of building in an emergency, well, you're in a whole a lot of trouble,"" Lowrey said. ""Every large, tragic indoor fire has probably been contributed to somehow by overcrowding, and blocked exits or locked doors."" Lacey said he worked closely with the Secret Service, police and UCCS officials as he made his decision about the right ""occupant loads"" for the venues. These officials weren’t the only ones who agreed to the fire marshal’s decisions on crowd restrictions.   Three days before the rally, Trump campaign treasurer, Timothy Jost, and UCCS officials signed a ""Facility Usage License Agreement."" The contract stated that the campaign ""shall comply with...all other rules and regulations prescribed by the Fire and Police Departments and other governmental authorities, as may be in force and effect during the terms of this Agreement.""   So the Trump campaign had agreed to comply with the fire department’s safety requirements days before the candidate blew up at the fire marshal. Earlier Friday afternoon, Lacey received a call from the police command center that there was a request to allow more people into the rally. After conferring with security officials and an on-site fire battalion chief, Lacey said he was comfortable with a 10 percent increase in the events center crowd (to 1,650) and the overflow room (to 1,100). Denver7 asked Lacey about Trump’s assertions that he was a disgrace and ""probably a Democrat."" ""Absolutely not,"" the fire marshal replied. ""Anytime that any of the members of the Colorado Springs Fire Department are working, the politics or policies like that are not on our agenda. We're here for public safety and making certain our community is safe from harm."" ""If the event planners wanted to have more people inside, we have a number of venues here in the Colorado Springs area that they could have secured,"" Lacey added. ""But this is the event (venue) that they chose."" While fire marshals wrestle with these life-or-death decisions, they’ve also had Trump publicly berating them in at least four states. In Ohio on Monday, Trump pulled aside reporters before a rally at the Greater Columbus Convention Center to rail against another fire marshal’s crowd restrictions. ""For political reasons, purely for political reasons, they said in this massive building, you're not allowed to have any more than 1,000 people, and that's nonsense. We could've had 4, 5, 6,000 people -- they've all be turned away… It's a disgrace,"" Trump said in a video that New York Times reporter Nick Corasaniti posted in Twitter. ""The fire marshal said he's not allowed to allow any more, even though the building handles many thousands of people. I just want to tell you that's politics at its lowest. You ought to check it out, but it’s really politics at its lowest."" PolitiFact did check it out and obtained documents from the Greater Columbus Convention Center that contradicted Trump's claims that his campaign was blindsided by the crowd restrictions. The center’s ""event acknowledgement"" document, containing the name and contact information for Trump campaign official John Hiller, stated the maximum event capacity was ""800+ media (not to exceed 1,000 per Fire marshal and contract)."" The document states ""This event is by invitation"" and it was ""Fire marshal approved."" The venue license contract was signed July 29 -- three full days before the event -- by Jost, the campaign treasurer, and the convention center general manager. Columbus Fire Department spokesman Steve Martin told the New York Times that Trump's accusations of politics were ""completely false."" Trump’s ‘battle with America’s firefighters’ What Politico calls the GOP nominee’s ""battle with America’s firefighters"" has been going on for more than a year. At a February rally at Madison City Stadium in Alabama, Trump twice complained that a fire marshal had shut the gates when the candidate claimed 32,000 were trying to hear him speak, according to AL.com. ""Let them come in, Mr. Fire Marshal,"" Trump urged from the stage. The news website said estimates placed the rally at more than 10,000 people. Then in Phoenix last summer, Trump did an about-face, saying city officials ""broke the fire code"" by allowing too many people into the convention center room where he was speaking. ""Convention Center officials in Phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room,"" Trump tweeted in July 2015. But the Phoenix Fire Department told ABC15 its officials limited the room to 4,200 people and closed the doors once that capacity was reached. ""No rules or codes were broken,"" Deputy Chief Shelly Jamison said. Back in Colorado, other fire marshals are praising Lacey for handling the Trump rally dispute with dispassionate professionalism. ""That's what Brett, the fire marshal in Colorado Springs, was trying to ensure -- the safety of the people in there. I don't want to over-crowd. If something does happen, I want to make sure people can get out,"" said Lowery, the Boulder fire marshal. Our ruling Trump claimed, ""We have a fire marshal that said, 'Oh we can't allow more people’....And the reason they won't let them in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing."" The Colorado Springs fire marshal laid out a clear explanation of how he set the crowd capacity based on fire codes and the professional calculus of how many people can swiftly and safely be evacuated if an emergency occurs. A Trump campaign official signed a contract agreeing to comply with the fire department’s rules and the campaign was notified of the crowd limits a day before the event. In at least four states, the Republican nominee has accused fire marshals of incompetence or political favoritism during crowd-capacity disputes. But documents often show high-ranking campaign officials agreed to the restrictions in writing ahead of time.

Evidence is not mounting that doctors are trying to kill Trump
","If President Donald Trump dies, a narrator warns in an Infowars video being shared widely on Facebook, the ""corrupt establishment could claim total victory, lock down the entire country, start going after the patriots, and destroy whatever’s left of our birth right.""  But the video isn’t speculating about what would happen if Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis is fatal. Rather, Alex Jones, who created the Infowars website, appears on camera to make the unfounded allegation that the president is being assassinated.   ""President Trump is being given very dangerous experimental drugs that no one has ever been given together,"" Jones says in the video. ""President Trump is in great danger. Evidence is mounting that he’s being deliberately killed at Walter Reed Military Hospital."" He goes on to claim that the ""facts are overwhelming."" ""Either the doctors at Walter Reed Medical Facility in DC are trying to kill President Trump,"" he says, ""or they are the most inept idiots in the medical field that modern history has ever seen."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Trump has been treated aggressively, but there’s zero evidence that doctors are trying to kill him. Here’s what we know about the president’s medical care since news broke that he tested positive for COVID-19.  On Oct. 2, before he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, he was given an experimental antibody drug at the request of his physician, Dr. Sean Conley. It was given under ""compassionate use"" provisions, when an experimental medicine can be tapped on an emergency basis, the Associated Press reported. The drug, made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is considered a promising approach to preventing serious illness from COVID-19 but it’s still in late-stage testing and its safety and effectiveness are not known.  At the medical center that day, Conley said that Trump had received remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug shown to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster. Trump was later given a steroid called dexamethasone, which has been shown to help very sick COVID-19 patients but could be dangerous if administered early after the onset of the disease. In addition to those drugs, Conley said that the president was also taking zinc, vitamin D, an antacid called famotidine, melatonin and aspirin.  While there is nothing to suggest that the president is receiving these drugs and vitamins because medical professionals are trying to kill him, some doctors and researchers have questioned his care and expressed concerns that too many people involved could result in overtreatment, USA Today reported. ""Excessive care isn’t necessarily good quality care,"" Dr. J. Randall Curtis, a University of Washington professor of pulmonary and critical care, said in the story.    Alden Landry, an emergency medicine physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told USA Today that it’s ""interesting and a bit concerning that they are trying so many therapies that are both experimental and unproven."" ""They’re pulling out all the stops,"" Dr. Eric Topol of the Scripps Research Translational Institute told USA Today. ""You just don’t know whether it’s because of the VIP syndrome — doing too much — or whether he’s started to show some signs that it’s taking a toll on his body.""  Several of the doctors USA Today interviewed supported the decision to try both the experimental antibody drug and remdesivir, according to the story, though the doctors also said they’ve never been studied in combination.  Conley, meanwhile, has said that doctors are using a ""multi-prong approach"" to treat the president.  ""He is receiving all of the standard of care for routine, international COVID protocols,"" Conley said. ""If there was any possibility that it would add value to his care and expedite his return, I wanted to take it."" Some experts have wondered whether the president is directing his own care, according to the New York Times, and if he is the one demanding intense treatment in spite of potential risks.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that though he hasn’t been involved in Trump’s direct care, Conley among others treating the president ""are very good physicians and they’re very qualified, so I’m really confident that the president of the United States is getting the optimal care that you can get with the team over at Walter Reed."" There are several guiding principles in the American Medical Association’s Code of Medical Ethics that conflict with a plot to kill the president. ""A physician shall, while caring for a patient, regard responsibility to the patient as paramount,"" for example. Also: ""A physician shall respect the law."" And the law does not look kindly on anyone trying to assassinate a president, whether they’re a doctor or not. Anyone who deliberately kills the president faces a murder charge punishable by death or life imprisonment.  Alex Jones and Infowars regularly share unfounded conspiracy theories. In 2018, several social media platforms including Facebook pulled or suspended their accounts for violating hate speech policies.  A Facebook group supportive of Trump shared this particular Facebook video. But there is nothing to substantiate the claim that Trump is being ""deliberately killed.""

Did Nick Freitas vote against job protections for pregnant workers?
","A large union is claiming Nick Freitas, the Republican candidate for the 7th Congressional District seat, has turned his back on working pregnant women. ""He voted to let businesses discriminate and fire expecting mothers for no other reason but their pregnancy,"" says a TV ad by the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters Vote! PAC.     The ad began airing Sept. 15. It shows a doleful pregnant woman, who seemingly worked at a convenience store, hanging up her apron, dropping her name badge in a trash can, and walking out into the rain. We fact checked the ad’s statement. The PAC says it’s based on Freitas’ vote on March 3 against successful legislation that gives job protections to pregnant women and new mothers working for small companies. The bill - now law - bans the small companies from firing, denying promotion or otherwise discriminating against an employee solely because she is pregnant or has a condition related to her pregnancy. It requires employers to make ""reasonable accommodations"" for the worker, including seating, light duty assignments, leave to recover from childbirth, and a private place other than a bathroom to pump breast milk. Violators can be sued. The bill passed the Senate unanimously. It cleared the House on a largely partisan vote. Although Republicans did not debate the bill or express objections, 38 of 45 GOP delegates - including Freitas - quietly voted against it. After the ad hit TV, Freitas explained his vote during a Sept. 22 podcast. He said the bill was superfluous because federal law already protects pregnant workers from job discrimination. ""It’s already a law; you can’t fire someone because they are or can become pregnant. That’s sufficient,"" he said. ""Democrats were adding all this additional bureaucracy and all these rules on top of that."" Freitas said he was concerned that the additional laws might discourage employers from hiring women. ""I don’t want to put women at a competitive disadvantage,"" said Freitas, who noted he was mostly reared by a single mother. ""I want them to have these opportunities."" Freitas is inaccurate, however, in saying the new state law merely bans what was already illegal. Federal law protects women against ""pregnancy-based discrimination and harassment at work"" only if they have jobs at companies with 15 or more employees. Virginia’s law offers protections to an additional group of women - those working at companies with 6-14 employees. The group covered by the new state law is relatively small, but statistics are not available to exactly define it. The closest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 14.9% of all Virginia workers in March were employed by companies with 5-19 employees. The data is not broken down by sex, age or the smaller 6-14 employee range covered by the law. Our ruling   The United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters PAC says in a TV ad that Freitas ""voted to let businesses discriminate and fire expecting mothers for no other reason but their pregnancy. "" Freitas voted against a bill - now a law - to bar small companies from firing or discriminating against an employee because she is pregnant or has a condition related to her pregnancy. But this was not a sweeping bill as the ad suggests by offering no other details. The legislation protects pregnant workers at companies with 6-14 employees. The vast majority of women work for companies with 15 or more employees and were already protected by federal law.  So the ad claim is accurate, but needs elaboration.

"['Elections', 'Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Coalition to Stop the Proposed Tax Hike Amendment']","
Will large and small Illinois businesses pay more under the graduated tax plan?
","An ad from a group opposing a constitutional amendment to change the way Illinois taxes income warns voters the proposal would hit large and small businesses alike. ""If approved, it would let the politicians immediately implement their plan to increase taxes on small businesses, farmers and large employers,"" the narrator says in an ad from the Coalition to Stop the Proposed Tax Hike Amendment. Currently, Illinois taxes all individual income at a flat rate of 4.95%. The amendment’s approval would allow a new graduated rate structure to take effect in 2021, raising taxes for those earning more than $250,000. Corporations that do business in Illinois would also see their flat-rate income tax rate increase from 7% to 7.99% under the plan. But most businesses, especially small ones, don’t pay the corporate tax. Instead, they operate as pass-through entities, which means their profits flow directly to the people who own them and get taxed as individual income. Just 3% of Illinois taxpayers overall earn enough to see an increase under the plan, according to the Illinois Department of Revenue. We wondered how different the picture could be for small businesses and their owners. Based on the way the tax plan is written, the ad is correct that corporations and at least some small businesses operating as pass-through entities would be affected, said Carol Portman, president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers’ Federation of Illinois. ""But who exactly is going to be impacted by that tax increase is where the rub is,"" Portman said. ""It's not an across the board increase on all small businesses. It's not an across the board increase on all farmers."" Publicly available federal data isn’t specific enough to show how many small businesses would be affected, experts said. And state data analyzed by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration has its own limitations. The data does suggest only a small share of Illinois’ 1.2 million small businesses would be affected by the tax plan, for the same reason most individuals wouldn’t see an increase: only those earning more than $250,000 would pay the plan’s higher rates. That’s 189,000 taxpayers overall, according to state data published by the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, which supports the plan.  A spokeswoman for the coalition pointed to individual income tax data from the Internal Revenue Service for upper-income tax returns reporting different kinds of business income. ""Based on IRS data, there are more than 100,000 small businesses in our state, including sole proprietorships, partnerships and S Corporations, that would be impacted by the proposed rates,"" spokeswoman Lissa Druss wrote in an email. Druss explained the coalition reached that figure by adding up the number of upper-income tax returns for different categories of pass-through income, then making reductions to account for data limitations. For instance, the IRS doesn’t have an income bracket beginning at $250,000. Instead, its upper-income brackets begin at $200,000, which makes it difficult to determine which taxpayers would be affected. Experts suggested an even bigger problem with the published IRS data. ""The table doesn’t tell you anything about small businesses,"" said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former director of research at the IRS. ""It tells you about the number of tax filers who have some business income."" The dataset doesn’t show how many separate filers have income from the same business, from how many separate businesses individual filers are drawing income, or how much of those filers’ income is coming from other sources such as wages, Toder said. Filers may also have multiple kinds of business income, so adding up the categories risks counting the same taxpayer twice. Pritzker has led the push to switch Illinois to a graduated income tax. So we also reached out to his administration to ask for its numbers. Cameron Mock, chief of staff for the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget, shared an analysis he conducted for the governor’s team based on 2016 data from the state’s Department of Revenue. That analysis estimated at least 95% of small businesses in the state will see no increase under the plan based on the number of them reporting less than $250,000 in net income, along with an assumption that a small share of owners whose businesses net less still make enough from other sources to push them over that threshold. But here too the numbers are not an exact match. Mock only counted the nearly half million Illinois businesses that file with the state as either partnerships or S-Corporations, which are businesses that pass along their incomes — and most of their tax bills — to shareholders. He did not count sole proprietors, because the state does not have data identifying them. S-corporations and partnerships may also have multiple owners splitting up the profits, but the analysis assumed just one individual was paying taxes for each because state data does not show how many separate taxpayers derive income from them, Mock said. J. Fred Giertz, an economist with the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, said the fact small business income is largely taxed at the individual level means it doesn’t matter that available data can’t tell us exactly how many would be affected. ""There's no particular reason why you should say, ‘I really feel sorry for the small business owner who's making a million dollars but I don't feel sorry for the opthamologist or the corporate lawyer who's making the same amount of money,’"" Giertz said. ""If you think the tax is good then they should be paying the tax. If you don't think that people above $250,000 should be paying the higher tax, it should not apply to anyone."" The coalition’s ad says approving the amendment ""would let the politicians immediately implement their plan to increase taxes on small businesses, farmers and large employers."" Corporations will see an increase in their flat-rate income tax under the plan that takes effect if the amendment is approved. But only a wealthy subset of small businesses, which generally pass their profits to shareholders, would be affected — and data suggests that portion would be small. We rate this claim Half True.

(Screenshot from Facebook) All of the posts were published by people who have promoted QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that says Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles. QAnon supporters have claimed that Trump’s hospitalization at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is actually a cover for mass arrests and executions of his political foes. There is no evidence that’s the case — and the Facebook posts are wrong to say that Trump is on Air Force One instead of staying at Walter Reed. The posts rely on a mix of screenshots from QAnon accounts, photos of Trump and posts from Q, the anonymous internet persona behind the conspiracy theory. None of it proves Trump is on Air Force One. We reached out to the original poster for additional evidence, but we didn’t hear back. How do we know Trump is at Walter Reed? Here’s a rough timeline of the president’s status over the past few days. On Oct. 2, Trump posted a video on Twitter shortly before departing the White House on Marine One. There is footage and photo evidence of him both leaving the White House and arriving at Walter Reed. On Oct. 3, Trump’s medical team held a press conference on the president’s condition outside the hospital. Later in the day, Trump posted another video on Twitter thanking the healthcare workers at Walter Reed. The White House also released two photos that show Trump looking at documents or signing a piece of paper in the presidential suite at Walter Reed. RELATED: Fact-checking misinformation about Trump, COVID-19 On Oct. 4, Trump’s medical team gave another update on his condition outside the hospital. Dr. Brian Garibaldi, a pulmonary physician, said the president could be discharged as soon as Monday. A reporter for New York Magazine, Yashar Ali, debunked the claim that Trump wasn’t really at Walter Reed. Tweeting a version of the Trump video, he wrote: ""I can't believe some of you conspiracy theorists are forcing me to do this, but a former USSS (Secret Service) agent who was on President Obama's detail has confirmed to me that this is indeed the larger office inside METU (Medical Evaluation & Treatment Unit) at Walter Reed."" There is also no evidence that Trump is faking his illness. That unfounded theory is outweighed by the significant amount of evidence showing that Trump does, in fact, have COVID-19.

Biden isn’t in the basement, but the Trump campaign keeps saying so
","Even with President Donald Trump hospitalized after contracting the coronavirus, Trump’s top allies continue to paint a picture of Trump hard at work for the American people while Democratic rival Joe Biden dawdles in his basement. On Saturday Oct. 3, Trump’s daughter Ivanka shared a picture of Trump working a conference table at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with the caption, ""Nothing can stop him from working for the American people. RELENTLESS!"" (The photos don’t show what Trump was signing.) On Sunday, top Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump was doing well and that the president and his campaign have taken COVID-19 seriously. But, Miller also noted, the president needed to continue advocating for and working on behalf of the American people. Contrast that with Biden, Miller told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. ""We’ve seen with Joe Biden, I mean, we can’t all stay in our basement for the rest of our lives,"" Miller said. It’s one of Trump’s favorite attacks against Biden. It’s also, by any objective measure, wrong. Before his coronavirus diagnosis, Trump made the basement attack a routine part of his campaign speech. ""I got a guy who stays in his damn basement all day long and I'm doing this,""  Trump said at a Virginia rally Sept. 25. ""Where's Hunter? You know where he is? Yeah. He's in the basement with his father,"" Trump said, talking about Biden’s son Hunter on Sept. 21 in Ohio. ""I've been in so many states the last few days. Yeah. Well you need a lot of energy to do this job properly. You can't be sitting in your basement for four days and come out,"" Trump said Sept. 14 in Arizona. ""He's in his basement right now, and he's saying, ‘What do I do?’ He calls his handlers, ‘What do I do about this?’ He hasn't left in two and a half days,"" said Trump Sept. 13 in Las Vegas. ""He's in his damn basement again. No, he's in his basement. He's in his basement,"" Trump said Sept. 12 in Nevada. In the first months of the pandemic, when many states employed significant restrictions, Biden ran much of his campaign from his Delaware home. He built a TV set in his basement to interact with voters virtually. Not all those interactions went smoothly.  Trump also suspended in-person campaigning from March 2 through June 20, when he held an indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla. But the claim that Biden stays in his basement is easily refuted. Let’s look at Biden’s events in September as an example. (All links go to the C-SPAN video so you can watch the event for yourself.)

(AP) Sept. 18: Biden delivered remarks at a campaign trip to Duluth, Minn.  Sept. 20: Speaking from Philadelphia’s National Constitution Center, Biden gave a speech about Trump’s plan to nominate someone to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the election.  Sept. 23: Biden appeared at the Black Economic Summit in Charlotte, N.C. Sept. 27: Biden delivered brief remarks in Wilmington, Del., responding to Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.  Sept. 30: Biden spoke about his plans for the economy at campaign stops In Ohio and Pennsylvania. The event was part of his ""Build Back Better Express Tour."" That’s at least 14 public events not in Biden’s basement in September. He made trips to seven states: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. Biden did address the Poor People’s Campaign virtually from his basement on Sept. 14. The Trump campaign cited as evidence comments Biden made that he would be willing shut down the economy if scientists advised him it was necessary to protect Americans from the coronavirus. Biden later clarified that in his view there would be no need to close the entire U.S. economy. Miller said, ""We’ve seen with Joe Biden, I mean, we can’t all stay in our basement for the rest of our lives.""  It’s the same criticism used by Trump to attack his rival as incapable and sleepy. It’s also wrong. We counted at least 14 different events outside Biden’s Delaware home in September, in six different states. We rate this claim False.

"['Vermont', 'Phil Scott']","
Would Zuckerman’s wealth tax extend to a family earning $159,000?
","Gov. Phil Scott came out firing when the issue of Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman’s proposed wealth tax came up during a debate Tuesday.  Zuckerman touted his plan to raise a tax on the wealthiest 5% for revenue to build out broadband and fund climate change initiatives like home weatherization.  Scott, who has opposed new tax increases, criticized the plan, arguing that it would impact middle class families, in addition to wealthy residents.   ""That 5% starts at $159,000 per family,"" Scott said. ""So we’re not talking about a grand amount of money here. Think about two teachers, married teachers. The tax proposal that I’m hearing from David is that it’s going to impact them.""  Zuckerman has said the tax would target the high-income earners who benefited from the federal tax cuts Trump instituted in 2017. Zuckerman hasn’t proposed a specific rate, but his campaign says the tax would raise $100 million. We’re certain that not all two-teacher households are making $159,000. But setting that anecdote aside, Scott’s income bracket didn’t square up with what Zuckerman and other Progressive and Democratic lawmakers have been saying about the proposed wealth tax, when discussing initiatives like the Green New Deal. So VTDigger decided to find out who, exactly, would be impacted by a tax on Vermont’s top 5% of earners.  After the debate, Colleen Jackson, a spokesperson for Zuckerman, disputed Scott’s numbers and told VTDigger the top 5% of earners start at households earning $294,000 per year. She pointed to a document from the Joint Fiscal Office to support that claim. Jason Maulucci, Scott’s campaign manager, said the governor was citing an analysis by the Vermont Department of Taxes, in response to legislation, S.311, that proposes a wealth tax. It was sponsored by Sen. Anthony Pollina, P/D-Washington, and co-sponsored by 13 other senators.  The Tax Department found the top 5% starts at $159,000 in taxable income, according to its 2018 data. Pollina’s bill would place a 1.6% income tax surcharge on Vermonters making between $200,000 and $500,000. For people making more than $500,000, the tax rate would go up an additional 0.15%. This would mean that someone making about $500,000 a year would pay about $3,000 more in state income taxes under the proposal, which would raise about $30 million annually. The decision to begin the tax on people with an adjusted gross income of $200,000 and up is based on an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-partisan think tank. Using estimates of Vermont’s 2018 tax data, ITEP reported that the top 5% begins with people who are making between $215,000 and $517,790. The average income of this group, ITEP, is $294,600 — incredibly close to what the Zuckerman campaign said the top 5% begins. Graham Campbell, the member of the Joint Fiscal Office who summarized the ITEP report in late 2019 for Pollina, reviewed the data and said the institute’s ""percentile breakdowns are likely not as exact as the Tax Department’s."" Scott said ""that 5% starts at $159,000 per family"" when referring to his opponent’s proposed tax on the wealthiest Vermonters.  The Department of Taxes reports that filers with $159,000 in adjusted gross income would indeed be included in Vermont’s wealthiest 5%. While the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy’s analysis shows that 5% would encompass people making $215,000 or more, closer to Zuckerman’s projection, the Department of Taxes’ data is a more accurate reflection of who the current proposal would impact. We rate Scott’s statement True.  Editor’s note: The headline on this article was changed after publication to better reflect the statement being fact-checked.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC81CD80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/04/phil-scott/would-zuckermans-wealth-tax-top-5-impact-middle-cl/

Trump did not board Marine One with a portable oxygen concentrator
","In one photo, President Donald Trump’s right blazer pocket is circled in red. In another, an arrow points to his ear. A final photo shows Trump’s back circled in yellow. ""Did Trump board Marine One with a portable oxygen concentrator in his pocket with the nasal cannula going up his back, hidden in his hair and tucked under his mask?"" wrote a Facebook user in an Oct. 3 post. A day before that post, Trump took a helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ""out of an abundance of caution"" after he announced he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus. Conjecture and misinformation about the president’s condition took off on Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and Facebook. Several posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screenshot from Facebook) There is a lot of confusion surrounding Trump’s use of supplemental oxygen to treat his COVID-19 symptoms. But is there any evidence that the president boarded Marine One with a ""portable oxygen concentrator?""  No — multiple fact-checkers have debunked the conspiracy theory, and video evidence refutes it. We reached out to the original poster for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. The confusion stems from the Trump administration’s shifting timeline for when the president first tested positive for the coronavirus and whether he was administered supplemental oxygen.  Dr. Sean Conley, the White House physician, originally declined to say whether he had given Trump oxygen. But on Oct. 3, Conley told reporters that Trump was ""fever-free and off supplemental oxygen."" Several news outlets have since reported that Trump was given oxygen on the morning of Oct. 2 — before he left for Walter Reed.  ""Yesterday morning we were real concerned with that,"" said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in an interview with Fox News on Oct. 3. ""He had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly."" But that doesn’t mean Trump had a portable oxygen concentrator when he boarded Marine One. The source of the viral claim appears to be a now-suspended Twitter account that published the photos of Trump walking to Marine One on Oct. 2. The post was shared thousands of times before Twitter suspended the account for violating its rules. Other angles of Trump’s walk from the White House to Marine One don’t support the conspiracy theory. Take a closer look at the footage: There does not appear to be anything in the right pocket of Trump’s blazer. And there are no tubes running up the president’s back to his nose. If he did use a portable oxygen concentrator, you’d be able to see tubes behind Trump’s ears or across his face.

Examining Cornyn's record on Dreamer legalization
","U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, released a Spanish-language campaign advertisement in September that says the senator ""fights for all Texans,"" including immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, known as Dreamers. The 30-second ad began airing in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and the Rio Grande Valley on Sept 12. In it, a voice-over describes the senator’s position on Dreamers. ""While Senator Cornyn is for secure borders, he strongly supports legalization for Dreamers,"" the Spanish-speaking narrator says. There’s no doubt that Cornyn has voiced his support over the years for protecting young Dreamers from deportation. ""In America, we don’t hold children responsible for the mistakes their parents made,"" Cornyn has said. And his aides point to numerous occasions when he has cast votes on bills designed to provide Dreamers a path to citizenship. Nonetheless, immigrant advocates and Cornyn’s Democratic detractors are quick to highlight other occasions when legislation with Dreamer protections was scuttled or opposed by the senator. A clear picture of Cornyn’s voting record on Dreamers, however, is tangled in the messy politics of immigration reform. We were curious about Cornyn’s record. We found the issue goes back to Cornyn’s early days in the Senate. A mixed record The most popular form of legislation aimed at granting conditional permanent resident status to young immigrants was introduced in 2001, known as the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or DREAM Act. In 2003, during his first year in the Senate, Cornyn and a majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a version of the act. But the bill went no further. It’s at that point where Cornyn’s voting record on the DREAM Act and Dreamers becomes more mixed. In 2007, another version of the act was derailed after Cornyn and a majority of senators supported a procedural move that defeated it. In 2013, Cornyn opposed a broad-based immigration reform bill crafted by a bipartisan group of senators that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for 11 million immigrants living in the country without authorization, including Dreamers. Cornyn said at the time he opposed the bill because it lacked border security components. In 2018, during the latest congressional showdown over funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall, Cornyn cosponsored the Trump-backed Secure and Succeed Act while opposing a bill backed by a bipartisan group of senators known as the Common Sense Coalition. Both efforts would have offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers and allocated $25 billion for a southern border wall, but the bills differed in other ways. The Secure and Succeed Act would have canceled the Diversity Visa Program, which awards green cards via a lottery, and limited family-based immigration to spouses and unmarried children under 18. According to the libertarian Cato Institute, these moves would have reduced legal immigration by 44%. The bipartisan ""Common Sense"" plan would have prohibited parents from using their Dreamer children’s newly granted citizenship to apply for citizenship themselves, according to a bill description on Sen. Susan Collins’ website. Neither bill was successful. Cornyn’s voting record on the DREAM Act, however, is not the only metric by which his support for Dreamers should be measured, said Cornyn’s spokesman Drew Brandewie. And Brandewie pointed to numerous occasions when the senator has expressed his support for Dreamers. ""I am sympathetic to their plight,"" Cornyn said in 2019, ""and I want to work to find a solution that would allow them to become American citizens."" The language used in the advertisement — that the senator ""strongly supports legalization for Dreamers"" — should be interpreted narrowly so as not to include his position on the DREAM Act itself, Brandewie said. For example, in 2017 Cornyn was part of a bipartisan working group that sought a solution for Dreamers after the Trump administration signaled its intent to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — a move that has been held up in the courts. In 2018, Cornyn criticized a lawsuit that Texas and six other states filed to end DACA. Cornyn said the suit provided no solution and that the state needs the ""pool of very productive, good young people"" being protected by DACA from deportation. ""One can support legalization without supporting or voting for the DREAM act,"" Brandewie said. But to Frank Sharry, executive director of the progressive immigrant advocacy group America’s Voice, making a distinction between supporting the DREAM Act and supporting Dreamers is splitting hairs. ""He technically can say he’s voted for the DREAM Act, but it’s his opposition that’s the major feature of his career,"" Sharry said. Cornyn’s ad is ""hoodwinking Latino voters into thinking he’s for a priority in that community when he spent the last 15 years undermining it,"" Sharry said. Cornyn said during an interview Tuesday with the American-Statesman's editorial board that the stalemate on Dreamers and the tendency for bills to get packaged with other items ""is probably my single greatest frustration and disappointment."" ""It’s sort of like a Christmas tree. People keep adding different things to it and it almost always seems to collapse under its own weight,"" Cornyn said. The version of the DREAM Act currently before Congress could provide a pathway to citizenship for more than 2 million Dreamers. Cornyn opposes the legislation because it would give Dreamers access to federal student financial aid that's not available to citizens — a provision that Brandewie said is ""wholly unrelated"" to the legalization of Dreamers.  Our Ruling A Spanish-language advertisement from Cornyn’s campaign says that Cornyn ""strongly supports legalization for Dreamers."" It’s true that Cornyn’s voting history has supported the legalization of Dreamers, but there are also examples of his opposition to bills that package Dreamer protections with other items.

"['Vermont', 'David Zuckerman']","
Did the governor really suggest a 5% budget cut amid the pandemic?
","During a heated exchange over their competing financial philosophies, Gov. Phil Scott turned to Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman at a debate Tuesday and responded to a question about the many Democratic bills he has vetoed.  ""Your approach is just to tax people more,"" Scott said to Zuckerman.   Zuckerman repeatedly defended his plan for a tax on the top 5% of Vermont’s earners during the debate, and at one point accused Scott of swinging too far toward austerity amid the pandemic.  ""Our governor proposed initially a 5% cut across the board of state government which would have further injured and weakened our infrastructure for vulnerable Vermonters,"" Zuckerman said at the in-person debate in Waitsfield. Scott said that he wasn’t aware of the proposal that Zuckerman was talking about.  ""I would love to see the 5% reduction proposal you keep talking about that I proposed. Maybe you could provide that to me because I haven’t seen it,"" Scott said. This exchange had us wondering if Scott really proposed a 5% budget cut this year.  To back up Zuckerman’s claim, his campaign pointed to budget instructions that the state’s finance commissioner, Adam Greshin, sent to all state agencies and departments June 26, 2020.  The instructions asked agencies and departments to come up with proposals to cut spending by 5%, compared to the budget that the governor had proposed in January, before the Covid-19 pandemic set in.  The Covid-19 crisis strained tax revenues, and forced state officials and the Legislature to restart their budgeting process, eventually deciding to delay a full-year budget until the summer. In his June letter, Greshin said that less revenue meant that state government would need to tighten its belt to achieve a balanced budget. ""We expect to utilize a variety of other tools, including statewide policy changes, one-time revenue sources, and other savings opportunities. However, these statewide solutions will not be sufficient to get us to balance,"" Greshin wrote.  In July, the fiscal landscape changed when the Scott administration and lawmakers learned of an unexpected surplus of tax revenue that flooded state coffers after Vermonters filed their taxes. This gave the administration more leeway to build a budget without proposing as many cuts.   The budget that Scott ended up presenting to lawmakers in August proposed fiscal 2021 spending cuts of 3% across state government, on average — some departments saw higher reductions, and others saw lower.  In an interview Friday, Greshin said the budget instructions that the Zuckerman campaign referred to ""do not equal a budget proposal."" Those instructions are instead, an ""opening request"" to state agencies that the administration uses to inform its budget deliberations, he added.   ""The budget proposal is what the governor steps up to the microphone and delivers the third week of January, or in this case over the summer,"" Greshin said.   ""Budget instructions are not a proposal. That’s kind of like judging a marathon runner on the first five miles that he runs. His time is after 26 miles, not after five,"" he added.  ""So the question is, in difficult times, do we cut our way out and do austerity budgeting, which is shown to fail in Greece, it’s been shown to fail in this country,"" Zuckerman said.   ""And what do we do after recessions? What did we do after the Great Depression? We infuse money into the economy, we build infrastructure, and that’s what I’m looking forward to do,"" he said.  In August, the Scott administration stressed that the proposed budget cuts would not affect the state’s social welfare programs, such as Medicaid or food assistance. ""I would challenge him to point to one thing that would have affected a vulnerable Vermonter,"" Greshin said of Zuckerman.  However, when they passed a budget bill last month, lawmakers ended up reversing many of the cuts that the governor made, including reductions to the Vermont Humanities Council and Vermont Arts Council, and reductions in the Attorney General and Defender General offices.  In passing a partial budget bill to fund the first quarter of the current fiscal year, the Scott administration proposed a 2% spending cut — which, if it had been spread out over the entire year, would have amounted to an 8% reduction. However, the administration never proposed extending it any further. That 2% cut was also rejected by the House and Senate.  Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman said: ""Our governor proposed initially a 5% cut across the board of state government."" It’s true that the Scott administration was considering as much as a 5% cut before the revenue picture became rosier in July. But the budget cut Scott actually proposed was 3% for the full fiscal year.  We rate Zuckerman’s claim mostly false. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA26D40>],/factchecks/2020/oct/03/david-zuckerman/did-governor-really-suggest-5-budget-cut-amid-pand/

Fact-check: Why Barack Obama failed to fill over 100 judgeships
","President Donald Trump often celebrates the large number of judicial appointments he’s been able to make. Federal judges are lifelong appointments, and filling the district and circuit courts leaves a legacy that lasts well beyond any presidency. In the first debate, Trump faulted President Barack Obama for giving him a golden opportunity. ""I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and (Biden) left me 128 judges to fill,"" Trump said Sept. 29. ""You just don’t do that."" While Trump inflates the number, the bigger question is did Obama, and by extension Joe Biden, drop the ball on judicial appointments? There’s broad agreement that their problem was not a lack of trying, but the power of a Republican Senate to bottle up their nominees. ""Scholars have referred to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's actions during this time as a blockade of judicial appointments,"" said Michigan State political scientist Ian Ostrander. ""Very few judicial nominations were successful during the 114th Congress,""  Republicans won control of the Senate in 2014. From that point on, the numbers show how hard it was for Obama to seat the people he put forward. We don’t know where Trump got his figure of 128 vacancies, but it’s wrong. The accurate number is 105. That said, the fundamental point remains the same. Obama had a hard time getting judges confirmed. A key part of understanding judicial confirmations lies in the Senate. The Senate is the gatekeeper and, without its nod, no nomination goes through. The party that holds the Senate wields final control. During the two years before Republicans took the Senate, Obama had a confirmation success rate of nearly 90%. Afterward, the confirmation rate fell to 28%. It always makes a difference when the opposing party holds the Senate in the last two years of any presidency, but Brookings governance fellow Russell Wheeler wrote that Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush faced that situation, too, and still had much higher success rates. The Senate of 2015 and 2016 was nearly impenetrable. ""The 114th Senate both confirmed far fewer judges than its recent other-party predecessors and stopped confirming them at a much earlier point,"" Wheeler wrote. The trajectory of confirmations passed through three phases during the Obama years. In the first four years, while Democrats retained control, Republicans used the Senate rules to slow down the process. Sheldon Goldman, professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said geography played a big role. ""A large number of vacancies were from states with two Republican senators or one Republican and one Democrat,"" Goldman explained. ""Until McConnell and the Republicans upended the practice of senatorial courtesy, both senators had to sign off on the recommended judicial nominees. Republican senators did their best to delay the process. As we now know, that tactic of obstruct and delay was successful."" Not only could individual Republicans block nominees to courts in their states, there was always the threat of a filibuster. That lasted until 2013, when Democratic Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked what is called the ""nuclear option."" For district and circuit court appointments, debate was limited to 30 hours and after that, a simple majority would carry the day. The nuclear option opened up the second phase that lasted from 2013 to 2014, when nearly 90% of nominations sailed through. Even with that, Ostrander said there was only so much Democrats could do, because of the backlog created during the previous four years. The final phase came when Republicans won the Senate. The period wasn’t totally devoid of confirmations. But George Washington University’s Sarah Binder said those judges represented a modest victory for Obama. ""Keep in mind that Republican senators would have a decent degree of influence with the White House in recommending nominees for vacant judgeships in their red states,"" Binder said. We reached four experts in the politics of the federal judiciary. In one way or the other, they all agreed on the broad reason why Trump saw so many vacancies after he won. ""That Obama left office with so many unfilled vacancies was largely by design — by Mitch McConnell,"" said the University of Vermont’s Lisa Holmes. Trump said Obama did something wrong by leaving him 128 judgeships to fill. The actual number is 105, but the bigger flaw in Trump’s narrative is that it ignores the successful effort of Republicans to block the people Obama put forward. That effort was somewhat effective in Obama’s first term, and became a nearly impenetrable barrier during Obama’s last two years. We rate this claim Mostly False.

But Lorraine’s claim is wrong.  Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have not contracted the coronavirus. But the same could also be said for Republican leaders. Meanwhile, several Democratic mayors and governors have contracted the virus, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. NPR has been keeping tabs on specific members of Congress who have tested positive for the coronavirus or quarantined after being exposed to it. According to the list, three Republican senators and nine representatives have tested positive or were presumed to have the coronavirus since the pandemic began. That’s more than the Democrats, who have had no senators  and six representatives test positive for the virus. Polls suggest that Republicans are less likely than Democrats to view the coronavirus as a serious public health threat.

The post, which has echoes of a widely debunked conspiracy theory known as QAnon, paints a distorted picture of both Biden, now the Democratic presidential nominee, and the president he is seeking to unseat on Nov. 3. The claims that President Barack Obama and Vice President Biden — now the Democratic presidential nominee — allowed grown men into restrooms with young girls appears to stem from an accusation Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made after the Obama administration issued guidance to schools about civil rights protections for transgender students. A May 2016 letter to schools from the Justice and Education departments said that schools were not allowed to force students to use facilities that aligned with their sex assigned at birth: ""A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity. A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so."" The requirement prompted a lawsuit, and the debate about which bathrooms transgender individuals should be allowed to use emerged as a talking point during the 2016 presidential campaign. Cruz, a Republican who ran against Trump for the presidential nomination in 2016, claimed the Obama-era rule required schools to ""allow grown men and boys into little girls’ bathrooms."" We rated Cruz’s claim Mostly False as the guidance was related to students, not adults. Once in office, Trump’s administration rescinded the guidance, saying the issue was best resolved ""at the state and local level."" Biden has pledged to reinstate the guidance if elected. Nevertheless, the Obama-era rule that required schools to allow students to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender identity applied to students. But the guidance said nothing about adult men, as the post claims. There is no evidence that Trump has ""rescued over 300 missing children from pedifiles and perverts."" The claim is associated with QAnon, a widely discredited and baseless conspiracy theory that maintains leading Democrats and other public figures are Satan-worshiping pedophiles and that Trump is secretly working to stop them. We looked into a similar social media claim that Trump created a ""child protective force that found over 300 missing kids in less than 30 days,"" and rated it False. The U.S. Marshals service’s Missing Child Unit, working alongside local agencies, has safely located or recovered missing children for years, including while Trump was president.

A Facebook post claims, ""Biden and Obama allowed grown men in restrooms with little girls. TRUMP has rescued over 300 missing children from pedifiles and perverts."" Obama administration guidance required schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender identity, but the rule said nothing about allowing adults to do so as well.  During the Trump presidency, the U.S. Marshals Missing Child Unit has conducted operations to locate missing children.

When asked about Trump’s criticism that his plans would tank the economy in the debate, Biden did say there will be no new coal-fired power plants.

Nobody’s going to build another coal-fired power plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil-fired plant in America.

Biden’s campaign directed PolitiFact to the former vice president’s support for carbon capture projects, which could use coal power plants retrofitted to trap carbon dioxide before it’s emitted into the atmosphere. Biden’s action plan also promised to secure health care and benefits for coal miners and help communities transition into new jobs, as marketplace competition ""continues to shift the country away from coal-fired electricity.""  It’s not the first time Biden has mischaracterized his own stance on fossil fuels. In a March primary debate, he misspoke and seemed to say he would ban fracking. He has, however, said that he wants to ban the federal government from issuing new permits to drill on public land.  The Facebook post claimed that Biden said ""no more coal-fired power plants!!

Biden during the first presidential debate said that ""nobody’s going to build another coal-fired power plant in America,"" after explaining that renewable energy is ""cheaper or as cheap as"" coal, oil and gas.   The claim is missing important context that Biden appeared to refer to marketplace competition, which would be consistent with his climate action plan.  We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD8A5C0>],/factchecks/2020/oct/02/facebook-posts/bidens-nobodys-going-build-another-coal-plant-cont/

The prices shown in the photo were also $1.70-plus more than the weekly retail price for a gallon of gas on average in the U.S., which was $3.79 on May 7, 2012. Gas prices fluctuate often, regardless of who is president at the time. Several experts maintain that unless the president is directly controlling gasoline prices, he cannot take credit for the cost. Severin Borenstein, the director of the Energy Institute at the Haas School of Business University of California Berkeley, told PolitiFact presidents have ""very little direct influence"" over gas prices. ""By far the biggest driver is the price of crude oil, which is driven by supply and demand factors,"" he said. ""A strong global economy, which presidents can influence slightly, is likely to increase demand and drive up prices. The economic growth out of the financial crisis was part of what drove high gasoline prices in 2012-14, just as the pandemic-driven global recession is now keeping oil prices very low."" A comprehensive look at gas prices during both the Obama and Trump administrations revealed that average gas prices for the entire country varied greatly. On average, the weekly regular retail gas price during the Trump administration was about $2.50 per gallon, which is less than the average weekly regular retail price during the Obama administration — about $2.97 per gallon. A Facebook post includes an image of an Exxon sign that lists gas prices at more than $5 per gallon and says, ""Just a reminder of what things looked like the last time Biden was in the White House.""  It is a real photo of the price of gas at a Washington D.C. Exxon station in May 2012, when Obama and Biden were in office. However, the photo was taken when gas prices were spiking and shows a price that was still well above the average cost of a gallon of gas in the U.S. at that time.   Gas prices fluctuate regardless of who the president is. The average price during the Obama years was $2.97 a gallon.

No evidence 'doomsday planes,' Trump COVID-19 diagnosis related
","Late Oct. 1, two so-called ""doomsday planes"" took flight, and not long after, President Donald Trump announced he has COVID-19. Online, people are speculating that the two events are related.  Military officials say they’re not.  ""After Trump tested positive for Covid they scrambled the 'Doomsday Plane,'"" one Facebook post says.  ""For those suspecting Trump’s announcement is a hoax, here’s skywatcher Tim Hogan of Honolulu posting about U.S. ‘doomsday planes’ launching off the East and West Coasts half an hour before news broke,"" says another. ""National security is no joke, and a White House in turmoil puts us all at risk."" These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Here’s what we know about how these claims emerged: After news broke on Oct. 1 that Hope Hicks, a Trump aide who had been traveling with the president, had tested positive for COVID-19, a man named Tim Hogan tweeted about E-6B Mercury aircrafts that he said appeared on the East and West coasts of the United States. ""I looked because I would expect them to pop up if he tests positive,"" Hogan said in his tweet. Then, referring to U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear forces, Hogan wrote, ""IMO Stratcom wants them to be seen."" Soon after, Trump announced on Twitter that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19. An E-6B Mercury aircraft is an airborne nuclear command center that’s known as a ""Doomsday Plane"" because it’s designed to keep the National Command Authority in contact with Naval nuclear forces in a crisis, the Washingtonian explained in a story about the planes. The Navy has 16 such planes and one is often in the air, according to Forbes.  We reached out to the Defense Department about the planes but did not immediately hear back.  However, U.S. Strategic Command told Business Insider that ""these flights were pre-planned missions"" and that ""any timing to the president’s announcement is purely coincidental."" according to the outlet’s Oct. 2 story.  Business Insider also quoted Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman, saying: ""There’s been  no change to DoD alert levels. The U.S. military stands ready to defend our country and interests. There’s no change to the readiness or capability of our armed forces. Our national command and control structure is in no way affected by this announcement."" People who study nuclear issues echoed this.  ""It is very routine to have E-6s up,"" tweeted Vipin Narang, a political science professor and member of MIT’s Security Studies Program. ""Do not read anything into this, it isn’t a message to anyone. In terms of nuclear command and control, the concern isn’t communication but chain of command in case of POTUS incapacitation, but we are nowhere near there yet.""  ""These planes fly daily,"" tweeted Marc Ambinder, security expert in residence at USC Annenberg. ""Attend to your thought patterns and cognitive biases here. I will try to do the same. Reality is unsettling enough!"" Lara Seligman, a Politico reporter who covers the Pentagon, also tweeted that a spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the president’s COVID-19 diagnosis did not change its alert levels.  ""The US military stands ready to defend our country and its citizens,"" Seligman quoted the spokesperson as saying. ""There’s no change to the readiness or capability of our armed forces.""  There is no substantive evidence that these aircraft were dispatched because the president was diagnosed with COVID-19. If such evidence emerges, we’ll reconsider our ruling. For now, we rate claims saying otherwise False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA6AF80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/02/facebook-posts/no-evidence-doomsday-planes-trump-covid-19-diagnos/
