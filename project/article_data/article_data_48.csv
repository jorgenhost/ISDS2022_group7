Donald Trump wrong that Virginia saw 'huge increase' in illegal immigration under Tim Kaine
","Donald Trump depicted Tim Kaine’s 2006-10 tenure as governor of Virginia as a painful time of tax hike proposals and rising unemployment. ""He also oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase,"" Trump told supporters at an Aug. 20 rally in Fredericksburg. We wondered whether Trump was correct that, under Kaine’s governorship, illegal immigration spiked. We emailed the Trump campaign twice to ask about the basis of his statement, but we did not hear back. The GOP presidential nominee’s campaign posted a version of his speech online that includes a footnote to support his claim. It’s a 2007 editorial in The Washington Times that accused Kaine of failing to crack down on unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. But the editorial provides no insight into whether the number of illegal immigrants in the state rose during Kaine’s tenure. For additional insight, we reached out to the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, which estimates the size of the illegal immigration population in each state. Here are Pew’s figures on the size of Virginia’s illegal immigrant population by year: •2005 - 250,000 •2006 - 250,000 •2007 - 250,000 •2008 - 275,000 •2009 - 250,000 •2010 - 275,000 For 2011 and 2012, the latest years for which figures are available, the size of the illegal immigrant population also was 275,000, Pew found. So when Kaine entered office in 2006, the size of the illegal immigrant population was 250,000, it rose to 275,000 in 2008 and then went back down to its original level during 2009, his last full year in office, according to the Pew figures. If you go to 2010, during which Kaine served only the first two weeks, the illegal immigrant population was 275,000 - or 25,000 higher than when he entered the governor’s mansion. While a 10 percent increase in the illegal immigrant population between 2006 and 2010 might seem significant, it’s actually not much of a change at all from a statistical perspective, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew. Passel explained that the research group’s illegal immigration figures are not meant to be exact figures on the size of the state’s illegal immigrant population. Rather, they are estimates culled from a sample of data collected by the Census Bureau and are subject to rounding. Just like a public polls drawn from a sample, there’s a margin of error involved in the estimates. During Kaine’s time in office, the annual size of the illegal immigrant population could be 15,000 to 20,000 higher or lower than the mid-range estimate Pew reported each year, according to its report. So it’s possible that a 25,000 increase from year-to-year might not outpace the Pew study’s margin of error. The bottom line, during Kaine’s tenure the size of the illegal immigrant population remained flat, Passel said. Nationally, the illegal immigrant population peaked in 2007 at 12.2 million and fell to 11.3 million in 2013, Pew’s figures show. A major reason for that drop was the impact of the Great Recession, Passel told us. The Trump campaign didn’t respond to a question we posed about how Kaine’s policies as governor would have led to an increase in illegal immigration. Analysts told us that beyond state laws, many other factors contribute to where illegal immigrants choose to reside. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, told us illegal immigrants often settle in a state based on how its economy is doing, and whether they already have family living there. Our ruling Trump said that while Kaine was governor, he ""oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase."" But figures from the Pew Hispanic Center show that the size of the illegal immigrant population essentially was flat during Kaine’s term as governor. It’s certainly not the ""huge"" and ""tremendous"" increase that Trump makes it out to be. We rate his claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/10bcb296-66a2-4ad7-a60d-b53e86eecc3c",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2D2B40>],/factchecks/2016/aug/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-virginia-say-huge-increase-ille/

Did Hillary Clinton call African-American youth 'superpredators?'
","In response to Donald Trump calling Hillary Clinton a ""bigot"" this week, GOP chairman Reince Priebus reminded people that Hillary Clinton once referred to African-American youth as ""superpredators.""   Priebus took a swing at Hillary Clinton’s past, telling NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that her actions say a lot about her, adding ""she’s the one that labeled African-American youth as ‘superpredators’."" Trump, who is looking to increase his appeal among African-American voters, made the same ""superpredator"" claim days earlier on Twitter.  It didn’t take long to find what Trump and Priebus were referencing, but for this fact-check, we wanted to take a close look at the full context of Clinton’s remark. ‘Superpredators’ in context The ""superpredators"" line comes from a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, where Clinton spoke in support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which her husband, Bill Clinton, had signed in to law. ""We’re making some progress,"" Clinton said. ""Much of it is related to the initiative called ‘community policing.’ Because we have finally gotten more police officers on the street. That was one of the goals that the president had when he pushed the crime bill that was passed in 1994."" Provisions of the act included a ban on some assault weapons, more funding for community policing and an expansion of the death penalty. The legislation, which was championed by Bill Clinton as a way to reduce the number of African-Americans being killed in drug-related incidents, has drawn criticism in recent years for sending disproportionate numbers of African-Americans to prison. The ""superpredator"" remark, which Priebus and Trump referenced, was in the same speech a few lines later. ""But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs,"" Hillary Clinton  said in a C-SPAN video clip. ""Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators — no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel."" The full context of this incident does link children and superpredators, but nowhere in the speech does she directly label African-American youth this way. However, backlash from this speech has followed Clinton into this year’s election. Two Black Lives Matter activists confronted Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, telling the candidate she owes black people an apology. One day after this confrontation, Clinton released a statement to the Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart, expressing regret for her word choice. ""Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today,"" she said. Later in the election cycle, former Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, also criticized her language at a debate in Brooklyn. When Sanders was asked by debate moderator why he called out Bill Clinton out for his defense of Clinton’s use of the term ""superpredator,"" Sanders responded, ""Because it was a racist term, and everyone knew it was a racist term."" Our ruling Priebus said Hillary Clinton is ""the the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators."" Clinton — in the midst of championing her husband’s 1994 crime legislation — did use the term ""superpredator"" when referring to ""gangs of kids."" She did not specifically label superpredators as African-American, but the context of her speech and her subsequent apology decades later suggests it was a reasonable inference. Priebus’ claim is accurate, but needs some clarification, so for that reason we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B15680>],/factchecks/2016/aug/28/reince-priebus/did-hillary-clinton-call-african-american-youth-su/

Yes, Donald Trump donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation
","As Donald Trump amps up attacks on the Clinton Foundation, Democrats are pointing out that Trump himself has given to the nonprofit he now calls a pay-to-play operation. Recently released emails between Hillary Clinton’s aides when she was secretary of state and officials at the Clinton Foundation have demonstrated that some foundation donors did get access to Clinton, though there’s no evidence of direct favors. Addressing the topic on NBC’s Meet the Press, Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe noted the Clinton Foundation’s work on HIV/AIDS and malaria and Trump’s own ties to the charity. ""The Clinton Foundation, I think it’s a universal agreement, has done remarkable work around the world. I think Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000 to the foundation,"" he said. Plouffe is right that Trump gave at least $100,000 to the foundation, a fact that Trump and his campaign readily admit. One caveat: It appears that the money came through Trump’s own foundation, not directly from Trump. The Clinton Foundation lists Donald J. Trump as a contributor with a cumulative lifetime donation amount between $100,001 to $250,000. It’s not clear if Trump himself made a personal contribution, but tax forms show that the Donald J. Trump Foundation (which Trump controls) donated $100,000 to the foundation in 2009 and reserved a table at the Clinton Foundation gala for $10,000 in 2010.   Trump’s daughter Ivanka is also listed as a donor who gave between $5,001 and $10,000 and her father-in-law, Charles Kushner, gave between $250,001 and $500,000. Trump’s gift amount places him in the top 0.2 percent of the foundation’s donors. Most of its 300,000 donors (85.5 percent) gave less than $250. Breaking it down by dollar amount, however, Trump’s total contribution isn’t that big. We estimated that the foundation has received at least $800 million in donations, over 70 percent of which came from gifts of $1 million or more. In 2009, the Trump Foundation gave $926,750 to some 40 organizations (page 18). The Clinton Foundation received one of the largest gifts that year, matched or surpassed only by the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000) and the Police Athletic League ($156,000). Altogether, the Trump Foundation has donated $5.5 million to 298 charities between 2009 and 2013 according to the nonprofit’s tax forms, Forbes found. Trump did not make any personal contributions to his foundations during this time. (Money for the Trump Foundation in these years came from others and from investment income.) Trump doesn’t deny that he donated to the Clinton Foundation that he now calls a criminal enterprise. During the first GOP primary debate in August 2015, Trump voluntarily brought up his giving to the Clinton Foundation when asked about his previous donations to Hillary Clinton. ""When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me,"" Trump said. ""With Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding, and she came to my wedding. You know why? She didn’t have a choice, because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn’t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world."" For the record, the Clintons did attend Trump’s third wedding to Melania Knauss, but that occurred in 2005, four years before the $100,000 donation. A few months later, Trump gave pretty similar answers when he was asked to explain the Forbes article on his charitable giving record in late January. ""I did give to the Clinton Foundation. What I didn't know is they'd be using it for private aircraft and things like that. The Clinton Foundation was helping with Haiti and with lots of other things and I thought it was going to do some good work. So, it didn't make any difference to me,"" he said on Jan. 31’s Fox News Sunday. ""Again, I was a businessman and it was my obligation to get along with everybody, including the Clintons, including Democrats and liberals and Republicans and conservatives."" Our ruling Plouffe said, ""Donald Trump himself gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation."" Tax records show the Donald J. Trump Foundation gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2009, and spent an additional $10,000 for a table at a Clinton Foundation gala the following year. The Clinton Foundation also lists Donald J. Trump (as well his daughter Ivanka and Ivanka’s father-in-law) as a contributor. It’s important to note that Trump made the donation through his foundation, not out of his personal income. But Trump himself acknowledges the donation. We rate Plouffe’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/552526f7-e5b8-4ccb-9206-517f0a5819f7",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFD740>],/factchecks/2016/aug/28/david-plouffe/yes-donald-trump-donated-100000-clinton-foundation/

Sean Hannity incorrect that 'all of Texas' conservative save a bit of Austin
","Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, took note of a brief protest during the Austin taping of his Aug. 23, 2016, interview of Donald Trump by characterizing the state’s politics. ""All right,"" Hannity said amid shouts, ""all of Texas is conservative, except a little bit of Austin."" Without question, Austin largely tilts left. At the time Hannity spoke, Travis County had no countywide elected Republicans while its Texas House delegation consisted of five Democrats and one Republican. In 2012, President Barack Obama carried 60 percent of the county’s vote to Republican Mitt Romney’s 36 percent. We focused on Hannity’s larger point — that the rest of Texas is conservative. In Hannity’s favor: No Democrat has won statewide since 1994 (when Democrats won five of 10 statewide non-judicial races). Also, no Democratic presidential nominee has captured the state since Jimmy Carter edged Gerald Ford by 129,019 votes in 1976 (a November so long ago that Donald Trump was only 30 and and Hillary Clinton had just turned 29). Statewide in 2012, Romney beat Obama by more than 1 million votes, carrying 57 percent to Obama’s 41 percent, leaving Texas pretty darned red, per this Politico map:    SOURCE: ""Election Special, 2012 Texas Presidential Results,"" Politico, last updated Nov. 19, 2012 But contrary to Hannity’s statement, Austin wasn’t the only blue dot on the 2012 map. Obama won much of the traditionally stalwart-Democratic border region including El Paso County plus the urban counties of Bexar (home to San Antonio); Dallas; Harris (home to Democrat-dominant Houston); and Jefferson (home to union-strong Beaumont). Two years later, Republican Greg Abbott trounced Democrat Wendy Davis for governor, doing well nearly everywhere outside the Mexico border region. Politico’s map (below) shows that beyond border counties, Davis outpolled Abbott only in Travis and Dallas counties.  SOURCE: ""2014 Texas Governor Election Results,"" Politico, update Dec. 17, 2014 (accessed Aug. 25, 2016) Otherwise, meantime, Democrats show some local strengths--and not only in Austin or near Mexico. As of August 2016, when Hannity spoke, Dallas County’s judge (the county’s top executive position) was Democrat Clay Jenkins while five other countywide officeholders, including Sheriff Lupe Valdez, were Democrats, per the county’s Democratic Party. District Attorney Susan Hawk was the sole Republican in a countywide elected post. In contrast, neighboring Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth, remained a Republican stronghold; by our count, per a county Republican Party list, Republicans held all six countywide elected posts. Also, the state’s most-populous county, Harris, had just one Democrat in a major countywide post--Vince Ryan, the county attorney. Ryan won re-election in 2012 along with another Democrat, Sheriff Adrian Garcia. Garcia resigned in 2015 to bid for mayor and he was replaced with a Republican, Ron Hickman, who seeks re-election in November 2016. Bexar County, meantime, had a longtime Democratic leader as county judge, Nelson Wolff, as well as Democrats Albert Uresti, the tax assessor-collector, and Nicholas ""Nico"" LaHood, the county’s criminal district attorney. Then again, voters also had in place a Republican sheriff, Susan Pamerleau, seeking a second term in 2016; a Republican county clerk, Gerard ""Gerry"" Rickhoff, who’d held the office for more than two decades; and a Republican district clerk, Donna Kay McKinney. We also asked the state parties to assess Hannity’s claim, which by email Mike Joyce of the Republican Party of Texas called ""fair."" Manny Garcia of the Texas Democratic Party noted Democratic gains in some parts of the state and pointed out that when Texas voters participating in a June 2016 University of Texas poll were asked to place themselves on a seven-point scale running from extremely liberal to extremely conservative, 39 percent chose ""in the middle."" Otherwise, 18 percent self-identified as liberal, 44 percent as conservative. Our ruling Hannity said: ""All of Texas is conservative except a little bit of Austin."" If Hannity had solely singled out the state's many rural and suburban counties, he'd have a point. However, the state’s border counties and biggest cities (not just Austin) lean Democratic while the UT poll showed the majority of all voters self-identify as something other than conservative.

Professor: 'Concrete examples' of teachers, students spurning University of Texas due to gun law
","A University of Texas English professor says a law enabling Texans with state permits to carry concealed guns into classrooms has already caused prospective faculty, students and even speakers not to come to the Austin campus. Lisa Moore said in an NPR interview aired Aug. 7, 2016, six days after the campus-carry mandate took effect: ""We already have concrete examples of faculty who have declined to apply for jobs here at the university or who, once offered jobs, have turned them down when they realized that this policy would go into effect, students changing their minds about coming to our graduate and undergraduate programs, and invited speakers declining to come when they realized that we couldn't guarantee that they would give their talk in a gun-free space."" ""Concrete examples"" is definitive. So, how about details? First it’s worth noting that since 1995, Texas law has allowed any individual with a concealed handgun permit to carry a gun on public college and university sidewalks, streets, parking areas and other grounds. In 2015, state lawmakers widened the law by voting to let permit holders also carry guns in campus buildings, except in areas excluded under rules adopted by each school’s president. UT-Austin President Gregory L. Fenves has written that he doesn’t believe handguns belong in campus buildings; still, he agreed to allow them in classrooms because, he said, barring them would have the effect of generally excluding guns from campus, which the law prohibits. In February 2016, Fenves also wrote Bill McRaven, the UT System chancellor: ""Since this is a new law with an unknown effect on UT Austin, we will monitor implementation and its impact on students, faculty members, and staffers. I have significant concerns about how the law will affect our ability to recruit and retain faculty members and students. Fenves is among state defendants, too, in a lawsuit filed by Moore and two fellow professors seeking to bar civilian handguns from campus. On Aug. 22, 2016, a federal judge denied their request for a preliminary injunction that would have allowed them to ban concealed handguns from their classrooms. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel said he found no precedent for the argument that professors have a right of academic freedom under the First Amendment so broad that it overrides decisions of the Legislature and the university that employs them. Moore, Jennifer Lynn Glass and Mia Carter were still free to pursue the merits of their case. But Yeakel’s ruling was a considerable setback for them, as they wanted to ban guns in time for the start of fall classes. Virginia professor declined UT visit Moore, asked for concrete examples, initially responded with an email reminding that an out-of-state candidate for a UT deanship said he bowed out of consideration in 2015 due to the gun law. A February 2016 Austin American-Statesman news blog post quoted Siva Vaidhyanathan, a University of Virginia professor of media studies who’d previously earned UT bachelor’s and doctoral degrees, saying he’d been contacted by a search firm helping the university find a dean for the Moody College of Communication--and, the story said, was later told he was a finalist. But the gun law weighed on him; the story said that if chosen, Vaidhyanathan said, he’d have felt compelled to side with faculty members seeking to bar guns from classrooms. ""I would probably be fired immediately,"" he said. ""I told the search firm I was no longer interested in the position."" To our inquiry, Vaidhyanathan provided a December 2015 email he sent to search firm officials declining their invitation to return to the Texas campus for ""an extended visit and a dinner"" about the deanship that would have included meetings with Fenves and others. Vaidhyanathan’s email said the prospect of guns being allowed in classrooms meant he couldn’t ""pursue this position with enthusiasm."" Vaidhyanathan wrote: ""I could not, in good conscience, ask faculty and students to put themselves into an environment in which students, visitors, or even faculty could be armed. My wife is a scientist. I could not ask her to take a job at a university that was forbidden by law to restrict guns from classrooms. The very consideration of that possibility puts a chilling effect on open and relaxed discourse in the classroom. And the fact that the university cannot restrict guns on campus in general means that university police officers are forbidden to do their jobs effectively. They can’t diffuse a threatening situation until it becomes a dangerous one. ""Universities are tense enough already. And we all count on our university police forces to confront and (defuse) threatening situations as early as possible. The State of Texas has put every student and professor in Texas in danger. I applaud the chancellor, the president, the faculty, and the students for their strong opposition to campus carry."" So, that’s a candidate for dean confirmed. Next, we followed up with Moore about particular students, other prospective faculty and speakers deciding not to come to UT due to the gun law. A mother’s email Moore forwarded a November 2015 email sent by a parent, Rachel Zucker, to a UT mailbox. The message says: ""Dear UT, I want you to know that my son, Moses Goren, is a straight A student at Hunter College High School (in NYC) who has expressed interest in applying to your Plan II program at UT (Austin). He and I have decided, however, that he will not apply to any schools that have campus carry laws. We believe that guns should not be allowed on college campuses and that guns present a serious physical danger for faculty and students. If you were to make UT Austin a safer place by making it illegal to bring a gun on campus, I would eagerly and proudly have Moses apply to your esteemed school. Thank you, Rachel Zucker"" To our inquiry, Zucker confirmed her son’s decision. ""Both of us feel even clearer about this than we did when wrote that email. The rampant gun violence and lack of commonsense gun control in this country should be a source of unmitigated shame for our leaders and legislators,"" Zucker said by email, adding that she hopes UT bans guns on campus. Moore also noted the departures of two UT faculty members by 2016. In each instance -- Architecture Dean Frederick Steiner’s move to the University of Pennsylvania and economist Daniel Hamermesh’s shift to opportunities abroad -- news stories and emails we fielded from the men describe the gun law as a factor, though not the only factor, in the departures. Hamermesh urged us to consult Joan Neuberger, a UT history professor, who responded by emailing a prospective graduate student’s February 2016 email saying she would decline UT’s offer of admission ""due to my misgivings with the campus carry guidelines President Fenves released today."" Nora Dolliver went on: ""Although I think that UT would be a wonderful place to complete my graduate training, I am unwilling to study or work in an environment where my classmates, professors, students, or patrons are permitted to carry handguns."" Harvard professor’s decision A March 2016 news story in UT’s student newspaper, The Daily Texan, quoted Moore saying a Harvard University professor had withdrawn from a search for a faculty position in the UT Women and Gender Studies department because of the measure letting guns into classrooms. By phone, Moore told us the professor, Robin Bernstein, had been urged by Moore and others to apply in 2015, but Bernstein, citing the gun law, declared she wouldn’t. ""She definitely would have been a finalist,"" Moore said, adding that faculty were ultimately unable to fill the position. By email, Bernstein told us she was invited to apply for a professorship in women’s and gender studies but declined to do so ""in large part because of the changes in Texas law to allow guns in class."" Bernstein shared a portion of her November 2015 email to Moore about deciding not to apply. The email says Bernstein had been ""watching the madness with the Texas legislature"" and wasn’t more than 50 percent sure she’d accept the UT job if it were offered. Concerned outside speaker Moore, asked about speakers deciding not coming to campus, pointed us to Paloma Diaz, an administrator in UT’s Teresa Lozano Long Institute for Latin American Studies. Diaz said by phone that a speaker who teaches at the University of Washington cited the gun law in initially resisting the institute’s invitation to give a talk in fall 2016, though she said the speaker subsequently relented. Diaz said she didn’t have permission to identify the speaker. Otherwise, a web search showed the institute has posted a notice that Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, a UW professor, is expected to visit and give talks Sept. 26, 2016. Godoy didn't respond to our query. We couldn’t fairly consider a couple of late-breaking instances of invited speakers deciding not to come to UT because their decisions became public after Moore spoke to NPR. Still: --A Duke University professor, Karla Holloway, wrote Phillip Barrish, a UT English professor, that she was rescinding her acceptance of Barrish’s invitation to speak on the campus in fall 2016. Holloway wrote Aug. 26, 2016: ""I believe guns, and especially the vulnerabilities exposed in conceal carry cultures, contribute mightily to our nation’s public health crisis. And with the conceal carry now in full effect there, and after discussion with my family, I just cannot come."" To our inquiry, Holloway forwarded a copy of the emailed March 2016 invitation from Barrish that she and Barrish told us she’d previously accepted. --Neuberger separately alerted us to a Texas Christian University historian, Hanan Hammad, reversing course about speaking at UT, also while citing the gun law (which allows private universities like TCU to opt out of the mandate). To our inquiry, Hammad forwarded her Aug. 26, 2016, email rescinding her agreement to speak in October 2016. Hammad wrote that ""with campus carry now in full effect at UT, I just cannot come. I'm always proud to be a UT alumnus and I owe my mentors and teachers great deal, but I'm in full solidarity with all UT faculty, staff, and students whose health and lives are in danger due to campus carry. I believe open or conceal carry on campus is wrong and dangerous."" UT administration suggests claim solid We also asked a university spokesman, Gary Susswein, about the accuracy of Moore’s claim. Susswein responded by emailing a web link to an August 2016 statement by sociologist Harry Edwards, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, in which Edwards said that due to implementation of the gun law, he was rescinding his permission to present UT lectures on sport and society, launched in 2014, in his name. ""My decision was an exceedingly difficult one,"" Edwards wrote, ""but silence is evil's greatest and most consistently dependable ally."" Another campus spokesman, J.B. Bird, said by email the administration could confirm Moore’s claim. Bird didn’t identify resistant individuals by name though he wrote that the university provost’s office ""confirmed hearing of a few people who decided not to interview and who stated that it was because of campus carry. Similarly, Bird said, provost officials say ""they have heard of a few cases of faculty speakers who have decided not to come to campus to give talks because of the law."" Bird said too that ""we know of students changing their minds about coming based on campus carry. Our admissions office said when the law was announced they received about 10 calls and 10-15 emails with applicants saying that they were not coming or would not apply. We assume that we don’t hear from 100 percent of the people who make this decision. ""That said,"" Bird wrote, ""we did just admit the largest incoming freshmen class in UT’s history, with about 8,500 freshman. From what we have seen, though, the assertion is true that some individuals have chosen not to come because of the new state law."" Our ruling Moore told NPR there are ""concrete examples"" of UT job applicants, prospective students and invited speakers deciding not to come to the university because of conceal-carry permit holders newly being allowed to bring handguns into campus buildings including classrooms. Not naming names, UT’s administration says this is so. We separately identified two out-of-state professors, a prospective graduate student and the mother of a high school student who cited the change in gun law and policy for not continuing to seek a UT position or not applying to come there--plus an outside speaker who reportedly resisted an invitation to speak on campus before relenting.

Hillary Clinton, citing 'Trump Effect,' says teachers are reporting more bullying in schools
","Americans should be concerned about the effect of Donald Trump’s campaign on kids, said Hillary Clinton in an Aug. 25 speech decrying what she sees as her opponent’s campaign of ""prejudice and paranoia."" She told the story about a high school basketball game in Indiana, where home team fans taunted players from their heavily Hispanic rival school by holding up a large cutout of Trump’s head and chanting ""build a wall."" ""Next time you see Trump rant on television, think about all the children listening across America,"" Clinton said. ""Kids hear a lot more than we think. Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘Trump Effect.’ They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants."" We wondered if Clinton is right teachers are reporting an increase in bullying and harassment and if so, what does it have to do with Trump? Clinton’s source is an April report out of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights and antidiscrimination advocacy group. The report is titled ""The Trump Effect: The impact of the presidential campaign on our nation’s schools."" The center conducted an online survey of approximately 2,000 K-12 teachers and found: ""Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail."" While their findings correspond directly with Clinton’s claim, it’s important to note that this was not a scientific survey, as the report notes. The respondents don’t represent a random sample of teachers, and it’s likely that those who chose to respond to the survey are those who are most concerned about the campaign’s impact on students. This means it would be inaccurate to extrapolate from the survey that bullying and harassment are generally on the rise across the country. Rather, it is more a collection of teachers’ anecdotal experiences. We looked for a scientific study that speaks to this same question but couldn’t find one, mostly because there tends to be a lag in this kind of data, meaning data on bullying trends in 2016 won’t get published until 2017 or later. The process of setting up and getting approval to conduct a scientific study is lengthy and cumbersome, and would not be approved before the election, said Sheri Bauman, a professor at the University of Arizona who researches bullying. Even so, Bauman said the Southern Poverty Law Center’s report should not be dismissed, as its data show important recurring themes. Here are some interesting details from the survey. Keep in mind that the survey did not mention any candidate names whatsoever: Respondents gave a total of 5,000 comments. Of those, one in five mentioned Trump. All other candidates were mentioned fewer than 200 times combined. ""More than one-third have observed an increase in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment."" ""Teachers report that students have been ‘emboldened’ to use slurs, engage in name-calling and make inflammatory statements toward each other,"" and ""Kids use the names of candidates as pejoratives to taunt each other."" ""More than two-thirds of the teachers reported that students — mainly immigrants, children of immigrants and Muslims — have expressed concerns or fears about what might happen to them or their families after the election."" On the otherhand, the bullying can be contrary to the depiction that Clinton offered. The survey also noted examples of students getting bullied by others because they or their parents support Trump. The findings support Clinton’s claim, said Maureen Costello, the report’s author and director of the center’s Teaching Tolerance project. ""It’s fair to say the reports say teachers who respond to us are in fact seeing an increase in the quantity of harassment and change in quality of bullying,"" Costello said, adding that she has received upwards of 300 unsolicited additional comments from educators since the report came out, all expressing similar sentiments. ""I suspect (Clinton) might be right, but the data are not there to support the statement from a scientific-evidence-based perspective,"" said Dorothy Espelage, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and a leading expert in bullying. A Trump spokesman dismissed the survey, noting that it was unscientific. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘Trump Effect.’ They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants."" Teachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center study reported an increase in bullying and harassment, particularly involving anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments. Many of these teachers, unsolicited, cited Trump’s campaign rhetoric and the accompanying discourse as the likely reason for this behavior. The term Trump Effect is a product of the survey’s authors. And the survey is unscientific because it's based on anecdotal reports. But experts in bullying told us the Southern Poverty Law Center’s survey and their sense of current trends in schools supports Clinton’s point.

Trump's False claim Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on African-American businesses 50 percent
","Donald Trump’s newfound focus on black voters collided with a prior talking point on Hillary Clinton’s tax plan during a speech at a New Hampshire rally. But in the process he made an already inaccurate argument even more wrong. The GOP presidential candidate attacked Clinton on several fronts Aug. 25 in Manchester, including over alleged elements of her tax plan. ""She wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now,"" Trump said. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests to show us how Clinton’s tax targets black business owners with close to a 50-percent tax increase. It appears Trump’s penchant for going off-script further undermined his own attack. Wrong about rates Let’s acknowledge immediately that Trump’s focus on African-Americans, as if Clinton planned to tax them as some vindictive measure against black-owned businesses, is misleading. Trump has been attempting to woo black voters lately, so he likely was trying to present his point about taxation in a way that resonated with African Americans. But it comes across as Clinton targeting blacks in a way that would not apply in the tax code. There’s nothing in her tax plan that spotlights the country’s 2.6 million or so black-owned businesses in such a way. ""The tax code is race neutral. Nothing targets — or gives preference to — anyone based on race,"" said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""Whether a provision disproportionately affects people of one race relative to those of another race depends on particular situations but isn't based on race."" We have an idea what Trump was trying to say. Earlier this month, he told a Detroit crowd on Aug. 8 that Clinton ""would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent."" We rated this statement Mostly False in a previous fact-check. The Trump campaign told us then that his earlier statement referred to a 4 percent surcharge Clinton has proposed on high earners. Using an analysis of Clinton’s plan from the Tax Policy Center, the campaign pointed out the top tax rate is currently 39.6 percent. A business owner also could potentially be paying 3.8 percent in Medicare taxes, reaching a rate of 43.4 percent. Add the 4 percent surcharge on top of that and you reach 47.4 percent. That was the ""nearly 50 percent"" part. Except it’s not as simple as that. Clinton's proposed 4 percent tax increase only applies to taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of over $5 million, and only income in excess of $5 million would be taxed at that extra 4 percent. That’s not a lot of business owners. Only about 0.5 percent of all small businesses in the nation reported a profit of more than $1 million in 2011, according to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis. Overall, only a bit more than 34,000 of the 150 million or so tax returns filed in 2013 reported income of more than $5 million. That's an even smaller fraction — about 0.02 percent of all earners. But Trump made it worse for himself in this new description. The prepared remarks for his speech read, ""She wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent."" This is important to note, because he then ad-libs and changes the meaning of the sentence by adding ""more than they're paying now."" That means instead of saying they will be taxed at 50 percent, they will be taxed at a rate almost 50 percent higher than they are currently. That’s a different assertion. Experts told us it’s difficult to find anything in Clinton’s plan that telegraphs such a hefty increase. Leonard Burman, director at the Tax Policy Center, said the effective tax rate for the highest-earning self-employed people would only go up by about 7 percent. If Trump were referring to corporations, which are affected by the rise in tax rates on capital gains and dividends, the marginal effective tax rate on new corporate investment would still go up by less than 10 percent. Williams further noted that Clinton’s proposed ""Buffett Rule"" requiring people with income greater than $1 million to pay a minimum 30 percent tax rate could theoretically boost a person’s tax by more than 50 percent. But the conditions would have to be specific, so that result probably wouldn’t bump tax rates on business income by 50 percent. Her proposed 28 percent cap on the value of tax preferences — think credits, deductions, exemptions and so forth — also doesn’t appear likely to produce such a dramatic change. ""There might be an odd case in which that would boost taxes a lot but nothing pops into my brain,"" Williams said. He added that it’s difficult to be certain absolutely no one would face such an increase, but ""it doesn't look like any of (Clinton’s) plans could increase a person's tax bill by half."" Our ruling Trump said Clinton ""wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now."" Putting aside the irrelevance of the comment about African-Americans, the campaign never specified exactly how Clinton’s tax plan would do that to anyone. Clinton has proposed some tax increases on higher earners, but barring an extremely unusual case, nothing she has proposed approaches boosting taxes by almost 50 percent.

Explaining the confusion over the Start-Up NY Report
","Assemblyman Robin Schimminger, D-Kenmore, said state officials reported an incorrect number of jobs created by companies participating in Start-Up NY, one of the state’s economic development programs. A report released in July says the program created 408 jobs in its first two years, 2014 and 2015. Schimminger, who chairs the Assembly’s Economic Development Committee, said at a hearing earlier this month that Empire State Development Corp. inflated its claim of 319 jobs in 2015 by as many as 80 positions. The report puzzled Schimminger and other lawmakers because it showed more net new jobs for the companies than the number of jobs the companies said they created. ""I could not figure out how that could be, until I came to the conclusion that very possibly the companies were reporting a two-year amount, the 2014 and 2015 net new jobs created and including them in their submission to the agency,"" Schimminger said at the hearing. ""The agency then simply took that number, tallied it and reached what should be the correct tally number to include in the report. However, they were the wrong numbers from the companies. So I would submit this is not the difference of a dozen or so, this is a significant number of overcounts in the compilation that I’ve looked at."" Howard Zemsky, head of the Empire State Development Corp., defended Start-Up NY before the Assembly panel. ""I don’t acknowledge that there are any inaccurate numbers,"" Zemsky replied. Who’s right? We took a closer look. Did the Start-Up NY report inflate job claims by double counting many of the jobs? What’s a net new job? Start-Up NY offers businesses tax relief for 10 years when they locate or expand on or near a participating college campus. The state must publish an annual report on the program’s progress. This year’s report was tucked inside an omnibus report of other state incentive programs called the Business Incentives Report. The section on Start-Up NY takes less than three pages. Last year’s report was a 14-page document. This year’s report offers little guidance on how to interpret the information in the report other than a few footnotes and a set of unidentified appendices. Understanding the report requires knowing the state’s definition of a ‘net new job.’ It’s not just any job created during the year. It must be a job that did not exist before the company joined the program. It has to be full time. It has to be filled for more than six months. Empire State Development counted 319 net new jobs in the report. A separate part of the report shows jobs created at any point during the calendar year. No six-month requirement applies to this count. That means any job filled in the second half of 2015 was counted in this number - but not included in the net new job count because it did not reach the six month mark by the end of the year. By that way of counting, the state reported 332 jobs created in 2015. Counting the jobs So the 319 net new jobs in the report are jobs filled at any point during the 2014 calendar year or in the first half of 2015. The 332 jobs created are new, full-time positions companies reported creating during the entire 2015 calendar year. We reached out to Liazon Corp., which expanded in Buffalo under Start-Up NY. Liazon confirmed this is its explanation for why it reported more net new jobs than jobs created in 2015. Our ruling Schimminger said at an economic development hearing in Albany that Empire State Development reported ""wrong numbers from the companies"" in Start-Up NY. So the report included ""a significant number of overcounts in the compilation,"" he said. Empire State Development did not provide guidance on how to read the report, so anyone not privy to state definitions of certain terms may have come to the same conclusion as the assembly member. Schimminger, of course, is not just anyone. Schimminger served as chairman of the Assembly's small business committee from 1985 until 1997, when he was named chairman of the Assembly Standing Committee on Economic Development, Job Creation, Commerce and Industry. A closer look at the law explains how the numbers are reported. We rate Schimminger’s claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/10730ecb-e329-40ec-8370-9bb70ece7310",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F13C0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/26/robin-schimminger/explaining-startup-ny-report/

How much would Barack Obama $10-per-barrel tax on oil raise gas prices? 24 cents, Paul Ryan says
","In an Aug. 11, 2016 tweet that was augmented with a bit of animation (a counter with rolling numbers), House Speaker Paul Ryan declared: ""President Obama’s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon."" That’s a flat declaration of a specific figure. Let’s see if it’s on the money. Ryan’s evidence To back Ryan’s statement, his office cited a February 2016 article from MarketWatch.com, which reported on Obama’s proposal for a $10  tax on each barrel of oil to pay for ""clean"" transportation projects such as expanding mass transit. The article said the tax would be paid by oil companies and gradually phased in over five years. To be clear, the article said the proposal ""isn’t expected to go far."" And in a news release Ryan issued the same day as his tweet, he said the tax is ""dead on arrival in Congress."" The MarketWatch article quoted Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, as saying: ""This proposal would trickle down and be a $10 per barrel tax on motorists -- or 20 to 25 cents per gallon on refined fuels. To me it’s clear: this is not something oil companies are going to absorb."" So, 24 cents is in the range of the analyst’s estimate. But it’s only one analyst; and his estimate is based on how he thinks oil companies would respond to a $10-per-barrel tax. What the oil companies would do isn’t quite as certain as what Ryan claimed. A trade group that should know, the American Petroleum Institute, warned the tax would ""harm consumers."" But it hedged a bit in saying the tax ""could"" raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon. Economist Nicolas Loris estimated the cost slightly lower, at 22 cents, the Huffington Post said 22 to 24 cents, and the Washington Post said 24 cents. Politico and Forbes said about 25 cents. One note: The federal government currently imposes a tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline. But that’s a direct tax on gas, not on the oil companies. Our rating Ryan said: ""President Obama’s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon."" Estimates are in the 24 cents range for the $10-per-barrel tax that Obama proposed on oil companies. But it’s not a sure thing, if the tax became law, that all of the tax would be passed onto consumers.

Big Tobacco blowing smoke in claim about California's Prop 56
"," Opponents of Proposition 56, California’s proposed $2 per pack cigarette tax hike, are flooding radio airwaves with attacks on the measure. The initiative is one of many on the state’s November ballot. The No on 56 campaign is funded by tobacco companies Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. Its campaign says online and in radio ads that the measure ""cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year."" The industry attacks are not surprising. And they’ll likely continue as opponents of the measure have raised more than $35 million, while supporters have collected about $17 million. We wondered whether there’s any truth to the claim that Prop 56 ‘cheats’ schools out of all that money. Our research Nearly three decades ago, voters in California approved Proposition 98 requiring a minimum level of funding for public education. It requires the state to dedicate roughly 40 percent of new General Fund revenues to K-12 schools and community colleges. Prop 56 would generate up to $1.4 billion in tax revenue its first year. But instead of sending that revenue to the General Fund, Prop 56 would place it in a special fund to help pay for Medi-Cal, which provides health coverage for millions of low-income Californians. We asked the No on 56 campaign for evidence that the tobacco tax measure ‘cheats’ schools. A spokeswoman pointed to language in the measure that exempts Prop 56 from the school funding guarantee. The campaign said this exemption is proof that the measure undermines the funding guarantee and ‘cheats’ schools. But the experts we spoke with say there’s nothing new about this proposal. Past tobacco taxes, in 1988 and 1998, also established special funds rather than sending money to the General Fund. One of the experts said the opponents’ claim is misleading. ""When I think of this claim that the schools are going to be cheated -- particularly that word ‘cheated’ out of this money -- that suggests something that’s wrong or illegal. And this is not the case,"" said Steve Boilard, executive director of Sacramento State University’s Center for California Studies. ""There’s plenty of examples where new revenue is raised that is not subject to the Prop 98 funding guarantee."" Boilard pointed to Proposition 63, a tax on wealthy Californians that funds mental health services.  Curran Kelleher / Flickr Others reject claim State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson rejected the claim that the new tax measure ‘cheats’ schools. In a recent letter circulated by the Yes on 56 campaign, he wrote: ""Make no mistake, Proposition 56 will not divert a dime away from schools. Rather, it will raise revenues for school based tobacco prevention and intervention programs."" A report by the Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates Prop 56 will add $20 million for those school based programs. The Sacramento Bee’s fact-checking team, PoliGRAPH, recently examined the same claim about Prop 56 ‘cheating’ schools. It found that it ""isn’t fair to say the measure 'cheats' schools out of $600 million a year. Nothing in the measure reduces school funding. If the measure passes, the budget for schools does not decrease."" Our ruling The No on 56 campaign is running ads that say the proposed tobacco tax ""cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year."" The measure includes an exemption from the state’s school funding guarantee. A portion of its revenues, estimated at up to $1.4 billion, could otherwise have been directed toward school funding. But past tobacco taxes and a tax to fund mental health services have also legally avoided this guarantee. Those had exemptions allowing their revenues to fund health services. This doesn't mean, however, that money will be taken from schools or community colleges under Prop 56. The measure, in fact, sends about $20 million to schools for tobacco prevention programs. The claim that Prop 56 ""cheats"" schools goes too far. It might have been accurate to say the measure exempts most all revenue from going to schools. But the term chosen by No on 56 is misleading.

Feingold: Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help ship Wisconsin jobs overseas
","In the race for the U.S. Senate, a new TV ad from challenger Russ Feingold claims that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican incumbent, ""voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas."" When it comes to attacks on Republican officeholders, this claim is not new. In 2014, PolitiFact National wrote: ""Democrats and their advocates have washed, rinsed and are now repeating one of their favorite talking points from 2012: that ‘(Insert Republican Here) supports tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas.’ "" The piece called the description ""so simplistic as to be misleading,"" adding there is no specific tax break for sending jobs to other countries. OK, 2012 … 2014 … 2016 … we’re sensing a trend here. Let’s take a look at how Feingold’s claim fares on the Truth-O-Meter. Bring Jobs Home Act The Feingold campaign cited five votes by Johnson, two of which were on what was termed the Bring Jobs Home Act, which would have given companies credit for bringing jobs to the United States and denied existing deductions associated with moving a business outside the country. Those two votes were specifically addressed in a 2014 factcheck involving a claim against U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. The claim in the 2014 piece was that McConnell voted ""three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas."" Feingold’s campaign emphasized that the claim in their ad was that Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship jobs overseas, not that corporate tax breaks by themselves are responsible for sending jobs outside the U.S. ""Like that PolitiFact notes, McConnell voted against denying deductions for costs associated with outsourcing,"" Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said in an email to PolitiFact. ""That helps a company attempting to ship its jobs elsewhere."" But the earlier item noted: ""The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isn’t a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California."" Tax experts said there is very little money associated with these standard deductions and ""getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a company’s decision to engage in foreign activity."" The legislation was proposed in 2012 and 2014 and Johnson voted ""no"" on procedural measures in each case, functionally voting to block the legislation from moving forward. The measures failed on procedural votes. The legislation itself was ""almost entirely symbolic,"" PolitiFact reported. Three votes on budget amendments Now let’s turn to the other three votes, taken in March 2015 and cited by the Feingold campaign, this time on amendments to Congress’ concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2016. Two were proposed by Democrats and a third was proposed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent who ran as a Democrat in the 2016 presidential race. The amendments were opposed by Republicans, with the two Independents voting with the Democrats. -- Amendment 817 statement of purpose: ""To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide tax benefits to patriot employers that invest in American jobs and provide fair pay and benefits to workers and to eliminate tax benefits for corporations that ship jobs overseas."" -- Amendment 523 statement of purpose: ""To prevent United States companies from getting tax benefits for moving jobs overseas, to end offshore tax loopholes including inversions, and to provide incentives for United States companies to relocate overseas jobs to the United States."" -- Amendment 323 statement of purpose: ""To create millions of middle class jobs by investing in our nation's infrastructure paid for by raising revenue through closing loopholes in the corporate and international tax system."" USA TODAY reported that amendment 323 targets ""tax loopholes"" that ""let corporations and wealthy Americans shift jobs and profits overseas."" But experts we spoke with said these votes had no practical effect. Congress’ concurrent budget resolution does not have the force of law and it would not be the place to change the tax code, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""To me those are just sort of messaging -- they were all very much of a partisan vote,"" Ellis said. He added: ""You can argue, well, he voted against whatever the message that the member, the Senator, was trying to get across, but I wouldn't necessarily say that was voting for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas because if he had voted for it, it wouldn’t have had any effect and voting against it didn’t have any effect."" In addition, he said, tax reform would have to originate in the House, and it would be dealt with by the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means -- not on the floor of the Senate in a budget resolution. In an email, Johnson’s campaign said the senator’s position is that ""we should scrap the tax code, rather than favor any single deduction."" Our rating Feingold’s campaign ad said Johnson ""voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas."" By voting against the Bring Jobs Home Act, Feingold is correct that Johnson voted against denying deductions associated with moving a business out of the country. But, as the 2014 PolitiFact notes, the law was mostly symbolic and these aren’t deductions specifically for moving jobs elsewhere, which is how the statement could easily be interpreted. The amendments to the budget resolution on which he voted had no practical effect, experts told us.

"['Education', 'Illinois', 'Rahm Emanuel']","
Emanuel scores well on CPS test
","In June, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner called some Chicago Public Schools ""crumbling prisons,"" and then five-year-old emails from when he was in private business revealed he’d also called principals ""managerially incompetent"" and half its teachers ""virtually illiterate."" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could not let the moment pass, even as he said he was accepting Rauner’s apology for the remarks. At a press event after Rauner’s email comments were released, Emanuel used the opportunity to boast about CPS students’ achievements. ""Well, let me tell you what the [Chicago Public Schools] ‘crumbling prisons’ with wardens as principals and guards as teachers have done. They lead the country in high school graduation of an urban school system…They now match the United States of America in kids graduating high school going on to a four-year college...That same prison with that same warden and that same security guard is also producing eighth-grade leaders in the country in math gains, fourth-grade leaders in reading gains."" That’s a lot to study, so we decided to do our homework. Testing the claims Lauren Huffman, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office, noted Emanuel often repeats those claims, citing statistics from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The NAEP calls itself the largest, continuing organization that tests students in a variety of subjects. It is under the umbrella of the National Center for Education Statistics run by the federal education department. We were able to verify the mayor’s claims about eighth-grade math and fourth-grade reading by examining ""The Nation’s Report Card"" for 2016 and the Trial Urban District Assessment published by the NAEP, and by interviewing Grady Wilburn, a statistician with the National Center for Education Statistics. Wilburn said Chicago’s fourth-grade reading score had improved 15 points since 2003, the second-highest improvement behind Washington, D.C., which improved 26 points. Since 2013, Chicago improved 7 percentage points and tied for first place with Washington, Cleveland and Boston.      While the chart shows numerically that D.C. is higher, it does not account for statistical significance. Wilburn said when districts are tested for statistical significance, Washington, Cleveland and Chicago are not different from each other. Significance testing considers sampling error associated with only assessing a portion of students, not all of them. In eighth-grade reading, Wilburn said scores show Emanuel’s statement to be accurate. Since 2003, he said, eighth-grade CPS math scores have improved 20 percentage points. They are statistically tied for highest gains since 2003. They’re tied with Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles. If you look just at 2013-15, Chicago’s scores went up 6 percentage points, and that is the biggest gain. Of the 21 urban districts monitored, CPS students were the only ones to improve in eighth-grade math from 2013 to 2015.   Passing or surpassing? Emanuel made two other claims about Chicago Public School students. One of the claims was that they now match the nation in kids graduating high school and going on to a four-year college. The Chicago Consortium on School Research at the University of Chicago published a new study in June that examined high school graduation, college enrollment and bachelor’s degree attainment rates. Chicago Public Schools’ ""four-year college enrollment rate for 2014 is 42 percent, two percentage points lower than the national rate, and half of CPS graduates who enroll in four-year colleges will graduate in six years,"" a summary of the report says. Two percentage points lower than the nation in college enrollment would indicate Emanuel’s statement is slightly off, but it is clear CPS graduation rates, college enrollment and degree attainment have been rising significantly. In 2006, the graduation and college enrollment rate was eight percent. In nine years, by 2015, that rate had doubled to 16 percent. Emanuel’s other claim, that CPS leads the nation among urban districts for high school graduation, was more difficult to verify. The National Center for Education Statistics put the adjusted cohort graduation rate at 82 percent for 2013-14. Jenny Nagaoka, deputy director of the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research and an author of the study of CPS college attainment, said the CPS rate for the same year is 74 percent, but she cautioned the two institutions might rely on districts that calculate rates differently. Unlike reading and math scores, there doesn’t appear to be a comparison of urban district graduation rates. In 2012, she said CPS was ""probably in the middle of the pack"" nationally. ""On the basis of this, I can’t conclusively say this is a true or false statement,"" she said. ""CPS is certainly higher than Baltimore. We may be higher than New York. CPS is certainly higher than many. Chicago has made great gains. We’ve really closed the gap compared to the national rate and that’s important."" Chicago’s improvement in graduation rate comes at a time when, nationally the rate also has been climbing. ""It is a big accomplishment to improve the gap when the national rate also is improving,"" Nagaoka said. Our ruling Emanuel’s boasts about reading and math scores compared to other urban districts were accurate. His statement about going on to four-year college was a bit off, but probably not statistically significant. We could not find data to conclusively verify that CPS leads urban districts nationwide in its graduation rate, but it has made dramatic improvement. A similar study from the consortium concludes, ""While changes in student demographics account for some of the increase in graduation rates, improvements in student performance in high school — compared to similar students who started high school in the past — accounts for most of the change; students are passing more classes and earning more credits in ninth grade. Not only are more students graduating, but they are leaving high school with higher achievement than graduates in prior years.

Clinton celebs still sizzling Clinton has received endorsements from at least 900 celebrities. With that volume, some ""aren’t very hot anymore"" (consider Laguna Beach’s Lo Bosworth and MC Hammer). But Hollywood royalty is largely on Clinton’s side. Trump specified ""Hollywood celebrities,"" so we won’t count Clinton supporters like radio host Howard Stern or President Barack Obama. And because Trump focused on ""enthusiastic"" supporters, we’ll also limit our investigation to Hollywood celebrities who have campaigned or raised money for Clinton. With those parameters, we identified about 100 hardcore Tinseltown Clinton fans. The roster includes singers Beyoncé, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Katy Perry and Demi Lovato (the last three of whom performed at the Democratic National Convention); and Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio, plus George Clooney (who once defended a fundraiser he held for Clinton with this Half True claim) and Bradley Cooper (whose appearance at the DNC upset some American Sniper fans). Other celebrity supporters include Kanye West and wife Kim Kardashian (who got her selfie with Clinton in 2015), Heidi Klum, Magic Johnson and Elton John (who headlined a New York City concert for the Hillary Victory Fund and isn’t too keen on Tiny Dancer being played at Trump rallies). And as we said, you can actually gauge how hot these celebrities are.     We consulted E-Poll Market Research, which collects data on almost 9,000 celebrities and measures whether people know and like them. The marketing firm had an E-Score for all but one person on the list (Orange is the New Black’s Dascha Polanco). Altogether, the 100 most enthusiastic Clinton celebrities averaged an E-Score of 86 out of 100. Two-thirds of the list scored above 90, with seven netting a perfect 100. (Because E-Score reflects both awareness and likeability, Kanye West scored a low 15 due to low appeal.) Katy Perry, a Clinton donor and campaign trail performer, tops Forbes’ list of celebrities with the most Twitter followers (92.1 million). A dozen other Clinton supporters also are on the list. Forbes also counts Perry and six other Clinton backers among the highest-paid celebrities of 2016. Ten Clinton celebs made it onto Vulture’s Most Valuable Movie Stars of 2015. And finally, half of People’s Top 25 Celebrity Hot List, as of Aug. 25, 2016, is backing Clinton. For a more qualitative take on Trump’s claim, we turned to Hollywood blogger Perez Hilton. ""He’s dead wrong!"" Hilton told PolitiFact. ""Katy Perry is one of the biggest and highest-earning pop stars on the planet. Justin Timberlake just hosted a fundraiser for (Clinton). Meryl Streep and Barbra Streisand are legends. Trump himself is the one with D- and Z-list celeb support!"" (Full disclosure: Hilton supports Clinton and has been photographed wearing a Hillary Clinton onesie.) Not many of the 100 total celebrity Trump endorsers have also appeared with him on the campaign trail (notable exceptions include former Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight and several NASCAR drivers). Just one, Beth Chapman of A&E’s Dog the Bounty Hunter, gave to his campaign, according to our search. E-Poll Market Research did not have an E-Score on file for 13 of about 60 of Trump’s most prominent defenders. Randy Parker, a spokesman for the company, told us the Republican nominee’s list includes ""some more obscure folk."" ""The fact that so many of (Trump’s) people aren’t even in our database shows that his people are really the ones who are not hot,"" Parker said. The Trump celebrities with E-Scores averaged a 64, with Walker, Texas Ranger star Chuck Norris leading the pack with a score of 99. Other high-scoring Trump celebrities include actors Lou Ferrigno (97), Randy Quaid (96), and Paul Sorvino (94). Of the Republican National Convention speakers, Scott Baio of Happy Days clocked a 91, while Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson scored a 78 and soap star and underwear model Antonio Sabato Jr. came in at 71. No enthusiastic Trump Hollywood celebrity appeared on the lists from People, Forbes or Vulture, though Trump supporter Caitlyn Jenner was named Just Jared’s Most Popular celebrity of 2015. Our ruling Trump said the Hollywood celebrities endorsing Hillary Clinton are ""in many cases celebrities that aren’t very hot anymore."" Trump has a point that out of hundreds of celebrities endorsing Clinton, some have faded. But the data doesn’t lie. Many prolific Clinton-backing stars remain popular according to several metrics: social media influence, earning potential, and popularity on celebrity news blogs and websites. Supporters like Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Meryl Streep and George Clooney are arguably the most visible and enthusiastic. Trump’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57cb5021-de28-46f5-840e-64751fb508fe",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E5B600>],/factchecks/2016/aug/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-clintons-celebrity-backers-arent-very/

No, Kamala Harris Did Not Tell Joe Biden He’d Do ‘Whatever’ China Wants
","An image making rounds on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms claims Vice President Kamala Harris said during a 2019 Democratic debate that President Joe Biden would do ""whatever"" the Chinese government wants because they gave his son ""over a billion dollars.""  The image featured cropped and merged photos of Harris, who was a senator from California at the time, and Biden at the June 27, 2019, Democratic debate, which was held in Miami, Florida, and sponsored by NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.  The way the images are cropped and combined depicts Harris and Biden standing face-to-face, by deleting U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, who was standing at his lectern between Biden and Harris at the debate.  Text above the photos reads, ""Anyone remember Kamala telling Joe during the debate: ‘You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars.’"" There’s just one problem with the quote: According to transcripts of the Democratic debates, Harris never said it. We decided to look at the false claim and where it came from. Facebook flagged this image as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) One Facebook user’s post featuring the image had been shared more than 400 times as of April 30. Another was shared 183,000 times. The image racked up more than 3.3 million views within 24 hours. The claim and the transcripts The image’s claim references allegations that swirled around Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the time leading up to the 2020 election. Hunter Biden had an investment deal that involved the Bank of China while his father was serving as vice president, which former President Donald Trump and other Republicans touted as an example of improper ethics and corruption. Trump repeatedly stated that the business deal made the Bidens more than $1 billion. The business deal remains murky because of minimal disclosure requirements for international investments, and nobody has been able to independently verify how much Hunter Biden made off the deal.  In a previous fact check, PolitiFact found no evidence that either Joe Biden or Hunter Biden broke any laws, although experts in political ethics said the deal was unwise and put Joe Biden in an awkward position. Additionally, experts noted that relatives of high-ranking American public officials of both parties have routinely been courted by Chinese businesses. During the first five Democratic debates, Harris never discussed any of the controversy surrounding the Bidens. Harris suspended her presidential campaign on Dec. 3, 2019, so she was not present for the six remaining Democratic debates. Her only significant comment on China came during the Sept. 12, 2019, debate in Houston, Texas, when she was asked how her trade policy would differ from former President Barack Obama by moderator George Stephanopoulos of ABC. ""It's a complicated relationship,"" Harris said. ""We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable."" She added that the United States should also seek to partner with China ""on climate and the crisis that presents"" and ""on the issue of North Korea."" Harris did occasionally spar with Biden on stage, most notably in the first Democratic debate on June 27, 2019, when she said she ""wanted to speak on the issue of race"" and criticized Biden for his ""hurtful"" comments surrounding prominent segregationists and his opposition to busing. When Brown v. Board of Education was decided in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Berkeley Unified School District in Berkeley, California, implemented a busing program to integrate schools. Harris was part of the cohort that began kindergarten in the district during the second year of the program. Harris drew praise for her ""breakout"" moment on stage during the debate, but her comments to Biden were entirely based around race and the history of segregation, not China or Hunter Biden. We could find no evidence that Harris made any such statements elsewhere on the campaign trail. Her office declined to comment on the claim. Additionally, no other candidate made similar statements attacking Biden over allegations surrounding his son and China during any of the Democratic debates. Former President Donald Trump did attack Biden over China during two presidential debates. Our research A search of the false quote turns up results dating back to January 2021. The earliest evidence of the quote on Facebook was posted on Jan. 24 and appears to have come from a page run by a group called Activated Patriots. The group protects ""freedom, God and guns"" and is based in Wisconsin, according to their website.  The Activated Patriots post included the false quote, but in the post’s text, rather than in an image. It also included additional statements mischaracterizing several of Harris’s comments during the Democratic debates and on the campaign trail during and after her presidential bid. On April 29, the post was deleted from the Activated Patriots page. It had been shared more than 450 times. The false quote appears to have originated on Twitter on Jan. 23, less than 24 hours before the Activated Patriots post on Facebook, when @BlessUSA2024 tweeted it out.  The pro-Trump account was created in September 2019 and has more than 26,000 followers as of April 30. It has previously shared misinformation related to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims there is a deep state run by political elites, business leaders and celebrities that engages in pedophilia and works against former President Donald Trump and his allies.  The tweet had received 700 likes as of April 30 and was retweeted more than 600 times. PolitiFact reached out to Activated Patriots and the @BlessUSA2024 account for comment, but received no response. Our ruling Social media posts claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris told President Joe Biden during the Democratic debates, ""You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars."" Transcripts of the debates show that this is wholly incorrect.  Harris never made such a statement and rarely touched on China during the debates. When she did, she did not reference the murky allegations surrounding Biden’s son and his business dealings with Chinese companies. Harris made no such statements elsewhere on the campaign trail and none of Biden’s other competitors made similar comments.  Furthermore, the quote has not been substantiated by any reputable news organization and appears to have originated on social media from pro-Trump accounts. Therefore, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Congressman, carrying GOP complaint, leaves a lot out of infrastructure definition
","Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, was among several members of Congress to respond to President Biden’s first address to Congress the night of Wednesday, April 28. We’ve seen the claim before, as it is a major talking point from Republicans concerned about the price tag on Biden’s proposed $6 trillion stimulus combination of  The American Jobs Plan, American Rescue Plan, and American Families Plan. Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, made the claim in the Wednesday night GOP rebuttal to Biden’s speech, although Scott also said, ""Republicans support everything you think of when you think of ‘infrastructure’ Roads, bridges, ports, airports, waterways, high-speed broadband — we’re all in.""  PolitiFact reported previously that elements of infrastructure Scott listed would take up about 26% of Biden’s proposed spending in the proposed American Jobs Plan. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said only 6% of the jobs plan was for infrastructure of any type, which we rated Pants on Fire.  Citing the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, we’ve pointed out that transportation upgrades to rail, air and water travel, for example, would get $207 billion. Protecting land and water resources and upgrading drinking water supplies would get $161 billion, while power infrastructure and high-speed internet would get $100 billion apiece. Roads, bridges and highways would get $115 billion, for a grand total of $683 billion for infrastructure projects, based on what the Committee for a Responsible Budget estimates will be a $2.65 trillion cost if the plan gains congressional approval. That’s different from other reported figures or the plan and what Feenstra tweeted. At this point, the actual cost would not be determined until the legislation is negotiated, debated and adopted. Feenstra notes three Biden stimulus plans in his tweet and ties them to his complaint about infrastructure’s share. But, while the $1.8 trillion American Rescue Plan’s stated purpose is to ""change the course of the pandemic and deliver immediate and direct relief to families and workers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis through no fault of their own,"" the program’s fact sheet says.  But, that law, passed in March, includes $10 billion for local improvements to infrastructure to go along with direct payments to individuals, increased child tax credits, funds to local governments for COVID-19 vaccinations, support for small businesses, employed retention and paid leave credits and homeowner assistance. The proposed American Families Plan does not have an infrastructure component. It would authorize spending for universal pre-school, direct payments and tax breaks for families with children or in low-income brackets, summer and school meal programs for low-income families, free community college and selected studies in college for up to four years. It also calls for increasing the income tax rate for those making more than $400,000 in a year.  We asked Feenstra’s Washington, D.C., office in emails about the infrastructure spending beyond roads and bridges and also called his office but did not receive a response to the questions. Feenstra, as well as Scott and other Republicans for that matter, are correct about the share of the American Jobs Plan spending on just roads and bridges in Biden’s plans. But, focusing only on those two items paints a skewed picture of how much money from the president’s plan is tabbed for infrastructure as key Republican leaders define it. Feenstra didn’t give a full picture in his tweet. We rate the claim to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972EC100>],/factchecks/2021/apr/30/randy-feenstra/congressman-carrying-gop-complaint-leaves-lot-out-/

No, Kamala Harris didn’t attack Joe Biden on China during a primary debate
","More than a year before Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris to be his running mate, the future president and vice president sparred on the debate stage in Miami. In a tense exchange, Harris attacked Biden over his record on busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s. ""There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,"" she said. ""And that little girl was me."" Now, months into Biden’s term as president with Harris by his side, social media users have recast the exchange as a confrontation over Biden’s relationship with China. ""Anyone remember Kamala telling Joe during the debate: ‘You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars,’"" says an April 24 Facebook post.

Harris called off her campaign for president on Dec. 3, 2019. Before that, she participated in five Democratic primary debates, including the first in Miami. But transcripts of each debate from the Washington Post do not show Harris attacking Biden about China. Harris did mention China during a September debate in Houston, but the comment did not pertain to Biden or Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. ""It's a complicated relationship,"" Harris said. ""We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable. We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea."" Fact-checkers at Snopes, the Associated Press, Lead Stories and USA Today also found no evidence that Harris attacked Biden as the Facebook post claimed. Hunter Biden became a target of attacks from former President Donald Trump and his allies as Trump and Biden squared off on the campaign trail. Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into the Bidens led to the first of his two impeachments. In December, Hunter Biden confirmed his finances were the subject of a Justice Department probe. He has been involved in business dealings involving Chinese companies. But claims alleging wrongdoing by the elder Biden have generally remained unsubstantiated. A Facebook post said, ""Anyone Remember Kamala telling Joe during the Debate: ‘You will do whatever the Chinese tell you!

No, there is no evidence that spending time around vaccinated people causes death or disease
","As COVID-19 vaccine distribution continues, so does the spread of online misinformation about purportedly serious side effects — not just for the people who are vaccinated, but also for the people who come near them.  ""The Unvaccinated Beware, COVID-19 mRNA Shots Cause Death and Disease Through GMO Shedding,"" reads the title of a nearly 15-minute video posted on Facebook.  The video is a screen recording of someone navigating between several articles while providing a voiceover. The video’s narrator reads through several anecdotal accounts of women experiencing out-of-the-ordinary menstrual cycles and pregnancy complications — including one death — after being around people who were vaccinated.  ""There have been some fatalities from contact with the vaccinated,"" the narrator says. ""This does not mean hugging or kissing, necessarily. It means being in the same room, in the same elevator. It’s a dangerous time."" These health problems and deaths were attributed to ""shedding of the mRNA,"" according to the video narrator. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is not true. Being close to someone who has been vaccinated against COVID-19 cannot impact those who are unvaccinated. There is no evidence that anyone has died because they were near someone who was vaccinated.  Other fact-checking organizations have also debunked the claims in the video. And PolitiFact has debunked similar claims before. Recently, PolitiFact checked a claim about the vaccines affecting the fertility and menstrual cycles of unvaccinated individuals who were near vaccinated people and rated it False. Experts say that there are no parts of the vaccines that can be passed on to unvaccinated people. Dr. Kelly Moore, deputy director of the Immunization Action Coalition, said it is not possible that those who have received the COVID-19 vaccines are ""shedding"" materials that could cause unvaccinated individuals to experience side effects such as disease or death. Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN who writes a New York Times column, wrote in a blog post: ""An mRNA vaccine simply cannot affect other people. We don’t shed mRNA or spike proteins."" Similarly, experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters: ""There is no way for a COVID-19 vaccinated person to ‘shed vaccine.’"" Andrew Pollard, a professor of pediatric infection and immunity at the University of Oxford and a member of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told Full Fact that he couldn’t think of ""any biologically plausible mechanism for shedding"" any elements of the Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines after they’ve been administered. In addition, there is no evidence the COVID-19 vaccines have been linked to infertility or to pregnancy complications.  Those who are pregnant, trying to conceive or would like to get pregnant someday can get vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the CDC.  A Facebook video claims that people who aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19 should ""beware"" because being around people who have received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could cause ""death and disease.""

Claim about COVID-19 vaccines misinterprets the meaning of herd immunity
","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the term ""herd immunity"" has been tossed around as a future benchmark of progress in the fight against the virus. For over a year, health officials and news organizations have analyzed what herd immunity means for COVID-19, and whether and when the United States might achieve it. But we recently came across a post on Instagram that makes a series of problematic claims about the effectiveness of vaccines and the concept of herd immunity. Notably, it asserts that the benchmark revolves only around vaccines and can’t realistically be achieved because, ""100 percent of the population would have to be vaccinated for that to work."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This post is dubious for a couple of reasons. First, herd immunity does not depend on 100% of the U.S. population getting vaccinated. Everyone is encouraged to get the shot, because the more who do, the more likely it is that herd immunity can be achieved without putting too many more lives at risk. Second, herd immunity doesn’t mean that no one gets the disease. It means that if enough people get the vaccine or have some natural immunity from a previous infection, the virus’ spread can be contained.  The post bases its claim on the premise that ""today we take ‘herd immunity’ to mean that no one gets the disease if we all vaccinate."" That’s not the prevailing definition of herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when enough people are immune — either through vaccination or previous infection — to make its spread from person to person unlikely. That’s because an infected person is less likely to encounter a non-immune person to pass it on to, breaking that link in the chain of transmission.  When that happens on a large enough scale, the spread of the disease remains under control, though it’s not necessarily eradicated. ""Herd immunity is not ‘everybody is vaccinated therefore the disease goes away,’"" said Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the Immunology and Infectious Diseases Department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Herd immunity is, in fact, that enough people are vaccinated that the transmission chains are disrupted and people who are vaccinated, or not, are less likely to be exposed."" For COVID-19, scientists have tossed around different estimates of how much of the population needs to be immune, either naturally or by vaccine, in order for herd immunity to work well. The mathematical model for SARS-CoV-2 — which is derived based on how contagious the virus is and how the population behaves — puts it around 70 to 85 people out of every 100.  Even the most highly contagious viruses in the world don’t require 100% protection in a population to get them under control.   Take measles, for example. It’s considered the most contagious airborne virus that scientists are aware of, and medical experts say about 95% of the population needs to have protection for its circulation to remain low.  ""Before the vaccine was available for measles, 90% of people got measles by the time they were 15,"" Fortune said, adding: ""Measles isn’t gone, but the fact that a child now isn’t expected to be regularly exposed to it shows that herd immunity works."" In arguing that herd immunity can’t be achieved with vaccines, the Instagram post points out that vaccines don’t guarantee immunity. But the new COVID-19 vaccines’ high efficacy numbers undercut this point.  Clinical trials and follow-on studies show that the vast majority of people who get the COVID-19 vaccines are protected. ""The only people we found that don't produce an antibody response have highly dysfunctional immune systems,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech appeared to be 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 infection in a real-world setting (outside of clinical trials). And all three vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. have been proven to be highly effective at protecting against serious COVID-19 disease and death among those who do get infected. An Instagram post claims that vaccine herd immunity doesn’t exist because 100% of the population would need to get vaccinated for that to be achieved.  The post misinterprets the meaning of herd immunity.  Herd immunity occurs when enough people are immune — either through vaccination or previous infection — to make its spread from person to person unlikely. It doesn’t mean completely eradicating the disease through vaccination, and it does not require 100% of the population to be vaccinated.

Bipartisan police reform has been a struggle in the Senate. Here’s the story
","Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who has called on lawmakers to work together to achieve common ground, said that he proposed a police reform proposal last year, but Democrats thwarted his efforts. ""In 2015, after the shooting of Walter Scott, I wrote a bill to fund body cameras. Last year, after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, I built an even bigger police reform proposal,"" Scott said. ""But my Democratic colleagues blocked it. I extended an olive branch. I offered them amendments. But Democrats used the filibuster to block the debate from even happening."" Scott said negotiations with Democrats continue on police reform. ""My friends across the aisle all seem to want the issue more than they wanted a solution,"" Scott said. ""But I’m still working. I’m hopeful that this will be different.""  Scott made the comments during his GOP response to President Joe Biden’s address to a joint session of Congress.  Scott did propose a police reform bill in June 2020, but Democrats, who preferred their own version, blocked it. Each side accused the other of failing to negotiate in good faith, and neither party got its measure passed into law. Following the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, Senate Republicans and House Democrats wrote separate proposals for police reform.  Scott, the lone Black Republican in the Senate, was tasked with coming up with a police reform plan that would be acceptable to Republicans. Scott unveiled the Justice Act on June 17 and drew dozens of GOP cosponsors. ""I’ve been waiting for this for a long time. I’m sad that it takes another death to get here,"" Scott told NBC’s ""Today."" House Democrats unveiled the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act on June 8 and drew widespread support among their party. Scott’s Senate bill and the House Democrats’ bill had some similarities, such as making lynching a federal hate crime, increased data collection and funding for body cameras. Scott’s bill called for incentives, grants and study, while the Democrats’ version had more mandates. The proposals also had other key differences: Qualified immunity: Democrats sought to limit qualified immunity to make it easier for victims to sue police officers, while Scott’s bill didn’t change the practice. Chokeholds: Both aimed to curtail the use of chokeholds, but Scott’s bill had a more narrow definition of chokeholds than the Democrats’ bill. Both cut off funding to agencies as an incentive to create chokehold policies. No-knock warrants: The Democrats’ bill banned the use of federal no-knock warrants in drug cases and prohibited state and local agencies from receiving funds if they didn’t have a law prohibiting no-knock warrants in drug cases. Scott’s bill called for police agencies to report their use of no-knock warrants to the attorney general. Military equipment: The Democrats’ bill banned the transfer of surplus military weapons to police departments such as firearms, bayonets and grenades. The Senate version did not have that provision. President Donald Trump threatened to veto the Democrats’ bill if it reached his desk. Civil rights groups like the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund objected to Scott's bill and said it lacked a ""strong accountability framework for police officers."" The group said it steered more funding to police agencies rather than reimagining public safety and routing money to social services. The ACLU opposed Scott’s bill and said it failed to address systemic issues such as militarization of police departments and qualified immunity. The ACLU did not endorse or oppose the House Democrats’ police reform bill and called on lawmakers to go further on several provisions. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called for creating a bipartisan group to reach a deal, but Republicans sought a vote. Scott’s bill needed 60 votes to move forward, but it fell short on June 24, when Senate Democrats blocked the bill on a 55-45 vote. Two Democrats, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, along with independent Angus King of Maine, joined Republicans in voting to move the bill forward. King said the GOP proposal didn’t go far enough to address racial injustice, but ""my concern was that voting against it will end the discussion of this subject in the Senate for the foreseeable future."" Democrats dismissed the GOP bill as a ""political game"" that didn’t address the concerns of equal justice for Black Americans. ""And we're not going to play that game. And we're not going to be played,"" then-Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., told reporters. After the bill died, Scott said in a floor speech that he was open to multiple Democrats’ amendments on the bill, such as collecting data on all uses of force and the definition of chokeholds. ""We offered them opportunities, at least 20 I offered, to change it,"" Scott said. ""Their answer to me? You can't offer 20 amendments. I said why not? Because Mitch McConnell won't give 20 amendments. I spoke to Mitch McConnell. He said you can have 20 amendments. I told them that."" Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Democrats’ vote was an example of minority obstruction.  The context is that the House had crafted their own version that they preferred.  ""Democrats wanted a sign that Republicans would move in their direction on the issue and found the Scott measure to be an inadequate alternative,"" Smith said. ""Both sides could have gone public with half-way measures. Neither side did so."" The Democrats’ legislation passed the House June 25, a day after Scott’s Senate version hit a wall. But the House version didn’t reach a vote in the Senate. Democrats reintroduced the legislation this year, and it passed the House in March but has yet to reach a vote in the Senate. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin’s recent conviction for manslaughter and murder led to renewed calls by politicians to pass police reform. Scott has been trying to negotiate a compromise. The day after Scott’s speech, he was scheduled to meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to continue negotiations on the bill. Advocates for Floyd and others who died at the hands of police officers also met with lawmakers from both parties. One key sticking point for Republicans has been Democrats’ efforts to limit qualified immunity as a defense in civil lawsuits against police officers. Scott has called on making it easier for victims to sue police departments rather than individual officers.  In 2020, Scott said Democrats’ efforts on qualified immunity was a ""poison pill."" ""When you make it all about the individual officer, you run good cops out, you make it far more difficult to get anything accomplished, but if the actual conversation is around restitution and recourse, you can change the behavior of all officers, not simply one,"" he told Vox in July 2020. Scott says Democrats blocked his efforts at police reform. Scott proposed a bill in June 2020, but Democrats blocked it from moving forward. Scott omits the reason that Senate Democrats blocked the measure: They preferred the House version of a police reform bill Democrats put forward the same month.  While both parties faced pressure to adopt police reform, partisan bickering and maneuvers led to nothing passing, and efforts stalled weeks later. Bipartisan negotiations are now underway, but it remains to be seen whether they will reach a compromise.  We rate this statement Mostly True. RELATED: Fact-checking Sen.

Gov. Tony Evers doesn’t tell whole story with claim that new Foxconn deal saves taxpayers $2.77B
","Gov. Tony Evers has wasted no time touting Wisconsin’s new deal with Foxconn. The Democratic governor negotiated a new deal with the technology giant that would create 1,454 jobs and invest $672 million by 2026. In return, the company will receive a maximum of $80 million in tax subsidies — up to $37 million of which could be paid over the next two years.  The plan dramatically scales back promises of 13,000 jobs and $10 billion in investment negotiated under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker that would have cost the state nearly $3 billion. But the company’s proposed LCD manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant never came to fruition, and the company now seems to be shifting its focus to create a wider range of products on that campus.  Evers contends the new agreement is a better outcome for Wisconsin.  ""We fixed that agreement and found a better deal with Foxconn that will save Wisconsin taxpayers $2.77 billion while still bringing good, family-supporting jobs to Wisconsin,"" he tweeted on April 21, 2021. We’re going to focus on that number. Does the new Foxconn deal save taxpayers $2.77 billion? When asked for evidence to support the governor’s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to the difference in tax credits between the new agreement and what Walker negotiated.  The original plan would have provided Foxconn up to $2.85 billion in tax credits compared to $80 million under the new contract. The new deal includes $60.3 million in job and capital investment credits, plus another $19.7 million in performance credits if Foxconn meets and maintains job projections. If you subtract $80 million from $2.85 billion, you get the $2.77 billion Evers cited.  That means when the governor is talking about savings, he’s really referring to how much the state will spend on subsidies.  But how does that fit into the larger picture of taxpayer dollars? It’s first worth noting that Wisconsin has not yet given Foxconn any money.  The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. decided last year not to award tax credits to the company for work done in 2019 after determining it didn’t hire enough people. State officials expected the company to fall short for several more years and therefore didn’t plan to issue any subsidies during that time. Still, the state had to budget assuming Foxconn would meet its goals and be eligible for the money. For example, Cudaback said the 2019-21 state budget included roughly $211 million in case the company reached its job targets in the 2021 fiscal year.  ""That’s more than $200M that couldn’t be spent on other priorities like schools, healthcare, broadband so Wisconsinites lost out on having that money invested in those areas because it had to be budgeted for Foxconn even if they did not ultimately qualify to receive those credits,"" she said. It’s part of the process for the 2021-23 budget, too. In an April 23, 2021 letter to chairmen of the Joint Finance Committee, Administration Secretary Joel Brennan asked that the spending plan reflect $37.4 million for Foxconn from 2021-23, based on the new deal. Now, back to Evers’ original claim.  It’s clear that Foxconn affected the state’s bottom line because officials had to set aside money for tax credits should the company meet its end of the agreement. But as Cudaback noted, that money theoretically could have been spent on something else if it wasn’t already earmarked — meaning it still could’ve hit taxpayers’ pocketbooks.  The same is true for future savings, though none of that has been budgeted beyond the two-year spending plan in front of the Legislature. ""Because of the renegotiated contract, the $2.77 billion saved — or, on average, nearly $200 million per biennium — can be allocated for other purposes in the state budget rather than being earmarked for a potential Foxconn payoff,"" Cudaback said. Evers’ claim also doesn’t reflect the possibility that Wisconsin may never have paid a dime in subsidies under the previous deal, based on the slow progress and shrinking Foxconn plans. So, in that respect, can one really save money that may never have been spent? That’s part of the issue when Evers and others make such claims about tax incentives. On the other side, if the original deal had been fulfilled — and Foxconn met all of the investment and job goals — the state would have paid more. And if a fully-realized massive LCD facility was the result, the state would have also seen a much bigger boon in jobs and economic development in return for those incentives.  In a tweet, Evers said the new Foxconn deal ""will save Wisconsin taxpayers $2.77 billion."" The agreement does involve $2.77 billion less in state tax credits, which means taxpayers are on the hook for significantly less money. It’s important to note that the state had not paid subsidies to the company under the previous deal and wasn’t on track to do so for several years, so it’s possible much — or even all — of that never would have been paid.  That said, the new contract also frees up funds that officials could funnel elsewhere. There’s no telling how this will affect future budgets, but if the state does choose to reallocate that money and spend it elsewhere, taxpayers won’t enjoy the savings Evers boasted about.  Our definition for Half True is a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097477080>],/factchecks/2021/apr/30/tony-evers/gov-tony-evers-doesnt-tell-whole-story-claim-new-f/

FACT CHECK: Did San Francisco Have ‘Twice As Many Drug Overdose Deaths As COVID Deaths’ In 2020?
","San Francisco’s early and dramatic response to the coronavirus last year earned it praise as a model for fighting the pandemic. But during that time, was the city also experiencing a surge of fatal drug overdoses that far outpaced its COVID-19 deaths?  That’s what Republican Assemblyman Kevin Kiley of Rocklin claimed on social media this week.  ""San Francisco had twice as many drug overdose deaths as COVID deaths last year. This true state of emergency is met with political indifference if not encouragement,"" Kiley wrote on Twitter on April 26.  Kiley has filed numerous legal challenges against Gov. Gavin Newsom over the past year, claiming the Democrat and former San Francisco mayor has overstepped his authority during the pandemic.  We decided to fact-check the first part of his claim, which took off on Twitter and was shared more than 2,000 times within two days.  Did Kiley get his numbers right? Data from the city’s public health department and medical examiner’s office support his case. How Many People Died Of COVID-19 In San Francisco In 2020?  San Francisco was the first city in the nation to declare a coronavirus emergency in February of 2020, weeks before other major metros. The response contributed to San Francisco having one of the lowest COVID-19 death rates among major cities early last fall. As of late September, San Francisco was averaging about 12 deaths due to the coronavirus per 100,000 people. The next lowest city, Seattle, was averaging nearly three times as many deaths, according to Healthline.com, a health news and information website.  By the end of last year, San Francisco, which is home to nearly 875,000 people, had tallied 257 deaths due to the virus, according to data from the city’s Department of Public Health. That total increased rapidly this winter as the virus surged across California and many parts of the country. It now stands at 531 since the pandemic started, according to recent data.  But amid this relative success, did drug overdose fatalities dwarf San Francisco’s COVID-19 death toll, as Kiley claimed? A Look At San Francisco’s Drug Overdose Deaths In 2020  We asked Joshua Hoover, Kiley’s chief-of-staff, to provide evidence for the lawmaker’s statement. He pointed to a recent New York Times article that placed San Francisco’s drug overdose deaths at 713 last year, more than double the 257 COVID-19 deaths.  Though the article doesn’t point to a specific source, we found a report by the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner that more than backs up Kiley’s claim.  The report listed 697 accidental drug overdose deaths from January through December 2020. It describes the data as preliminary.  This is a screen shot from a February 2021 report on accidental overdose deaths by the San Francisco Medical Examiner’s Office.  Still, that total is more than two and a half times San Francisco’s COVID-19 deaths from last year. It is triple the city’s total from 2017, according to the Times article.  What Caused San Francisco’s Spike In Overdose Deaths?  San Francisco health officials say two key factors caused the spike in overdose deaths: The spread of the powerful opioid fentanyl across the city, and the isolation and despair created by the pandemic.  ""These deaths were on the uptick before the Covid pandemic. But much about the pandemic really impaired our ability to address it,"" said Margot Kushel, professor of medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. ""There’s no question we are losing way too many people to this preventable cause of death.""  Kristen Marshall is project manager for the Drug Overdose Prevention and Education Project, a city-funded program that coordinates San Francisco’s response to overdoses. She told the San Francisco Chronicle that the stay-at-home order led people to use drugs alone, which can be more deadly than when someone uses them under supervision. ""People at high risk went into isolation and that heightened the risk. The chaos put people at higher risk,"" she said. ""The worst months were in the dead of the summer when it was most chaotic for this community."" Kushel said communities can reduce overdose deaths by creating ""safe injection sites,"" or places where people can inject drugs under the watch of trained medical staff. Those sites are legal in Canada, Europe and Australia, but illegal in the United States.  Advocates say they provide professional supervision and a chance to connect people with treatment services. The California State Senate passed SB 57 this month to start a pilot program allowing safe injection sites in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles County. To become law, it would need approval from the state Assembly and Gov. Gavin Newsom. Kushel said communities can also reduce harm by providing drug testing services to identify deadly opioids such as fentanyl, which is often mixed into other drugs without a person’s knowledge.  Hoover, Kiley’s chief-of-staff, did not respond when asked what solutions the state lawmaker had for San Francisco or other places grappling with the drug overdose crisis.  Our Ruling Assemblyman Kevin Kiley claimed San Francisco had twice as many drug overdose deaths as COVID-19 fatalities last year.  Data from the city’s public health department and medical examiner’s office support the lawmaker’s claim. It should be noted that San Francisco had one of the lowest per capita COVID-19 death rates of any major cities.  Still, the city’s overdose deaths climbed rapidly during the pandemic compared with past years, reaching nearly 700 while the total coronavirus deaths was 257.  We rated Kiley’s claim as True.

No, Sen. Joni Ernst did not say liberals wanted to ban lasagna
","Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, appeared on the Senate floor on Wednesday, April 28, saying  President Biden was not uniting the nation and that he should listen to Republican voices. ""Frankly, the president only seems to be listening to the far left progressives within the Democratic Party, who live on their own fantasy island,"" Ernst said, pulling out a poster board.  On the visual aid was an image of an island with the phrases ""expand the court,"" ""tax increase,"" ""defund the police,"" ""end the filibuster now,"" ""Green New Deal,"" and ""Abolish I.C.E."" meant to represent priorities on the left to which Ernst argued Biden was catering to.  That afternoon, a doctored image of Ernst’s poster was posted on Twitter with the message, ""wtf even are some of these???????"" The post came from Keaton Patti, a comedy writer and actor who has contributed to The New Yorker, Funny or Die and the satirical McSweeney’s, and The Onion.   The image showed Ernst next to a poster with the same title, ""Liberal Fantasy Island,"" but some of Ernst’s original talking points had been replaced. Her note on tax increases was replaced with ""sex blimps."" Defund the police was replaced with ""Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" end the filibuster was replaced with ""only gay people get to go to restaurants,"" and abolish I.C.E. was replaced with ""abolish lasagna.""  Some users caught onto the joke, but others in Twitter replies sought clarification on whether or not the image Patti shared was real.  It wasn’t. Patti has garnered internet attention before for satirical work. In 2020, he published a book of scripts, essays, and advertisements that he wrote and marketed as if they came from robots that had consumed a certain genre of material and were attempting to rewrite it themselves. The book was inspired by Tweets he published in the same format.  Though abolishing lasagna was not one of the liberal fantasies on Ernst’s presentation, the senator has claimed the left is engaged in a ""War on Meat.""  On April 13 she introduced a bill that would prohibit federal agencies from establishing policies that prohibit eating meat in their dining facilities. The Daily Iowan previously reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a newsletter in 2012 encouraging government employees not to eat meat once a week, although the USDA did not impose a ban on meat consumption in its facilities. No action has been taken on the bill since it was introduced.  By the way, Ernst weighed in on the joke on Twitter later in the day.  ""For the record: I’m pro-lasagna,"" she wrote.  The image circling on Twitter was edited by a comedian to make a joke. None of Ernst’s talking points included sex blimps, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, only letting gay people eat at restaurants, or abolishing lasagna.  Like so many things on the internet, this started as satire but has been misinterpreted by some people who believe it’s real. If you’re wondering whether Ernst talked about liberals wanting to ban lasagna, she didn’t.

Despite all the talk, COVID-19 vaccination does not infect people with shingles
","Posts are showing up all over social media tying COVID-19 vaccinations to shingles and other painful skin disorders. The source of one such post was Alex Berenson, an author and vaccine critic whose posts are sometimes cited for misinformation. Berenson posted — first on Twitter, which then found its way to Facebook — a photo of a man covered in a severe rash. The man, according to the post, blamed the skin outbreak on a COVID vaccination he had weeks earlier. The post also included unsubstantiated information purported to be from the man’s doctors, indicating a likely diagnosis of a type of rash usually triggered by medications or infections, such as herpes simplex. It led Berenson to draw the conclusion that ""for #Covid vaccines, shingles and even more dangerous and painful skin conditions may be the new thrombocytopenia."" That is a reference to a low blood platelet condition reported among some people who experienced blood clots after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) Without more information, it’s impossible to know whether the picture was as described, or what might have led to the man’s condition. We reached out to Berenson by email, but he did not respond. However, in a related Twitter thread, Berenson went on to discuss a study conducted in Israel that looked at six shingles cases occurring post-vaccination in a group of about 500 people with immune disorders. The small Israeli study drew wide attention on social media and other outlets, and currently is the most-read article in the British Medical Journal’s Rheumatology. Some outlets, including the New York Post, ran stories on its findings, often with misleading headlines. That got us wondering: How strong is the science behind this connection? Shingles, also called herpes zoster, occurs in people who had chickenpox, a virus that causes itchy blisters. (Shingles can be prevented by the two-dose Shingrix vaccine.) After a person recovers from chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus that causes it can lie dormant in the body, and then reactivate years or decades later in the form of shingles. Both are part of the herpes virus family, which includes herpes simplex Types 1 and 2. Type 1 commonly causes ""cold"" sores around the mouth and lips and is spread by kissing or sharing things like toothbrushes. Type 2 can cause genital herpes, which is spread via sexual contact. Among the things that can reactivate these dormant herpes viruses are stress, drugs that suppress the immune system or simply aging. Neither the picture of the man with a rash or the findings of the small study in Israel prove cause and effect. In other words, just because a rash follows a vaccine by days or weeks does not mean the vaccine caused the rash. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said it’s natural for people to link events that occur within a short span of time, but he stressed it doesn’t prove causality. ""Just because B follows A doesn’t mean A causes B,"" he said. In considering whether there are links between a treatment and a side effect, researchers often follow two large groups of similar people, one group getting a particular medication or vaccine, the other not. If the vaccinated or medicated individuals experience a side effect at a greater rate than those not treated, there may be a connection. Safety is also monitored by tracking data on reported side effects. In the United States, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System includes unverified reports from patients, doctors and others about possible illnesses or symptoms that occur following immunizations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention watches those reports. ""So far, the data indicates that shingles and herpes are not occurring at an increased rate in the vaccinated population,"" said Schaffner, who encourages people who get a rash of any kind — or shingles — following vaccination to report it through that system. Even its authors said it was not designed to find a cause and effect. Instead, the study followed 491 people — all of whom were being treated for underlying autoimmune inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, making them more susceptible to shingles in general. Out of those, six women ages 36 to 61 developed shingles in the days and weeks after they received the Pfizer vaccination, for a prevalence rate of 1.2%. The researchers noted in their article that vaccine-related reactivation of shingles has been seen with other vaccines, such as those for influenza, hepatitis A and rabies. But there were no reports of herpes-related rashes in the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines. In the study, most of the cases were mild, five occurred after the first dose, and all five of those women went on to have their second dose with no additional adverse effects. The researchers said their observations cannot prove causality but should prompt ""further vigilance and safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination side effects."" Some media outlets, including the New York Post, ran headlines such as ""Herpes Infection Possibly Linked to COVID-19, Study Says."" That’s simply ""clickbait,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. No one is getting infected with herpes from vaccinations, he said. ""What the anti-vax community is doing is giving the impression that vaccinations are giving people herpes, which is simply not true."" Adalja objects to the headline and effort to scare people, but he also said it is plausible, if yet unproven, that vaccination could reactivate an existing herpes zoster virus. Other types of rashes and injection-site redness have certainly been reported by people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, reported on a group of 12 patients who had rashes that appeared four to 11 days after getting their first dose of the Moderna vaccine. Ice and antihistamines were used to treat most of the patients, half of whom experienced a rash again after the second shot. And there have been reports on social media and in the press of people reporting similar rashes following vaccination. Still, experts say those rashes may simply be a sign that the immune system is working. Such rashes are ""pretty innocuous and easily treated,"" said Adalja. An online post claims the COVID-19 vaccines cause shingles or other dangerous skin conditions. Although it contains a sliver of truth, it ignores important information. For instance, the evidence to date indicates this is an area to continue monitoring, but no direct link has been established between COVID-19 vaccination and shingles or other serious skin conditions. The study cited was not intended to prove cause and effect, and it was looking at patients who already had suppressed immune systems that made them more likely to get shingles whether they had a vaccination or not.

No, vaccinated people don’t make up 60% of new COVID-19 cases
","The worldwide push to get people vaccinated against COVID-19 is based on scientific evidence that shows that vaccines help reduce the spread of the virus and minimize the severity of infections in those who have been inoculated. But a widely shared social media claim suggests otherwise.  ""Yale public health professor suggests 60% of new COVID-19 patients have received vaccine,"" reads a screenshot of a headline shared on Instagram. The article pictured goes on to quote Yale professor Dr. Harvey Risch: ""Clinicians have been telling me that more than half of the new COVID cases that they’re treating are people who have been vaccinated."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It  was shared April 22 on Instagram by Leila Centner, co-founder of the 300-student Centner Academy, a private Miami school that made news a few days later for barring vaccinated teachers from having contact with students, citing debunked claims about unvaccinated people suffering adverse effects after being around those who are not. The claim is wrong. Risch made the comments in the post during an April 19, 2021, interview on ""Steve Bannon’s War Room"" video and podcast livestream. Here’s what he said in full: ""What clinicians are telling me is more than half of the new COVID cases that they’re seeing to treat is people who’ve been vaccinated,"" Dr. Risch said. ""They’ve estimated 60% of new patients they’ve been treating have been people who’ve been vaccinated."" Risch said that the American public is being ""sold on'' the COVID-19 vaccine, and that vaccine companies have ""provided no information"" on what the vaccines do to prevent the spread of infection. Risch’s claim, which appears to be anecdotal, does not line up with what data shows about COVID-19 cases among those who have been vaccinated. The CDC reported that as of April 20, 2021, more than 87 million people in the country have been fully vaccinated. Out of that number, 7,157 breakthrough cases, or cases in which a person gets sick with a disease after vaccination, were reported.  When those numbers are tallied up, the total number of breakthrough cases comes to only 0.008% of all fully vaccinated people. The week that Risch made his comment, April 12-19, there were 525,000 total new cases in the U.S, according to the CDC.  Even if all those 7,157 breakthrough cases came in that week (which is highly unlikely since vaccinations began in December) the percentage of new cases that came from people who had the vaccine would have been only about 1.4%.  Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, cited additional data from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published by the CDC on April 2, 2021, which studied 3,950 vaccinated healthcare workers and frontline personnel who received the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. The study showed that the vaccine was 80% effective after the first dose, and 90% after the second.  ""It’s just more evidence that if you’re vaccinated, you’re much, much less likely to be infected, which is what the approval studies also show."" Offit said that for the most part, all of the COVID-19 breakthrough cases have been mild or asymptomatic, and that the vaccine technology has worked extremely well in both pre-approval studies and now in the public.  ""It was used to stop a virus which has had a number of clinical and pathological surprises,"" Offit said. ""It didn’t appear to have any serious side-effect in pre-approval studies with tens of thousands of people, and now we know it doesn’t seem to have any serious side-effect when it’s been in more than a hundred million people, you know, two hundred million doses are out there. It is remarkable."" An Instagram post credits a Yale professor as saying that out of the new COVID-19 cases, 60% are patients who have had the vaccine. The CDC reported that as of April 20, only 7,157 breakthrough cases have been reported out of 87 million fully vaccinated people.

Kevin McCarthy repeats Pants on Fire claim that Biden will ‘control’ how much meat Americans eat
","President Joe Biden is not restricting access to red meat. But soon after Biden wrapped up his first address to Congress, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., repeated the Pants on Fire false claim that Biden’s climate plans would kick burgers and steaks off the menu. ""He wants control of your life. He’s going to control how much meat you can eat,"" McCarthy said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""Can you imagine that?"" Hannity, one of several Fox News and Fox Business Network personalities who had promoted the same false narrative days earlier, did not push back against McCarthy’s claim, even though a Fox News anchor recently acknowledged it is wrong.  .@GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy said Joe Biden is “going to control how much meat you can eat.” That is not true. https://t.co/YaolSbI2EF pic.twitter.com/Dplsr0qJPC A spokesperson for McCarthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in short, the top House Republican was up in arms over a Biden plan that doesn’t actually exist. The false claims about Biden coming after America’s hamburgers started with a Daily Mail article that wrongly linked his climate goals to an unrelated 2020 study from the University of Michigan, which examined the impact various dietary changes would have on U.S. carbon emissions. After Biden pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, the Daily Mail ran its article, which made projections as to what policies could potentially make Biden’s goal a reality. At one point, the article speculated that ""Americans may have to cut their red meat consumption by a whopping 90%,"" citing the Michigan study. But the study has no link to Biden’s plans. ""The study was published in January 2020, when Trump was still president, so it had nothing to do with Biden or his climate change plan,"" said Tulane University professor Diego Rose, one of the study’s three co-authors. ""It's all just sensational goo from ‘Fox & Friends.’"" ""The study shows that if we eat less meat, especially beef, we could substantially reduce our dietary carbon footprint. But that change in behavior is a choice that individuals will make."" In a separate statement, co-authors Martin Heller and Gregory Keoleian of the University of Michigan explained that one hypothetical scenario the study considered was a 90% reduction in beef combined with a 50% reduction in other meats. They found that such a change would reduce ""diet-related greenhouse gas emissions associated with agricultural production"" by 50%. ""But this is not a specific recommended policy for achieving a 50% reduction in U.S. carbon emissions,"" Heller and Keoleian said.  They added: ""President Biden’s climate plan does not directly refer to diet shift as a carbon reduction strategy, so the linkage to our study is baseless."" Biden’s climate plans do not include restrictions on red meat consumption, a White House official confirmed to PolitiFact. Biden never mentioned red meat when he announced his plan to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030, a move that would double the U.S.’s commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. He talked mostly about investing in U.S infrastructure by modernizing the grid and shifting toward electric vehicles, among other things.  McCarthy’s claim that Biden is ""going to control how much meat you can eat"" came days after the notion was widely debunked by fact-checkers and news outlets.  It also came after Fox News — which created a graphic about Biden limiting meat — acknowledged in an on-air correction that the ""graphic and the script incorrectly implied that it was part of Biden’s plan for dealing with climate change. That is not the case."" McCarthy said Biden is ""going to control how much meat you can eat."" Biden’s climate plans do not include restrictions on red meat consumption. Claims that they do trace back to a Daily Mail article that wrongly linked Biden’s new U.S. emissions target to an unrelated 2020 study examining the impact of hypothetical dietary changes on emissions.

Parker released a video to promote his bill, and he included this claim on Twitter and Facebook: ""Law enforcement violence is the leading cause of death for young Black men and women in the US.""   THE TIME FOR CHANGE IS NOW‼️Law enforcement violence is the leading cause of death for young black men and women in the US. I have introduced legislation to combat this issue in New York State. #DaunteWright #ExcessiveForce #policebrutality #lawmaker #blacklivesmatter pic.twitter.com/f5UVNflwrj Given the public interest in police use of force in Black communities, we wondered if Parker’s claim was accurate.  We approached his office, and spokesperson Raven Robinson sent us a research article by researchers from Rutgers University, Washington University and the University of Michigan that examined the risk of being killed by police use of force. The study, based on data from 2013 to 2018, found that ""police violence is a leading cause of death for young men in the United States."" Among Black men, about one in every 1,000 ""can expect to be killed by police"" over the course of their lives. The inequality in risk of death is greatest for Black men, the study found. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than are white men, while Black women are about 1.4 times more likely to be killed by police than are white women. We contacted the study’s lead author, Frank Edwards, and he told us that police violence is not the leading cause of death for any group.  Edwards, an assistant professor at the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University in Newark, said that police violence is not the leading cause of death for any age group in the United States. It’s the sixth leading cause for all young men in the 25 to 29 age group, Edwards said.  For Black men ages 25 to 29, it is the seventh leading cause of death, behind homicide, accidents, suicide, heart disease, HIV and cancer, according to the study and federal data. It is ahead of diabetes.   The study did not distinguish between the justified or unjustified use of force by police, and it excluded cases that police described as a suicide, those that involved a vehicular crash, or accidents such as overdoses or falls. We also approached the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which studies leading causes of death, though studies have shown that deaths caused by law enforcement are underreported in government databases.  Among non-Hispanic Black males ages 15-24, deaths due to use of lethal force by law enforcement would rank as the seventh leading cause of death in 2019, the most recent data available, according to CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard.  Among non-Hispanic Black women ages 15 to 24, there were four deaths due to use of lethal force by law enforcement in 2019. The count is low, and is unstable year to year, according to the CDC.  Researchers who study lethal use of force by law enforcement caution that there is no national data collection system. As a result, there is likely an underreporting of incidents in which police actions resulted in deaths, according to the study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Study authors also said that the database it relied on, Fatal Encounters, contains more police-related deaths than the CDC’s database, the National Vital Statistics System.   Researchers at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health also found that in the CDC database, misclassification of deaths involving police happen more in instances when the death was caused by something other than a gun, or if it happened in a low-income county.   Dr. Anthony Bui, a pediatric resident at University of Washington, is co-author of a 2018 study examining the years of life lost due to encounters with law enforcement.  Bui told PolitiFact that young Black men and women are disproportionately impacted by police violence. His study found that years of life lost from encounters with law enforcement disproportionately impacts young people, and the young people affected are disproportionately people of color.  Parker called police violence the leading cause of death for young Black men and women. His office pointed to a study that it said backed the claim. It didn't. The study’s lead author said that police violence is not the leading cause of death for any age group in the United States, though Black men and women are disproportionately impacted.  CDC data back this up.  Experts would like to see better official reporting of deaths caused by law enforcement. And research has shown that Black people are more affected by police violence. But no evidence supports Parker’s claim. If he had called police use of force a leading cause of deaths among young Black men, our ruling would not have been so clear cut. But he called it the leading cause. We rate his claim False.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DBF380>],/factchecks/2021/apr/29/kevin-parker/police-violence-leading-cause-death-young-black-me/

No evidence that ‘leaked’ email from a Canadian politician is authentic
","Social media users are resurfacing a chain email alleging that the Canadian government is using the COVID-19 pandemic as a cover to eliminate all debt, impose a police state, ""reset"" the economy and seize private property.  The email message, which social media users copied and posted to Facebook, purports to be a ""leak"" from an anonymous Liberal Party politician. It details a long list of harsh measures to combat the coronavirus, including mandatory vaccines, lockdowns, travel restrictions and the deployment of the military into major cities. According to the email, these measures will culminate with the total seizure of all Canadian private property. As part of the final phase of its COVID-19 response, ""the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the (International Monetary Fund) under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program,"" the message claims. ""In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever."" The message further alleges that individuals who do not agree with the plan will be ""relocated into isolation facilities"" and detained there until they agree to have their property seized.  The post with the text of the purported email was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There’s no evidence that the email is genuine, and its claims have no basis in fact.  The email purports to come from a member of a ""Strategic Planning Committee"" steered by the Prime Minister’s Office. However, spokespeople from Canada’s ruling Liberal Party and the Prime Minister’s Office both told us that there is no Strategic Planning Committee.  ""The post that you have referenced and others with the same content are not authentic, and no such committee exists,"" said Braeden Caley, senior director of communications for the Liberal Party.  The ""leaker"" of the email doesn’t provide any identification or proof of the claims. In addition, the email’s predictions of sweeping lockdown restrictions and business closures implemented simultaneously across all of Canada haven’t come to pass. Instead, Canadian provincial and territorial governments have imposed varying restrictions over the course of the pandemic in response to local case rates.  The email’s claims about Canada’s COVID-19 response mirror what has come to be referred to as the ""Great Reset"" conspiracy theory. The theory essentially holds that a group of ""global elites want to use the coronavirus as a tool to reorganize global societies and economies to their benefit at the expense of ordinary people, with the ultimate goal of a global totalitarian regime,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League.  There is no evidence to support this widely debunked theory, which has also been linked with the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.  The Great Reset theory gets its name from proposals put forth by two international organizations — the World Economic Forum and the International Monetary Fund — to combat economic inequality  In June 2020, the WEF proposed a ""great reset"" on capitalism to combat the way the pandemic was contributing to global economic inequality. It encouraged reforms to fiscal policy, industrial development and an economic system where corporations no longer sought to maximize shareholder profits at the expense of their workers and communities.  Similarly, the IMF advocated a ""Global Economic Reset,"" which aimed to promote an equitable recovery from the pandemic through time-limited debt suspensions for poor countries and public investments in health care.  Neither organization has advocated the seizure of private property or the creation of a totalitarian world government.  Facebook posts claim that a leaked email from a liberal party politician shows the Canadian government's plan to ""reset"" the economy and seize private property.  The email claims to come from a member of the ""Strategic Planning Committee"" of Canada, but no such committee exists. The claim echoes a widely debunked conspiracy theory known as the ""Great Reset.""  We rate these posts Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280972020C0>],/factchecks/2021/apr/29/facebook-posts/no-evidence-leaked-email-canadian-politician-authe/

No, it’s not illegal for a college or employer to require a COVID vaccine
","A viral Facebook post claims it is illegal for schools and employers to mandate vaccination against COVID-19, citing the vaccines’ emergency use authorization status. With all adults in the United States now eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, businesses and schools are continuously assessing how to safely allow for employees and students to return to in-person operations. ""If any college, public school, employer, etc tries to ‘mandate’ the latest prick it’s completely illegal for them to do so,"" the April 21 all-caps post reads. ""The prick has been released under the EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) & is not FDA approved. It cannot be mandated."" The post was flagged as part of efforts by Facebook to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is inaccurate. A growing number of employers and colleges across the country are mandating that workers and students get vaccinated. And while their decisions could face legal challenges, scholars say courts have found such institutions to be on solid footing.  First, emergency use authorization is a declaration made by the secretary of health and human services that allows for emergency use of drugs or products during a public health emergency such as a pandemic. To qualify for emergency use, the new drugs must be fully tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. Drug makers have to submit reports on the outcomes and effects on every participant. The chemistry behind the drug, details of the manufacturing process, and the details of the quality controls in place are also required. Second, there are no legal mechanisms in place that would prevent any institution, whether an employer or school, from mandating COVID-19 shots, though exemptions can be made for those with certain disabilities or sincerely held religious beliefs, as provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As PolitiFact has reported, vaccination records are already required for certain jobs, school registration and travel abroad. The World Health Organization requires travelers to be inoculated against yellow fever, and some countries have additional vaccination requirements, such as for the poliovirus. Immigrants to the U.S. must be vaccinated against a slew of diseases.  Dr. Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, whose research at the University of California Hastings School of Law focuses on legal issues related to vaccines, told PolitiFact in an interview that while some may test this in court, institutions that are mandating the vaccine are ""not doing anything wrong."" In February, Rubinstein Reiss wrote a post for Harvard Law’s bioethics blog arguing that, although there was some room for legal interpretation, a vaccine mandate would meet little resistance in a court of law. ""Employment in the United States is at-will, and employers can fire employees for almost any reason, with few exceptions from anti-discrimination laws,"" she wrote. ""Employers can certainly fire employees for violating a health and safety requirement, or for outright refusing to follow it. Vaccine mandates in the workplace are such a requirement, and have been used for a long time, for example, to require influenza vaccines for health care providers."" The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in March 2020 updated its guidance concerning worker-protection laws to state that employers could dismiss employees who opt to not get vaccinated due to religion or disability so long as the employer has exhausted all ""reasonable accomodations."" Similarly, as of April 27, at least 108 U.S. colleges and universities — both public and private — were requiring students and staff to be fully vaccinated against the novel coronavirus before returning to campus this fall, according to a Chronicle of Higher Education database. They include the University of California system, Yale University, University of Notre Dame and University of Michigan. A California court in December 2020 upheld the University of California system’s mandate from July of the same year that all returning students taking classes in person receive the flu vaccine.  Citing data from the American College Health Association, The Wall Street Journal reported last fall that in a sample of 86 higher education institutions, roughly 14% required flu shots, and nearly 70% were beefing up efforts to encourage participation among students and staff. There are no legal or legislative mechanisms that broadly prohibit employers or schools from mandating vaccinations. It is not illegal for them to do so, though federal law stipulates that exemptions can be made for those with conflicting religious convictions and certain disabilities. We rate this claim False.

Labeled swabs in photo are for quality control, not a sign COVID-19 tests are fixed
","More than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation is still spreading online about the  tests used to diagnose whether someone has the infection.  The latest claim comes in the form of a photo circulating on Instagram, which appears to show two packages of SARS-CoV-2 antigen test swabs, with one labeled as a ""positive control swab"" and the other a ""negative control swab."" (Antigen tests detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which implies current viral infection.) ""Nothing to see here folks!"" reads the post’s caption. ""It’s perfectly NORMAL to have PCR TESTS that are labelled ‘Positive’ and ‘Negative!’ There’s no conspiracy involved at all! They aren’t trying to manipulate and control the test results in any way! Trust your leaders."" Text overlaid along the bottom of the photo says: ""Picture taken secretly by a nurse on shift. Name not mentioned for obvious reasons."" An Instagram post suggests that COVID-19 tests are fixed because a photo shows two packages of antigen testing kits with the labels ""positive control swab"" and ""negative control swab."" This is a misinterpretation of the labels. Positive and negative control swabs are routinely included in testing kits for quality control — to ensure that the test is working correctly — not for patient testing. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972DA380>],/factchecks/2021/apr/28/instagram-posts/labeled-swabs-photo-are-quality-control-not-sign-c/
