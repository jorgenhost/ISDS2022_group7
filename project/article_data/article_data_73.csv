Did Hillary Clinton change position on the Cuba embargo?
","Hillary Clinton gave a speech in Miami in which she called for lifting the Cuba embargo -- and she did it on the home turf of embargo supporters and GOP rivals former Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. ""The Cuba embargo needs to go, once and for all,"" she said at Florida International University July 31. The anti-Democratic America Rising PAC accused Clinton of making a ""sudden flip flop on Cuba."" Well, it wasn’t exactly sudden. We decided to put Clinton’s statements since 2000 on the embargo on our Flip-O-Meter, which doesn’t pass judgment on changing stances but evaluates whether a candidate has flipped and to what extent. Some voters see some flips as a sign of inconsistency, while others view flips as a sign that a politician has the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of constituents. First, a word about lifting the embargo, which would require action by Congress. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act which prevents the embargo from being lifted until Cuba holds free and fair elections, frees political prisoners and allows for a free press and labor unions. Cuba did release some prisoners as part of the deal with the United States but has not met all of these conditions. 2000 Clinton spoke about Cuba in 2000 when she was running to be the U.S. senator from New York. After a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in October that year, an audience member asked Clinton for her position on the embargo. ""I believe before the United States should lift the embargo, Castro should make some good faith show of moving toward ending repression, freeing political prisoners and some steps toward democratization,"" she said. Clinton also said that while she supported increasing food and medicine exports to Cuba and allowing more travel, ""I’m not ready to vote to lift the embargo."" 2008 During her first presidential bid in 2008, Clinton favored maintaining the embargo. (So did Obama at the time, though he would later change his stance.) In July 2007, Obama said in a debate he would meet with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The next day Clinton said that was ""irresponsible and, frankly, naive."" In a December 2007 debate, Clinton said: ""Until there is some recognition on the part of whoever is in charge of the Cuban government that they have to move toward democracy and freedom for the Cuban people, it will be very difficult for us to change our policy."" In January 2008 in a statement accompanying a questionnaire released by the Cuban American National Foundation, Clinton said now is ""not the time to consider wholesale or broad changes to our Cuba policy."" In a debate on Univision in February 2008, Clinton said ""as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction."" 2014 to 2016 In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that near the end of her tenure as secretary of state, she recommended that Obama review the embargo. She wrote that the embargo ""wasn’t achieving its goals, and it was holding back our broader agenda across Latin America. After 20 years of observing and dealing with the U.S.-Cuba relationship, I thought we should shift the onus onto the Castros to explain why they remained undemocratic and abusive."" When Obama made his announcement on Dec. 17 about the change in Cuba policy, Clinton said  she supported the change. The speech in Miami was Clinton’s first major speech as a presidential candidate about Cuba policy. It occurred amid the backdrop of polls that show the majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba. During her speech, Clinton explained that she had supported the embargo in the past. The Helms-Burton law was signed after the Cuban Air Force shot down the Brothers to the Rescue plane, killing volunteers on board. Clinton said ""with their deaths in mind, I supported the Helms-Burton Act to tighten the embargo."" But she said that the embargo was a ""failed policy"" and said she agrees with Obama’s call on Congress to drop the embargo. ""That last step about the embargo is crucial, because without dropping it, this progress could falter,"" she said. ""The Cuba embargo needs to go, once and for all."" She also said that if Congress won’t act to make it easier for more Americans to go to Cuba, she will use her executive authority to do so. Our conclusion In her 2000 campaign for Senate, Clinton clearly stated that she wasn’t ready to lift the Cuba embargo. During her first bid for president in 2007, she repeatedly called for reforms in Cuba before any such changes to the embargo. But by 2014, she was a critic of the embargo and said it hadn’t achieved it’s goals. In a speech in Miami on July 31, Clinton forcefully stated that she believes it is time to drop the embargo. Clinton has made a full change of position, so we rate it a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2015/aug/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-cuba-embargo-change-position-did/

Did George W. Bush 'borrow' from Social Security to fund the war in Iraq and tax cuts?
","Evoke George W. Bush, his income tax cuts and the war in Iraq, and you’re sure to arouse some liberal ire. Suggest that Bush financed those projects by plundering Social Security’s retirement coffers, and you’ve got yourself a popular meme. ""Next time a Republican tells you that ‘Social Security is broke,’ remind them that Pres. Bush ‘borrowed’ $1.37 trillion of Social Security surplus revenue to pay for his tax cuts for the rich and his war in Iraq and never paid it back,"" reads one version of the meme, which appeared on the Facebook pages of Occupy Democrats and Americans Against the Republican Party. A number of readers asked us to check out the claim, so we decided to take a look. The meme seems to extrapolate a point made in a 2009 newsletter post by Allen W. Smith, a professor of economics emeritus from Eastern Illinois University. ""Bush spent every dime of Social Security surplus revenue that came in during his presidency. He used it to fund his big tax cuts for the rich, and much of it was spent on wars,"" Smith wrote. The meme’s claim and Smith’s argument circle back to how Social Security funds are managed. Experts say words like ""borrow"" and ""raid"" don’t really capture how the system works. Bonds, ‘borrowing,’ and Bush For about 50 years, Social Security was a ""pay-as-you-go"" system, meaning annual payroll taxes pretty much covered that year’s benefits checks. Then in 1982, President Ronald Reagan enacted a payroll tax hike to prepare for the impending surge of retiring baby boomers, and a surplus began to build. By law, the U.S. Treasury is required to take the surplus and, in exchange, issue interest-accruing bonds to the Social Security trust funds. The Treasury, meanwhile, uses the cash to fund government expenses, though it has to repay the bonds whenever the Social Security commissioner wants to redeem them. In this broad sense, Bush technically did ""borrow"" Social Security surplus to pay for the income tax cuts and the Iraq war. But even if we use this loose definition of the word, we still run into a few issues. First, the amount of surplus Bush ""borrowed"" is actually around $708 billion, a little more than half of the $1.37 trillion claimed in the meme. While around $1.52 trillion in bonds was added to the trust funds from 2000 to 2008, the Treasury only has access to the cash revenue collected every year, not the interest accrued on the entire surplus. Second, Bush didn’t exclusively spend on the war, which has an estimated cost of $1.7 trillion. Other big costs include the financial bailout in 2008. ""Since all money is green, the cash that the Treasury received from the Social Security surplus was not earmarked for any specific government program,"" said Andrew Eschtruth, a former Social Security research analyst at the U.S. Government Accountability Office and current spokesperson for the Center on Retirement Research at Boston College. The larger question is whether the existence of the surplus influenced Congress’ spending decisions, but Eschew pointed out that no one can prove what was on the lawmakers’ minds. ""The idea that lawmakers consciously thought, ‘We can only go into Iraq because of the surplus’ is a stretch,"" he said. Third, if we characterize the entire trust fund system as the government borrowing from Social Security, Bush is by no means the only debtor. ""That’s how the Social Security trust fund has worked ever since the program started, so there’s no point in focusing on Bush,"" said Andrew Biggs, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""You could focus on pretty much any president."" That being said, some nonetheless contend that Bush’s case is unique. Smith, a self-described progressive, told us in an interview that the tax cuts wouldn’t have been possible without the surpluses funded by payroll taxes. Maintaining payroll taxes (everyone pays the same rate) while cutting income taxes (rates are much higher for the rich) effectively streams the money from lower- and middle-income earners into the pockets of millionaires, according to Michael Hiltzik, a financial reporter with the Los Angeles Times. ""Bush was able to do whatever he wanted without raising income taxes,"" he said. Replenishing the coffers As for the claim that Bush ""never paid back"" what he reaped, experts told us that doesn’t really make sense. The meme’s language implies that Bush bailed on a loan, but no one was really pressing him for repayment. During his presidency, the Social Security trust fund was still running surpluses (which stopped in 2010), enough to cover the benefits checks, and had no need to cash in their bonds (which won’t happen until 2020). The larger question posed by critics of the trust fund system is if and how the government will provide cash for all the bonds, now totalling  $2.8 trillion. These bonds are a special class of securities unique to the Social Security fund that can’t be sold. Because they’re not-marketable, some contend that they’re ""worthless IOUs."" ""These special-issue things, they’re all in a filing cabinet in West Virginia. That’s the entire trust fund,"" Smith said in an interview. ""There’s no trust, and there are no funds."" Experts told us there's no question that the Treasury will repay the Social Security surplus (including what was accumulated during the Bush years) when the trust fund starts redeeming the bonds in 2020. Otherwise, says Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times, ""you’d have to march 40 years worth of Treasury, Labor, Health and Human Services secretaries, Social Security commissioners, and public trustees -- Republicans and Democrats -- into prison."" To Paul Craig Roberts, the assistant Treasury secretary under Reagan, the bonds are harbingers of more tax hikes and more public borrowing to come. Biggs said the bonds are like money that we owe ourselves. ""The bonds are worthless to the taxpayer as a way of actually paying for Social Security, since those bonds must be paid off by the taxpayer,"" he said. Hiltzik, though, dismisses these concerns as alarmism. He pointed out that taxpayers who would foot most of the bill for surplus repayment are those who pay higher income tax rates and who reaped the benefits of the Bush tax cuts. As for borrowing to cover the bonds, doesn’t the meme suggest that’s what the government's been doing the whole time? ""You’re not actually increasing the public debt. If you have to redeem $100 million bonds and you do it by borrowing $100 million, the net change is 0,"" Hiltzik said. Our ruling A Facebook posts says, ""Bush ‘borrowed’ $1.37 trillion of Social Security surplus revenue to pay for his tax cuts for the rich and his war in Iraq and never paid it back."" By law, the Social Security surplus is converted into bonds, and the cash is used by the Treasury to pay for government expenses. If we agree that this is ""borrowing,"" every president since 1935 has done it, to fund all sorts of things. Even if Bush ""borrowed"" from the surplus, the amount is more like $708 billion, and the borrowing wasn’t earmarked for a special purposes. As for not ""paying back,"" the bonds won’t need to be repaid until 2020. Overall, the claim is misleading and confuses many points. So we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/03/facebook-posts/did-george-w-bush-borrow-social-security-fund-war-/

Jack Hanna talks Cecil on ""This Week,"" claims Africa's lion population is in major decline
","As experts debate legal consequences for the Minnesota dentist who killed well-known Zimbabwean lion Cecil, conservationists and animal rights activists are using the opportunity to highlight threats to the long-term viability of lions in the wild. Animal expert and television personality Jack Hanna, who is also the director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, emphasized how quickly the lion population has decreased within his lifetime on ABC's This Week. ""In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions,"" Hanna said in the Aug. 2 interview. ""In the mid-'70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000."" We wondered if Hanna’s claim about the lion population was true. Has the population really shrunk by more than 90 percent in 68 years, and if so, why? When it comes to counting lions, accurate numbers are almost as elusive as the animals themselves. 1940s Most scientists and researchers agree that the number of lions in the wild is in decline. The Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as ""vulnerable"" on its threat scale, just one level below ""endangered."" It’s the speed of the decline that is in dispute. A spokesperson for Hanna said he was citing loose figures from the National Geographic Society’s Big Cats Initiative. The organization’s page on lions estimates that there were around 450,000 African lions in the 1940s, 100,000 in the 1980s, and 20,000 today — almost exactly mirroring what Hanna said. Other research questions some of Hanna's figures. He claimed more than 450,000 lions roamed the savannahs in the 1940s, but detailed studies of the population weren’t conducted back then. That means data for that period is virtually nonexistent. Susie Weller, a spokeswoman for Panthera, another big cats advocacy group, cited her organization’s own estimate that there were already as few as 200,000 ""over a century ago."" In other words, no one really knows how many lions there were in the 1940s. ""You might even see numbers in the millions,"" said Stuart Pimm, a professor of conservation ecology at Duke University and a contributor to the Big Cats Initiative. 1970s Hanna then claimed there were 100,000 lions in the wild during the 1970s. No empirical data exists for that time either, not that scientists haven't tried to make a best guess.  In 1996, a team of researchers employed land-use data to predict there were around 75,800 lions in 1980. The study, which was not published, is widely cited and was conducted at Cranfield University’s International Eco Technology Research Centre in the United Kingdom. Pimm said that this strategy was one of the more reliable ways to estimate the size of the population. ""What we can consider,"" he said, ""is how much lion habitat there was back then, and then approximate how many lions fit into that area. But if you’re going to put a number on it, you have to be careful to couch it in very, very approximate terms."" The geographic analysis is the closest anyone has come to a population count for that time, and it’s a rough guess at best. Jason Riggio, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Davis and the author of a study on lion populations, said the 1980 number ""arguably should not be cited as fact"" because it doesn’t take into account expert opinions or survey data. Hanna’s claim that there were 100,000 lions left in the 1970s isn’t far off from the closest estimate for that decade, yet isn’t based on any convincing data. Today Hanna was more on target when he said there ""are less than 30,000"" lions left in the wild today. A widely used figure for the present population comes from the 2012 study led by Riggio. The paper, which combines data from two counts in the early 2000s, puts the population ""between 32,000 and 35,000."" Other organizations cited the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species as an authoritative source for species population numbers and trends. The Red List questions Riggio’s numbers, arguing that, among other issues, his team’s use of older figures ignored downward trends that may have taken place in some regions. ""We have greater confidence in the estimate of fewer than 20,000 lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000,"" reads the group’s file on lions. Still, Hanna’s claim that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild today is within the range of these two estimates. Lions, Pimm said said, stake out in some of the most unforgiving natural habitats in the world, making them hard to locate, spot and count. ""There are roughly 30,000 lions in Africa,"" said Pimm, ""and they’re spread out over a massive area. People just don’t realize how big the continent really is."" Some researchers in the field, including Riggio, are reluctant to mention specific numbers for the changing lion population given the problematic data. But the experts agreed that Hanna's general point about a massive decline in the species is accurate. The threat lions pose to farms means that ""they are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa,"" according to the IUCN, and growth in the bushmeat market has led to a decrease in the abundance of their prey. While hunters claim that trophy hunting in small numbers is a valuable way to finance conservation, the IUCN has reported an unsustainable number of kills in regions across the continent. Our ruling Hanna said, ""In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions. In the mid-'70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000."" Counting lions in the wild is extremely difficult and requires a lot of estimation. Any hard numbers, therefore, should be taken with a grain of salt. Hanna’s claim reflects the consensus among researchers that lion numbers are in decline. The exact figures are up for some deabte, but his point is certainly valid. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/03/jack-hanna/jack-hanna-talks-cecil-week-claims-africas-lion-po/

Obenshain says Virginia's crime and recidivism rates have dropped since parole abolition
","Republicans are denouncing Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s efforts to study whether Virginia’s no parole policies, in effect since 1995, should be eased. Among the most vocal critics is state Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, who ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in 2013. Here’s what he said during a July 21 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond. ""We’ve been studying this for the past 20 years and we’ve got great experience and shown that this whole truth-in-sentencing movement actually works, and what the governor is doing is messing with success. Our crime rate has dropped to, what, third lowest in the country; our recidivism rate is down by 20 percent, and that’s the second lowest in the country. The governor just doesn’t need to do this."" Virginia’s no-parole policy -- a legacy of former Gov. George Allen, a Republican who served from 1994 to 1998 -- requires that criminals serve at least 85 percent of their prison sentences. McAuliffe, a Democrat, says he’s not talking about easing the program for violent offenders. But the governor has appointed a bipartisan commission to explore whether there are better ways to handle thousands of non-violent inmates, particularly drug offenders. The governor’s action is sure to be an issue this fall when all General Assembly seats are up for election. So we decided to see whether Obenshain’s statistics on the drop in crime and recidivism rates since the advent of no-parole hold up. Crime rates Obenshain said his information that Virginia has the third lowest crime rate came from a staff briefing on parole reform given to the Senate Finance Committee last November. The PowerPoint presentation cited statistics from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report dating back to 1994 -- the year before no-parole went into effect. One slide said Virginia had the third lowest violent crime rate in 2013 -- the most current year available -- and called it a ""significant improvement"" from 1994, when the state ranked 14th. We verified those rankings through the FBI reports. The ranking, however, needs some context. Violent crime has been has been waning throughout the U.S. in recent decades. Nationally, 714 people out of every 100,000 were violent crime victims in 1994; that dropped 368 in 2013, a 48.4 percent decrease. In Virginia, 358 people per 100,000 were victims in 1994. That dropped to 188 in 2013, a 47.4 percent decrease. In other words, Virginia’s decline in violent crime rates is consistent with national trends. The Powerpoint slide that Obenshain cites does not connect Virginia’s decrease to no-parole. To the contrary, it contains this caveat: ""There are many factors involved in the national drop in crime rates over the last two decades, many of which are not unique to Virginia."" The FBI also compiles property crime rates. Virginia has also seen a decline in this category that is consistent with U.S. trends. Nationally, 4,660 people out of every 100,000 were property crime victims in 1994. That fell to 2,732 in 2013, a 41.4 percent decrease. In Virginia, 3,690 per 100,000 were victims in 1994, and that dropped to 2,066 in 2013, a 44 percent decline. Recidivism rates Obenshain also cited the Finance Committee briefing last November as his source for claiming that Virginia’s recidivism rate has dropped by 20 percent and is the second lowest in the nation. A slide in the presentation said, ""Virginia’s rate has dropped from 28 percent for offenders released in (fiscal year) 2004 to 22.9 percent for those released in (fiscal) 2009. Virginia has the second lowest recidivism rate among the states that have a comparable measure. Virginia had the eighth lowest recidivism rate for offenders released in 2004."" The figures come from the Virginia Department of Corrections. You may have noticed that the drop between the years Obenshain cites is 5.1 percentage points. But you have to pay close attention to language. The decrease from 28 to 22.9 is an 18.2 percent drop, which the senator rounds to 20 percent. Virginia’s computes its recidivism rate by calculating the percentage of of inmates who are returned to prison for committing new crimes within three years of their original release. DOC records show the rate was 25.4 percent for prisoners released in 1992 -- three years before no parole began. So the decrease in the rate since the advent of the policy is about 10 percent -- or half the figure Obenshain offered. Now, let’s discuss Virginia’s national ranking. The DOC has distributed a chart showing that Virginia’s 22.9 percent for prisoners released in 2009 was the second lowest in the nation. There are no national standards for computing recidivism rates. DOC uses the three-year recidivism rates other states publish. Tama Celi, statistical analysis and forecast unit manager for DOC, the Virginia Department of Corrections, said the footnoted chart does not offer an apples-to-apples comparison. The years for each state’s recidivism rate vary, she said, and different states have different criminal laws defining thresholds for violations. ""The states are measuring their own criminal justice systems and laws,"" she said. Two experts on recidivism told us comparing state numbers has little value. They noted that states have different ways of defining three-year recidivists. Some like Virginia, with lower rates, require a high standard of a former inmate being sent back to prison. Others, with higher rates, require lower standards for recidivism such as being convicted or arrested for a crime. ""You want to believe these crime statistics are solid, but they really don’t tell you much,"" said Danielle Rudes, a professor of criminology at George Mason University. ""To me, they don’t offer any evidence that Virginia’s abandonment of discretionary release has been successful. They don’t offer any evidence to the contrary, either."" Adam Gelb, director of the Public Safety Performance Project and The Pew Charitable Trusts, agreed. ""On the surface, it seems like recidivism rates are a straightforward issue but, in reality, it’s fraught with complexity,"" he said. Gelb directed a Pew effort several years ago to equate all state recidivism rates by a standard formula. The study found that Virginia had a 28.3 percent, three-year recidivism rate for prisoners released in 2003. That ranked fifth among the 41 states that cooperated. The study broke down recidivists into two categories -- those who returned to jail for committing new crimes and those who went back for violations such as breaking parole or probation conditions. Virginia’s recidivism rate for new crimes was 23 percent, which ranked 28th among 41 states. Its recidivism rate for technical reasons was 5 percent -- the fifth lowest among the states. Our ruling Obenshain says that since parole abolition, ""Our crime rate has fallen to third lowest in the country, our recidivism rate is down 20 percent and that’s the second lowest in the country.’ Virginia’s violent crime rate did drop to the nation’s third lowest  in 2013. The recidivism rate is a stickier issue. It fell by 10 percent over the last 20 years -- half of what Obenshain said. And the No. 2 national ranking, released by Virginia’s DOC, is fraught problems because different states compute their recidivism rates in vastly different ways. But on the whole, crime trends have gone down in Virginia and we rate Obenshain’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/03/mark-obenshain/obenshain-says-virginias-crime-and-recidivism-rate/

97% of Planned Parenthood's work is mammograms, preventive care, O'Malley says
","The vast majority of Planned Parenthood’s work goes toward mammograms and preventive care, said former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. Since an anti-abortion group released videos Planned Parenthood officials talking about aborted fetal parts, Republicans have pushed to take away federal funding from the women’s health organization. Democratic presidential candidates, on the other hand, are showing their support, if subdued. O’Malley said he hadn’t seen the videos, speaking to reporters in New Hampshire July 26. ""And I don't generally make a habit of responding to right-wing videos,"" O'Malley said, according to Washington Post’s Dave Weigel. ""I do know that 97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health. So that's what I know, but I'll defer to others for commenting on that video and whatever videos they're pumping out there."" Is 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood does mammograms and other preventive care, as opposed to abortions? O’Malley spokeswoman Haley Morris pointed us to a Planned Parenthood press release that had a similar, but not identical, statistic. ""More than 97 percent of Planned Parenthood's services are primary and preventive health care, including lifesaving cancer screenings, birth control, testing and treatment of STDs, annual exams and health counseling,"" the 2011 release said. As we’ve found in previous fact-checks, Planned Parenthood comes to this number by adding up the number of individual services provided each year. In total, they provided nearly 11 million services in 2013, according to their most recent annual report. (Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, so many received multiple services.) Here’s the breakdown from the annual report: Abortions: 327,653 Sexually transmitted infection/disease testing and treatment: 4,470,597 Contraception: 3,577,348 Cancer screening and prevention: 935,573 Pregnancy tests: 1,128,783 Prenatal services: 18,684 Family practice services: 65,464 Adoption referrals: 1,880 Urinary tract infection treatments: 47,264 Other: 17,187 Based on this list, it’s accurate that abortion procedures only count for 3 percent of all services provided, meaning 97 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are other forms of reproductive and primary care. By far, contraception and STI/STD testing and treatment are the most frequented services. Of their services, Planned Parenthood considers many to be preventive care in that they manage health and prevent disease or worse problems down the line. This includes STI/STD testing and treatment, contraception and cancer screening and prevention -- 8,983,518 services provided in 2013. Not included in this list are abortions, pregnancy tests, prenatal services, adoption referrals, UTI treatments, family practice services (a vague category that could include certain preventive care), and other services -- 1,606,915 services in 2013. Based on this breakdown, about 85 percent of Planned Parenthood’s work is preventive. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Elizabeth Clark put the figure at 90 percent. But both are a bit lower than what O’Malley said: that 97 percent is preventive care and mammograms. Oh yeah, what about mammograms? Within the category of ""cancer screening and prevention services,"" Planned Parenthood said it offered 487,029 breast exams or breast care services in 2013. However, as we’ve noted before, Planned Parenthood clinics do not provide mammograms themselves. Rather, Planned Parenthood physicians perform other types of breast exams and refer patients to outside clinics where they can get a mammogram. An October 2012 statement posted on Planned Parenthood’s website explained the group’s approach, which they said is helping women access mammograms via referral even though the clinics do not perform them in-house. So O’Malley’s 97 percent figure has some basis -- that’s the percentage of Planned Parenthood’s services that aren’t abortion. But that’s a broader category than ""mammograms and preventative health,"" which O’Malley said. Our ruling O’Malley said, ""97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health."" According to Planned Parenthood, about 97 percent of the services the group provides in a given year are services other than abortion. That includes preventive and primary care. Preventive care accounts for about 85 to 90 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides. While mammograms are considered a form of preventive care, Planned Parenthood doesn’t do their own mammograms. Clinics perform breast exams and refer patients to outside clinics for an actual mammogram. The claim wasn’t pulled out of thin air, but it’s missing some important information, so we rate O’Malley’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/03/martin-omalley/97-planned-parenthoods-work-mammograms-preventive-/

Connolly says U.S. road spending, based on GDP, is one-third of 1960 level
","U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly says the nation will short-change its future if it doesn’t invest more money in infrastructure. In testimony prepared for a July 9 hearing with fellow Democrats, Connolly warned that the nation’s systems of roads and rails was being bled by lack of spending. ""In 1960, we spent more than 3 percent of our GDP on infrastructure projects like the Interstate Highway,"" Connolly, D-11th, said in a July 9 written statement. ""Today we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on these vital investments."" Connolly’s comments came amid debate on Capitol Hill over spending to maintain the country’s roads and rails. The congressman recently chastised colleagues in the GOP-run House over that chamber’s passage of a June measure that cut funding for Amtrak. Just this past week, Congress passed legislation to keep the keep money flowing into the federal Highway Trust Fund for the next three months as lawmakers grapple to find a long-term fix to the fund’s looming insolvency. We wondered if the congressman was right that infrastructure spending has been whittled to one-third of its level 55 years ago when the nation was just starting to build the Interstate Highway System. George Burke, Connolly’s spokesman, backed the congressman’s statement by pointing to several studies on infrastructure spending by federal, state and local governments. As Burke noted, the studies have varying results because of differing definitions of what constitutes infrastructure. Some looked at not just spending for transportation arteries like roads and passenger rails, but also costs to build and maintain power grids, private freight rail networks, and municipal sewage plants. The most recent report was released in March by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It said that federal, state and local money spent of transportation totaled $138 billion in 1960 compared to $279 billion in 2014, using inflation-adjusted dollars. All these dollars flowed into two categories: capital expenses that are used to buy equipment and pay for construction; and  operating and maintenance expenses that pay for upkeep. That means public spending on transportation infrastructure totalled 2.1 percent of GDP in 1960 compared to 1.6 percent in 2014, according to the CBO report. These figures don’t mesh with Connolly’s statement. So what’s the congressman referring to when he talks about infrastructure? Burke said Connolly was specifically referring to a smaller subset: capital spending to construct roads and bridges. Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, drilled down into the CBO figures for us to meet Connolly’s definition. He found that in 1960, public spending on new roads and bridges amounted to 1.17 percent of GDP and fell to .53 percent in 2014. That’s a drop, but not quite as steep as Connolly said. One last note: Connolly also sent us a 2014 report from the White House that said public spending on surface transportation infrastructure was just under 3 percent in 1962 compared to 1.4 percent today. That’s a drop of about 50 percent, which is more dramatic than the CBO findings but still not as stark as the two-thirds decline Connolly described. No matter how it’s defined, public spending on infrastructure -- as measured by the the percentage of GDP -- is lower now than 55 years ago. Shatz said a key reason is that the U.S. has built out its infrastructure system. ""You can always build more and improve it, but we’re not going to build a second full interstate system – we already have one, and we don’t need to double its size,"" Schatz wrote in an email. ""We need additional roads here and there, and we need to make sure we do (operation and maintenance). I don’t know what the right amount of infrastructure spending is, but I do think it’s a mistake to say we need to spend the same amount now when we have a lot of infrastructure as we did a long time ago when we lacked a lot of infrastructure."" Our ruling Connolly wrote, ""In 1960, we spent more than 3 percent of our GDP on infrastructure projects like the Interstate Highway. Today we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP on these vital investments."" His figures don’t match the statistics in a number of reports his office sent us. Connolly says he was referring specifically to road and bridge construction. CBO and White House data show that -- when measured by GDP -- we’re spending about half as much on roads and bridges as we did in 1960. That’s a drop, but not as steep as the two-thirds plunge Connolly describes. Connolly’s statement is also void of the context that our interstate system, new in 1960, is now pretty much built out. Bottom line is that the congressman has the trend right, but his numbers and trajectory are off.

Is Donald Trump still 'for single-payer' health care?
","For all his success firing up the GOP base, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump may be a Republican in name only when it comes to health care, says former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Perry -- at 11th place in the polls and currently just shy of making it into the first Republican debate Aug. 6 -- has been trading jabs with Trump for weeks. Trump mocked Perry’s glasses in July, and Perry responded by calling Trump ""a cancer on conservatism"" and challenging him to a pull-up contest. Perry switched up his attacks from the physical to the political on Aug. 2’s Fox News Sunday. ""He's for single payer,"" Perry said. ""How can anyone who's a conservative stand up and say I am for single-payer health care?"" Perry’s campaign referred us to a Buzzfeed piece and a PunditFact article that noted Trump’s past support for a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. Perry’s claim goes further to suggest Trump, like Vermont socialist and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, currently supports a single-payer system, which is a specific type of universal health care in which the government foots the bill for all residents. We wanted to know if Trump still supports that model. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our inquiry, and his campaign website does not outline any of his positions on major issues, including health care. So we scoured transcripts and videos from Trump’s public statements and interviews. Trump has been a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act, but his general stance on health care is much murkier. On the medical record Trump has said multiple times that he would ""get rid of Obamacare"" as soon as he takes office. He’s also repeatedly attacked the Healthcare.gov website as a $5 billion failure that ""has never worked"" (which rates False). But disliking the Affordable Care Act, which is not a single-payer system, is not the same thing as condemning the concept of health care for all. During his short-lived flirtation with a 2000 Reform Party presidential bid, Trump supported universal health care without ambiguity, and he voiced support for a single-payer system in several instances. • ""If you can’t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it’s all over. ... I believe in universal healthcare,"" Trump told CNN’s Larry King in October 1999. • ""I would put forth a comprehensive health care program and fund it with an increase in corporate taxes, "" Trump told The Advocate right before he dropped out of the race in February 2000. • ""The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. … We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing,"" Trump writes in his 2000 book The America We Deserve. Trump has said very little about single-payer health care since 2000, according to our search of the LexisNexis database. Reading between the lines Trump’s more recent comments about health care systems contradict each other, which experts say suggests he hasn’t formed a clear position. While bantering with David Letterman on Jan. 8, 2015, Trump voiced admiration for Scotland’s publically funded health care system and suggested that the problem with the Affordable Care Act is its implementation. Here’s a transcript of their exchange: Letterman, recounting how cheap it is to treat injuries abroad: ""In one case, I had my arm reattached and at the end of the procedure ... it was like $12 dollars!"" Trump: ""A friend of mine was in Scotland recently. He got very, very sick. They took him by ambulance and he was there for four days. He was really in troubl,e and they released him and he said, ‘Where do I pay?’ And they said, ‘There’s no charge.’ Not only that, he said it was like great doctors, great care. I mean we could have a great system in this country."" Letterman: ""Are people afraid of socialism?"" Trump: ""Well, people are afraid of a lot of things. But it’s mostly incompetence. … How do you spend $5 billion on a website, just the creation of the site itself, and it doesn’t work?  … There are things you could do to give unbelievable healthcare and a much better healthcare system. It’s a complicated topic, unfortunately."" Experts told us Trump is either implicitly supporting a single-payer system or putting his foot in his mouth. ""The Scottish system is a classic single-payer system, like the English system, except better funded,"" said Timothy Jost, a professor of health care law at Washington and Lee University. ""He should stop citing Scotland,"" said Gail Wilensky, a health economist and former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""He doesn’t seem to know what the Scottish system is. Most market-oriented people are not real keen about it."" In a July radio interview, Trump came short of rejecting his previous position for a Canadian-style plan and instead talked about a totally different approach. He called himself a ""conservative with a heart"" and described his alternative to the Affordable Care Act: ""Great (private) plans"" made through ""deals with hospitals"" that allow the government to help people ""at the lower levels."" On July 31, a spokesperson for Trump clarified to Forbes that he’s ""never supported socialized medicine"" but is for ""a universal ‘market-based’ plan that would offer a range of choices."" The sort of system Trump is alluding to — a universal, market-based system with a mix of public and private funding — is essentially what the Affordable Care Act establishes, Jost said. More teased-out conservative alternatives with less government regulation than the Affordable Care Act can be found in John McCain’s 2008 proposal or Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan’s reform bill, Wilensky said. Our ruling Perry said Trump is ""for single-payer health care."" Fifteen years ago, Trump was decidedly for a universal healthcare system that resembled Canada’s system, in which the government pays for care for all citizens. Recently, he's said he admires Scotland’s single-payer system and disses the Affordable Care Act as incompetently implemented. However, a Trump spokesman denied that the candidate supported ""socialized medicine"" and suggested Trump prefers a ""free-market"" solution. Other than that, though, the Trump campaign has been silent about what his specific health care policies are; perhaps Trump will be pressed on this point during the Aug. 6 debate. Given the current evidence, Perry's attack is partially accurate, but leaves out details. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/02/rick-perry/donald-trump-still-single-payer-health-care/

Donald Trump: Black income, unemployment 'worse now than just about ever'
","Just days before the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, billionaire real-estate developer and current polling leader Donald Trump  criticized President Barack Obama’s record on ABC’s This Week. At one point, Trump zeroed in on Obama’s status as the country’s first black president, arguing that he had failed his black constituents. The topic came up when ABC’s Jonathan Karl referred to a tweet by Trump that said, ""Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!"" Karl asked Trump why he thought the country wouldn’t see another black president for ""generations."" Trump replied: ""I think that he has set a very low bar, and I think it's a shame for the African-American people. And by the way, he has done nothing for African-Americans. You look at what's gone on with their income levels. You look at what's gone on with their youth. I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. I thought he'd do a fabulous job for the African-American citizens of this country. He has done nothing. They are worse now than just about ever. ... They have problems now in terms of unemployment numbers. Look at their unemployment numbers. … Here you have a black president who's done very poorly for the African-Americans of this country."" We wondered whether Trump was right that under Obama, income levels and unemployment numbers ""are worse now than just about ever"" for African Americans. We looked at historical data trends for four specific measurements for African-Americans: Overall unemployment rates, youth unemployment rates (since Trump mentioned ""youth""), poverty rates, and median income. We’ll take these one by one. Overall unemployment rates for African Americans The African-American unemployment rate when Obama entered office was 12.7 percent. By June 2015, it had fallen to 9.5 percent, a drop of about one-quarter. And compared to its Obama-era peak of 16.8 percent in March 2010, the unemployment rate has fallen by about 43 percent. But what about a longer historical look? The black unemployment rate was higher than its current rate between May 1974 and June 1997, and between November 2001 and June 2005. In all, since May 1974, black unemployment was higher than today’s rate in 328 months, and lower than today’s rate in 87 months. So it’s been higher than today 79 percent of the time since May 1974. So Trump's point here is wrong. Youth unemployment rates for African Americans For this category, we looked at the historical unemployment rate data for African-Americans age 16 to 24. Because this data is not seasonally adjusted (which makes a month-to-month comparison imprecise), we looked at the most recent month of June 2015 and all previous June data going back to the oldest, which is from 1972. In June 2015, the unemployment rate for black youth was 23.4 percent. That was down from 31 percent in June 2009. That’s a drop of about one-quarter. More important, in the previous 43 Junes, the rate has been lower than that in only seven of those months, and higher than that in 36 of those months. So it’s been higher than its current rate 84 percent of the time, meaning Trump isn’t correct by this statistic, either. African-American poverty rate The black poverty rate is one of Obama’s weaker statistics. The poverty rate rose from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 27.2 percent in 2013, the most recent year available. That’s about 5 percent higher than it was when Obama took office. It’s also higher than at any time prior to the Obama presidency going back to 1996. Still, even today’s higher black poverty rate is hardly unprecedented: It was higher than it is now between 1959 and 1996 -- a 38-year period. So Trump isn’t correct by this measurement, either. African-American median income We looked at household median income for African-Americans and found a similar pattern to the poverty rate: Inflation-adjusted incomes have worsened during Obama’s tenure, but they are hardly the worst rates in history. In 2013, the median income for black households was $34,598. That’s lower than 2009 in inflation-adjusted dollars, though it’s up slightly compared to 2010. This could certainly be considered stagnation, if not shrinkage. Median income in 2013 was also lower than it was between 1996 and 2009 -- not a stellar accomplishment. On the other hand, inflation-adjusted median household income was below today’s level between 1967 and 1995. So it was worse than today two-thirds of the time between 1967 and the year Obama became president. So Trump’s wrong using this measurement as well. Our ruling Trump said that under Obama, income levels and unemployment numbers ""are worse now than just about ever"" for African-Americans. Some key statistics for African-Americans, such as unemployment, improved significantly during Obama’s tenure. The ones that stagnated or worsened under Obama are still relatively positive compared to recent history. Trump is wrong by several important measures.

"['Rhode Island', 'Public Safety', 'Coast Guard']","
Coast Guard needs to work on its math
","A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter from Cape Cod had plucked three Canadian fishermen from a raft after their vessel sank more than 150 miles off the coast. The resulting news release prepared by a Coast Guard public-affairs unit did not make an outright declaration that the Coasties had saved the men’s lives. But the news release did conclude with this: ""Every year the First Coast Guard District saves 350 lives in the Northeast."" We know the Coast Guard does some amazing things, but 350 lives, year in and year out? We reached out to the public-affairs staff of the Boston-headquartered First Coast Guard District, whose jurisdiction ranges from the waters of northern New Jersey to Canada. Right away, Petty Officer Ross Ruddell told us that the 350 number is an average.   An average of what, we asked. After a day of research, Ruddell got back to us with the numbers: 385 for 2014, 338 for 2013 and 427 for 2012. So based on those numbers, Ruddell pointed out, the average was actually 383 -- not 350. Which brings us to a second question: What does the Coast Guard mean by a life saved? The organization, with a history dating to the U.S. Life-Saving Service in 1878, distinguishes between cases where people in peril were ""saved"" and other cases where individuals, even people with injuries, were ""assisted.""  So the Coast Guard does not tally a life saved every time it tows in a vessel with mechanical trouble. Fair enough. We’ll accept the way they tally a life saved. And we have not tried to audit that number. What’s odd is the way the Coast Guard keeps using the number 350 in its news releases. In a 2012 news release, a public-affairs officer declared that the Coast Guard saves ""more than 350 lives"" in the Northeast ""per year."" In a news release in 2013, the agency claimed that it saves 350 lives ""each year."" In 2014, it sent out a release saying, ""In an average year, the Coast Guard assists 3,300 lives and saves 350 lives across the Northeast."" And of course this summer, a news release concerning the fishing boat that sank 150 miles out at sea concluded: ""Every year the First Coast Guard District saves 350 lives in the Northeast."" Our Ruling That’s not strictly correct.  It was 385 lives saved in 2014, 338 lives saved in  2013 and 427 lives saved in 2012. In its news release, the Coast Guard failed to say that 350 was an average, as they did in 2014.  And the average for the past three years is 383 not 350. So the news release understates the value of the Coast Guard’s work. The service is strong on the sea, weak in math. But because in two of the last three years the service saved more than 350 lives, we rate this claim Mostly True.

Harry Reid is way off on claim that 30% of women rely only on Planned Parenthood for health care
","An anti-abortion group recently released several secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing fetal tissue, and that has given opponents of the abortion-providing health organization new momentum to shut off federal funding. During Senate floor debate on July 29, 2015, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., urged lawmakers to focus on consequences for women who rely on Planned Parenthood for health care beyond abortions if the federal funding is cut off. Planned Parenthood ""is the health care backbone for American women during their lives,"" Reid said. ""In fact, it's the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care."" A reader thought that number sounded high and asked us to check it out. We started by doing some basic math. According to the 2013 Census Bureau population estimate, there were about 161 million women in the United States, of whom 131 million were age 15 or over -- the primary constituency for Planned Parenthood. Thirty percent of that number is about 39 million women. Did Planned Parenthood serve 39 million women who had no other health care options? Not even close. According to the most recent Planned Parenthood annual report, the organization saw 2.7 million patients in 2013, completing 10.6 million separate procedures. The biggest categories of procedures were sexually transmitted infection tests (3.7 million), reversible contraception (2.1 million), emergency contraception kits (1.4 million), pregnancy tests (1.1 million), and HIV tests (704,000). (For the record, the group disclosed that it performed 327,653 abortions during that period, or about 3 percent of all procedures.) Equally problematic, there's no indication in Planned Parenthood’s data that each of the 2.7 million patients had no other health care resources to rely on, as Reid said was the case. When we checked with Reid’s office, a spokesman said that the senator was speaking off the cuff and had meant to refer to a different statistic. That is a statistic -- often cited by Planned Parenthood itself -- is that ""one in five American women has chosen Planned Parenthood for health care at least once in her life."" But that’s not what Reid said. Our ruling Reid said Planned Parenthood is ""the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care."" That’s not the case -- Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million patients in 2013, not the 39 million it would have needed to see for Reid’s claim to be accurate. Even if every Planned Parenthood patient had no other health care options, the group would have seen about 2 percent of women, not 30 percent. His office acknowledged that Reid, making off-the-cuff remarks, got the talking point wrong. In this case, he really got it wrong. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/jul/31/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-30-women-rely-only-planned-parenth/
"['National', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Cory Booker']","
Was a prison built every 10 days to house a fast-growing population of nonviolent inmates?
","With criminal justice reform in the national spotlight, first-term Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., commented on the growth of the prison system in recent years. ""We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders,"" Booker said in a post to his Instagram account on July 27, 2015. Before joining the Senate, Booker served as mayor of Newark. Is Booker’s claim correct?  We decided to check. Prison growth, 1990-2005 We’ll start by evaluating the first part of Booker’s claim about a new prison being built on a near weekly basis between 1990 and 2005. Booker’s communications director, Jeff Giertz, pointed to an almost identical quote in Bryan Stevenson’s book, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, published in 2014. Stevenson is a law professor at New York University School of Law and executive director of a nonprofit group in Montgomery, Ala., called the Equal Justice Initiative. ""Between 1990 and 2005 a new prison opened in the United States every 10 days,"" Stevenson wrote. Neither Booker’s nor Stevenson’s statements specify state or federal prisons, but if we assume they are referring to both types of prisons, then data and an expert we contacted largely corroborate this claim. According to a Congressional Research Service report, ""the number of state and federal adult correctional facilities rose from 1,277 in 1990 to 1,821 in 2005, a 43% increase."" That’s an increase of 544 new facilities. There are 5,478 days in a 15-year span, which works out to almost exactly one facility every 10 days on average. John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School specializing criminal justice and the recent boom in mass incarceration, said Booker’s claim is correct if it includes both types of prisons. Pflaff said Booker is actually underselling the statistic by not going back to 1984. Between 1984 and 2005, the number of facilities grew by about one every 8.5 days. That said, Booker’s time frame makes some sense because ""crime began to drop in 1991,"" and 2005 is the latest available year from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities. Mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders The second part of Booker’s claim is somewhat less clear. Grietz of Booker’s staff pointed to data that showed the total number of nonviolent offenders incarcerated between 1980 and 2013 grew from 122,000 to 607,000 in 2013 -- a 400 percent increase, compared to a 300 percent increase of incarcerated violent offenders. But for the specific period discussed in Booker’s Instagram post, the data runs counter to his point. Pfaff pointed to data gathered by a study in the Harvard Journal on Legislation that shows violent offenders contributed 60 percent to state prison growth between 1990 and 2009, while nonviolent offenders (drug and property offenses combined) contributed only 27 percent. Pfaff also added that the universe of state inmates is much larger than the pool of federal inmates. All told, 86 percent of prisoners are in state systems while only 14 percent are in the federal system. As it turns out, the big increase happened earlier. The data shows that 55 percent of state inmate growth came from nonviolent offenders between 1980 and 1990, before declining to 27 percent between 1990 and 2009. So Booker is wrong to focus on the period 1990 to 2005 when discussing a ""mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders."" A big rise did occur, but it started earlier than Booker’s post indicated.  Finally, we’ll note that in the much smaller universe of federal inmates, 76 percent and 72 percent of those sentenced to federal prison were sentenced for nonviolent offenses, according to U.S. Sentencing Commission data for 2012 and 2013. Our ruling Booker said, ""We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders."" Booker is right that a new prison was built every 10 days during that period. But while there was a significant rise in the incarceration rate of nonviolent offenders, it took place over a longer time period than the post indicates -- between 1980 and 2013. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/31/cory-booker/was-prison-built-every-10-days-house-fast-growing-/

Ted Cruz: States not singled out by Supreme Court not bound by gay marriage ruling
","The U.S. Supreme Court holds ultimate sway on the laws of the land, yes? Hold on, Ted Cruz said in an interview about the court’s 5-4 decision holding that state bans on gay marriage violate federal principles of equal protection and fair treatment under the law, creating a ""grave and continuing harm"" to families led by such couples. After the June 26, 2015, ruling, which addressed challenges to state laws in Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan and Kentucky, Cruz said that if a party isn’t directly involved in a dispute before the Supreme Court, it’s not required to comply with the ruling. ""Those who are not parties to the suit are not bound by it,"" Cruz said. A reader asked us to check Cruz’s claim. The Republican senator and presidential aspirant should know about the high court. He argued before the court on Texas’ behalf in a past job as the state’s solicitor general. In the interview, Cruz told Steve Inskeep, who hosts NPR’s Morning Edition program, that the court’s ruling imposed ""elitist radical views,"" short-circuiting the ability of each state to define marriage. Inskeep asked if Cruz would encourage officials who disagree with the ruling to ignore or defy it. State officials ""cannot ignore a direct judicial order,"" Cruz said. ""The parties to a case cannot ignore a direct judicial order. But it does not mean that those who are not parties to case are bound by a judicial order."" INSKEEP: ""Did I understand you to say just now that as you read the law, as you read our system, this decision is not binding on the entire country, only to the specific states that were named in the suit."" CRUZ: ""Article III of the Constitution gives the court the authority to resolve cases and controversies. Those cases and controversies, when they're resolved, when you're facing a judicial order, the parties to that suit are bound (by) it. Those who are not parties to the suit are not bound by it. Now, in subsequent litigation, other courts will follow the precedence of the court, but a judicial order only binds those to whom it is directed, those who are parties to the suit. That's the way our litigation system works."" (See fuller excerpts of this part of the interview here.) We alerted Cruz’s campaign to this fact check and didn’t hear back. Legal experts Separately, several legal experts told us the idea that states not party to the marriage cases weren’t bound by the court’s ruling may have technical merit, but that’s all. Richard Fallon, a Harvard specialist in constitutional law, said by email that under the doctrine of precedent, ""any official who failed to issue gay marriage licenses would be sueable for failure to do so, and any court in which the suit was filed would be obliged to follow the Supreme Court’s gay marriage ruling.  In the long run, non-compliance thus amounts at most to a delaying tactic.  And there are lots of complicated questions about whether officials should regard themselves as obliged to do what they know a court would order them to do if they were sued — even if they are not technically bound by the Supreme Court’s ruling.  But on Senator Cruz’s technical point, he is probably correct, if you understand it as being only a very limited, technical point about a delaying tactic."" In contrast, Lynn Wardle, a law professor at Brigham Young University who has advocated that the Constitution leaves it to legislators to stipulate who may marry, called Cruz’s statement ""precisely correct."" Entities not party to a suit are not bound by the resulting judicial order, Wardle said by email, adding: ""That’s the way our litigation system works."" Only parties before the court are bound by its judgment and orders, Randy Barnett, a professor of legal theory at the Georgetown University Law Center, said by email, but all other courts are bound to follow the court (which Cruz hinted at). So, Barnett wrote, ""it is futile for states who are not parties to resist. More importantly, when a ruling is clear, ignoring the Supreme Court's decisions until a court directly orders them to obey undermines the rule of law. Bad people say ‘we won't obey the law until you make us.’ Unless they are engaged in justified civil disobedience — in which case they are liable to be punished — good people follow the law before they are directly commanded."" If nonparties to the suits don’t go along with the ruling, he said, ""they are postponing the inevitable and flouting the rule of law that was announced by the Court."" Stephen Vladeck, an American University law professor, called Cruz’s statement ""literally true, but deeply misleading. Technically, the only parties that are bound by a ruling by the Supreme Court are the parties to that litigation — and so, in the context of the marriage cases, the small subset of states whose bans on gay marriage were before the Court. ""But the way our system works,"" Vladeck emailed, ""every state and federal court is ultimately subject to the supervision of the Supreme Court at least where federal law is concerned. That’s why those courts generally apply the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the Justices in Washington; if they don’t, they’re likely to be reversed."" Asked if Wardle had a point saying Cruz was precisely correct, Vladeck said that read is misleading in that states still have to go along with such a ruling, absent a good-faith reason not to. In the ""immediate aftermath of a decision like this one, when there is no reason to think the Supreme Court would answer the question any differently were a different state a party to the suit,"" Vladeck said, ""it’s unreasonable for a state official or state court to decline to follow that ruling. They’re not literally bound to do so (and, thus, can’t be held in contempt for failing to do so), but they are practically bound by dint of the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction."" By phone, Susan Sommer, the lead lawyer for Lambda Legal in the suits that reached the Supreme Court, suggested that ""only in the very most technical and hair-splitting way could it be said that the Supreme Court’s ruling is not immediately and directly binding on every state government and government official in the country."" Sommer said she knows of no legitimate school of thought that could say the ruling doesn’t apply to all the states. ""It’s sort-of Law School 101,"" Sommer said. We also heard back from SCOTUS Blog reporter Lyle Denniston, who’s covered the Supreme Court for more than 50 years. The Constitution’s Article III, Denniston said by email, limits the authority of federal courts to actual cases or controversies, so the outcome is between the actual litigants, as Cruz said. Then again, he said, ""the Supreme Court since 1803 (Marbury v.

Denniston further said: ""The Supreme Court, in the 1958 decision in Cooper v. Aaron (the Little Rock high school integration case), said explicitly that the combination of the Marbury decision and Article VI made the Supreme Court's decisions binding on the states. That decision, by the way, is the only"" one ""in history where each of the nine Justices explicitly signed the opinion to give it more force.""

Our ruling Cruz said states not directly involved in the gay marriage lawsuits that reached the Supreme Court ""are not bound"" by the court’s ruling. He has a thread of a point in that only four states were directly involved in the case. But that’s an incomplete answer to the question of whether states could ignore the court’s ruling. Other courts would be bound by the Supreme Court’s precedent, making the ruling applicable throughout the nation. That’s a fact that Cruz alluded to only after being pressed by the interviewer for clarification of his earlier misleading statement. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Jeb Bush says he won 60% of the Hispanic vote in 2002 election
","Former Gov. Jeb Bush is courting Hispanic voters to build momentum for his presidential run, pointing out that he relied upon the demographic during his gubernatorial campaign. ""In my re-election in 2002, I won the majority,"" he told Telemundo’s Jose Diaz-Balart in Spanish during a July 27, 2015 interview. ""I won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, 60 percent in the state. It can be done."" Bush has some advantages over most of his GOP rivals when it comes to Hispanic voters: He speaks Spanish fluently and his wife, Columba, is a native of Mexico. But did he really win re-election as governor with 60 percent of the Hispanic vote, higher than his percentage with white voters? We decided to revisit the polls and find out. Demographic shift The percentage of the vote is important, because the majority of registered voters in Florida are white. In 2002 there were 7 million white voters, with other ethnicities totaling 2.3 million. The Florida Department of State told PolitiFact Florida that it’s tough to say exactly how many Hispanic voters were registered in 2002, because Division of Elections record-keeping has since changed. Registrations then were recorded as either ""white,"" ""black,"" ""other"" or ""unknown/not given."" In 2013, the percentage of the electorate that is Hispanic was between 14 and 18 percent, a number that has probably grown since 2002. Bush cruised to re-election that year, winning 56 percent of the vote over Democrat Bill McBride. His campaign focused on Hispanic voters, with Bush giving interviews in Spanish and running Spanish-language campaign ads. Afterward, analysts and media coverage credited Bush with taking anywhere from 57 to 65 percent of the Hispanic vote. That would usually be an oddity for a non-Hispanic, Republican candidate, but not necessarily Bush. In 1998 he garnered 61 percent of Hispanic voters against Buddy McKay, versus 60 percent of white voters. But breaking down 2002’s numbers isn’t as clear cut as it would be for other years.  Voter News Service, a joint poll by ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN and the Associated Press, stopped providing numbers on Election Night 2002 after it decided its computer analysis was flawed and couldn’t give reliable results.   That meant a dearth of data for national and state races, and no exit polls that dissected the race, gender or economic status of Florida’s voters. That left independent analyses to pick up the slack. But most of those generally accepted Bush had won the Hispanic vote handily. Fernand Amandi, managing partner of Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi, said a combination of low turnout and a strong, older Cuban electorate gave the Republican an advantage. Some estimates said 80 percent of Cuban voters rallied around Bush. ""The 2002 exit poll was flawed and not kept for reference, but targeted precinct analysis suggests he did clear the 60 percent threshold,"" Amandi said. ""Without the benefit of a definitive exit poll, I would speculate he did as well or better against Bill McBride."" One widely cited study from the Center for Immigration Studies pegged Bush’s support among Hispanics at 57 percent in 2002. University of Texas government professor Daron Shaw provided data from a Fox News poll for that analysis. Shaw also thought the Cuban population favored Bush, a factor that's especially in play in Florida. ""I do recall the number and wasn’t particularly surprised,"" he said. ""The Cuban population in Florida makes it a unique Hispanic cross-section, one that is much more friendly to Republicans than the national cross section."" Our ruling Bush said in 2002, he ""won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, 60 percent in the state."" While Bush historically had enjoyed a strong Hispanic voter base, we found there actually aren’t the usual exit poll results from his 2002 re-election to support this conclusion. However, most media analyses from the election do suggest Bush carried about 60 percent of the Hispanic vote, as he did in 1998. Experts we consulted said that was most likely the case. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/31/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-won-60-hispanic-vote-2002-electio/

Fact-checking a viral Pa. Facebook post on coronavirus that says the government is 'up to something'
","A few days after President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency and cautioned against gathering in groups, a Facebook post accusing the government of being ""up to something"" went viral in Pennsylvania. Here’s the full post: ""Is anyone paying attention to the bigger picture? And not what the media is feeding you? This virus is a distraction from the truth. Coming through Pennsylvania and stopped at a store and they have stopped selling gun ammo until further notice and all the cases are full so it’s not like they have run out. They are closing liquor stores. Next will be the banks. Then our phones will stop working. They don’t want venues of 50 or more people because they would have trouble trying to control 50-plus people. Something’s not right here and everyone is dumb enough to think it’s really just a virus. The numbers are nothing compared to H1N1 or Ebola. Everyone needs to realize our government is up to something and we are dumb enough to believe what you see on TV or on Facebook. Everyone better stock up on defense supplies because that toilet paper isn’t going to protect you when they come."" Before we go any further, let’s get one thing straight – the coronavirus is real. The number of cases in the U.S. and the grim tally of deaths caused by the virus climbs exponentially every day, and the restrictions that drew skepticism from this Facebook user are the very measures that public health experts say will help slow the virus’ spread. There’s a lot to unpack in this misleading Facebook post, so we’ll take the claims one by one. When the post first appeared on March 16, there were no restrictions on the sale of guns or ammunition in Pennsylvania, and customers anxious about the coronavirus flooded firearms dealers. Then Gov. Tom Wolf ordered gun sellers and other businesses not deemed ""life-sustaining"" to close their doors. But he quickly reversed course under pressure from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and allowed them to reopen so long as the shops agreed to keep customers six feet apart. The Trump administration also advised states to consider gun sellers and shooting ranges essential businesses – on par with grocery stores and pharmacies. The post gets one thing right. Pennsylvania did initially close liquor stores, which are state run. Liquor stores reopened on Wednesday for online sales, but demand was so overwhelming that the Pennsylvania Fine Wine and Good Spirits website was unavailable for most users. The state liquor control board said access to the site would be ""randomized"" to prevent it from crashing. The Facebook user also warned that the government would soon close banks and cut the phone lines. There’s no evidence of this. Banks appear on Wolf’s list of life-sustaining businesses allowed to remain open, although some bank branches have closed voluntarily to keep customers and staff safe and others have reduced their hours or moved to drive-through service. Telecommunications companies like Philadelphia’s Comcast are easing shutoffs and waiving late fees to accommodate customers. Next the post argues that new rules against gathering in large groups are designed to prevent people from organizing. Really they’re the most important tool government officials have to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which scientists say is far more contagious than the flu. Pennsylvanians who defy the rules now risk arrest, and in New Jersey, 15 men who attended an ultra-Orthodox Jewish funeral were charged Wednesday with violating that state’s ban on large gatherings. Finally, the post suggests that coronavirus numbers don’t compare to H1N1 or Ebola, but top government scientists now predict that the coronavirus will be far deadlier than either of those diseases. During the H1N1 outbreak that started in 2009, more than 12,000 people in the U.S. died. About a dozen people were sickened with Ebola in 2014, but no one died. Last week, members of the Trump administration leading the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak announced that the deadly pathogen could kill between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans. So far, nearly 5,000 people have died – 90 of them in Pennsylvania. State-run liquor stores did close in Pennsylvania as government officials scrambled to halt the spread of the coronavirus, but all the other claims made in this post are false. Most importantly, any suggestion that the coronavirus isn’t real or that it’s part of a government conspiracy is a ridiculous claim. The deadly virus is killing Americans right now, and abiding by unprecedented orders to stay home is the best way to halt its spread. We rate the post’s claim about the government being ""up to something"" Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2020/apr/06/facebook-posts/fact-checking-viral-pa-facebook-post-coronavirus-s/

Attack ads in Milwaukee comptroller race exaggerate, mislead
","In an election season already historically bizarre due to the coronavirus pandemic, of course we have a down-and-dirty race for a position in city finance. The normally low-profile Milwaukee comptroller post, held since 2012 by the retiring Martin Matson, is up for grabs, pursued by Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa and state Assembly Democrat Jason Fields. The comptroller is the city’s chief financial officer, but a series of ads from a dark-money group backing Fields have made this a race about lead pipes. The specifics of the claim vary by ad, but one mailer sent to various homes in Milwaukee summed up the core of the attacks on Sawa. The flier, funded by the Leaders for a Better Community, says this: ""For three years, Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa and the Milwaukee Comptroller’s office blocked an audit of Milwaukee’s lead abatement programs. This put our children in danger. Her inaction has even led to a criminal investigation."" Let’s be clear up front — that is a wild exaggeration at every turn.  Here’s the breakdown. Leaders for a Better Community is a politically active nonprofit that doesn’t have to disclose the source of its funds. The supposed ""issue ad"" directs readers to call a number at the comptroller’s office (a number no longer in use) or visit the group’s website for more information on their plan for transparency and accountability (no such plan is posted). The group was founded in 2015 and previously supported Fields in a 2016 run for state Assembly, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. It is run by Sherwin Hughes, a long-time friend of Fields. Fields referred to Hughes in a March 8, 2020, Facebook post as ""our guy, our friend, my brother, an advisor."" The race pits Fields against Sawa, who has worked in the office she now seeks to run since 2010, working her way up from auditor to lead auditor, audit manager, accounting director and now deputy comptroller. Fields served in the state Assembly from 2005-13, and now again since 2017. He has also worked as a stockbroker and runs several local organizations. A February 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story noted he is seeking the city’s top finance job despite a background that includes a bankruptcy in 2016 and drunken driving convictions from 2008 and 2014. The ad campaign ignores those backgrounds and focuses on the city’s lead abatement program. The program, run by the Milwaukee Health Department, is the subject of an outside audit and was condemned in a state report from 2018 that found more than 90% of cases were closed before the amount of lead in a childs' blood had dropped to levels deemed safe by the state, among numerous other failings. So let’s get back to the ad. As evidence of its multiple claims, the mailer lists four sources in footnotes: None of these prove the claims in any way. In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Hughes provided no additional direct evidence, stating simply: ""The city of Milwaukee had been requesting lead abatement audit for years. Per the current comptroller, Sawa was in charge of audit division."" That response is just as misleading as the mailer itself. Here’s the reality behind the mailer’s claims. ""For three years…blocked an audit of Milwaukee lead abatement"" Hughes did not respond to a question asking what three-year window this referred to. But another flier references this in the present tense, saying the office ""has refused for three years,"" so we’ll work from the assumption it is a 2017 to 2020 window. Matson, the current comptroller, said in a phone interview an audit of the lead program was never on the table before the rampant lead issues around the city began coming to light in 2016 and 2017. ""The lead program in the city years ago was considered the example for the rest of the country, so it was considered a low-risk item,"" he said. By the time lead concerns in Milwaukee became more public, Sawa was no longer in charge of the audit division. She held that position from 2012 until February 2015, when she was promoted to accounting director, Matson said. Even the behind-the-scenes memos where city officials discussed issues with the lead program were just starting to circulate in early 2015. ""That was an outright lie,"" Matson, who has endorsed Sawa, said of the blocking claim. Then there’s this key detail: An audit has in fact taken place, conducted by an outside agency, and it was recently completed. ""Put our children in danger"" It’s absurd to attribute this to Sawa, who at the time lead concerns were raised was the accounting director. Her job there was ""assuring the accuracy of the city’s financial statements,"" her biography says. ""Her inaction has even led to a criminal investigation"" This is flat-out ridiculous. The criminal investigation connected to the lead testing is of the health department, not the comptroller’s office. The investigation came after former health commissioner Bevan Baker was forced from his job in January 2018, and a number of other staffers were disciplined, forced to resign or fired. There was never a criminal probe into Sawa or the comptroller’s office. The actual audit involved has yet to be released to the public, though Matson said a copy of the findings have been submitted to the city.  In January 2018, the Common Council directed the city clerk to audit all Health Department programs within 90 days, as lead concerns grew. Matson said he objected at the time, arguing this was both not humanly possible and that only a few organizations around the country were qualified to audit a lead abatement program, so the council rescinded the request and asked the comptroller’s office to seek an outside audit. The city eventually reached an agreement in February 2019 for an audit by the Public Health Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., and it began work in May 2019. A flier attacking Sawa says she ""blocked an audit"" of the city’s lead abatement program for three years that ""put our children in danger"" and spurred a criminal investigation. But Sawa’s oversight of city audits ended in 2015, well before any concerns with the city’s lead testing program publicly came to light. And in any case, there was never any suggested or proposed audit brought forward that she could block. Implying she continued blocking something for a three-year span is pure fiction — as is the claim that her actions spurred a criminal investigation. The investigation was of the health department, not Sawa or the comptroller’s office. And, of course, an audit has in fact been done. We rate this false and ridiculous claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/apr/03/leaders-better-community/attack-ads-milwaukee-comptroller-race-exaggerate-m/

Fact-checking a conspiracy theory about 5G and the coronavirus
","A conspiracy theory with roots in a Russian propaganda campaign is getting new life amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a March 28 post, a Facebook user refers to Public Law No. 116-129 and claims the government is taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to distract from the installation of 5G cellular data towers. The technology is the latest upgrade to speed up wireless internet connections. ""5G LAW PASSED while everyone was distracted,"" the post reads. ""Signed into law 116-129 on 3-23-2020, that will speed up the installation of 5G and protect profits! Children had to be out of schools for the covert installation. Parents are you seeing what's happening?"" The post also lists 20 purported symptoms of 5G exposure, including shortness of breath and fever — symptoms similar to those of COVID-19. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) We’ve fact-checked other conspiracy theories that falsely connect the coronavirus outbreak to the development of 5G, so we wanted to look into this one, too. There is no evidence that the new law was deliberately passed during the COVID-19 pandemic. And while some experts have speculated that 5G’s high-frequency radio waves could have some adverse health effects, such as neurological disorders, other reports say the fear is overblown. On March 23, President Donald Trump signed a law that requires the president to work with federal agencies to ""secure and protect"" 5G infrastructure in the United States. ""The Act requires the President to develop and implement a strategy for the adoption of secure wireless communications technology in the United States and abroad,"" Trump said in a White House statement. ""The strategy will protect the American people from security threats to telecommunications networks and 5G technology."" The Secure 5G and Beyond Act contains a provision to ""protect the competitiveness of United States companies,"" but it says nothing about the ""covert installation"" of 5G towers, as the Facebook post claims. The legislation is not specifically focused on speeding up the implementation of 5G. By March 23, the coronavirus crisis was well underway in the U.S. The World Health Organization reported 31,573 confirmed cases across the country, and Trump said during a press briefing that the numbers ""are going to increase with time."" However, there is no evidence that Congress waited to pass the 5G law during the coronavirus outbreak. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced the legislation last spring, and the Senate Commerce Committee finalized it in December. The full Senate passed the bill on March 4. The second part of the Facebook post lists a slew of symptoms purportedly associated with exposure to 5G networks. While some experts are concerned about the potential health effects of 5G, there is no evidence to support the flu-like effects listed in the post. Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, supports a moratorium on 5G development. He wrote in Scientific American that there could be health effects and that research needs to be funded. ""The latest cellular technology, 5G, will employ millimeter waves for the first time in addition to microwaves that have been in use for older cellular technologies, 2G through 4G,"" he wrote. ""Given limited reach, 5G will require cell antennas every 100 to 200 meters, exposing many people to millimeter wave radiation."" Short-term exposure to millimeter waves can cause physiological effects in the nervous system, immune system and cardiovascular system, while long-term exposure could lead to conditions like melanoma and sterility, according to Moskowitz. However, he also wrote that there is no research to confirm a correlation between 5G exposure and those broad health conditions, much less the very specific symptoms listed in the Facebook post. RELATED: No evidence that coronavirus was faked to cover up ‘5G Syndrome’ And other reports say the fears of 5G exposure are overblown: ""The vast majority of evidence says there’s no reason to pause deployments."" — Rod Waterhouse, an electrical engineer, wireless-communications entrepreneur and editor of a report on 5G, speaking to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ""There’s little reason to think 5G frequencies are any more harmful than other types of electromagnetic radiation, like visible light."" — Wired magazine ""The 5G Health Hazard That Isn’t — How one scientist and his inaccurate chart led to unwarranted fears of wireless technology."" — New York Times headline False and misleading social media posts about 5G and coronavirus are similar to a Russian propaganda campaign that’s aimed at delegitimizing the technology’s implementation in the U.S. In May 2019, the New York Times reported that Russian network RT America was airing unsubstantiated reports linking 5G exposure to brain cancer, infertility and autism.  ""It’s economic warfare,"" Ryan Fox, chief operating officer of technology firm New Knowledge, told the New York Times. ""Russia doesn’t have a good 5G play, so it tries to undermine and discredit ours."" Hundreds of blogs and websites have republished RT’s dubious claims about 5G, according to the newspaper. And over the past week, we’ve seen dozens of Facebook and Instagram posts build on that misinformation by baselessly linking the coronavirus pandemic to the development of 5G. (Screenshot from Instagram) The conspiracies are particularly popular among anti-vaccine and alternative-health Facebook groups and Instagram accounts. In a March 30 Instagram post, which has more than 146,000 likes, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted a conspiracy theory about 5G and the coronavirus. Kennedy, the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, is among the biggest sources of anti-vaccine advertisements on Facebook. ""The quarantine has facilitated the unobstructed #5G rollout,"" Kennedy said in his post, which echoes the claims made in the March 28 Facebook post. According to Google Trends, search queries for ""coronavirus 5G"" have spiked since early March. A Facebook post claimed that the government used the coronavirus pandemic to distract from the passage of a 5G law. Trump signed a law March 23 that aims to ""secure and protect"" 5G infrastructure in the U.S. The legislation has a provision to protect American companies, but it says nothing about installing more 5G towers. While some experts have said there could be adverse health effects associated with 5G, other reports say the fears are overblown.

Letting a fever run to fight coronavirus could be risky
","If you’re a mostly healthy person who contracts the coronavirus, will letting your fever run high help get rid of it? That’s what a post shared on Facebook suggests. It says:  ""Passing along corona advise from a retired respiratory therapist"" for ""the otherwise generally healthy population.""  It lists eight recommendations, starting with: ""For people experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms with or without a COVID-19 diagnosis. … Only high temperatures kill a virus, so let your fever run high. … Use common sense and don't let fever go over 103 or 104 if you got the guts."" The final recommendation is: ""If your still dying go to ER."" (Yes, it says, ""advise"" instead of ""advice"" and ""your"" instead of ""you’re"" in the post.)  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ll first note that it’s best to take your medical advice from health care professionals, not from random Facebook posts. Doctors say it’s true that a high temperature can help the body fight off a virus, but not enough is known about the new coronavirus to support the post’s advice, and running a high fever could be dangerous. A fever means you have a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Fevers are a common sign of illness, but they also play a key role in fighting infections. Generally speaking, a fever is ""basically a symptom of your immune system trying to fight the virus"" Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, told PolitiFact. ""The higher temperature does make it more difficult for some viruses to survive."" The Mayo Clinic offers general tips — for otherwise healthy people and not specifically for coronavirus — on deciding whether to treat a fever or let it run its course. For example, for adults with a temperature above 102, Mayo recommends acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brands), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or aspirin.  But it says treatment decisions also depend on age, medical history, other symptoms and other factors,  not just temperature. Fever, along with cough and shortness of breath, is among the symptoms of COVID-19. If you have symptoms and think you have been exposed to COVID-19, call your healthcare provider, the CDC advises. CDC’s Self-Checker tool can help you make decisions about seeking medical care. Mayo Clinic also offers a tool that helps you decide on seeking medical care and whether you need a COVID-19 test. If you’ll be treating COVID-19 symptoms at home, get enough rest, stay well-hydrated, and take medications to relieve fever and aches and pains, Harvard Medical School says.  For fever, aches and pains, the school recommends acetaminophen. But if you are taking any combination cold or flu medicine, keep track of all the ingredients and doses, and make sure not to exceed a total of 3,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Mayo Clinic recommends rest and fluids, as well as cough medication, and pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.  There have been some claims that using ibuprofen to treat coronavirus symptoms is risky. We found that some medical experts believe ibuprofen’s anti-inflammatory properties could damp the immune system’s ability to fight off COVID-19. But experts say this is just a theory and that there’s no scientific evidence that links ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory medications with COVID-19 complications. That said, there is no rule that says you need to lower a fever with over-the-counter medication if you’re feeling only mild symptoms and are not uncomfortable, Consumer Reports says in an article on COVID-19 and fevers. It lists a cold compress for sweating and blankets for chills, along with rest and liquids, as alternatives.  The article says there is an argument for letting a fever run its course, because lowering a fever with medication might suppress your body’s ability to fend off illness, ""but if your fever is running at or above 103 degrees, you should call a doctor. A high fever could lead to a seizure or brain damage."" Dr. Myron Cohen, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology, and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina and director of its Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases, told PolitiFact that while there is research suggesting that fever can defend against infection, ""it is extremely difficult to relate the magnitude of fever to the severity of infection, or to demonstrate the benefits of fever for any given microorganism,"" including the COVID-19 virus.  The body’s immune response is the most important factor in killing the virus, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease physician-scientist at the University of Maryland. ""The fever response is just one of the symptoms that are experienced when the immune response is revved up when fighting the virus. It is like what smoke is to fire—the point is that you are not focusing your concern on putting out the smoke; you want to put out the fire,"" he said. Said Watanabe: ""The caveat here is how heat-tolerant is COVID-19? That is, as far as I am aware, an unanswered question. There are viruses that are relatively heat-tolerant, so your body’s fever defense may not be effective."" A Facebook post advises that generally healthy people ""experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms with or without a COVID-19 diagnosis"" should ""let your fever run high"" to kill a coronavirus. Generally speaking, a fever under 103 degrees doesn’t necessarily need treatment. But that depends on other factors, such as age, underlying health conditions and other symptoms.  Higher temperatures and persistent fevers are dangerous. And it isn’t yet known whether a fever might help the body fight the novel coronavirus, as it does other viruses. The advice on letting a fever run high to fight the coronavirus, even with generally healthy people and mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, is too broad.

No, empty hospital beds do not indicate COVID-19 is 'fake crisis'

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

""Canceled elective procedures and admissions are freeing up bed space to prepare for (the) surge,"" Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases expert and internal medicine professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, told PolitiFact. ""In regions where hospitalization rates from COVID are still relatively low, this is resulting in more empty beds — which is good. The surge is coming to them as well.""  There is plenty of evidence showing how extensive the outbreak is and is expected to continue to be. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, has estimated between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die from the pathogen even as communities adopt stronger social distancing measures. And an analysis from ProPublica and the Harvard Global Health Institute found that even in a ""moderate case"" scenario — where 40% of the adult population contracts the disease over the course of a year — the country would need to more than double available hospital beds by freeing up existing beds or adding new ones. The report also noted that America lags behind China and Italy, where the epidemic has overwhelmed hospitals, when it comes to hospital bed capacity. The U.S. has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people, compared with 3.2 in Italy and 4.3 in China. There are also stark regional differences in hospital capacity. Modeling suggests that hospitals in more urban communities will likely be more stressed, but  larger hospital systems may also have more flexibility to stretch their resources if they shift patients around to free up beds. Within days of the Facebook post, one U.S. Navy hospital ship had arrived in Los Angeles, and another was two days from reaching New York City, both to provide relief from the coronavirus pandemic, with space for 1,000 beds each.  Again, there are examples of hospitals with empty beds, but the key reason is that they are clearing out space to treat coronavirus patients. A few we found: On the day of the Facebook post, only 70% of the beds at the University of Nebraska Medical Center were occupied, spokesman Taylor Wilson told PolitiFact. ""It's only because we've canceled elective procedures to prepare for a surge of coronavirus patients,"" he said. Two days after the Facebook post, the local newspaper in Syracuse, N.Y., about 250 miles northwest of New York City — where the outbreak is worst — reported that Syracuse’s three hospitals had a total of 300 empty beds. That was attributed to cancellations of scheduled non-emergency surgeries and postponements of other hospital admissions, as well as a decline in seasonal flu activity. Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston was only about 65% occupied, well below its usual 99%, because it was preparing for a surge of coronavirus patients, WBUR radio reported three days before the post. In West Virginia, some hospitals are having cash flow problems and at least one, Charleston Area Medical Center, has cut the hours of some employees because of fewer patients and procedures, a statewide radio network reported.   A Facebook post amid the surging coronavirus outbreak claimed nurses are reporting mostly empty hospitals in the United States and suggested it shows a conspiracy to exaggerate the coronavirus outbreak.  There are hospitals with significant numbers of empty beds, but that’s because they are canceling non-urgent surgeries and other procedures in an effort to free up bed space for an expected influx of coronavirus patients. The COVID-19 outbreak is real. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2020/apr/03/facebook-posts/hospital-beds-being-kept-empty-prepare-covid-influ/

What’s true, what’s not in Biden’s attacks on Trump and getting experts in China amid coronavirus
","Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has targeted what he sees as a couple of key failures by President Donald Trump that made the coronavirus crisis worse. In a CNN virtual town hall, Biden talked about the early days as the virus spread from China. ""I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know what's actually happening,"" Biden said March 27. ""There was no effort to do that. He didn't put any pressure on (Chinese President) Xi. I guess because of his trade deal, which wasn't much of a deal. And in addition to that, what happened was, we had one person in-country who was working. He pulled him out of the country."" There are two claims to sort out: that Trump made no effort to get American epidemiologists into China, and that he pulled out the one person who was working there. Biden’s first claim distorts the American response, and the second skips over other changes that took place at the same time.  The words of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Jan. 28 undercut Biden’s sweeping statement that ""there was no effort"" to get experts into China. Azar said that by Jan. 6, about a week after China confirmed the existence of a new virus, ""we offered to send a CDC team to China."" ""I reiterated that offer when I spoke to China's Minister of Health on Monday (Jan. 27), and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization today,"" Azar said. ""We are urging China: More cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response."" There is no question that China resisted the presence of outside experts. The World Health Organization was working its own medical diplomacy to get more visibility into the China situation. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met with Xi on Jan. 28 in Beijing. That was a month into the pandemic and while he won approval for the deployment of a WHO team, that didn’t happen until Feb. 10. The WHO group included some Americans, but in a statement, the Health and Human Services Departments said the Chinese ""limited the ability and timing for CDC staff to participate in the WHO joint mission."" Biden’s campaign staff said that Trump himself should have pressed the issue in his conversations with Xi. We asked the White House press office if he had and got no comment.  Regardless, Azar, a high-ranking member of the cabinet, did tell his Chinese counterpart that the United States was ready to provide people.  In a Jan. 27 tweet, Trump said he had broadly done the same. ""We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary. Our experts are extraordinary,"" Trump said. Biden said Trump pulled the ""one person"" in China ""who was working."" This, his staff said, referred to the July 2019 departure of an American epidemiologist from the CDC’s China office. (The CDC maintains offices in countries around the world. The one in China dates back to 2003.) Reuters reported that the CDC epidemiologist, Linda Quick, would have been in a position to help Chinese experts respond to the emerging disease precisely because she was embedded in China’s CDC to train Chinese specialists. The CDC’s website shows that the U.S. staff in China went from eight in March 2019 to three in December 2019. The change was driven by a shift in the U.S. strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department said. ""The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief under the Office of Global AIDS Coordinator moved to a regional model in this region and based on the epidemic in China to date, changes were made to the existing footprint,"" the department’s statement said. In July 2019, the CDC said it would complete its PEPFAR-funded work in China that year. The department’s statement also said that CDC began ""scaling up"" before the outbreak. That didn’t necessarily mean additional U.S. staff. The program hires more Chinese staffers than American ones. Biden said that Trump made ""no effort"" to get American experts into China and pulled the ""one person"" the U.S. had on the ground out of China. Trump’s personal role is unclear, but his Health and Human Services secretary did make the effort to get U.S. experts inside. The department reached out to China in the first week of January, and secretary Azar asked his Chinese counterpart again in late January. China resisted outsiders, both from the U.S. and WHO.  Biden’s assertion that Trump pulled the ""one person"" out of China has more substance, but is not as straight-forward as he made it sound. An American CDC epidemiologist left in July and was not replaced. The overall American staff went from eight down to three. According to the Health and Human Services Department, the staff reduction was mainly driven by changes in the U.S. strategy to reduce HIV/AIDS. Biden made it sound as though everyone left, but some CDC staff remained. The first claim is, at best, exaggerated, and the second is murky on the details.

No, the coronavirus did not cause the death rate to drop in Chicago
","As the coronavirus forces people across the country to stay indoors, questions have emerged over how the pandemic is impacting crime rates.  It’s a debate of particular significance to cities like Chicago, which is accustomed to high levels of violent crime. As of April 1, 2020, the virus sickened over 3,000 people in Chicago and killed 39 — even as Illinois officials attempt to contain the spread through a stay-at-home order.  But a March 22, 2020, Facebook post that accumulated more than 2,200 shares took it one step further. ""In Chicago, Covid-19 actually LOWERED the death rate,"" the post stated, over a background of laughing emojis. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Murders in Chicago decreased in March 2020 compared to years prior, but officials have yet to attribute that shift to COVID-19.  And overall, deaths don’t appear to be declining. The first case of COVID-19 arrived in Illinois in January after a 60-year-old Chicago woman returned from Wuhan, China — where the virus originated — but like many states did not see a surge in cases until March. Illinois reported its first death on March 17, a patient who was a Chicago resident. The most recent available numbers on deaths in Chicago come from the Cook County Medical Examiner, which takes cases that require additional investigation to determine a cause of death. If someone was under the care of a doctor when they died, that case wouldn’t necessarily go to the medical examiner because the doctor can sign off on their death certificate. So it’s important to note that information from the medical examiner doesn’t encompass all deaths in Chicago. But it does provide a valuable snapshot. The examiner’s office handled 413 deaths in Chicago in March, according to its case archive as of April 2. At least 11 of them were tied to COVID-19, while other causes of death ranged from gunshot wounds to cardiovascular disease.  In March 2019, by comparison, the medical examiner saw 279 deaths in Chicago. There were 301 Chicago cases in March 2018 and 306 in March 2017. These numbers show the virus doesn’t appear to be decreasing deaths as the Facebook post suggested. Instead, officials say it's likely the opposite. ""The uptick you are seeing is a direct correlation to the rise in COVID-19 cases,"" said Natalia Derevyanny, director of communications for the Cook County Bureau of Administration. Chicago sees high rates of gun violence largely tied to gang conflict. Given its reputation, this Facebook post implies that the virus is ultimately saving lives because people are inside and not on the streets. The poster did not respond to a request for comment. According to the Chicago Police Department, the city saw 24 homicides in March, a decrease from 35 in March of last year. But shootings and shooting victims for the month jumped roughly 6% and 5%, respectively. The department declined to say whether it attributes the decrease in homicides to COVID-19. According to the Chicago Tribune, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been hesitant to draw a line between the virus and crime. ""We can’t specifically say that the crime rate is affected by coronavirus,"" Lightfoot said. ""But obviously what we know going back many, many years and looking at data is that when large congregations of people are outside in neighborhoods where gun violence is prevalent, that increases the risk."" A footnote: In Milwaukee — another city plagued by gun violence — there were more homicides in March 2020 than March 2019, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s homicide tracker. A Facebook post shared by more than 2,000 people claimed that in Chicago, COVID-19 has lowered the death rate. But numbers from the Cook County Medical Examiner do not indicate that deaths in Chicago decreased in March as COVID-19 started to ravage Illinois. In fact, the data suggest the opposite — more deaths, despite a decrease in murders reported by Chicago police.

Don’t let this Facebook post scare you: Hand sanitizer is flammable, but safe when used correctly
","Public health officials say one of the best ways to avoid catching the coronavirus is to wash your hands with soap and water or, when that’s not an option, rub them with hand sanitizer. But some Facebook users are sharing posts saying hand sanitizer can be dangerous. ""This lady here applied sanitizer to her hands/forearms & went to the kitchen to cook,"" said a March 23 Facebook post showing the arms of a burn victim. ""The moment she turned on the gas stove, her hands caught fire due to the alcohol contained in the sanitizer.""  ""Y'all please be careful!"" the post warned. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  RELATED: Hand sanitizer can be used to prevent coronavirus infection We found no credible news reports detailing the incident in question, which fact-checkers in India said was a hoax. Medical experts told us that while hand sanitizer is flammable, the fire risks largely disappear when the sanitizer is applied properly and given time to dry. We can’t say for sure that the Facebook post doesn’t show a woman whose arms were burned from a hand sanitizer-induced flame. The post has the ingredients of a hoax, however. For starters, we were unable to identify the original source of the photo through reverse image searches on Google, TinEye and Yandex. Our searches on Google and Nexis for related news reports also turned up no results, whereas other sanitizer mishaps have been widely covered. Fact-checkers in India and online bloggers suggested the wounds in the photo were the result of skin grafting, a surgical procedure in which healthy skin is transplanted onto a new part of the body. But Andrew Vardanian, assistant clinical professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at UCLA and a plastic surgeon at UCLA Health, told us the image looked to him like a second-degree burn — and likely not one that came from hand sanitizer. ""The straight line on the left arm is too straight for this to have happened from hand sanitizer, he said. ""It is more consistent with a submersion type burn into something that caused a scald."" Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are flammable, which is why the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, the World Health Organization and major manufacturers like Purell all offer fire safety warnings for use. Travelers typically can’t carry large amounts on planes. But while bottles and dispensers of hand sanitizer are recommended to be stored away from flames, the CDC and the WHO both say the incidence of fire from use is ""very low."" A WHO webpage says that the benefits ""in terms of infection prevention far outweigh the fire risks."" Proper application and use mitigates the fire risks, experts told us. ""The directions for alcohol based sanitizers often state to rub it into your hands until they are dry, which would reduce the fire risk because the flammable liquid and vapors would evaporate,"" said Jeffrey Gardner, associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ""Once a person’s hands are dry, the fire risk would dramatically decrease."" ""If properly applied with hands rubbed together until the liquid evaporates, it shouldn't burst into flame,"" added Michael Gochfeld, professor emeritus of clinical research and occupational medicine at Rutgers University.  It takes about 20 seconds of rubbing for hand sanitizer to fully dry on your hands, according to the CDC and the WHO.  Vardanian said surgeons often use flammable products to sterilize the skin before surgery, but he said ""we wait for a few minutes until we start draping to prevent these types of injuries."" ""If someone used massive amounts of hand sanitizer and then contacted a flame, there may be a fire and a burn can result from this,"" he said of the Facebook post.

Are COVID-19 travel restrictions ‘more critical in saving lives’ than testing? Not really
","Defending President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response, Fox News commentator Jesse Watters highlighted federal efforts to restrict international travelers who may be infected – a ban he claimed mattered more than diagnostic testing. ""We were slow with the testing, but very quick with the travel ban. And that's been much more critical in saving lives,"" Watters said in a March 31 episode of ""The Five"" on the Fox News Channel. The administration has attracted stinging criticism from public health experts and state officials, who say the dearth of COVID-19 tests has made it impossible to get a handle on the disease’s spread. But the impact of the restrictions Trump had imposed – both on people traveling from China and, by March, from Europe and the United Kingdom – is another story. So we decided to dig in. We contacted Fox News to find out the evidence on which Watters based his comment but did not hear back. Early on, those restrictions won plaudits. After the March restrictions, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said there was ""compelling evidence"" to justify restricting travel from those high-infection areas. But the implementation is another story. Global health specialists told us there is little to no evidence that Trump’s restrictions have restrained  COVID-19 – they came too late and didn’t have the follow-up necessary to make a real dent. By contrast, they said, better and earlier testing could have saved countless lives. Targeted, quick travel restrictions can be part of the public health arsenal to control the spread of an illness such as COVID-19. The idea is to stop people in hot spots from carrying the virus to uninfected areas. The restrictions also tamp down on the risk that an infected traveler will expose others in the closed quarters of an airport, airplane or other mode of transportation. But the experts we spoke to made clear that these restrictions can work only as one (smaller) part of a comprehensive strategy. Without other aggressive public health measures, they would have little value. The timing of American restrictions – and how they interacted with other domestic efforts – rendered them ineffective. The administration’s first coronavirus-related travel restrictions took effect Feb. 2, targeting non-citizens who had recently traveled to or from China. On Feb. 29, it took similar steps with people who had traveled to or from Iran. For context, the incidence of a severe respiratory illness began to emerge in China late last year. These cases were confirmed to be a novel coronavirus by Jan. 7, and the first American case was reported Jan. 20 – almost two weeks before any travel restrictions were in effect. Expanded travel restrictions took effect March 13 and 16 to include people in Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland. Experts told us those measures represented the wrong approach at the wrong time. ""When the travel ban was put in place, the risk of importation from China was quite small,"" said William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. For one thing, China had also put in place its own limitations on travel – limiting travel to and from Wuhan starting Jan. 23. And, by then, there were already several cases of coronavirus across both the United States and in other countries that had not been targeted by restrictions. And while European cases shot up in early March – particularly in Italy – even those travel restrictions were misplaced, he said. At that point, Americans already faced a domestic threat from the virus. So was the administration ""very quick"" with a travel ban? Not really. If anything, the travel limitations gave people ""a false sense that something with a big impact was being done,"" said Jennifer Kates, a vice president and global health expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) That false security, others said, distracted from the reality that more essential precautions weren’t in place. Well-implemented travel restrictions can buy time on the margins, research suggests. But that time has to be used effectively – to ramp up emergency preparedness and bolster activities like testing and isolating people who may have been exposed. And there’s no way to know if the Trump administration’s initial travel restriction – barring people who had been to China – reduced the spread of coronavirus. That’s because the administration limited testing for the virus to people who were sick enough to be hospitalized or who had been to Wuhan specifically. Those are people with a heightened risk of exposure, and not representative of the broader swath of people affected by the travel limitations, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Had we expanded testing during this time and still found few cases I would be more convinced that the travel ban had an impact. But we didn’t."" Available research on travel bans isn’t promising, either. A March 20 analysis run by Think Global Health, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, compared countries that did and didn’t restrict travel with China. The researchers found no correlation between travel restrictions and preventing a pandemic outbreak. ""The combination of the travel restrictions within China and international travel restrictions against China may have delayed the spread of COVID-19, but more so in nations that used that time to reduce community spread of the virus,"" the researchers wrote. That last part is crucial – travel restrictions may have bought time, but that mattered only if countries actively fought domestic spread. Other research backs that up. A paper published in Science last month found that when China imposed its own travel restrictions, it made only a modest difference in curbing the spread of the coronavirus, both domestically and to other countries -- at most, buying a few days’ time. And, this paper also notes, travel restrictions were effective only when coupled with other efforts to halt transmission. By contrast, researchers were unanimous in noting the effectiveness of  robust testing of people who may have been exposed -- and then isolating those who test positive for the virus. This test-and-quarantine approach has been proven effective in South Korea, which experienced its first case on the same day as in the U.S. but where the number of new COVID-19 cases is now on a dramatic decline. If you could pick only one strategy – travel bans or testing – the choice is clear, Nuzzo argued. ""We don’t have any evidence that travel bans did much to stop or slow the spread,"" she said. ""Conversely, testing is essential. Had we been better able to find and isolate cases and traced their contacts, we could have kept case numbers down."" The World Health Organization makes a similar point: It says temporary restrictions are justified only in narrow circumstances and as a way to buy time. But that time, the organization says, must be used to ""rapidly implement effective preparedness measures"" – like testing. Another point that supports this position: the real-world experience unfolding in the United States. The ""travel ban didn’t work,"" said Lawrence Gostin, a university professor at Georgetown Law, who specializes in global health law. ""This is self-evident, because the U.S. is now the global epicenter."" Arguing in support of the White House coronavirus response, Watters said the United States was ""very quick with the travel ban"" and that was ""much more critical in saving lives."" This is incorrect. Travel restrictions could have bought a bit of time. But they were instituted after the coronavirus had already entered the United States. And the evidence at hand suggests that travel restrictions are most effective in combating viral spread if they are accompanied by targeted, robust testing and quarantining, which are the areas in which the administration stumbled. If you were to pick only one area to excel in – testing people for coronavirus or travel restrictions – experts told us that the research clearly supports testing, even without travel bans. Watters’ claim has no factual basis and misrepresents real-world evidence on multiple levels.

""The RFID chips that are routinely used for the tracking of pets are as small as a grain of rice … or in other words, they are as large as a grain of rice, and no vaccine needles in use are that large in diameter."" Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida who has written extensively about conspiracy theories, told us this type of hoax is typical of many theories rooted in otherwise legitimate concerns about privacy. It isn’t surprising that the hoax has been adapted to the current outbreak and included in misinformation about the novel coronavirus, he said. Tracking technology has been deployed in the battle against the coronavirus. Singapore, China and South Korea have employed a number of data-generating tools to help track movement, monitor quarantines and identify where infected people are, for example. Human-rights organizations say the ramped up surveillance comes with significant privacy concerns and ethical challenges that the U.S. is still grappling with. But while there is ongoing discussion of how to use technology to help track virus spread, this ""antivirus"" implant notion remains very far afield from what is actually unfolding.  ""The fear of insertion of tracking chips and other things like that into our bodies has been a longstanding bogeyman for theorists,"" Fenster said. ""There is a lot of tracking that goes on, but the suggestion that it’s being used in this manner and this way seems absurd. This comes from the stream of conspiracy theories of the last 50 years.

For now, Texas among states with lowest coronavirus death rate
","During a March coronavirus briefing, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the state has one of the lowest coronavirus death rates in the country — a trend he said he hopes will continue through April. ""If you look at the death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country,"" he said. ""But we need to continue that for the rest of April. And even be better at that."" The first issue here is that Patrick is conflating two calculations in his statement: the death rate for the coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas. The death rate of a particular illness or disease is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the number of confirmed cases of the illness. A geography’s total population isn’t a factor. It is possible to look at the number of coronavirus deaths per capita, but it says less about the danger posed by the virus than the death rate. To give Patrick a fair shake, we’ll take a look at both of these figures and how Texas compares to other states. Patrick did not return a request for comment seeking clarification on his statement. ""The death rate is generally a function of the number of people infected,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an email. ""We are often unsure of this because this depends on sampling, and the tests deployed."" For this reason, we’ll also look at the number of tests administered by each state. As more tests are administered and more cases are identified, the death rate for the virus will change. Given that the number of cases and fatalities is constantly changing, this fact-check will use data from March 31 — the day Patrick made his statement. Along these lines, it is important to remember that the death rate at this point in time is just a snapshot. ""Case fatality rates are not constant. They can change considerably during an epidemic if, for example, it is discovered that there are many more milder cases than originally thought,"" according to a statement from the World Health Organization to PolitiFact at the end of March. The WHO also noted that the rate may vary across different geographies due to ""demographic factors, for example differences in the age structure of the population."" End of March numbers At the time of Patrick’s remarks, there were 3,266 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Texas and 41 related deaths reported by state health authorities. This puts the approximate death rate for the virus at 1.26%, meaning 1.26% of people who tested positive for the virus died. Looking at all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, Texas is among the areas with the lowest coronavirus death rate. Eleven states had a lower death rate when Patrick made his statement, including several with just one death: Wisconsin (1.18%), Missouri (1.06%), Tennessee (1.03%), South Dakota (0.93%), New Hampshire, (0.82%), West Virginia (0.62%), Utah (0.56%), North Carolina (0.53%), Hawaii (0.47%) and Wyoming, which had reported zero coronavirus deaths on the last day of March. ""It appears that Texas is among the states with low coronavirus deaths, but that is still true of large portions of the U.S. at this point,"" said Dr. Dhitinut Ratnapradipa, an environmental health professor at Sam Houston State University. At the time of Patrick’s claim, 29 states had a death rate of less than 2%. The state with the highest death rate on March 31 was Louisiana, with about 5,237 confirmed coronavirus cases and 239 deaths, a rate of 4.56%. Patrick’s statement also referenced deaths ""per capita of 29 million people"" in Texas. Texas is among the states with the fewest deaths per capita, based on March 31 coronavirus data and 2018 1-year population estimates from the Census Bureau’s American Communities Survey. When Patrick spoke, there had been fewer than one coronavirus death for every 100,000 people in Texas. The state with the most deaths per capita at the time was New York, with about eight deaths per 100,000 people. But Texas is also among the states that have administered the fewest number of coronavirus tests per capita. At the time of Patrick’s statement, Texas had administered 42,992 coronavirus tests — about 150 per 100,000 people. New York had administered about 1,050 tests per 100,000 people, or 205,186 tests in total. ""The number of confirmed cases is directly related to testing,"" Ratnapradipa said in an email. ""There is likely widespread community infection of people with no or mild symptoms who are not being tested. This means that we cannot accurately calculate a COVID-19 fatality rate."" Cohen said it is important to remember that the current pandemic is ""dynamic and growing, worldwide"" and that declaring any kind of victory over the virus ""is probably a bad idea at this point in time for most places on the planet."" Since Patrick made this claim, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the state has almost doubled, the state confirmed more than 1,000 additional cases and administered more than 10,000 additional tests. Our ruling Patrick said looking at the coronavirus ""death rate in Texas, per capita of 29 million people, we're one of the lowest in the country."" Patrick’s statement equates the death rate for coronavirus and the number of coronavirus deaths per capita in Texas, two different calculations. It is true that, at the time of Patrick’s statement, Texas was among the states with the lowest coronavirus death rate (and those with lowest number of deaths per capita) — but not by much. There were 29 states with a death rate of less than 2%. Experts cautioned that the actual coronavirus death rate cannot be accurately calculated until more people have been tested — and Texas is among the states with the lowest number of tests administered per capita. Patrick’s comparison is accurate based on the information available at the time of his statement, but his claim needs clarification and is missing important context about testing.

Wisconsin justice Kelly overreaches with claim that challenger Karofsky wants to disarm citizens
","In the race for a seat on the state Supreme Court, Justice Daniel Kelly and challenger Dane County Circuit Judge Jill Karofsky have clashed on many fronts, but perhaps especially so on guns and the Second Amendment. Kelly faced criticism after hosting a fundraiser at a Brookfield gun range the day after the Molson Coors shooting. At a March 12, 2020, forum hosted by the Milwaukee Bar Association, Kelly called the criticism a cheap political hit.   Meanwhile, at the same forum, Karofsky called Kelly posing with an assault-style rifle ""a clearly partisan move.""  Even before that, Kelly’s campaign made a stronger accusation in a March 3, 2020 email sent to supporters, in which Kelly claimed: ""Judge Karofsky and her radical liberal allies want to disarm law abiding citizens.""  Is the assertion correct?  When asked to back up the claim, Kelly campaign manager Charles Nichols first pointed to a series of Karofsky tweets.  ""In December 2019, Jill Karofsky called for increased gun control laws on Twitter following two incidents in Wisconsin schools,"" Nichols said in an email. ""Law enforcement later revealed that the weapons used in both incidents weren’t actually guns. Karofsky’s tweet called on lawmakers to put forward stricter gun laws."" But putting forward stricter gun laws is not the same as wanting to ""disarm law abiding citizens."" For instance, one often-discussed legislative proposal is to tighten background checks, which would fall far short of disarming citizens. Let’s take a closer look. On Dec. 2, 2019, at Waukesha South High School, an ""angry"" 17-year-old student pointed a pellet gun at the head of a fellow student, pulled a pellet gun again later when officers arrived, and then was shot three times by police, according to news reports.  The following day, at Oshkosh West High School, a 16-year-old student with an ""edged weapon"" stabbed a school resource officer, and the officer shot the student.  The Karofsky tweets in question all came on Dec. 3, 2019, beginning with this one: ""As a mom of two teenagers, my heart races every time I hear about yet another school shooting. I'm relieved that no one was killed in yesterday’s shooting at Waukesha South High School, and today’s shooting at Oshkosh West High School."" She went on to refer to families in Sparta and at Waukesha North who ""had to deal with lockdowns"" and a ""hit list in Shorewood."" She thanked first responders, and said parents should not have to worry about the safety of their kids at school. Pretty straightforward. Then she got to what the Kelly campaign is citing. ""It's up to the policy-makers to decide what the law should be, and judges like me are here to apply and interpret the law. But I know action is needed,"" she tweeted. Then she added this:  ""We can respect constitutional rights and at the same time take steps to make every family safer. It’s way past time for lawmakers to step up to the plate."" So, as evidence, the tweets don’t really stand up. Karofsky did not advocate any specific changes, noted it’s up to policymakers to decide what laws to advance, and talked explicitly about respecting constitutional rights in the process. As in a trial, we view the burden of proof as falling on the one who makes the charges. So far, Kelly clearly falls short. Nichols, the Kelly campaign manager, also pointed to a Jan. 24, 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that laid out the views and records of the candidates on a series of hot-button issues. In a section on guns, the article described the candidates and their views on a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Heller, which held the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment of the Constitution is an individual right, rather than a collective right for groups like militias. ""I've read it carefully, and I've not identified any errors,"" the article quoted Kelly as saying of the decision. Meanwhile, the article offered this position from Karofsky:  ""I think that there are ways that are constitutional that we are able to limit people's possession of firearms so that we're able to live in a country where we don’t have to send our kids to school for code-red drills.""  As with the tweets, that stops well short of what Kelly claimed. What’s more, it specifically describes finding ways that are constitutional to make any changes. ""Judge Karofsky has made it clear throughout this campaign that she supports the Second Amendment and the precedent established in the Heller decision,"" Karofsky spokesman Sam Roecker said in an email. ""Dan Kelly knows this precedent requires judges to uphold the law and an individual's right to own a gun.""  Kelly claimed Karofsky wants ""to disarm law abiding citizens.""  Rather than cite any past rulings as evidence, Kelly points to a series of tweets and a Karofsky quote in a newspaper story on the race.  In both cases, Karofsky indicates she feels lawmakers should take steps to reduce gun violence -- even calling on them to ""step up to the plate."" But nowhere did she call for disarming residents. Indeed, in both places she framed the comments around abiding by the constitution, even noting it’s up to policy-makers to ""decide what the law should be."" As evidence, that’s pretty thin. Our definition of Mostly False is a ""statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.

Chloroquine is not banned in Michigan, New York and Nevada
","Facebook pages and groups are promoting misleading information about several states’ decisions to restrict access to a malaria drug that could be used to treat COVID-19. One post, published March 29 in a group called ""Keep America great Trump Pence 2020,"" claims that three Democratic governors have ""issued orders banning the prescription of hydroxychloroquine to patients with COVID-19."" The post includes photos of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak. ""For a drug deemed safe by doctors and has a history of safely treating malaria for the last 40-50 years,"" reads a caption on the post. ""So now ask yourself...who is the enemy."" The photo collage also asserts that the governors are ""threatening the licenses of doctors and pharmacist(s)."" That’s similar to a claim made in a Facebook post published by Trending Politics, a conservative opinion website, on March 27. ""The Democrat Governor of Michigan along with other Democrat governors are THREATENING doctors who prescribe the promising drug Chloroquine to Coronavirus patients,"" reads text on an image of Whitmer. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Collectively, they’ve been shared thousands of times. (Screenshot from Facebook) Since President Donald Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19, several states have restricted access to the malaria drug to prevent stockpiling — including New York and Nevada. But neither of those orders bans the use of chloroquine outright, and Michigan has not taken formal action to restrict access to the drug. New York and Nevada have limited access to chloroquine since Trump’s March 19 press briefing. But neither of the actions comprise an outright ban on the drug. Take Nevada, for example. On March 24, Sisolak signed an emergency regulation that safeguards the supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which is sold under the brand name Plaquenil and as a generic. The order prohibits doctors in outpatient settings from prescribing and dispensing the drugs for COVID-19 treatment. It also limits prescriptions to 30-day supplies. ""While the two drugs serve necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada’s own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,"" Sisolak said during a press conference. ""The emergency regulation is aimed at preventing the hoarding of the drugs so those that actually need them can have access to them."" As several news outlets have reported, physicians around the country have started to prescribe themselves chloroquine in order to hoard it for their families. That hoarding has led to drug shortages in some parts of the country, affecting patients who take chloroquine regularly to treat conditions like lupus and arthritis. Conservative organizations like Turning Point USA took Nevada’s order to mean Sisolak was banning any use of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients. But there is an exemption to the order.  RELATED: Conservative group's meme distorts Nevada’s chloroquine restrictions A spokesman for Sisolak told KSNV-TV in Las Vegas that the regulation allows for a ""chart order for an inpatient in an institutional setting,"" meaning that doctors in hospitals and emergency rooms can still prescribe chloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with COVID-19. That’s similar to what the government has done in New York. On March 23, Cuomo signed an executive order restricting the prescription of chloroquine ""except when written as prescribed for an FDA-approved indication; or as part of a state approved clinical trial related to COVID-19 for a patient who has tested positive for COVID-19."" The state has acquired more than 800,000 doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for clinical trials. And while the Food and Drug Administration has said there are no approved drugs to treat or prevent the coronavirus, the agency is investigating whether chloroquine ""can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms."" On March 28, the FDA signed an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The day before that action, Cuomo amended his previous restrictions on the drug.  The new rules allow health care providers to prescribe the drug for ""patients in inpatient settings and acute settings; for residents in a subacute part of a skilled nursing facility; or as part of an study approved by an Institutional Review Board."" The change means that, similar to Nevada, doctors in New York can now prescribe chloroquine to COVID-19 patients in hospitals and emergency rooms, but not in outpatient settings. Bottom line: Neither Nevada nor New York currently bans the use of chloroquine to treat coronavirus patients. Michigan has taken no formal action to restrict access to chloroquine. Instead, it has asked prescribers to not stockpile the drug for friends and family. On March 24, the state’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs sent a letter to ""licensed prescribers and dispensers"" about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. It said that the department had received ""multiple allegations of Michigan physicians inappropriately prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to themselves, family, friends, and/or coworkers without a legitimate medical purpose."" ""Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage for patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other ailments for which chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are proven treatments,"" the letter reads. ""Reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action."" The letter did not outline any new regulatory action related to chloroquine. In a follow-up statement published March 27, the department said the purpose of the correspondence was ""to remind both prescribers and dispensers of their continued obligation to adhere to the standards of practice."" RELATED: A 100% COVID-19 cure? No, chloroquine effectiveness only anecdotal On March 31, however, the state shifted course. It requested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile based on the FDA emergency authorization for using the drug to treat severe cases of COVID-19. The Detroit News reported that several hospitals in the metro area are using chloroquine to treat hospitalized patients. In an op-ed, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey explained why the government included the ""administrative action"" wording in its original letter. ""We needed something to prevent chloroquine from becoming the next toilet paper,"" he told the Detroit News. ""I quickly requested of (Whitmer’s) staff that they put something out, and somehow in the translation it was prohibiting use of these drugs — and that wasn't the intent."" A Facebook post claims the governors of Michigan, Nevada and New York have ordered banning the use of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients. Nevada and New York have restricted access to the malaria drug in an effort to limit stockpiling. Each state has exemptions for patients hospitalized with the coronavirus. Michigan has taken no additional regulatory action to restrict access to chloroquine; instead, it has asked prescribers to avoid giving the drug to potential stockpilers.  The Facebook posts are inaccurate.

Yes, US shipped donated personal protective equipment to China in February
","National shortages of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment have exacerbated concerns that U.S. doctors and nurses are not getting the supplies needed to help COVID-19 patients. The surging demand for masks led President Donald Trump to charge, without evidence, that the equipment earmarked for New York’s hospitals has been ""going out the back door."" But some people are pointing the blame back at Trump, who downplayed the threat of the virus early on despite warnings from experts about the health care system’s readiness.  One claim we’ve heard from politicians, TV commentators and social media users is that the U.S. gave away medical supplies that are now sorely needed at home. ""On February 7, the (World Health Organization) warned about the limited stock of PPE,"" said a March 31 Facebook post, using an acronym for personal protective equipment. ""That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China. Now our health care workers are dying because of no PPE."" The post from Blue Dem Warriors was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the information is largely accurate. The State Department announced on Feb. 7 that it had ""facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials."" The Facebook post cited as its source of information a CNN editorial criticizing the shipment. The move came more than two weeks after the first U.S. coronavirus case was detected in Washington state on Jan. 21. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Feb. 7 that the delivery would ""help save lives"" in China, which had reported more than 31,000 cases by then.   We have coordinated with U.S. organizations to transport more humanitarian relief to people in Wuhan. Personal protective equipment and other medical supplies donated by these organizations can help save lives in #China and help protect people from the #coronavirus. pic.twitter.com/57SN2TXfLP Pompeo touted the assistance again in remarks to reporters on March 31, saying it was an example of American generosity and part of an effort to keep the virus contained to China. The materials sent to China, Pompeo said, were donated by Samaritan’s Purse, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and other private organizations. Boeing and Intermountain Healthcare were also involved, according to a Feb. 15 State Department press release. On Feb. 7, the State Department also pledged to commit up to $100 million in existing funds to assist China and other countries. A State Department spokesperson told us the $100 million promise has been fulfilled with funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. aid to date also includes about $110 million in humanitarian assistance for up to 64 different countries and roughly $64 million in refugee-related assistance for the United Nations.  The spokesperson told us the security and health of Americans comes first, but that ""the spread of COVID-19 is a threat to our shared international security"" and that efforts aimed at responding to the virus abroad are also meant to help mitigate the spread in the U.S.  We won’t weigh in on whether the distribution of donated protective equipment to China was the right move. But the Facebook post is correct that the U.S. announced the delivery in February. Other fact-checkers said the same about a similar claim from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. The Facebook post also notes that the timing of the China shipment coincided with a press conference in which the World Health Organization sounded the alarm about a ""limited stock"" of personal protective equipment.  That’s accurate. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Feb. 7 of a potential supply shortage across the globe and especially in China. The warning was for the world, not the U.S. in particular. ""The world is facing severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment,"" Ghebreyesus said. ""Demand is up to 100 times higher than normal and prices are up to 20 times higher."" Ghebreyesus said the situation was made worse by people outside of patient care using masks, for example. He said health workers and caretakers should be first to receive items from the limited stock, and that health workers in China needed ""the bulk of PPE supplies."" ""WHO discourages stockpiling of (personal protective equipment) in countries and areas where transmission is low,"" he said. The Facebook post closes by saying ""our health care workers are dying because of no PPE.""  News reports indicate that some health workers — who are at an increased risk of exposure — are among the more than 200,000 infected Americans and over 4,500 who have died. Doctors and nurses have made shortages known and are tweeting the hashtag #GetMePPE. Some medical supplies are now coming into the U.S. from abroad. The White House arranged for the transport of tons of equipment from China, and the New England Patriots recently lent its team plane to pick up 1.2 million N95 masks from China for Massachusetts’ health workers. We asked the State Department whether any of the donated materials sent to China in February made their way back to the U.S., and whether the donations would have gone straight to U.S. hospitals had they not been shipped overseas. We didn’t get answers to those questions. A Facebook post said: ""On February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China."" The State Department announced the delivery of nearly 18 tons of donated materials on Feb. 7, the same day that the WHO sounded the alarm about the world’s supply of personal protective equipment.
