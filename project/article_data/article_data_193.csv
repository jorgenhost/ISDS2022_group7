Campaign ad accuses Elissa Slotkin of carpetbagging in Michigan 8th Congressional District
","It has been 18 years since a Democrat held the U.S. House seat in Michigan’s 8th Congressional District. Even so, the race between political newcomer Elissa Slotkin and incumbent Mike Bishop is viewed as a bellwether in the fight for control of the U.S. House in November. Slotkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst, is looking to unseat the two-term Republican congressman, who received 56 percent of the vote in his 2016 re-election bid. The district, which stretches from north of Detroit to the state capital Lansing, voted for President Trump with 51 percent of the vote.  Slotkin is seen as a ""different kind"" of Democrat who served in both the Bush and Obama administrations, supports existing gun rights and criticizes single-payer health care. One argument routinely made against Slotkin — and emphasized in a recent radio ad by Bishop — is her weaker ties to the district. ""What do we know about D.C. insider Elissa Slotkin? Not much, since Elissa Slotkin just parachuted into the district to run for Congress. We know that Elissa Slotkin was recruited by Nancy Pelosi and sent here from Washington. Slotkin doesn’t own a home in Michigan, and her only voting record … for herself, just a few days ago in the Michigan primary. Elissa Slotkin even admitted that she doesn’t know our area."" (Audio of Slotkin's voice) ""I did not know the outline of the district…"" ""Doesn’t know the district? Then how can Elissa Slotkin know us?"" Here, we are focusing on her Michigan ties and the claim that she ""doesn’t know"" the district’s boundaries. She's not as much of an outsider as the ad says. Slotkin’s campaign calls her a third-generation Michigan native. Slotkin was born in New York, but her family  returned to Michigan when she was 4 years old, the campaign said. Slotkin grew up on her family’s farm in Holly, which is located in the 8th district in Oakland County.  Her great-grandfather established her family’s meat business called Hygrade Foods, which opened its Detroit headquarters in 1949. The business created a number of foods, but most famously the Ballpark Frank, first sold at Tiger Stadium. Slotkin studied at Cornell University in New York and then went to graduate school at Columbia University. She served three tours in Iraq as a Central Intelligence Agency analyst before taking on various roles in Washington in the intelligence and defense departments during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Slotkin moved back to her family’s farm from D.C. in the spring of 2017 after her national security post ended with the Obama administration. She runs a small consulting business there called Pinpoint Consulting, according to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. The ad claims that Slotkin doesn’t own a home in Michigan. That is accurate, but leaves out some important context. Slotkin does not own her family’s farm herself — the deed is in the name of her father, Curtis Slotkin, Oakland County property records show. Slotkin's father and stepmother live about 30 minutes from the farm, in the Detroit suburbs of Oakland County. The farm was purchased by Slotkin’s grandfather and passed down to her father when her grandfather passed away, said Slotkin campaign spokeswoman Laura Epstein. ""When Elissa’s parents pass,"" Epstein says, ""the property will then be in her name — in line with family tradition."" Bishop’s ad asserts that Slotkin has only voted in Michigan once, and that was in her own primary. That statement, according to state records, is correct. Michigan Secretary of State Elections Bureau records show that Slotkin has only voted once in the state, and that was in the August primary. The audio clip of Slotkin talking about the district’s outlines is from a town hall event sponsored by the NAACP Lansing chapter, according to Bishop campaign consultant Stu Sandler. It is clear the audio is clipped. Slotkin said she ""did not know the outline of the district,"" even though the ad's retort of ""doesn't"" makes the listener think she still doesn't know. We were unable to obtain a full recording from that event. However, at a campaign volunteer event on July 7, Slotkin can be heard saying something similar, that she ""didn’t know, probably a year and a half ago, the exact boundaries of the district."" She then goes on to review the district’s outlines. Epstein told PolitiFact that Slotkin frequently introduces herself by giving a lay of the land at the beginning of an event and sometimes starts by talking about the district lines. Bishop’s ad portrays Slotkin as a ""Washington insider"" who parachuted into the district to run for the U.S. House. It also utilized an audio clip to allege she doesn’t know the outlines of the district. On some of the technical claims, the ad is accurate. Slotkin has only voted once in the state (in her own primary race), and she is not a Michigan homeowner. However, the ad leaves out important details about her childhood background in the district, and takes her words at a campaign event out of context. The home where she lives is owned by her parents on her family farm, and is slated to be passed down to her. The ad's soundbite is clipped to make it sound like Slotkin admitted to not knowing the outlines of her own district. A similar Slotkin statement shows she may not have known the boundaries before moving back to the state, but she does now. We rate the claim Half True. Update, Sept. 24, 2018: This report was updated to include Slotkin's birth in New York. The rating remains the same. ",/factchecks/2018/sep/19/mike-bishop/campaign-ad-accuses-elissa-slotkin-carpetbagging/

Kyrsten Sinema says she stopped a health care age tax. Really?
","Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema says she’s looking out for older Arizonans, and her voting record backs her up. In her bid for U.S. Senate, Sinema pointed to her vote against a ""new age tax."" ""We need to make it easier for Arizonans to afford their health care. That’s why I voted to stop a new ‘age tax’ on coverage for people age 50 and over,"" Sinema tweeted Sept. 8. Her tweet included an image with text that said: ""Arizonans age 50 & over could be charged 5 times more for their health care under the ‘age tax’."" We need to make it easier for Arizonans to afford their health care. That’s why I voted to stop a new “age tax” on coverage for people age 50 and over. #AZSen pic.twitter.com/g6Ydh7xkna Sinema is campaigning against Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally for the seat held by retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. The election is Nov. 6. Did Sinema vote to stop a new ""age tax"" that could have charged Arizonans 50 years and older five times more for their health care? Sinema in 2017 voted against a Republican bill that allowed insurance companies to charge certain people 50 and older up to five times more what they would charge younger adults. It wasn't a ""tax"" levied by the government. The bill would have increased the cap by which people could charge some people over 50. Her claim mimics attacks we’ve seen against Republicans, omitting the same caveats: This provision applied to people buying insurance on the individual and small-group markets. It didn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or to people 50 and older with coverage sponsored by large employers. Current law allows insurers to charge older adults three times what they charge younger adults. The American Health Care Act was part of an effort to repeal the 2010 health care law signed by President Barack Obama. The bill retained some parts of the Obama-era law, including the prohibition on insurance companies from denying coverage for a pre-existing health problem. The Republican bill passed the House in May 2017 by a vote of 217-213, with Sinema voting against it and McSally for it. The Senate failed to pass its own measure. Before Obamacare, as the Republicans called it, older adults paid about four or five times more for premiums than what younger adults paid, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. Obamacare changed the rules so that insurance companies could still charge older adults more than younger adults, but only by up to three times. Here’s a sample of the 2018 age rating curve: • A 50-year-old pays 1.786 times the amount that a younger person pays; • A 55-year-old pays 2.230 times the amount that a younger person pays; and • Someone 64 and older pays 3 times the amount that a younger person pays. The 2017 House bill that Sinema voted against sought to increase the ratio to 5-to-1 for certain adults over 50. It allowed states to set a different ratio. However, the proposal didn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people older than 50 who had coverage through large employers. Katie Keith, a researcher for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said the policy change would have made overall premiums ""significantly more unaffordable."" The Trump administration would have to figure out how to set an age rating curve, Keith said, ""but all of these numbers would shift up significantly, even if not five times as much, at all ages over 50."" The age rating works on a curve that increases with each year of age (for adults), so ""it's probably most accurate to say that seniors 50 and over could be charged up to 5 times more,"" Keith said. It's an open question as to whether Arizona would have set a different ratio under the Republican repeal, Keith said. Under current law, states can request ratios less than the federal standard, but Arizona — like most states — hasn’t done that, Keith said. The 2017 health care bill also could have increased health care costs for older adults, because the legislation would have replaced income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. Under the proposal, adults under 30 would get a $2,000 credit; adults over 60, a $4,000 credit; and individuals who made more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who filed jointly earning $150,000) would have tax credits phased out. According to AARP calculations, under AHCA, 50- to 64-year-olds making $25,000 annually would be eligible for tax credits that are on average 50 to 80 percent less than what they would receive under current law. ""Generally, people who are older, lower-income, or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA,"" said a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. ""Additionally, older people would have higher starting premiums under the AHCA and would therefore pay higher premiums."" Sinema said she voted to stop a new ""age tax,"" under which ""Arizonans age 50 & over could be charged 5 times more for their health care."" Sinema voted against the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, which would have allowed companies to charge individuals 50 and over up to five times more than what they charged younger adults. Sinema’s ad glosses over a few important points. The bill’s provision only applied to people who bought insurance through the individual and small-group markets. It wouldn’t have applied to people on Medicare (and are 65 and older) or with coverage through larger employers. The current health care law allows insurers to charge this age group three times as much for insurance as younger adults. Although Sinema's tweet references a ""new"" age tax, it may be unclear to some that the charges wouldn’t be fives time more than the current situation. Sinema’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/19/kyrsten-sinema/fact-checking-kyrsten-sinemas-claim-about-age-tax-/

Phil Bredesen says Marsha Blackburn weakened DEA opioid enforcement
","Tennessee has struggled with the opioid crisis more than many states. In 2015, prescription drug deaths were twice the national rate, according to federal and state summaries. And around that time, Congress moved to trim the power of the Drug Enforcement Administration to sanction negligent drug distributors. Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen said if he wins, his first act as senator would be to attempt to reverse a 2014 bill  championed by his opponent, Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn. ""Blackburn, at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry, co-sponsored a law that weakened DEA enforcement efforts against drug distribution companies that were supplying corrupt doctors and pharmacists who peddled narcotics to the black market,"" Bredesen’s Aug. 24 campaign announcement said. The law was at the center of a Washington Post/60 Minutes October 2017 exposé. Within days, that investigation scuttled the nomination of Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., to serve as national drug czar. Marino introduced the first version of the bill in 2014. Blackburn was an original cosponsor. In this fact-check, we examine Blackburn’s position on DEA enforcement and to what extent she did what the drug distribution companies wanted. Blackburn played a lead role on a bill that made it harder for the DEA to hold the threat of shutdowns over drug distributors. The drug distribution industry spent over $1 million lobbying for the change, and its campaign donations to Blackburn went up after the bill became law. The precise impact of the law remains unclear, but the Justice Department recommends reversal, and Blackburn has signed on to a bill that would do that. The DEA enforces the Controlled Substances Act, which includes monitoring sales of prescription painkillers such as oxycodone, fentanyl and codeine. Around 2009, the agency began focusing on distributors who were shipping millions of doses into relatively small communities. The DEA holds two legal hammers over bad actors. One, called a show cause order, requires the company to prove why it shouldn’t have its permit to sell drugs taken away. The bigger hammer is an immediate suspension order, which stops all shipments on the spot. The company can argue its case under both actions, but with the first one, operations continue during the hearing process, while with the second, operations shut down right away. Jim Geldhof retired from the DEA in 2016 after nearly four decades. He told us that formal sanctions were a last resort. ""I can’t think of one time that we didn't try to get a company into compliance before we issued any kind of order,"" Geldhof said. But Blackburn saw the DEA as trigger happy. In a 2011 House hearing on prescription drug diversion, Blackburn said certain things had to be kept in mind. ""First, to what extent should duly-licensed prescription drug manufacturers be required to spend time, money and resources on trying to envision every new way that their products might be abused,"" Blackburn asked. By 2012, her focus was more on DEA oversight of distributors and pharmacies. ""Should we be thinking of a more surgical approach to addressing the issue of prescription drug abuse rather than just looking at suspension of licenses?"" she asked a DEA official at a House hearing. ""Is there a more proportional approach to take rather than just going to an immediate suspension?"" Blackburn was unswayed by testimony that DEA regularly met with companies before taking formal action. In 2014, Blackburn firmly linked herself to legislation that added new requirements before the DEA could move against a distributor.  She put her name to two versions of the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act as they were  introduced, and at one point, Blackburn took the lead during debate on the House floor. In an April 2014 hearing, Blackburn said she was concerned that patients would not get the pain medications they counted on. She said suppliers needed more guidance from Washington on how to collaborate with law enforcement. ""Stated simply, their obligation to prevent diversion is only achievable if the DEA and other regulators will work with them to get it done,"" Blackburn said. Both bills made two changes. They raised the DEA’s burden of proof before it could issue a immediate suspension order. For show cause actions, drug distributors gained the option to offer a plan to fix any problems. That effectively put the enforcement on hold while the plan played out. The Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2014 passed the House. In response, then-Attorney General Eric Holder cautioned Congress. ""A recently passed House bill would severely undermine a critical component of our efforts to prevent communities and families from falling prey to dangerous drugs,"" a department press release said July 31, 2014. The bill stalled in the Senate. Two years later, a slightly modified version passed in both chambers and became law in April 2016. The major drug distribution companies lobbied for bills Blackburn supported. Between 2014 and 2016, two distribution companies and the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, a trade group, spent just shy of $1.3 million on lobbyists to work specifically on getting Blackburn’s ideas into law. ""This legislation will go a long way in encouraging meaningful dialogue and collaboration between supply chain stakeholders and federal regulators,"" the Healthcare Distribution Alliance wrote in 2014. The drug distribution industry’s campaign donations to Blackburn rose over this period. In 2012, they gave her $6,000. A few years later, the total more than tripled to $22,000. (This is a conservative figure, based only on distribution firms, and omits other groups interested in these bills, such as the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.) We asked Blackburn’s office what input she received from the distribution industry as she formed her approach. Her staff declined to answer, but in October 2017, Blackburn said questions about whether donations fueled her interest in the law were ""absolutely absurd."" Many observers have noted that the final version of the law passed with barely a ripple of dissent. The Washington Post described backroom negotiations, but when it came to a vote in 2016, it sailed through under unanimous consent. After the Post investigation, the Justice Department sent a letter to the House recommending that the law be rolled back. In October 2017, less than a week after the Washington Post article appeared, a group of seven House Democrats and one Republican introduced a bill to repeal the amendments made in 2016. Blackburn did not join that effort, saying she was waiting for a report from the DEA on the law’s impact. In mid March 2018, another two House Democrats introduced their own measure to roll back the changes. Both of them, Peter Welch, D-Vt., and Judy Chu, D-Calif., had been original cosponsors of the 2014 legislation. Blackburn submitted a bill at the same time, but while it increased penalties for drug diversion, it left the enforcement changes untouched. After Bredesen raised the issue in late August, Blackburn and fellow Republican Rep. Gus Bilrakis, R-Fla., submitted a bill to undo the changes Blackburn had championed. She was still waiting for the report from the DEA. ""This solution takes another step to combat the opioid epidemic by giving law enforcement the tools they need to go after bad actors,"" said Blackburn chief of staff Charles Flint. At the end of the day, the legal and lawmaker consensus is that the measures first proposed in 2014 had weakened the DEA. Bredesen said that ""at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry,"" Blackburn was a leading force behind a law that weakened the ability of the DEA to go after drug distributors that facilitated the flow of opioids into the black market. The record shows that Blackburn was critical of the DEA and was an early leader in reining in DEA powers. It is also a matter of record that the industry spent nearly $1.3 million lobbying for those changes and increased its donations to Blackburn as the legislative process played out. The only uncertainty concerns what prompted Blackburn’s actions, and the meaning of ""behest"" has some wiggle room. It can be both a command and a strong suggestion. Blackburn’s office declined to answer our question about her contacts with the industry. Nearly a year after the controversial legislation came to light, Blackburn switched her position. Because additional information is needed, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/18/phil-bredesen/bredesen-blackburn-weakened-dea-opioid-enforcement/

What percentage of Americans own stocks?
","The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 32 percent since President Donald Trump took office. But are Americans overall benefiting? U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna. D-Calif., suggested that they are not in a Facebook post spotted by a PolitiFact reader. Khanna’s post featured the headline, ""Most Americans don’t own stocks."" He repeated that point in his message, which accompanied a bar graph: ""FACT: Most Americans don’t own any stocks. Instead of celebrating whenever the Dow Jones goes up, we need to focus on bringing investment and good jobs to the areas of this country that haven’t been part of the economic recovery.""  The accompanying graph details the ""distribution of stock ownership by wealth percentile,"" specifically 84 percent for the ""top 10 percent,"" 9.3 percent for the ""next 10 percent"" and 6.7 percent for the ""bottom 80 percent."" The data in the graph stems from a peer-reviewed academic paper. However, when we took a closer look, we found the data in the graph doesn’t directly support the claim that ""most Americans don’t own stocks."" In fact, the actual data on that question shows that a small majority of Americans do have a stake in the stock market. The data in the graph comes from a paper published in November 2017 by New York University professor Edward N. Wolff. One of the paper’s findings was that ""despite the fact that almost half of all households owned stock shares either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, trusts, or various pension accounts, the richest 10 percent of households controlled 84 percent of the total value of these stocks in 2016."" This line by Wolff presents a key contrast that Khanna’s post glosses over: While about half of households own stocks in one way or another, the richest Americans hold the lion’s share of the value. Khanna uses a bar graph that highlights the imbalance in the value of stock holdings, but his headline claim is about the reach of stock ownership throughout the population. Those are two different things. When we contacted Wolff, he agreed that Khanna’s headline was ""wrong."" So what does the data show on the reach of stock ownership? It’s a bit wider than Khanna suggests. Even if you don’t own or trade individual stocks, there’s a decent chance you have a 401(k) account or an Individual Retirement Account or belong to a pension fund that is invested in stocks. ""Many individuals have an indirect interest in the stock market by means of their claims on pension funds that own stocks and use these stock positions to fund pension payments,"" said Hendrik Bessembinder, a professor at Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business. A once-every-three-years study by the Federal Reserve Board found that in 2016, 51.9 percent of families owned stocks, either directly or as part of a fund. And in 2017, Gallup found that 54 percent of respondents owned stocks either directly or as part of a fund. Those findings show a majority owning stocks — a modest majority, but still a majority. In an email interview, Khanna told PolitiFact that he still feels the ""essence of the post"" is accurate but added that ""a better headline would have been, ""Most Americans Don’t Have a Real Stake in the Stock Market."" Khanna has a point that a household’s affluence does help determine how vested they are in the stock market. The Federal Reserve Board study found that about one-third of families in the lower half of the income scale had stock holdings. In the next 40 percent of the income scale, about 70 percent of households held stocks, while households in the top 10 percent of the income scale had stock ownership rates above 90 percent. Here's a chart from the Fed's report, showing how stock ownership rates vary depending on income level.   Gallup, meanwhile, found that certain subgroups were notably less likely to own stocks, including those without a college education, younger Americans, unmarried Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanics. Khanna wrote that ""most Americans don’t own stocks."" To be precise, a narrow majority of Americans does own stocks, according to credible recent studies. But Khanna has a point that Americans of modest incomes are significantly less invested in the stock market than wealthier Americans are. Other large groups, including minorities and those without a college education, also lag in stock ownership, meaning that the stock rally is largely passing them by.

At one point, he has his cameraman film a wooden pole that is still wet from when water levels were about a foot-and-a-half higher. ""You can see the water is definitely going down,"" he said in the 2008 liveshot. Cooper also said in the original liveshot that he’s standing next to a road that is on higher ground than most of the area and is being used for evacuations. He points out that there is a drop-off from the road to the surrounding area. In his fact-checking segment, Cooper said his camera crew was standing near the road to keep the camera equipment dry. He also said he was not standing on the road because he did not want to hinder the evacuation efforts. Doug Thomas, a long-time CNN audio technician, was the cameraman seen in the viral photo. He died in September 2017. This photo comes from 2008 coverage of Hurricane Ike. Cooper repeatedly shows the range of water depth in the liveshot and is not on his knees or in a ditch. Because the photo is from 2008, the liveshot was not taken to ""make @realDonaldTrump look bad.""

Fact-checking Andrew Gillum on the cost of Medicare for All
","Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has attracted national attention for his support for ""Medicare for All,"" an idea to expand the government-run Medicare health insurance program to cover everyone, rather than just Americans 65 and over. Under the plan Gillum supports, individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone’s medical bills. It's based on a bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. On CNN’s State of the Union, host Dana Bash asked Gillum about a George Mason University study that found Medicare for All could cost the government $33 trillion over 10 years. Bash asked whether Gillum be willing to tell Floridians they need to pay more in taxes to offset the costs. ""Well, let me first say there was also a report, Dana, that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time,"" Gillum said during the Sept. 2, 2018 interview. We confirmed with Gillum’s campaign that he and Bash were actually referring to the same report — one published by the free-market-oriented Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Both sides in the Medicare for All debate have seized upon aspects of the report to bolster their arguments. Critics, including the author of the report, emphasized that the policy would bring a substantial fiscal burden. But supporters found fiscal hope. When Sanders previously said that the study indicated that enacting Medicare for All ""would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period,"" we rated that claim Half True. We thought that the issue was worth a fresh look with Gillum's defense, especially given some slight differences in his phrasing. Medicare for All supporters say the proposal would not only increase health-insurance coverage to 100 percent but that the government could actually save money. The savings, they say, would come from eliminating the profits currently generated by health insurers, from taking advantage of economies of scale, and from being able to leverage lower prices on everything from prescription drugs to physician reimbursement fees. Critics are skeptical that such savings would materialize, leaving taxpayers on the hook if they don't. They also worry about other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees. To settle this debate, Medicare for All supporters flip to the page in the Mercatus report summarizing the financial effects of Sanders’ bill. The researchers looked at two main scenarios after implementation of the proposal. One compared Mercatus’ projection for the Sanders Medicare for All bill with what would be expected under a continuation of the current system (according to a Department of Health and Human Services’ projection). With Medicare for All, the total amount of health care expenditures nationally would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years compared to the current system. So Gillum can point to some evidence in the study that predicts savings. However, the Mercatus report’s author, Charles Blahous, criticized that takeaway. In an August interview with PolitiFact, Blahous said that estimate is based on a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders’ plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payments will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent. Blahous was more confident about an alternative scenario published in the report, in which cost-control works less effectively. Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law. In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem. In other words, there are a range of possible outcomes if Medicare for All is enacted, some supportive of Gillum’s perspective and some not. Independent health policy experts express caution before assuming large savings. Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model that Gillum likes are ""not likely feasible,"" John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute, told us in August. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it’s a ""pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically."" Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst with the RAND Corp., said that uncertainty makes it hard to predict the cost impact of Medicare for All, including whether administrative costs and reimbursements would decline or whether demand for health care services could be kept in check. In a recent report co-authored by Eibner that considered the impact of a single-payer model for New York state, RAND found that ""the estimated effects are highly dependent on the assumptions about provider payment rates, administrative costs, and drug prices."" Gillum said there is a report ""that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time."" Trillions in savings would be one of a range of possibilities for how Medicare for All enactment could play out. But it’s not the only one, and independent analysts say it’s far from a sure thing that Medicare for All would save as much money as Gillum hopes it will. The statement is partially accurate.

Donald Trump wrong about Puerto Rico death toll from Hurricane Maria
","As Hurricane Florence battered the Carolinas, President Donald Trump stirred a tweetstorm of his own creation by continuing to deride an estimated death toll from two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico last year. He said the count of Puerto Ricans killed by Hurricane Maria jumped from 16 during his October visit to 64 deaths a few months later, and ""then, like magic, ‘3000 PEOPLE KILLED.'"" “When Trump visited the island territory last October, OFFICIALS told him in a briefing 16 PEOPLE had died from Maria.” The Washington Post. This was long AFTER the hurricane took place. Over many months it went to 64 PEOPLE. Then, like magic, “3000 PEOPLE KILLED.” They hired.... He said in a second tweet that a method by George Washington University researchers to come up with a death count ""was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed. FIFTY TIMES LAST ORIGINAL NUMBER - NO WAY!"" ....GWU Research to tell them how many people had died in Puerto Rico (how would they not know this?). This method was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed. FIFTY TIMES LAST ORIGINAL NUMBER - NO WAY! Trump’s defiance echoed his initial tweets Sept. 13 in which he said 3,000 people ""did not die"" from the storms and that such a number was boosted by counting deaths from ""old age."" Turning conspiratorial, he said it was ""done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible."" 3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000... .....This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico! Trump ignores basic facts about reality for Puerto Ricans after Hurricanes Irma and Maria after September 2017. Trump also miscasts the estimate as a Democratic effort when it was created by experts on disaster response. There was no ""magic"" to the increase in the death toll estimates. It is based in science. ""Early after a disaster, death tolls tend to be preliminary,"" said Roberto Rivera, College of Business University of Puerto Rico. ""In the case of Hurricane Maria, indirect deaths are the reason the toll was so high, as suggested by some reports. That's the context that Trump is missing."" The government in Puerto Rico initially reported 16 deaths in September 2017, and raised it to 34 in October and then 64 in December. But for months, researchers had said that the government’s official count was an undercount. Part of a death toll is a count of direct deaths from a storm, such as being struck by a falling tree or drowning in a flood. The more complicated count comes from indirect deaths caused by unsafe or unhealthy conditions, such as someone who relies on a respirator but loses electricity. Usually, the death toll of an event such as Hurricane Maria is determined through an exam by a medical examiner. But Puerto Rico officials did not have the proper resources to effectively conduct forensic examinations. Without complete medical records, researchers were left with other ways to try to come up with an estimate. Multiple studies used different methodologies and time periods, and therefore arrived at different results about ""excess deaths"" — comparing the number of deaths with historical trends during the time period in previous years. Excess death measurement has been a standard in the measurement of deaths attributable to environmental and climate events since the early 1960s, said Alexis Santos-Lozada, an assistant teaching professor at Pennsylvania State University. However, in some ways the case in Puerto Rico is unique. Before Hurricane Maria, governors and stakeholders were usually the first ones to raise alarm about the number of deaths — as the mayor of New Orleans did after Hurricane Katrina. ""This was not the case of Puerto Rico, in Puerto Rico we turned to estimates because both the governor and the president minimized the number,"" Santos-Lozada said. Trump was referring to an estimate published in late August by George Washington University’s Milken Institute. That estimate was higher than some earlier estimates by academics and the New York Times that were around 1,000, but lower than the 4,645 midpoint of a Harvard study. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló contacted George Washington University in December, which led to commissioning the university to do a study. The Milken Institute published the first phase Aug. 28 and found a midpoint of 2,975 excess deaths in the six months following the hurricane. That number was 22 percent higher than the number of deaths that would have been expected during that period in a year without the storm. Researchers found that lack of communication and training for doctors about how to certify deaths resulted in an undercount. Trump misrepresents what the Milken Institute study actually concluded about deaths. The study did not include anyone who died for ""any reason, like old age,"" as he said. If that were the case, the number of deaths would have been much higher. The study found that there were 16,608 total deaths during the six months — and approximately 77 percent were at least 65 years old. The study didn’t attribute individual deaths to Maria; it tried to determine a number of ""excess"" deaths. In other words, it tried to find how many deaths would have been expected were it not for the but rather came up with a counterfactual: how many deaths would you expect to see each month if the hurricane hadn’t happened and then subtract the actual number to arrive at an ""excess"" number of deaths. Dr. John ""Jack"" Sandberg, an associate professor in the department of global health, told PolitiFact that the contract stipulated that the study would be done with no government interference by officials in Puerto Rico — and none occurred. ""I did the number crunching on this, no one ever said boo to me about anything,"" he said. ""We are quite shocked that this is having political repercussions."" Lynn Goldman, the dean of the Milken Institute, responded to Trump's tweets in a Washington Post op-ed. ""To set the record straight, our study was carried out with no interference whatsoever from any political party or institution,"" she wrote of the study done in collaboration with scientists at the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health. ""We do not know the exact circumstances around each of the 2,975 excess deaths that occurred. Many factors — disruption in transportation, access to food, water, medications, power and other essentials — may have contributed."" The government in Puerto Rico accepted the Milken institute study and raised Maria's official death toll from 64 to 2,975. The study's next phase is expected to more closely examine the identified deaths to look at causes through interviews with family members and medical personnel. Trump tweeted that 3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico and that the death toll estimate was ""done by Democrats."" Trump tried to cast doubt on an estimate by George Washington University that includes indirect deaths. Studies by other academics or researchers have also concluded that the number of deaths was above 1,000. The death toll provided by the government in Puerto Rico did rise after the storm from 16 to 64 in the months following the storm. The government then hired George Washington University to research an estimate and several months later it produced a report estimate 2,975 deaths. None of that is evidence of an estimate created by a Democratic conspiracy to make Trump look bad.

Did Dino Rossi take away health care coverage from 45,000 children?
","Did Dino Rossi, a Republican Washington state senator running for U.S. Congress, once take away coverage from 45,000 children? That’s what an attack ad by the House Majority PAC claimed. ""He’s back. Dino Rossi,"" the voiceover in the ad says. ""Rossi first showed up in Olympia decades ago. He went to work! Health care stripped from 45,000 children."" They’re referencing a 2003 budget measure, back when Rossi was the state Senate Ways and Means chairman. The budget was looking bleak, so Republicans proposed large spending cuts that year. One, proposed by Rossi, was a $50 million cut in Medicaid spending. The cut would have eliminated coverage for nearly 40,000 low-income children, according to reporting at the time. But the cut didn’t fly with Democrats, and ended up being scrapped in the final budget. The final budget, which won bipartisan support, wasn't a specific cut, but it did include rules changes. Those changes ultimately resulted in the loss of coverage for 45,000 kids on Medicaid. While it didn’t change any of the eligibility requirements, the budget changed state Medicaid policy in a way that lead to an enrollment decline later reported by state health care agencies. We were unable to trace this measure back to Rossi himself, but he did vote in its favor. First, it ended continuous eligibility, which meant if a family’s income was over the income standard, the child’s medical coverage would end. Second, certification periods went from every 12 to every six months. A signature became necessary for renewal, ending telephone renewals. Third, it adopted new income verification requirements; while it previously accepted a family’s statements, it now verified the information provided through available databases. ""These changes were requested by the legislature and they did have the impact of reducing the children’s caseload by at least 45,000,"" said Amy Blondin, chief communications officer for the Washington State Health Care Authority. Andrew Bell, spokesman for Dino Rossi, said the changes Rossi pushed forward in the budget ensured resources were given to the neediest families. ""So it seems like the HCA is saying that that was a combination of families who were making enough money to afford healthcare themselves moved off of Medicaid coverage, and a reduction in wealthy families who were cheating the system and taking health care from poorer families,"" Bell said. ""Either way, this seems to leave more resources available for truly needy families (which is the standard we've always used)."" That’s one way to interpret the drop. Using data from the Medical Assistance Administration, the University of Washington Health Policy Analysis Program found most children leaving Medicaid weren’t ineligible in an April 2004 study. ""In fact, only about 20 to 30 percent of the children removed are ineligible for Medicaid,"" the report read. ""Most are eligible but are inhibited from getting coverage because of the administrative barriers and hurdles described above."" When the first two rules changed back (and income verification stay put) in 2005, the numbers mostly returned to normal.  Source: The Commonwealth Fund, June 2006 ""I don’t think that ‘wealthy’ families were taking advantage of the program given the bounce back in enrollment,"" said Tricia Brooks, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. The ad said Rossi stripped health care from 45,000 children. Rossi wasn’t solely responsible for the move, but he did support it. The 2003 Washington state Senate budget measure he voted for increased administrative hurdles for children seeking Medicaid coverage. Most of the eligible children regained coverage when the rules changed back in 2005.

AG candidate Raoul makes false claim about opponent’s stance on gay adoption
","In his bid to become Illinois attorney general, Democratic state Sen. Kwame Raoul has sought to cast Republican opponent Erika Harold as too extreme. To that end, he’s run three ads centered on the stance Harold allegedly took against gay adoption in 2000 as a 19-year-old Miss Illinois contestant during a closed-door interview session. ""You still won’t believe what Erika Harold believes,"" a narrator says in his latest one. ""We know she'd discriminate against a loving gay couple who want to adopt a child, favoring an abusive straight couple instead."" ""She also supports a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and would even allow employers to fire workers just for being gay,"" the narrator goes on to say. While those claims also warrant examination, we decided to focus this fact-check on the ad’s first contention because it has become the central focus of Raoul’s argument that Harold’s views are extreme. What’s more, Harold publicly declared months ago that she supports gay adoption and foster parenting, undercutting Raoul’s claim that ""we know"" Harold ""believes"" (present-tense) in discriminating against gay couples looking to offer children a home. The allegations on which his claim is based come from a March report by NBC 5 that quoted unnamed pageant officials who recounted the interview session: One of the questions to Harold that year was: If she, like her mother, was responsible to place a child in foster care and had to choose between a.) A loving gay couple or b.) A heterosexual couple who were known child abusers, which would she chose? All three sources told NBC 5 she chose the child abusers. After repeated requests for comment, NBC 5 reported, Harold’s campaign responded with a statement saying she did not recall the exchange but ""certainly support[s] same-sex adoption and foster care placement."" That’s the same position Harold herself took in multiple media appearances following the story’s release. ""I don't remember the specific exchange that was alleged by the anonymous sources,"" Harold said in an interview with ABC 7 the week after the story ran. ""What I do remember is that at the time I would not have supported same-sex adoption, but what I want to make very clear is my position today, which is I strongly support same-sex adoption and same-sex foster parenting."" We asked Raoul’s spokeswoman Aviva Bowen to explain how they know for a fact Harold believes otherwise, but Bowen did not provide any evidence that answered our question. Instead, Bowen wrote in an email that Harold’s ""‘evolution’ is not credible."" ""Her statement: 1. comes only after pressed several times by media when the story was becoming public and 2. conveniently contradicts all of her other anti-LGBT views,"" Bowen added, pointing to Harold’s responses in a candidate survey from the socially conservative Illinois Family Institute, which she filled when running unsuccessfully for the U.S. House in 2014. The questionnaire Bowen referred to asked Harold and other candidates for office about federal legislation important to social conservatives, including gay marriage. Harold’s answers indicated she supported defining marriage as between a man and woman. For the record, a spokesman for Harold said she no longer supports a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in light of the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling legalizing it. The campaign also says Harold backs the Illinois Human Rights Act, which prohibits employers other than religious institutions from discriminating against an individual for their sexual orientation or identity. ""It’s entirely reasonable and common for elected officials to evolve and change their positions on these issues,"" Harold spokesman Aaron DeGroot wrote in an email, pointing to language used by former President Barack Obama when he embraced gay marriage after previously opposing it. Raoul’s ad says, ""we know"" Erika Harold would ""discriminate against a loving gay couple who want to adopt a child, favoring an abusive straight couple instead."" That attack refers to something Harold allegedly said nearly two decades ago as a 19-year-old Miss Illinois contestant, according to an NBC 5 report. But the sources who said she took that stance remain unnamed and no one has yet come forward publicly or produced further evidence the comments were made. What’s more, since the NBC story ran in March, Harold has stated repeatedly that although she doesn't recall the long ago exchange, she now ""strongly"" supports same-sex adoption and fostering.

Bill Foster says Rick Kriseman passed zero bills in Legislature, was 'ineffective'
","Here’s how St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster wants voters to think of mayoral rival Rick Kriseman: As Foster got down to business at City Hall, Kriseman was lobbing partisan bombs in Tallahassee and getting nothing done. Foster used the Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 mayoral forum on Aug. 6 to go after Kriseman’s stint as a Democrat in the Florida House. ""For the years that I was mayor of the city of St. Petersburg, you were up there, and there was no legislation that passed the House that had your name on it,"" Foster said. ""You were ineffective, and it was a waste of time."" We thought Foster’s claim merited more scrutiny. (In a separate fact-check we’ll consider Kriseman’s response.) Kriseman, a former St. Petersburg City Council member, was first elected to the state House in 2006. He served through the 2012 legislative session, meaning he was in Tallahassee for three of Foster’s four years as mayor -- 2010, 2011 and 2012. In each year, House rules limited Kriseman to filing, or sponsoring, six substantive bills. A search of House records shows that Foster is correct -- no bills Kriseman sponsored ultimately became law, let alone passed the House. Kriseman proposed laws banning oil drilling in Florida waters, increasing term limits for Florida House and Senate members, creating a recall provision for the governor and Cabinet offices and limiting deductions and other benefits for businesses that pay the state’s corporate income tax. Many of the bills Kriseman sponsored were never even considered in a House committee, meaning lawmakers never debated them. So yes, Kriseman was 0-for-18. But is it a sign that Kriseman was ineffective as a lawmaker? There’s no proof of that. In the Florida Legislature, Democrats are in the minority, so they have a harder time getting legislation passed. As a Democrat, Kriseman sat on one of the lowest rungs in the 120-person House. The system rewards senior Republicans, then Republicans, and then with whatever little time’s left over, maybe a Democrat or two. It doesn’t mean Democrats are unable to get bills passed -- Kriseman himself had success in 2007, for instance -- but the prospects are slim. Why? Members of the minority party in the House do not routinely chair committees, so they cannot guide legislation toward the House floor. And they do not run the House chamber, so they cannot bring up legislation for a full vote. Republicans have been the majority party in the Florida House since 1996. In 2011 and 2012, the GOP held a two-thirds majority in the House, an important threshold that allowed Republicans to completely control the legislative process. Even innocuous bills written by Democrats got hung up in the process. In an interview, Foster pointed out Kriseman’s failure to get a ""no-brainer"" local measure passed that would have merged the duties of the Pinellas Planning Council with the county’s Metropolitan Planning Organization. It did not budge through even one committee under Kriseman’s sponsorship, but it became law the next year when two Pinellas Republicans put their names on it. To Foster, it’s proof of Kriseman’s ineffectiveness. To Kriseman, it’s proof of one committee chairman’s influence. ""That year, very few local bills passed. (Rep.) Ritch Workman was killing everyone’s local bills,"" Kriseman said. ""The chances of the minority member’s bill passing is slim to none,"" said Mike Fasano, a Republican who served both in the House and Senate and was recently appointed Pasco County tax collector. The mechanics are different in the state Senate where a smaller number of lawmakers, 40, allows for more collaboration, he said. One more point: getting a bill signed by the governor is difficult for most everyone in the House, Republican or Democrat. In 2011, lawmakers filed 1,850 general bills. Only 245 passed both the House and Senate, and a handful of them were vetoed by Gov. Rick Scott. Kriseman described the dynamics in the House during an interview with the Times/Herald in 2011. ""If you go into the session with the understanding that your bills are dead,"" he said, ""you will be free to speak your mind and vote how you feel like you need to vote because they can't do anything to you."" Part of his job was working ""to make bad bills better,"" Kriseman said, pointing to a 2009 telecommunications bill sponsored by Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. Kriseman voted against it throughout the session but voted for it on the floor after substantial changes were made, which he said he worked out with Weatherford.  Weatherford, by the way, passed no bills in the two years before he became House speaker. Our ruling Foster claimed that Kriseman failed to get legislation passed in the House from 2010-2012 and that Kriseman was ineffective as a result. We’re not passing judgment on whether Kriseman was good or bad at his job. But we were unable to find a direct correlation between Kriseman’s inability to get a bill passed during Foster’s timeframe and his effectiveness as a lawmaker.

Al Sharpton defends Obama family vacation, saying George W. Bush spent more time away
","As President Barack Obama begins a vacation on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, social media and blogs are buzzing with details of Obama’s vacations, past and present. Mark Knoller, the CBS News White House correspondent who is considered the authority on tracking the president’s daily activities, recently tweeted that ""no presidential numbers I report stir as much reaction and resentment as vacations -- except one: golf."" Obama’s vacation plans have attracted heat from some of his critics, who say the cost of moving the president, his family and his Secret Service protection are an extravagance that taxpayers still stung by the weak economic recovery shouldn’t have to pay for. Obama and his family are reportedly staying at a $7.6 million vacation home of Democratic donor David Schulte. The president’s supporters counter that the unique security concerns for the president mean that he and his family can’t simply head out on the road and plop down at a Motel 6. They add that all presidents have to be accessible for consultation and decisionmaking even if they’re on vacation, and that every occupant of the White House, from both parties, has followed essentially the same procedures for vacations. As the Obamas took off for Martha’s Vineyard, one of their defenders was the Rev. Al Sharpton, who hosts a show on MSNBC. On the Aug. 9. 2013, edition of PoliticsNation, Sharpton said, ""We all love summer traditions, fireworks, barbecues, the beach. And we’re seeing the return of a right-wing favorite -- attacking the president’s vacation."" Sharpton cut to a clip of Fox News’ Sean Hannity saying that Obama ""is living a pretty extravagant lifestyle, isn’t he? Martha's Vineyard, big expensive vacations, Hawaii, while 50 million Americans, Dana, are on food stamps."" In reality, Sharpton told viewers, Obama ""has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in. How many did President (George W.) Bush take by the same point in his presidency? Three hundred and sixty seven. Yes, more than a full year of vacation."" We wondered whether Sharpton was right that Obama’s predecessor took many more vacation days than he has. When we asked MSNBC for the source of Sharpton’s data, a spokeswoman pointed to a story in USA Today. The article says, ""At the same point in Bush's presidency, the 43rd president had spent 367 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and his parent's compound at Kennebunkport, Maine, according to a count by CBS News reporter Mark Knoller. Obama, who doesn't own a vacation home, has spent a total of 92 days of his presidency on vacation, according to Knoller."" Tweets by Knoller himself back that up. On the eve of Obama’s departure for Martha’s Vineyard, Knoller tweeted that ""since taking office, Pres Obama has taken 14 vacation trips spanning all or part of 92 days."" Knoller also tweeted that ""at the same point in office, Pres. GWBush had made 50 visits to this Texas Ranch totaling all or part of 323 days."" Another 26 of Bush’s vacation days are accounted for by trips to Kennebunkport, with 18 days on vacation at miscellaneous locations, according to Knoller’s data. Trips to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland are not included in either president’s figures. It’s worth noting that there was a difference in the two presidents’ patterns of vacations. As the USA Today article noted, Obama doesn’t own a vacation home, unlike Bush, who owned his ranch. So while Bush essentially used the ranch as as a working White House, Obama has traveled to a variety of destinations, including his native Hawaii. Because of this, the government may have been able to accrue some per-trip cost savings for Bush by going repeatedly to one location. But since the White House is traditionally tight-lipped about costs and security details for presidential travel, it’s impossible to know how the total cost of Bush’s travel compares to Obama’s. Our ruling Sharpton said that Obama ""has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in,"" compared to 367 for President George W. Bush at the same point in his presidency. While this discrepancy is explained by the fact that Bush often worked from a family home in Texas whereas Obama has no equivalent family retreat, Sharpton has correctly cited data from the leading authority, CBS News’ Mark Knoller. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.

United Nations document shared on social media says civilian gun confiscation is in the works for United States
","A reader recently sent us a realistic-looking document from the United Nations with a pretty explosive claim -- that the world body is moving forward with plans to help member nations disarm their civilian populations of ""military grade,"" ""concealable"" and ""hunting grade"" firearms, and even ""ammunition and components to manufacture ammunition."" Americans who support the right to bear arms have long expressed worry that the U.S. government is on the verge of taking away lawful citizens’ guns, and that concern has only increased when a U.N. body is believed to play a supporting role. The document sent to us by the reader would seem to be (pardon the expression) a smoking gun. Superficially, the document has the trappings of officialdom -- a blue U.N. logo at the top, along with the name of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, a real office. It’s dated Aug. 5, 2013, and labeled ""restricted."" The headline reads, ""Disarmament Commission -- Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group."" And it’s filled with believable bureaucratic jargon, such as creation of a ""codification framework"" and the need to undergo a ""full review by the Office of the Secretary General."" Here’s the full text: ""The issue of military grade weaponry in the hands of civilians looms ever larger in the face of the global implementation of 22/Agenda 21 by member nations. In particular, the United States of America has an estimated 500 million weapons in the hands of its civilian population. This is not just a static problem, it is a massive dynamic problem for the process of confiscation as there will be those who refuse to surrender their firearms. ""The conclusion of discussions by the CWCSG led to the adoption of a proposed agenda to begin the process for introducing to member nations a framework by which they can begin codification of national laws to disarm civilians within their borders through a graduated process. ""Within the discussion framework, we have identified several problem areas that must be addressed, they are: ""1. Classification of military grade weapons to be made illegal for possession. ""2. Creation of programs to provide reasonable compensation for voluntary surrender of said arms. ""3. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of concealable firearms. ""4. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of hunting grade firearms. ""5. Codification of laws to restrict the sale of, and possession of ammunition and components to manufacture ammunition. ""6. Finally, codification of laws to completely makes (sic) any and all firearms illegal to own, possess or use outside of military and law enforcement usage. ""7. Creation of a United Nations Police Taskforce with the specific mission of assisting member nations with the collection of weaponry from civilian hands. ""The CWCSG will submit its findings and final recommendations once we have created the codification framework for member nations for a full review by the Office of the Secretary General."" The document is persuasive enough to have been picked up by pro-gun advocates on a few message boards and Facebook pages. But is it real? When we checked with the United Nations, a spokesman declared it a fake. ""I checked the document number on our internal document system, and the reply I got back now was simply, ‘There is no document matching your request,’ said Farhan Haq, associate spokesperson for the Secretary-General. ""The document number (A/CN.11/L.72) doesn't conform to our standard system, in any case."" In addition, Haq said, ""there is no such body as a ‘Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group.’ Nor does the United Nations involve itself in confiscating weapons from member states."" Finally, Haq said, ""the use of blue ink, some of the type font and the scanner icon in the bottom right-hand corner are not found in real U.N. documents. So, in several different ways, this document is fake."" Our ruling A document found on the Internet and circulating via email and social media says that a United Nations working group has ""adopted a proposed agenda"" to enable member nations to ""disarm civilians within their borders."" If the document were real, it would confirm the worst fears of those who fear a mass confiscation of handguns, hunting rifles and ammunition in the U.S. -- but a United Nations spokesman cited several reasons for concluding that the document is a fake, including the fact that the study group referenced in the document does not exist.

Cuccinelli embellishes savings from stopping union contracts for subway project
","GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says Democrat Terry McAuliffe will drive up transportation costs by steering road and rail construction contracts to labor unions. For proof, Cuccinelli has been describing Virginia’s experience this year soliciting bids for a construction phase of the Metrorail’s new Silver Line that will provide subway service from Washington to Dulles Airport in Loudoun County.   ""I keep trying to come back to transportation and spending for transportation and when you’ve got the kind of union ties (McAuliffe) does, that’s a concern,"" Cuccinelli said during a July 29 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show. ""I mean, the one specific example is in Northern Virginia where the governor forced the rebidding of half of one transportation project -- the Metro extension -- because they had done that with Project Labor Agreements. These are guaranteed labor contracts and the governor said, `If you want to get state money (for the project), you’ve got to rebid those contracts. So they did and the price came down $300 million. ""Gov. McAuliffe won’t force the rebidding of guaranteed union contracts and Gov. Cuccinelli will,"" he said. Cuccinelli made the same claim during a July 20 debate with McAuliffe. So we decided to examine his contention that $300 million was saved by rebidding the contract without the union-friendly provision. Let’s start with some background. Construction of the 23-mile Silver Line began in early 2009. Phase 1, a $2.7 billion extension of Northern Virginia subway lines from Falls Church to past Tysons Corner, is expected to be completed this year. Work on Phase 2, an 11-mile expansion to Dulles Airport and slightly beyond, is scheduled to start next year and be finished in 2018. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is managing the project and last year estimated the second phase would also cost $2.7 billion. In April 2010, the MWAA Board of Directors ordered a Project Labor Agreement that would allow construction unions to determine the wages, benefits and employment conditions for all Phase 2 laborers -- whether they belonged to a union or not. The action was denounced by the state chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors and many Republican politicians, including Cuccinelli and Gov. Bob McDonnell, who said the agreement would elevate costs to depress bidding competition for Phase 2. Critics also said the agreement was inconsistent with the state’s libertarian culture, pointing to an academic study that found 95 percent of private-company construction workers in Virginia last year were non-union. Virginia is one of 24 states with a right-to-work law that bars compulsory union membership.   In April 2012, McDonnell signed a bill banning state aid to projects requiring a Project Labor Agreement. Two months later, the MWAA rescinded the union-friendly policy. Now, let’s return to Cuccinelli’s claim that after the agreement was dropped, Phase 2 was rebid and taxpayers saved $300 million. Cuccinelli’s campaign defended the claim by sending us a May 2013 news release from the MWAA announcing its awarding of a construction contract for roughly half of the work in Phase 2. But there has been no rebidding in Phase 2, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton, so any savings from eliminating the union agreement is conjecture. The MWAA originally estimated that the contract it put out this spring would come in at between $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, but Capital Rail Constructors submitted a winning bid of $1.18 billion. That’s the basis of the savings Cuccinelli claims: A range of $222 million to $422 million compared to the original estimates. Connaughton said he believes the elimination of the union agreement reduced costs -- although he didn’t know by how much -- because it encouraged contractors weary of unions to bid on the contract. That expanded competition and bidders ""sharpened their pencils,"" he said. Debate over the value of Planned Labor Agreements goes far beyond Virginia and there are many defenders of the arrangements. The Laborers’ International Union of North America pointed us to a report from Cornell University professor Fred Kotler that says PLAs have saved money on New York projects because they establish predictable costs, guarantee standards of excellence and management rights, and give contractors flexibility on starting times. A few final notes: Cuccinelli said that McAuliffe, if he was governor, would back union-guaranteed contracts. McAuliffe, in June, declined to say whether he supports such agreements. McAuliffe has reaped almost $1.2 million in contributions from organized labor this year, prompting Cuccinelli to portray him as a pawn for unions. Cuccinelli, in contrast, has received only $250 from unions. In July, we gave a False rating to a Cuccinelli claim that McAuliffe ""opposes"" Virginia’s right-to-work law. Our ruling Cuccinelli says Virginia saved $300 million by rebidding a Dulles Metrorail contract without a union-friendly agreement. But the project was not re-bid -- the ""savings"" was a reflection of preliminary construction estimates compared to the winning bid made by a contractor. The state’s transportation secretary believes that eliminating a requirement for union contracts expanded bidding competition and led to savings, but says there’s no way of knowing how much. The basis of Cuccinelli’s statement has merit; Virginia did force the repeal of the union requirement and project bids came in lower than expected. But he twists facts to suggest there was a tangible $300 million savings in killing the union agreement. We rate his statement Half True.  ",/factchecks/2013/aug/12/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-embellishes-savings-stopping-union-cont/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'DuBose Porter']","
HOPE changes hurt enrollment, Porter says
","The four people vying to become the next chairman of Georgia’s Democratic Party spent most of their time at a recent forum discussing ways to help get candidates elected, but one of them said something about education that made us quite curious. ""Look at our technical schools now. We had the best in the world. And (Republicans) ruined that by what they did with the HOPE Grant to try to fix it a little bit the last time. There are half as many students in the Heart of Georgia in technical colleges than there were two years ago,"" said DuBose Porter, a former state representative who ran for governor in 2010. PolitiFact Georgia was a little confused. Porter, the chief executive officer of The Courier-Herald newspaper in Dublin, explained. In July 2011, two Middle Georgia colleges, Sandersville Technical College and Heart of Georgia Technical College, merged to create Oconee Fall Line Technical College. The Heart of Georgia is located in Dublin and is now called Oconee’s South campus. Sandersville is called Oconee’s North campus. Porter told us that he was referring to the drop in enrollment at the new college after the changes to the HOPE program. With that clarity, we wanted to find out whether Porter was correct about the drop in enrollment. In 2011, state lawmakers raised the academic requirements for the Georgia Lottery-funded HOPE Grant program, which helps students attend state colleges. Students needed to have a 3.0 grade-point average instead of the previous requirement of a 2.0. The change was made in response to concerns that the HOPE Grant and Scholarship programs were in financial peril. In response to blistering criticism that enrollment at technical colleges declined greatly after the change, the Georgia Legislature passed bills earlier this year to go back to the 2.0 grade-point average requirement. Nearly 9,000 students lost the grant in 2012 because they couldn't meet the higher standard, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Porter sent us a September 2011 article reported by his newspaper that Oconee’s enrollment had fallen by 1,000 students, from about 2,800 students to about 1,800 students. That’s a decrease of about 36 percent. The Technical College System of Georgia sent us figures for the enrollment drop after the merger. They show a 37 percent decrease for the two campuses after the HOPE Grant requirement was changed. It’s a 41 percent decrease if you calculate the changes before the HOPE change and two years afterward. Here’s their breakdown: Year        Students 2008-2009     4,231 2009-2010    4,749 2010-2011    4,472 2011-2012    2,806 2012-2013    2,824    The state broke down the numbers for each campus before and after the merger. The state’s data for the Dublin campus were similar to the information Porter sent us. Regardless, neither set of numbers shows a 50 percent decrease. The state’s data suggest the HOPE changes may have had an impact on enrollment. In fiscal year 2011, nearly 82 percent of Oconee students had received a HOPE grant. In fiscal year 2012, it was 71 percent. Preliminary figures for fiscal year 2013 show 61 percent of Oconee students received a HOPE grant. ""They lost a lot of students who could no longer go to college,"" said Mike Light, a spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia. To sum up, Porter said at a forum that enrollment at the Oconee Fall Line Technical College had dropped in half. The enrollment declines were severe, but not a 50 percent drop. The data show a decline in the percentage of Oconee students who received a HOPE Grant, which seems to support Porter’s argument. Porter’s overall point has merit, but his claim was somewhat overstated. Our rating: Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/12/dubose-porter/hope-changes-hurt-enrollment-porter-says/

Rush Holt TV ad challenges Cory Booker on carbon tax, Wall Street banks, domestic spying
","They’re among the more controversial issues in America today: climate change, behemoth Wall Street banks and domestic spying. And Rep. Rush Holt (D-12th), a candidate in Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the late Frank Lautenberg’s U.S. Senate seat, claims another candidate in the race doesn’t support taxing, breaking up or ending any of those issues for the betterment of the nation. ""We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans,"" Holt said in a recent TV ad. ""Cory Booker doesn’t support any of these ideas."" Holt’s claim isn’t completely accurate, and raises an issue of semantics. Booker, the mayor of Newark, along with Holt, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6tth) and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) are the four candidates in this week’s primary. The winner will face the winner of the Republican primary between Steve Lonegan, the former director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, and Dr. Alieta Eck. A special election for the Senate seat is scheduled Oct. 16. Let’s look at the three points in Holt’s ad and review where Booker stands on each issue. First, the carbon tax and climate change. Holt has proposed a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, which account for 75 percent of greenhouse gases during the past 40 years, according to a report from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change that Holt references on his campaign website. He also claims that during the next two decades, a carbon tax could prevent the emission of 9.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide and by mid-century, reduce U.S. emissions by a third. Kevin Griffis, senior adviser and communications director for Booker’s campaign, said in an e-mail that Booker ""hasn’t taken a public position on a carbon tax, which is largely a federal or state-level issue. He has spoken extensively about the importance of regional greenhouse gas agreements, reducing carbon emissions and producing green jobs."" Booker also hadn’t take a public position on breaking up Wall Street banks by the time Holt’s ad aired on Aug. 5. Booker addressed both issues, however, in a campaign questionnaire to The Star-Leger. Booker said legislation must be passed that reduces carbon production, and involve a market-based approach, including cap and trade or a carbon tax. He also said in the questionnaire that he ""would support exploring additional rules"" to limit risky actions by financial institutions, but didn’t say whether he supported breaking up Wall Street banks. As for alleged domestic spying on civilian Americans’ phone calls and e-mails by the National Security Agency, Booker’s campaign says the mayor believes in striking a balance between enforcing privacy protections guaranteed by Constitution while also protecting the country from terrorism. Booker also supports amending, instead of ending, the 11-year-old Patriot Act, which reduces the restrictions law enforcement once had in investigating terrorism. So should the electorate care if a candidate doesn’t respond publicly on particular issues? ""One rule of thumb for politicians is that you have to define yourself before someone else does it for you,"" said Ben Dworkin, director of The Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics and an adjunct assistant professor of political science at Rider University in Lawrenceville. ""The essence of a campaign, a competitive campaign, is to draw distinction."" Griffis maintains that Holt’s ad isn’t accurate. ""Our basic position is that not being on the record about something, especially when the mayor would not have had occasion to discuss it in the past, is not the same as stating his affirmative support or opposition to an idea or initiative, and therefore, the Holt ad is misleading,"" Griffis said in an e-mail. The Holt campaign, however, emphasizes that Booker not taking a public position on significant issues speaks loudly to voters. ""With due respect to the mayor, ‘I haven't taken a position’ isn't a rebuttal,"" Thomas Seay, Holt’s communications director, said in an e-mail. ""It's a restatement of the problem."" Our ruling Holt said in a TV ad, ""We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans. Cory Booker doesn’t support any of these ideas."" Booker hadn’t taken a position on those issues by the time the ad had aired, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t support or reject them. It simply means he hasn’t taken a position thus far. But let’s look at the flip side, too. Without knowing where Booker stands on these issues, New Jerseyans can legitimately question whether he supports a carbon tax, breaking up Wall Street banks and ending domestic spying. That lack of context is what makes Holt’s claim partially accurate, and why we rate Holt’s claim Half True.

On average, a college degree takes six years, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson says
","It used to be that college students joked about being on ""the five-year plan"" in their quest to earn a four-year degree. Nowadays, according to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, you can add another year. In a July 17, 2013 interview with Politico, the Wisconsin Republican made a critique that could be summarized like this: Young people are made to think that the only path to success is a four-year degree. They have been ""enticed’ to take on large debt because subsidies limit interest rates on student loans. The availability of loans and grants has led to increases in the cost of higher education. ""And so we have, in all of our good intentions,"" Johnson said, ""we’ve actually made college less accessible because we’ve made it so unaffordable and we’ve plunged our children into debt."" Then he made this claim: ""And also by giving them this easy debt, on average, kids are taking six years to get a four-year degree, while that debt meter is increasing."" With the start of school right around the corner, we wondered whether it's really taking an average of six years to get from high school diploma to bachelor's degree. Getting our bearings Johnson’s staff didn’t follow through on a promise to send us evidence to back his claim. But let’s note a couple of things for we evaluate it. Johnson spoke of ""kids."" So, it’s fair to say his six-year claim applies to students who start college shortly after finishing high school, rather than adults who pursue a degree later in life, perhaps over many years. He also used the phrase ""on average."" That number, of course, is stretched by students who don’t take just four or six years, but much longer to finish their degree. That means there’s some value in also looking at how long it takes for a typical student to get a B.A. or B.S. Averages We examined the latest U.S. Department of Education statistics that include averages in measuring the time it takes to get a bachelor’s degree. We also discussed them with department statistician Aurora D’Amico. Those statistics, which cover students who earned their first four-year degree during the 2007-2008 school year, cast a pretty wide net. They include part-time as well as full-time students; students who started their college studies at a two-year or a four-year institution; and students who were not seeking a degree of any type when they initially entered college. For that relatively broad collection of students, the average time to get their bachelor’s degree was six years and four months -- even higher than what Johnson claimed. The time was shorter -- five years and 10 months -- for students who began college within a year of finishing high school; those are arguably the ""kids"" Johnson was referring to. And for students who started their college studies at a four-year institution, rather than a two-year school, the average was five years and eight months. So, those are the averages, all of which are in the ballpark of Johnson’s six-year claim. Other measures The Department of Education study also provided figures that aren’t averages, notably this one: 44 percent of the students who got their degrees in 2007-2008 did so within four years. That compares to 23 percent who needed five or six years (and 33 percent who took more than six years). So, it is more common to earn a four-year degree in four years than it is in five to six years. Another recent Department of Education study, reviewing a narrower group of students, found similar results. It covered first-time, full-time students who entered four-year institution in fall 2005 aiming to obtain a bachelor’s degree. In this group, 39 percent got their four-year degree within four years; 59 percent graduated within six years. Our rating Johnson said that on average, college students ""are taking six years to get a four-year degree."" It’s more common for students to take four years to graduate than it is for them to take six years. But overall, the average duration is about six years. Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs additional information. That’s how we rate this one.",/factchecks/2013/aug/11/ron-johnson/average-college-degree-takes-six-years-us-sen-ron-/

NAACP Providence President Jim Vincent says 24 states have restrictive voting laws now, compared with 2 before President Obama was elected
","The question over what kinds of identification requirements should be imposed on voters -- and whether such rules are being used to exclude minorities, the poor and the elderly -- continues to be a hot topic. During the Aug. 4, 2013, edition of WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers"" program, James Vincent, president of the Providence chapter of the NAACP, was asked about a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision invalidating a key part of the Voting Rights Act. ""I think within five minutes, both Texas and North Carolina couldn't wait to restrict voting rights,"" said Vincent. ""Let's face it. I think there's 24 states that have voting IDs or some form of restrictions in terms of who can vote and who can't vote, and I think before President Obama was elected, I think it was two."" He then spoke of ""the demographic reality of the browning of America"" and commented, ""I think these things are related. All of a sudden you have a country that's being more diverse and then you have an African-American president, and now all of a sudden you have all these voting rights acts and the elimination of same-day voting and early voting."" ""I don't think that's a coincidence,"" Vincent said. We focused on the numbers. Recognizing that Vincent was making it clear that his tally might be off a bit, we were curious about the totals and whether the number of states with tougher restrictions had increased 12-fold since the election of the country's first black president. First, let’s look at the current situation. We quickly discovered that checking this factoid depends on where you want to draw the line on whether a law restricts voter rights. Some consider it restrictive to ask for any type of written identification. Others draw the line at photo ID requirements. Still others consider it restrictive to curtail laws that make it easier for people to cast their ballot, such as early voting. (Rhode Island’s voter ID law, which went into effect Jan. 1, 2012, requires voters to have one of several forms of identification, such as a birth certificate or Social Security card. Beginning Jan. 1, 2014, voters will be required to have a valid photo ID.) Vincent said he got the 24 number from the website of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. He directed us to its 2013 ""Map of Shame."" Chris Melody Fields, an election protection coordinator for the Lawyers' Committee, said it doesn't just include states with photo ID rules. It ""shows the overall assault on voting,"" she said. It identifies states that have passed ""restrictive laws"" that have eliminated or reduced early voting, eliminated same-day registration or passed a tougher proof-of-citizenship law. It shows 25 states -- not 24 -- with laws the group considers restrictive, including (but not limited to) ones where a photo ID is requested or required. However the laws in seven of those states have not yet been implemented or have been challenged. In 10 of the 25, a photo ID is only requested, not mandatory, although Fields warned that poll workers in some states misread the law and think that it is mandatory. To get another perspective, we turned to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks voter ID laws. Its website shows that four states require a photo ID and seven request one. Seven more states have passed legislation to require or request a photo ID, but those statutes are awaiting implementation or are under challenge. If you include states that have any type of voter ID requirement -- whether or not a photograph is involved -- the number of implemented laws jumps to 30. It will rise to 34 if all are implemented. So by the Lawyers' Committee definition, Vincent’s claim on the number of states with restrictive voting is close to the mark. By the conference's tally, which looks exclusively at voter ID laws, his count is low. Now let's look at the number of states that had voter ID laws before Obama was elected. Vincent said he heard during the debate on Rhode Island’s law that two states fell into that category. According to NCSL, in 2001, three states -- Florida, Hawaii and Louisiana -- asked for but didn’t require a photo ID and 10 states required some other form of voter identification. Between 2003 and 2008, when Obama was elected, eight more states started requiring some sort of ID, bringing the total to 18. Among them, Michigan and South Dakota started asking for photo IDs. Indiana and Georgia, started requiring them. ""Indiana's law went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 and it was upheld,"" said Wendy Underhill, a senior policy specialist with NCS. ""I think after that, it did give other states a signal that that was something they could copy. So it's possible between 2005 [when the Indiana law passed] and 2008 states were sitting tight to see how that was going to come out."" Our ruling James Vincent said 24 states today require voter IDs or impose some other restrictions on voting, while only two states had such limits before Barack Obama was elected. He's using a measure set by the Lawyers' Committee that includes states with laws that request or demand a photo ID, and states that have restricted voting in other ways. The only comparable pre-Obama metric we could find, from the National Conference of State Legislatures, involves voter photo identification, so we'll stick with that. While only two states -- Georgia and Indiana -- required a photo ID to vote before 2008, Michigan, South Dakota, Louisiana, Florida and Hawaii, requested a photo ID, according to NCSL data. That means at least seven states -- not two, as Vincent claimed -- were demanding or asking for a photo ID for the 2008 election that put Obama in office. No matter which standard you use, the number of states adopting more-restrictive voter identification requirements has increased since 2008. We'll leave it to others to debate whether that’s linked to Obama's election and America's changing racial demographics. In short, Vincent was close on his first number but got the second number wrong. We rate his statement Half True.

"['Abortion', 'Human Rights', 'Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'Ken Cuccinelli']","
Cuccinelli says his support of fetal personhood was always qualified
","Republican Ken Cuccinelli says if he’s elected governor, he won’t push for strategic bills that could be used to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v Wade decision that established abortion rights. He made the declaration during a July 20 debate against Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Moderator Judy Woodruff asked Cuccinelli, who opposes abortions, whether he would sign a law defining life as beginning at conception. Cuccinelli, who has backed such legislation in the past, said ""when those things hit my desk, I’ll be supportive of them, ""but stressed that his focus is on jobs and the economy. ""Certainly I want to respect life as best we can, but we can’t defy the (U.S.) Constitution as it stands now,"" Cuccinelli said. ""Every bill I’ve ever supported has either had language that says we’re conforming to the constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court or language to that effect. I’m not looking to make a challenge in that respect."" We wondered whether every bill that Cuccinelli has backed granting personhood to fetuses has contained language saying the legislation is not intended to challenge high court rulings. We found two clear occasions when he supported such legislation during his career as a state senator from 2002 to 2009 and attorney general starting in 2010. Ana Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli’s campaign, pointed us to a 2012 bill introduced by Del. Bob Marshall, R-Prince William. Cuccinelli spoke at a rally supporting the legislation on the state capitol’s grounds. The bill contained this clause: ""The laws of this Commonwealth shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens and residents of this Commonwealth, subject only to the Constitution of the United States and decisional interpretations thereof by the United States Supreme Court and specific provisions to the contrary in the statutes and constitution of this Commonwealth."" So this measure, which passed the House of Delegates and died in the Senate, supports Cuccinelli’s debate statement. But his campaign neglected to mention the other personhood bill Cuccinelli weighed in on, and it erodes the candidate’s claim. In 2007, Cuccinelli cosponsored unsuccessful legislation that said life begins at the moment of fertilization and extended the ""right to the enjoyment of life"" from that point onward.

Is the average debt upon college graduation more than $24,000?
","A university degree doesn’t come cheap, and politicians are well aware that voters of all stripes wish college was more affordable. In a guest column last month in the Portland Tribune, Oregon’s junior U.S. senator wrote of his desire to make college more affordable to help grow the economy. In the piece, Democrat Jeff Merkley also cited the debt burden shouldered by the state’s university graduates. ""In Oregon today, the average debt upon college graduation is more than $24,000, with many students in debt $50,000 to $100,000,"" he wrote. At least $24,000 on average? That’s not chump change. For that money, students could splurge on a new car, plunk down a sizeable down payment on a first home or fly off on a very grand tour of Europe. In fact, $24,000 is almost half of the median annual household income in Oregon, according to the latest U.S. Census figures. We decided to focus our fact check on that statistic. Jamal Raad, Merkley’s spokesman, wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Oregon that the $24,000 figure comes from a June 2013 fact sheet from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning D.C. think tank. The average debt per borrower in Oregon is $24,370, according to the report. That figure includes both public and private universities, said David Bergeron, the center’s vice president for post-secondary education policy. The figure originated from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Household Debt and Credit Report, which provides a quarterly snapshot of trends in borrowing, including student loans. The statistic comes from a sample of consumer credit data and accounts for federally backed and private loans students borrowed, said Matthew Ward, a spokesman for the bank. The average amount borrowed by Oregon students is a bit less than the $24,810 U.S. average, according to the report. It also noted that 17.1 percent of Oregon consumers -- defined as those with a credit record -- carry student debt. The report listed ""average debt per borrower,"" not average debt per college graduate. In other words, many students incur student debt even if they drop out and never graduate. Some students incur no debt. Graduates from Oregon colleges in 2011 incurred an average debt of $25,497, according to The Institute for College Affordability & Success, a nonprofit that tracks student debt. The figures are for public and private schools and are based on voluntary reports submitted to college guidance company Peterson’s, which administers a financial aid database. The numbers are only as reliable as the universities are able to track and report. And college financial aid officers aren’t always aware of private loans that can add up. The institute’s numbers indicate that debt amounts can vary widely for private colleges, some of which offer more generous financial aid packages than public universities. For example, Reed College graduates in 2011 left with an average debt of $20,840; Lewis & Clark College $22,956; Willamette University $25,932; and Linfield College $29,754. We’ll note here that student debt figures are generally calculated out of the pool of graduates who leave school with debt — about 63 percent of Oregon students, the institute said. In other words, about 37 percent of students in Oregon graduate debt free. This matters because officials made similar statements about average debt per graduate in Ohio and Virginia, resulting in Half True rulings from sister PolitiFact organizations. They neglected to account for students who graduate without debt. Merkley, unlike the other politicians, did not talk about the ""average student"" but the ""average debt."" We’ll come back to this point later. Finally, we checked with the Oregon University System. The average debt of graduates in the class of 2011 across all seven state schools was $23,839, according to the OUS 2012 Fact Book. The figures are for federal loans borrowed by students at each institution. About 59 percent of graduates left with debt. Merkley said that the average debt upon college graduation in Oregon is more than $24,000. The studies we found came up with three figures that largely back him up. The studies calculated student debt in different ways, making apples-to-apples comparisons impossible even though they’re all within range of one another. The studies also fail to account entirely for private loans students take out directly, which would likely increase the average student indebtedness amounts. Still, the reports back up Merkley’s statement. The only point left to quibble over is clarifying that 37 percent of students graduate from university in Oregon without any debt. That is additional information that could help readers understand that the $24,000 figure is among those who leave college in debt. Unlike officials in other states, Merkley did not write about the ""average kid"" or student incurring a certain amount of debt. He wrote about ""average debt"" upon graduation.  That makes his statement accurate, but it needs additional information and context. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/10/jeff-merkley/average-debt-upon-college-graduation-more-24000/

Mary Taylor says Obamacare will push insurance costs up 41 percent for Ohioans
","Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, who also is the director of the state’s Department of Insurance, is a Republican who has been highly critical of the federal law known as Obamacare. In an email distributed Aug. 3, 2013, by KasichforOhio.com, a message bearing Taylor’s name solicits signatures to an online petition against the Affordable Care Act. ""A new study by the Ohio Department of Insurance details how Ohioans can expect to pay up to 41 percent more for their insurance premiums when Obamacare takes effect next year,"" the message says. Taylor’s note is accompanied by a photo headlined ""41% Increase For Ohioans."" In the picture, a smiling Barack Obama is looking toward the image of a woman with her hand over her forehead in anguish. Sounded and looked pretty bad. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. We didn’t have to look far for an explanation. When Taylor’s Department of Insurance put out a news release containing essentially the same message, The Plain Dealer investigated the facts behind the study. Reporter Natalie Villacorta and Washington Bureau Chief Stephen Koff talked with the Department of Insurance and also experts who looked at the department’s findings. What they found was that the 41 percent figure applies to one group of people -- individuals buying health insurance policies on the new state marketplace, or exchange. And that’s a small percentage of the population. The majority of Ohioans are insured by group plans, typically offered through their employers. A study done for the state by Milliman, Inc., a consulting firm, found that only 350,000 out of 10 million people with medical coverage in Ohio had these kinds of policies in 2010. That’s 3.5 percent of the people with medical coverage. The study by the Insurance Department, the one Taylor’s claim cites, also drew criticism from outside experts. They noted it did not take into account subsidies that will lessen the costs for many people who buy their policies in the exchange.  The average premium for 2014 was estimated at $332.58 a month for individuals, but that figure did not take into account the impact of subsidies that will help reduce out of pocket costs. Taylor acknowledged to The Plain Dealer that the impact of the subsidies was not factored into the estimates. She said that the Insurance Department did not have the necessary information to calculate the impact of the subsidies. But the subsidies could have a broad impact. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 80 to 90 percent of Americans using the exchange will be eligible for income-based federal subsidies. Those who make less than four times the federal poverty level – $45,960 a year for a single person and $94,200 for a family of four – will be eligible. And that can make a big difference. For example, a 30-year-old individual who makes $30,000 will be expected to pay $2,512 in premiums per year. That breaks down to $209 a month. But in that example, subsidies would cover about $76 of the monthly total. One other point is that comparing premiums from 2013 plans with those that will be used in 2014 is tricky. The Insurance Department’s report said 2013’s average premium for individuals was $236. That figure is part of the calculation that yields the 41 percent increase. A spokesman for the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Larry Levitt, told The Plain Dealer that there are factors in play, though, that make that average figure artificially low. First, cheap policies today often come with steep deductibles and co-payments and limited coverages. And second, it can be hard for people with pre-existing conditions to even qualify to purchase an individual policy. But that changes in 2014, under the Affordable Care Act. Insurers will be required to include coverage for some essential benefits, such as maternity care, in their policies. And, they will not be able to turn away clients with pre-existing conditions. Furthermore, to arrive at the 41 percent average increase, Taylor included all current policies -- including those with deductibles as high as $25,000, which some health policy analysts say barely qualify as health coverage. By contrast, the Affordable Care Act caps out-of-pocket spending for individuals around $6,000 (indexed for inflation). Mathematically, that doesn't make her figure wrong, but qualitatively, it's like comparing a used Chevy to a new Cadillac. So where does that leave Taylor’s claim? She said in the email that ""A new study by the Ohio Department of Insurance details how Ohioans can expect to pay up to 41 percent more for their insurance premiums when Obamacare takes effect next year."" Taylor didn’t say all Ohioans. By using the words ""up to,"" she implies that some won’t pay that much. And the Department of Insurance did in fact find some people could pay 41 percent more. But someone hearing Taylor’s claim would need to know some important details to put it in full context. While she implies ""some Ohioans"" rather than all, what her claim makes no mention of is that the 41 percent applies to a very small percentage of Ohioans. Nor does it mention that the figure would be impacted by federal subsidies for which a large percentage of those purchasing policies on the insurance exchange could qualify. And, as the expert from Kaiser noted, figuring average premium costs is tricky because some cheaper policies that lower the average price now won’t be available in 2014, while laws requiring certain coverages could push up the 2014 averages. On the Truth-O-Meter, Taylor’s claim rates Half True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/09/mary-taylor/mary-taylor-says-obamacare-will-push-insurance-cos/

Pier funding will 'take funds from the general fund for Pinellas County' and St. Pete, says Ford
","St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster and challenger Kathleen Ford tangled over paying for the Lens, the proposed pier replacement, at a debate last week. Foster said the money was use-it-or-lose-it, while Ford said the plan takes money from the city’s general funds. ""If we use (Tax Increment Financing) funding, that's going to take funds from the general fund for Pinellas County, as it will take funds from the general fund for the city of St. Pete,"" Ford said. We decided to look into Ford's comments. (We'll look at Foster's in a separate fact-check.) Let’s go back to 1969, when the Florida Legislature passed the Community Redevelopment Act. The intent was to allow a city and a county to target a specific geographic area -- say, a downtown -- for improvements. The law allows local officials to create a Community Redevelopment Area, so that a portion of property taxes collected in the area can be used for major development projects there.  In 1981, the city of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County set up such an area with the goal of paying for projects downtown. Each time the property taxes within the area rise above the 1981 level, that additional money goes into an improvement fund, usually called TIF, which stands for tax increment financing. We should note that a pier project of some kind has long been on the drawing board. The inverted pyramid made its debut in 1973 and underwent a major renovation in 1987. Since at least 2005, city officials have been looking at either another renovation or a total replacement, paid for with TIF money. Community Redevelopment Areas usually only last 30 years, and then the districts dissolve. But in 2005, the Board of County Commissioners granted the city a 30-year extension until 2035, said Ken Welch, a Pinellas County commissioner. Ford’s point is that if St. Petersburg’s district didn’t exist, the property tax money would go into the city and county’s general funds. But the district does exist, and that means TIF money is out of bounds for the city’s day-to-day operations or anything outside the downtown district, said Joe Zeoli, managing director of administration and finance in city development. City leaders have never supported abandoning the pier without a replacement, Zeoli said. Though Ford doesn’t support the Lens design, she did advocate refurbishing the inverted pyramid at Tuesday’s debate. Refurbishment money would likely come from the TIF fund. Right now there’s about $50 million in TIF money available for a pier project, with about $37 million of that intended for construction.  If the money isn’t spent by 2035, only then could the county reclaim its 44 percent share. The city would take the remaining money. Voters will approve or reject the Lens on Aug. 27. If the Lens fails and a different pier project goes forward, the same method of financing would apply, Welch said. What had been coming from the general fund is a roughly $1.5 million subsidy for yearly operating costs for the now-closed inverted pyramid pier structure. The Lens would call for a $680,000 annual subsidy, as estimated by a third party, said Chris Ballestra, the city’s managing director of development coordination. ""Any new project including a revamp of the inverted pyramid would likely reduce that $1.5 million burden,"" Ballestra said, not just the proposed Lens. If the new structure makes the surrounding property more valuable, then taxes in that area would go up and feed back into the TIF fund, said David Cruz, Florida League of Cities legislative advocate. The TIF money means no money for pier construction comes from general city funds. It doesn’t raise people’s tax bills, nor does it come from money the city is allowed to re-appropriate. Our ruling Ford said that TIF money takes away money from the city’s general fund, implying that taxpayers would pay for the Lens with money that could be used elsewhere. Actually, the funds come from a special financing district, not from general funds. We rate her claim False.",/factchecks/2013/aug/09/kathleen-ford/pier-funding-will-take-funds-general-fund-pinellas/

St. Petersburg pier money will be lost to the county, Mayor Foster says

After the forum, Foster confirmed the intent of his comments to PolitiFact Florida, telling us that money needs to be spent or part of it will be lost to the county. We decided to check it out. (We looked at Ford's comments in a separate fact-check.) First, some background: In 1969, the Florida Legislature passed the Community Redevelopment Act.

Are 5 percent of homeowners really 90 days or more behind on their mortgages?
","Oregon’s housing market might be showing some improvement, but there’s still a ways to go. That was the general gist of an opinion piece Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum recently published in the Statesman Journal. The article was a chance for her to introduce Oregonians to a ""rebooted and revamped foreclosure mediation program."" ""Homes are selling quicker and for more money,"" Rosenblum wrote. ""Foreclosures, thankfully, are down."" Still, she continued, ""we’re not all the way back. The hangover from the housing crash lingers for thousands of Oregonians. Nearly 29,000 Oregonians — almost 5 percent of all homeowners — are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage."" This caught our attention. We were curious not only whether the numbers she used were right, but whether the 5 percent figure she referenced was actually all that much higher than where we were before this whole recession began. First, we contacted Jeff Manning, Rosenblum’s spokesman. He told us their office got the numbers from Oregon Housing and Community Services, an agency that deals with state housing policy. That agency, in turn, had gotten the figures from a business called CoreLogic. CoreLogic is a company that specializes in information, data and analytics. In past news reports, The Oregonian has relied on its data regarding foreclosures and delinquency rates. We gave CoreLogic a call and got ahold of Andrea Hurst, who handles communications. She was able to send us a spreadsheet with the number of homeowners 90 days or more delinquent on their mortage for each month between January 2009 and May 2013. And, Rosenblum was right: the most recent figures put Oregon’s delinquency rate at 4.88 percent (or almost 5 percent). But, we came up short in two areas. First, there was no raw figure of how many homes that 4.88 percent figure represented. Second, we didn’t have much in the way of a baseline. See, the figure for January 2009 was a considerably lower 2.92 percent, but we wanted something from before the recession began. Generally, economists cite December 2007 as the turning point. The folks over at CoreLogic, however, couldn’t get us numbers stretching back that far. Manning, however, said that he had them and sent us over a spreadsheet that begins tracking monthly rates with January 2006. From January 2006 through November 2007, the average monthly delinquency rate was 0.73 percent, according to the data Manning sent us. In fact, in those 24 months it went over 1 percent once: In November 2007, when the rate began a fairly rapid rise. The numbers Manning sent also backed up the 29,000 figure Rosenblum used (technically the number of homes more than 90 days delinquent was 28,891 in May 2013.) Of course, we never like using data we get from the source that made the claim, so we asked Manning how he got these figures from CoreLogic when we couldn’t. He pointed us to Ben Pray with Oregon Housing and Community Services. Pray told us his department subscribes to data service from CoreLogic and he simply ran a data request for Rosenblum a week ago. We also did one last quick check to make sure that figures in the limited data set CoreLogic gave us matched with what Manning and Pray had given us. They did. There are, of course, other companies that try to discern and report delinquency rates and the figures can vary depending on which you use. However, CoreLogic’s data is the same data used by the federal reserve. If it’s good enough for them, we figure it’s good enough for us. In introducing a revised mediation program, Rosenblum wrote that the housing crash lingers and that nearly 5 percent of all homeowners are more than 90 days delinquent on their mortgage. We verified that her figures were right and that 5 percent does, indeed, represent a number well above what we’d experience before the recession.

IRS chief’s words didn’t reject 'Obamacare'
","In an Aug. 2, 2013, press release forwarded to us by a reader, U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas, objected to the IRS enforcing Obamacare -- a law he claimed the IRS chief said his employees don’t want applied to themselves. That week, Hensarling said, ""the acting chief of the IRS said he – and the majority of IRS employees – would rather stay with his current plan than switch to Obamacare."" Did the IRS boss say most agency workers would rather not be included in Obamacare? The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, isn’t a health plan itself. It requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. The act also sets up online marketplaces, which start opening Oct. 1, 2013, where people can shop for health care plans. Starting in 2014, the IRS gets the job of confirming taxpayers have health insurance and assessing a financial penalty if they don’t. One Obamacare provision requires members of Congress and their aides -- even though they already had health insurance through their employer, Uncle Sam -- to get coverage through the online exchanges, though how that will happen is in flux. A bill filed by U.S. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., would require all federal employees to get coverage through the exchanges. The National Treasury Employees Union -- whose members include about 80,000 of the IRS’ 90,000 employees, according to a June 10, 2013, Bloomberg news story -- has urged its members to oppose Camp’s bill. Hensarling spokeswoman Sarah Rozier told us the congressman’s claim referred to Aug. 1, 2013, testimony by acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel to a House committee, after Werfel was asked by another Texan why IRS union members opposed Camp’s bill. Notably, however, the question posed by U.S. Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Plano, contained an inaccuracy that’s also present in Hensarling’s statement and in a claim by Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio that PolitiFact recently found flawed. Here’s what Werfel was asked, according to CSPAN video: Johnson: Now, Mr. Werfel, last week your employees who are a member of the National Treasury Employees Union sent a form letter for union members to send in to ask they be exempt from the exchanges. Why are your employees trying to exempt themselves from the very law that you’re tasked to enforce? On Aug. 1, 2013, PolitiFact rated as Mostly False Rubio’s claim that the union was ""begging to be let out from under this law."" The others also cite the existing Obamacare law: Hensarling referred to a ""switch to Obamacare"" and Johnson said ""exempt ... from the very law."" But that premise is flawed, because the union is not objecting to Obamacare -- which doesn’t target Americans who already have insurance. In contrast, the union was objecting to the Camp bill, under which federal employees would have their current health plans taken away and then, like other Americans who lack insurance, buy plans through the exchanges. Here’s the IRS chief’s response to Johnson: Werfel: Well, I don’t want to speak for the NTEU, but I’ll offer a perspective as a federal employee myself and a federal employee at the IRS. And that is we have right now, as employees of the government or the IRS, affordable health care coverage. And I think the ACA was designed to provide an option or an alternative for individuals that do not. And all else being equal, I think if you’re an individual who’s satisfied with your health care coverage, you’re probably in a better position to stick with that coverage than go through the change of moving into a different environment and going through that process. So I think, for a federal employee, I think more likely, and I would -- can speak for myself, I’d prefer to stay with the current policy that I’m pleased with rather than go through a change if I don’t need to go through that change. And -- but, if I’m an individual that doesn’t have affordable health care coverage, or I’m unhappy with my coverage, then it’s my understanding the exchanges would offer a competitive alternative to look at, and that might be something someone might want to pursue. But I think the IRS employees as a whole, I think what the NTEU is saying is they’re pleased with their health care coverage, they prefer to stay in their current health care coverage. Boiled down, Werfel said federal employees already have affordable insurance and he thinks the Obamacare law set in motion programs designed for people who don’t. He said that he and IRS union members would prefer to keep their current policies rather than make a change (in context, the change proposed by Camp’s bill). Rozier told us Hensarling accurately summarized Werfel’s comments. Our ruling Hensarling said that ""the acting chief of the IRS said he – and the majority of IRS employees – would rather stay with his current plan than switch to Obamacare."" Werfel did say that he and other IRS workers would prefer no change in their insurance coverage. But the context for that statement is not as Hensarling suggested. IRS and other federal workers are not objecting to the law known as Obamacare but to proposed legislation designed to take away their current employer-provided insurance and make them buy coverage through exchanges created by Obamacare. We rate Hensarling’s partly accurate claim, which leaves the misimpression that IRS workers are scrambling to get out from under a law that actually applies to the nation’s uninsured, as Half True.",/factchecks/2013/aug/09/jeb-hensarling/irs-chiefs-words-didnt-reject-obamacare/

Postal service, which operates on sales of stamps, last had profit in 2006 and took last taxpayer aid in 1982
","Jim Hightower, the populist commentator and former Texas agriculture commissioner, questions whether the U.S. Postal Service is financially imperiled. This came to our attention after an Austin resident asked whether Hightower was right that Congress in 2006 required the service to set aside billions of dollars to cover the health benefits of postal retirees for 75 years--all of it to be stashed in one decade. Such a mandate indeed passed into law. But we were stirred by another part of Hightower’s spring 2013 fundraising letter for the Hightower Lowdown newsletter. Suggesting the service isn't broke, Hightower declared: ""Since 1971, the postal service has not taken a dime from taxpayers. All of its operations...are paid for by sales of stamps and related products. The Postal Service makes an operational profit year after year."" We traipsed through that trio of claims, finding two flawed. By telephone, Hightower aide Laura Ehrlich told us Hightower’s letter echoed the March 2012 Hightower Lowdown, which noted that President Richard Nixon and Congress in 1970 replaced the Cabinet-level Post Office with the postal service, to be governed by a board and funded by postage sales. And contrary to reports, Hightower wrote then, the service had enjoyed ""operational"" profits, though the mandate to pre-pay retiree health benefits was costing $5.5 billion a year in ""money taken right out of postage revenue that could be going to services."" In 2011, PolitiFact rated as Half True a claim that the 2006 law ""drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue, while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts."" The law required payments of approximately that amount, and the payments greatly hurt the post office's bottom line. However, those additional overpayments were also subject to debate and the law was hardly the only challenge faced by the service. Not a dime of tax aid since '71? The 1970 act launching the service called for it to be weaned from federal aid, a postal spokesman, Sam Bolen of San Marcos, told us by email. Still, from 1971 into the 1980s, nearly $9.2 billion in taxpayer money subsidized operations, according to a chart Bolen sent by email. Precisely, 10 percent to 11 percent of the service’s operating expenses from 1972 through 1974 were covered by congressional appropriations, according to the chart, with smaller shares funded through 1982. That year, $12 million in federal aid accounted for 0.1 percent of the service’s nearly $23 billion in operating expenses, the chart indicates. So, the service has not taken taxpayer dimes since 1982. By email, Ehrlich put us in touch with Steve Hutkins of New York, who oversees Save the Post Office, a website that presents information on post office closures and how citizens can object. Hutkins suggested we discount the taxpayer aid that went to the service after its inception, saying by email that that funding ""was not because the postal service was running deficits... It was about making the transition to a self-sustaining footing."" Operations funded from stamp sales Next, does the service rely solely on the sale of stamps and the like to fund operations? By email, Ehrlich pointed us to the Postal Service’s ""Postal Facts"" web page which states in part that the service ""relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations."" That’s correct, Bolen and another Postal Service spokesman, David Partenheimer, told us by telephone. Loans also help the service meet obligations and postal spokesman Stephen Seewoester of Dallas told us, ""We are currently at our statutory borrowing limit of $15 billion."" Then again, Partenheimer said, such loans are repaid, though he also said it would it would be inaccurate to say the service is financially thriving. ""Operational profits"" year after year? That brings us to Hightower's claim that the service has an ""operational profit"" year after year. To our inquiries, Ehrlich suggested by email that if not for the 2006 pre-funding law, the service would not have had recent cash-flow difficulties. She pointed out a Sept. 30, 2010, order from the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees postal-rate regulations, stating that if the mandate to pre-fund retiree benefits had not been imposed, the service ""would maintain substantial end-of-year cash balances without any need to resort to borrowing."" We looked for financial details. By email, postal spokesman Bolen told us the service last had an operational profit, of $900 million, in the fiscal year that ran through September 2006, while Hutkins of Save the Post Office said by email that the service’s financial statements show it’s been ""close to breaking even"" for years despite the pre-funding mandate. The service’s financial reports issued before Hightower sent his letter show consistent slight losses. In the first six months of fiscal 2013, through March 2013, the service reported $34 billion in revenues and $37 billion in expenses, Hutkins said. Its loss of $3 billion took into account $2.8 billion needed to pre-pay retiree health benefits, he said, leaving an ""adjusted loss"" of $245 million. A May 2013 update, covering eight months, shows $3.8 billion in losses counting $3.7 billion in pre-paid retiree health benefits. Hutkins wrote that since the annual pre-payments began in 2007, the Postal Service has lost $40 billion, counting $32 billion in the pre-payments. He said another $8 billion ""involves adjustments to workers compensation that the Postal Service considers problematic (due to the way they're calculated). Over this period of time, the Postal Service has lost $34 million (a microscopic loss in the context of annual revenues averaging around $68 billion)."" Hutkins said that over the decades, the service ""has had years when it shows a profit, years when it shows a deficit. It hovers around breaking even. If the profits get too big, the mailers say rates are too high; if the deficit gets too big, Congress presses for cuts; when the cuts get too big and service goes down, customers and citizens complain, and Congress tells the postal service to find a middle ground. It's always about rates vs. service."" By phone, postal spokesman Partenheimer said it’s incorrect that service has had an operational profit year after year. Partenheimer emailed us part of a Nov. 15, 2012 postal service presentation indicating that the service had an operational loss of $2.4 billion in the fiscal year through September 2012--without counting expenses including the required pre-payments. In his email, Partenheimer said the service previously defaulted on $11.1 billion of the health pre-payments and expects to default on $5.6 billion more this year. Broadly, he said, the service’s financial burdens will grow without changes such as elimination of Saturday mail delivery, an expansion in permitted products and services and financial adjustments related to workers’ compensation and how retiree health plans are supported. Our ruling Hightower said the postal service has taken no taxpayer aid since 1971, funds operations entirely from the sale of stamps and the like and makes an ""operational profit year after year."" The service funds operations from the sale of stamps and the like. Also, Congress in 1970 set a course for ending federal subsidies. But the last subsidies flowed in 1982, not 1971. Contrary to this claim, too, the service last enjoyed an operational profit in 2006, the year it was handed a costly mandate to quickly pre-fund decades of retiree health benefits. While the post office may be doing better than people think, we rate this claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/aug/09/jim-hightower/postal-service-which-operates-sales-stamps-last-ha/

Group says Wisconsin jobless rate was on the rise while Paul Ryan advocated for immigration increases
","U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s role as a potential deal-maker on immigration reform has drawn criticism from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes legal status for illegal immigrants and wants to reduce legal immigration to the United States. The group questions why Ryan, the Janesville Republican, would welcome more foreign laborers to America at a time when unemployment remains stubbornly high in Wisconsin. ""Does Congressman Ryan think Wisconsin workers aren’t good enough to get the job done?"" the group asks in a TV ad. The group fleshed out its complaint in an August 5, 2013 news release. ""Congressman Ryan needs to explain to thousands of Wisconsin workers, who are struggling to find jobs to support their families, why he wants to increase immigration in order to avert a labor shortage that clearly does not exist,"" said FAIR president Dan Stein. Then came this claim: ""Ryan's advocacy for amnesty and immigration increases has intensified as unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin. In June, unemployment increased in 30 of the state's 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state's 72 counties."" Those don’t sound like good numbers. But Gov. Scott Walker has touted a declining statewide unemployment rate. And the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that June’s private-sector job gain was the largest month-to-month increase since 2003. What gives? As we reported in an August 5, 2013 item, Ryan is open to granting legal status and eventually citizenship to those who came here illegally, if they get in ""back of the line,"" pay penalties and jump through other hoops over a 15-year period. He wants border security tackled first. In this item, we won’t evaluate whether ""amnesty"" is the proper description of what Ryan supports. The word means different things to different people. But we’ll examine whether ""unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin"" as Ryan stepped up his consensus-building efforts in the House, as the group claims. A look at the numbers There’s no dispute that unemployment rates still reflect widespread joblessness lingering after the Great Recession, with 210,000 people still unemployed in June 2013. FAIR’s larger point is well taken. But FAIR says things are getting worse. The group refers to a time period when Ryan’s advocacy ""intensified"", and cites the June unemployment figures in claiming that unemployment has been ""on the rise throughout Wisconsin."" It’s accurate to say, as FAIR did in backing up its claim, that unemployment increased in 30 of the state's 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state's 72 counties in June when compared to the previous month. Janesville, for example, saw its rate rise from 8.5 percent to 9.0 percent. Milwaukee rose from 9.9 to 10.6 percent. The figures, which are estimates, were reported by the state’s workforce development agency. The data supports the group’s claim if you interpret ""throughout Wisconsin"" as a geographical reference. Unemployment rose in most counties, and nearly all major municipalities. But there’s one inconvenient fact. In June, the statewide unemployment rate actually dropped from 7.0 percent to 6.8 percent despite the negative news in many local communities. How can that be? The figures are estimates drawn from a small sample, so the local numbers are less reliable than the statewide figure, noted Laura Dresser, a labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy. The size of the changes in different communities influences the bottom line, too. ""I would say it is most responsible to watch any of these trends over time -- i.e. statewide unemployment ticking mostly but very slowly down -- or to watch the trend in municipalities over a long horizon as well,"" Dresser told us. ""Only when you see month after month moving the same directions can you really think of it as a trend."" Then there’s the matter of the time frame. It’s reasonable to say that Ryan’s public role ""intensified"" in June and July -- before and after the Senate passed its version of immigration reform. And as FAIR noted, the latest unemployment stats are from June. But Ryan was revving up his push back in May. He barnstormed Wisconsin early that month, pushing for reform. A Journal Sentinel article at the time noted Ryan ""has plunged into the fray, using his stature with conservatives to promote a sweeping bipartisan compromise in Congress."" The time frame matters because the unemployment rate increase in June was not the norm for 2013. The statewide unemployment rate has nudged up and down for the last year, settling in June at 6.8 percent, below the U.S. rate of 7.6 percent. (Wisconsin’s rate is down from the recession’s 9.2 percent peak in 2009). And, notably, rates in larger municipalities and counties have been on a roller coaster in 2013, rising in some months, falling in others, state data shows. In May, for example, 24 of the 32 largest municipalities saw a rate decrease, as did all counties but two. So the claim of an unemployment rate ""on the rise"" is true only if we’re talking about a one-month trend. Finally, what about the part of the claim that Ryan favors ""immigration increases?"" Ryan has told interviewers that fixing the legal immigration system now could help solve future labor shortages. ""Not now, but in the future we're going to have labor shortages,"" Ryan said on The Laura Ingraham Show, June 19, 2013. ""We have 10,000 people retiring each and every day in America when the Baby Boomers retire. We are not like Europe, we're not like Japan in that our birthrates are really low, but they're not high enough. Immigration, in a decade or so, can help us."" Our rating FAIR says ""unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin"" as Ryan stepped up advocacy of ""immigration increases."" The group chose its words pretty carefully, clearly focusing on Ryan’s recent actions and the corresponding -- and overwhelmingly negative -- unemployment trend in most major municipalities and many counties in the most recent month. And it’s true Ryan is endorsing ""immigration increases."" But saying the rate ""has been on the rise"" suggests more than a one-month trend -- and there is no such trend in recent months. And for that one month, statewide unemployment in June fell, not rose, undercutting FAIR’s statement. There’s an element of truth here, but some critical facts create a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/aug/09/federation-american-immigration-reform/group-says-wisconsin-jobless-rate-was-rise-while-p/
