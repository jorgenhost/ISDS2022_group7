Rick Perry says only three in 10 Texas physicians accept new Medicaid patients
","
Saying Medicaid is a broken system that should not be expanded in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry and the state’s U.S. senators suggested many physicians decline to serve patients insured by the state-federal program. 
In an April 1, 2013, press release issued in conjunction with their joint Texas Capitol press conference, Perry and Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, all Republicans, said that nationally, Medicaid expenditures surged from 1990 to 2010, outpacing its caseload. 
Also, their press release said: ""Only three in 10 Texas doctors are currently accepting new Medicaid patients."" Elaborating in the press conference, Perry said: ""And we fear that number may actually decrease if expansion went through."" 
The 3-in-10 claim, brought to our attention by analyst Anne Dunkelberg of Austin’s liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, sounded familiar, especially after spokespeople for Perry and each senator said by email that it was based on a 2012 survey of Texas physicians by the Texas Medical Association. 
Preliminary results from the survey figured into one of our fact checks earlier this year. 
Final survey results are now compiled, Donna Kinney, the association’s lead researcher, told us by phone. Kinney said the results break out to 32 percent of Texas physicians saying they accept all new Medicaid patients and 42 percent declining all new Medicaid patients--with 26 percent limiting their new Medicaid patients. 
Put another way, the final results indicate that about four in 10 Texas physicians decline all new Medicaid patients while about six in 10 accept at least some new patients. ""They may accept them only in the emergency room,"" Kinney speculated. ""The limits could be anything."" 
Early this year, we rated as Mostly True the association’s claim that only 31 percent of Texas physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, compared with 67 percent in 2000. The group’s Twitter post about the figure was missing clarification that the figure came from a survey. 
At the time, though, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission told us that some 67 percent of the state’s physicians had accepted Medicaid at least once during a recent 12-month period. Agency spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us by email that 34,290 Texas physicians had claims paid by Medicaid in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. According to the Texas Medical Board, there were nearly 51,000 practicing physicians in the state at about that time. 
    
Goodman said then that she did not have information on the share of physicians not accepting all new Medicaid patients. 
    
Brent Annear, a medical association spokesman, guided us to a March 2012 web post by the group stating that 27,917 physicians and medical residents were asked to fill out its online survey and the group fielded 1,139 responses, a 4 percent response rate. The group’s ""preliminary findings"" document says the respondents were a ""representative sample"" of all physicians. The survey reached members and non-members, Kinney told us by email. 
        
The key question lists physician reimbursement methods including private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. ""For patients covered by the following payers,"" the question says, ""does your practice currently (1) accept all new patients, (2) limit new patients that you will accept, or (3) accept no new patients?"" 
According to the final results, Kinney said, 32 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients. Some 26 percent said they limit their new Medicaid patients, and 42 percent said they decline all new Medicaid patients, compared with 32 percent in 2010. 
For our previous check, Annear said by email that physicians have difficulties with Medicaid’s rates and bureaucratic hurdles that delay payments. The rates decreased four times from 2000 to 2011, an association spokeswoman, Pam Udall, said by email, though the state also agreed to a 25-percent boost in funds covering certain physician services provided to children on Medicaid, as part of resolving a lawsuit. 
    
We asked Kinney to speculate on why nearly 70 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim in a recent year. She said about 60 percent of the state’s physicians--including many specialists in radiology, pathology and anesthesiology--must accept Medicaid to maintain their hospital admitting privileges. Those kinds of doctors would have responded to the survey by saying they limit new Medicaid patients, she said by phone. 
        
For a ""real-world"" take, we ran the preliminary survey result by Austin opthalmologist Michelle Berger, the 2013 president of the Travis County Medical Society, which is affiliated with the medical association. 
    
Berger said by phone that the society frequently fields inquiries from individuals newly on Medicaid seeking a doctor. Berger said she stopped accepting new Medicaid patients in her practice because related paperwork proved onerous and government payments, which have not kept up with inflation, were not quickly forthcoming. Then again, she said, doctors who do not accept new Medicaid patients may still provide charity care--the result being that some low-income patients are served even though their doctors do not seek payment. 
Asked to appraise the Texas leaders’ declaration--that only three in 10 physicians accept new Medicaid patients--Kinney said: ""The language does matter. They should have said ‘all’"" new patients. 
In emails, Perry spokesman Josh Havens and Cornyn spokeswoman Jessica Sandlin each said the leaders’ statement accurately reflected the association survey. Havens added that ""you cannot continue to add context to manipulate the result you want."" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, also standing by the claim, said by email that the point is that Medicaid is a broken system. 
Our ruling 
Perry said only three in 10 Texas doctors currently accept new Medicaid patients. 
  
In a recent year, some 67 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim. 
More recently, 42 percent of the state’s physicians responding to a 2012 survey said they refuse all new Medicaid patients. Then again, 32 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients and 26 percent said they limit such patients--signaling that 58 percent of physicians accept at least some new Medicaid patients. 
By not specifying that the cited ""three in 10"" reflects only doctors who accept all new Medicaid patients, Perry’s statement falls off target by nearly 30 percent. Still, it has en element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B9B00>],/factchecks/2013/apr/01/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-only-three-10-texas-physicians-acc/

Email from 'a Florida teacher' says Dominican student takes free school aid before returning home
","
Did you hear the one about foreign students ripping off the U.S. by getting federal grants to go to college and then ditching our country to return home? 
The chain email from ""a Florida teacher"" arrived in our inbox March 28, 2013. It reads: 
""This is a subject close to my heart. Do you know that we have adult students at the school where I teach who are NOT U.S. Citizens and who get the PELL Grant, which is a federal grant (no payback required) plus other federal grants to go to school?

""One student from the Dominican Republic told me that she didn't want me to find a job for her after she finished my program, because she was getting housing from our housing department and she was getting a PELL Grant which paid for her total tuition and books, plus money left over."" 
The email also stated that this Dominican student accessed other special programs that supplied her with a credit card for gas and another to pay for daycare. The email continued:

""The one student I just mentioned told me she was not going to be a U.S. citizen because she plans to return to the Dominican Republic someday and that she 'loves HER country.’ I asked her if she felt guilty taking what the U.S. is giving her and then not even bothering to become a citizen and she told me that it doesn't bother her, because that is what the money is there for!"" 
  
We wanted to research if a noncitizen can get a Pell Grant to go to college with no intention of becoming a citizen and then simply return to their home country. As we soon discovered, this chain email has had a long life -- it was debunked in fact-checks by Snopes.com and Factcheck.org in 2008. 
Pell Grants 
Pell Grants are federal awards to low-income students for post-secondary education. The grants are for students to obtain bachelor's degrees or certain postbaccalaureate programs that lead to teacher certification. 
The grant does not have to be repaid, and the maximum amount for this year is $5,550. 
Citizens can get the grants. Also, students who are permanent residents -- commonly referred to as those who have a ""green card"" -- are considered eligible noncitizens and can get student aid if they meet eligibility criteria, said Jane Glickman, a U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman. We couldn’t find statistics on how many of the 9.7 million Pell Grant recipients are green-card holders, but Glickman said the vast majority are citizens. 
The chain email also claimed that the Pell Grant would pay for ""total tuition and books, plus money left over."" 
  
It appears highly unlikely our Dominican student would be profiting from the Pell Grant, since the average price of a four-year college education is far above the grant. (PolitiFact’s 2011 analysis showed it covered about 34 percent of public college costs.) 
The email also suggested that this Dominican student is seeking a free ride from the United States and giving nothing in return. Legal permanent residents who get Pell Grants can choose to return to their country, however, the majority eventually apply for citizenship. And they do pay taxes. 
Other programs mentioned in the email 
The chain email claimed that the Dominican student was accessing two other programs, called WAIT and CARIBE, to help pay for expenses: ""She was looking into WAIT which gives students a CREDIT CARD for gas to come to school, and into CARIBE which is a special program (check it out - I did) for immigrants, and it pays for child care and all sorts of needs while they go to school or training."" 
C.A.R.I.B.E. – Career Recruitment And Instruction In Basic English Refugee Program -- is a federally funded adult education program in Hillsborough County Public Schools. The program’s website explains that it ""provides English language, GED, and Hi-Tec vocational training to recent Cuban, Haitian, and other entrants with legal, documented refugee or asylee status."" (The website puts those two words in bold.) 
Program manager Estela Weideman told PolitiFact that CARIBE does not provide child care but will refer students to other programs that provide vouchers for child care if they qualify. 
""All we provide are English classes to the adults, and only those that qualify,"" Weideman said. 
The criteria is very specific -- participants must be refugees or asylum seekers, which typically means people fleeing oppressive regimes or war conditions. 
(In 2008, the director of this Hillsborough County program told Factcheck that he had received more than 600 emails about the chain letter and had received calls around the country, including from congressional offices.) 
Several other counties in Florida have similar adult education programs for refugees including in Miami-Dade County. 
It’s unlikely that this alleged Dominican student would qualify for Hillsborough’s program, though. 
State Department refugee admission statistics for 2012 do not show any refugees from the Dominican Republic. We also found no Dominicans were U.S. refugees from 2002 to 2011. The picture was more complex for those seeking asylum -- one category referred to as seeking asylum ""defensively"" as part of a removal hearing included tiny numbers from the Dominican Republican -- eight in 2011, for example. 
We couldn’t find anything on the other program mentioned in the email -- WAIT -- that would supposedly provide students with gas to go to school. This program doesn’t appear to exist.   
Our ruling 
The chain email paints a picture of free-loading foreigners, college students ""who are NOT U.S. citizens and who get the PELL Grant,"" then return to their home countries after getting free gas cards and child care. 
While green card residents can get Pell Grants, those people are generally legal permanent residents -- not people looking to return to their own countries. 
And there’s no free gas cards or child care. 
We rate the chain email’s claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280976EE880>],/factchecks/2013/apr/01/chain-email/email-florida-teacher-says-dominican-student/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Bill Seitz']","
State Sen. Bill Seitz says the current and former secretaries of state have supported controversial provision in election bill
","
Legislation signed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich on March 22 has infuriated Democrats and advocacy groups who say it will make it harder for voters to repeal laws and introduce their own. 
Senate Bill 47, sponsored by Sen. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, sets strict rules on the time organizers have to collect signatures when mounting a petition drive to strike down laws. The bill, which passed swiftly through the legislature, will essentially cut at least two weeks from the existing timetable. 
  
Part of SB 47, which Seitz affectionately calls the ""Stop in the Name of Love Provision,"" would prohibit organizers from collecting signatures while the secretary of state verifies submitted petitions. 
Under current law, organizers have 90 days to collect signatures before submitting the petition to the secretary of state. Organizers now can collect signatures to bolster their petition while the secretary of state reviews the initial petition, which has taken between 16 and 58 days. SB 47 will put a stop to that. 
Seitz says his bill would prevent potential malevolence by secretaries of state who could game the system in their favor -- quickly verifying a petition they hope will fail, or slow-walking a petition they hope will succeed. 
The Republican senator’s efforts riled the liberal side of the aisle and advocacy groups like the League of Women Voters of Ohio, We Are Ohio and the Ohio Fair Elections Network, which fear SB 47 would infringe on the constitutional right to initiative and referendum Ohioans granted themselves more than a century ago. 
The senator brushed off the opposition on March 13 during his sponsor testimony before the House Policy and Legislative Oversight Committee, saying his bill had major bipartisan allies: Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted and his Democratic predecessor Jennifer Brunner. 
""The current secretary of state supports this provision, and the previous secretary of state supported this provision,"" Seitz said. 
PolitiFact Ohio decided to get to the bottom of it. A call to Husted quickly propelled the Truth-O-Meter in a positive direction. 
""Sen. Seitz is on the right path,"" Husted said. ""There is certainly the potential for the secretary of state to slow down or speed up the process. The lack of guidance in the revised code certainly allows for that to happen."" 
Proponents of the bill have not been able to cite an instance in which the secretary of state has taken advantage of the current system. But Husted’s support of the ""Stop in the Name of Love Provision"" is clearly bubbled in. 
Brunner, on the other hand, said she is no such booster. 
The former secretary of state testified against SB 47 on March 19 during a House committee meeting in which she told legislators ""If you pass this lickety-split, it’s going to make you look very bad."" 
Brunner, who served as Ohio’s secretary of state from from 2007 to 2011, said Seitz misled the House committee when citing her as an advocate of the contentious provision. 
""No, I don’t support it,"" Brunner said in an interview with PolitiFact Ohio. 
However, Brunner’s explanation as to why she may have been lassoed into the SB 47 debate fogs the Truth-O-Meter glass. 
Brunner had worked with Seitz in 2010 on a now-abandoned compromise bill that would have made numerous changes to election laws. Seitz said those talks birthed the ""Stop in the Name of Love Provision."" 
  
The bill aimed to set the same restrictions as SB 47 on the number of days voters could use to collect signatures for a referendum. The language in SB 47 is cut from the same cloth as the 2010 bill, with a difference: SB 47 speaks to referendums and initiatives, whereas the old bill only addressed referendums. 
Seitz said Brunner approved the referendum measure in 2010. Brunner doesn’t deny that, although she has a different view now. 
""I had agreed to it two-and-a-half years ago,"" Brunner said. ""I think I should not have agreed to it because it limits what is granted in the Constitution."" 
So, let’s account for the facts. 
Seitz said Husted supports the controversial SB 47 provision, which is accurate. Seitz also said Brunner supported it --  the past tense being paramount --  which is partially correct. 
The old provision didn’t include language about initiative petitions addressed in SB 47. In addition, the senator failed to fully explain Brunner’s past endorsement of petition restrictions,  and might have left the impression that she was a current supporter of the provision. 
We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3F1300>],/factchecks/2013/apr/01/bill-seitz/says-secretary-state-jon-husted-and-former-secreta/

Joe Barton says domestic greenhouse gas emissions at 20-year low
","As President Barack Obama brought up his interest in addressing global warming, a Texas congressman said U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, widely believed to be fueling climate change, are on the decline.   ""DID YOU KNOW?"" Rep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington, wrote on Twitter during Obama’s Feb. 12, 2013, State of the Union address. ""U.S. GHG emissions are at 20-year lows while global emissions are rising.""     Global emissions have been on the upswing. The Environmental Protection Agency says on a web page that global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels ""increased by over 16 times between 1900 and 2008 and by about 1.5 times between 1990 and 2008."" Separately, the government’s Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center contributed to a December 2012 ""discussion paper"" stating that in 2011, estimated global carbon dioxide emissions due to burning fossil fuels and making cement were up 3 percent from 2010.     We checked on Barton’s claim that domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.     By email, Barton spokesman Sean Brown pointed out an August 2012 web post by the U.S. Energy Information Administration stating that estimated U.S. carbon dioxide emissions resulting from energy use during the first three months of 2012 ""were the lowest in two decades for any January-March period."" Brown also noted the Environmental Protection Agency saying in an online chart that as of 2010, concentrations of five common air pollutants--carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide--had decreased from 30 years earlier.     This information did not speak to all greenhouse gases, as Barton had, but carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.     Perry Lindstrom, an economist with the Energy Information Administration, emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that the nation’s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were estimated at 1,339 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1992 and at a slightly higher amount, 1,344 million metric tons, for the comparable months of 2012. In the intervening years, first-quarter emissions topped out at 1,580 million metric tons in 2004 and bottomed out at 1,364 million metric tons in 1993, according to the spreadsheet.     Then again, the first quarter of 2012 was unusual, the agency said in its post. ""Normally,"" the agency wrote, carbon dioxide ""emissions during the year are highest in the first quarter because of strong demand for heat produced by fossil fuels."" But such emissions were lower at the start of 2012 thanks to a mild winter, which reduced heating demand and energy use, the agency said, with other factors including a decline in coal-fired electricity generation, due largely to low natural gas prices, and reduced gasoline demand.     Still, the 2012 first-quarter emissions were lower than they had been in the first part of the year in 19 years. However, Lindstrom said by telephone, he would hesitate to reach conclusions solely by comparing emissions in part of a year to emissions in part of another year in contrast to looking, say, decade to decade. At our request, he provided a spreadsheet comparing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the 10 months through October 2012 to such emissions over the comparable part of each previous year over two decades. Our thinking was that this would deliver a longer view based on the latest information available when Barton tweeted. And according to this spreadsheet, the estimated emissions from January through October 2012, 4,386 metric tons, were the lowest 10-month total since 1995--17 years earlier--when such emissions totaled 4,385 metric tons.     Going forward, Lindstrom pointed out, his agency projects U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to remain below 2005 levels through 2040. Jim Butler, director of global monitoring at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Earth System Research Laboratory, said by phone that such levelling out makes sense due to improvements in energy efficiency and shifts to fuel sources with less of a carbon footprint than coal.     Mindful that Barton’s tweet said greenhouse gas emissions were at a 20-year low, we looked next at emissions of methane, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as estimated in the Environmental Protection Agency’s April 2012 inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions--the latest inventory that would have been available when Barton tweeted. (The agency’s 2013 ""draft inventory"" was posted online Feb. 22, 2013.)     The 2012 inventory indicates that total emissions of three gases were higher in 2010 than 1990, while emissions of four others were lower.     In keeping with Barton’s 20-year window, we used the inventory figures to gauge the difference between estimated emissions of each greenhouse gas in 2010 and 1990:     --Carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 were 12 percent greater than in 1990;   --Methane emissions were lower by 0.3 percent; --Nitrous oxide emissions were lower by 3 percent; --Hydrofluorocarbon emissions were higher by more than 200 percent; --Perfluorocarbons were lower by 73 percent; --Sulfur hexafluoride emissions were lower by 57 percent.   Taking all the greenhouse gases into account, according to the inventory, overall emissions were 11 percent higher in 2010 than 1990--and also up 3 percent from 2009, when total emissions dipped considerably during the national recession. Aside from 2009, the previous year with lower greenhouse gas emissions than 2010 was 1997, according to the inventory.     Our ruling     The congressman said domestic greenhouse gas emissions are at a 20-year low.     This statement depends on a comparison of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions—not all greenhouse gases--over three unusually warm winter months of 2012 to such emissions in the same months of 1992. But the latest information available when Barton tweeted indicates that total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were higher in 2010 than they were 20 years earlier, though the 2010 emissions were lower than they were 13 years earlier.     We rate this claim Mostly False.     CORRECTION, 10:42 a.m. April 8, 2013: Thanks to a reader's nudge, this story was amended to say that the discussed levels of carbon dioxide were in millions of metric tons, not metric tons alone. This did not affect our original rating of the claim.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A58700>],/factchecks/2013/apr/01/joe-barton/joe-barton-says-domestic-greenhouse-gas-emissions-/
"['Georgia', 'City Government', 'Transparency', 'William Perry']","
Watchdog says Reed didn't talk to public about stadium
","
The Falcons are thisclose to having a clear path for a new stadium built in downtown Atlanta. 
The team and city officials reached agreement on a deal for the almost $1 billion stadium a few weeks ago. Already, the Georgia World Congress Center Authority (which will own the stadium) and the Atlanta City Council have OK’d the deal, which includes using $200 million in city hotel-motel taxes toward construction costs and potentially several times that amount toward financing, maintaining and operating the stadium through 2050. 
All that’s left is approval from Invest Atlanta, the city’s development authority. 
In the meantime, ethics watchdog William Perry criticized Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed for rushing the deal, and not allowing enough time for public input. 
""Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed was quoted in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as saying Atlanta would have a ‘big public conversation.’"" We would get an information blitz, he said. But the mayor held not one conversation with the public,"" said Perry, executive director of government watchdog group Common Cause Georgia. 
Not one? PolitiFact Georgia has examined several other claims about the stadium deal, including some that were made during meetings about the project. We decided to walk backward through time and examine the weeks leading up to the stadium deal announcement. 
Perry’s statement appeared last month in an opinion piece for Creative Loafing Atlanta two days after the Atlanta City Council approved the stadium funding plan. 
A Feb. 8 AJC article  quoted Reed as promising ""a big public conversation"" about the new stadium. ""We’re going to give the public every piece of data that we can possibly give them. Everything is going to be known,"" the mayor went on to say. ""Questions are going to be answered in public and on television."" 
The City Council vote came late on a Monday evening after hours of debate between council members. The meeting was public and televised. Reed attended that council session and spoke to the body about the project. 
But his attendance there -- nor at any other council meeting -- doesn’t qualify as the mayor holding a public conversation on the issue, Perry told PolitiFact Georgia. The Atlanta City Council held several public meetings or work sessions convened by either the chairwoman of the finance executive committee or the council president, Perry said. But none of them were initiated by Reed or his office. 
We checked with the City Council, and Felicia Moore, who heads the committee that handled the stadium deal, sent us a list of all seven council meetings involving the project. According to Moore’s list, the first meeting was held Feb. 13, and it ended with a committee work session on March 21, three days after the full council approved the deal. The mayor or a representative from his office attended each of the meetings, according to Moore’s notes. The meetings were open to the public, but visitors were only allowed to speak at some of the meetings. ""The mayor’s office did not schedule any of those meetings,"" Moore told PolitiFact Georgia. She was one of four council members who opposed the final funding plan. Moore told her council colleagues that they needed to take time to further vet the deal that will impact the city for at least the next 50 years. 
Once a proposal was crafted, and before the council and other groups voted, Perry thought there would be public meetings held so people could read through the document and give testimony, he said. ""The bottom line is if you’re trying to ramrod something through, the way to do that is to have less public conversation about it. I don’t feel like he lived up to the promise of an information blitz."" 
We took Perry’s claim to Reed’s office, and his spokeswoman, Sonji Jacobs, blitzed us with information contradicting the watchdog leader. She called Perry’s claim ""blatantly false and misleading."" 
Jacobs’ three-page report to PolitiFact Georgia detailed the same council meetings that were on Moore’s list, along with meetings held by the GWCCA and Invest Atlanta, of which Reed is the chairman. The meetings were open to the public, and some were broadcast on the city’s cable television station and city website. (Perry says he sent a letter to Reed in February requesting a public forum. He did not receive a response, and was initially reassured by the mayor’s promise of an information blitz.) 
The meetings were not initiated by Reed’s office. Jacobs said that’s not the way things work with Atlanta’s city governance. 
""The mayor’s office doesn’t organize meetings. We conduct our meetings in concert with council, which enables us to engage the council and the public in a more efficient manner,"" Jacobs said. Holding a duplicate set of meetings hosted by the mayor would be wasteful and inefficient, Jacobs said. 
That process holds true with not only the City Council, but also community groups, and city entities like the GWCCA. The mayor or one of his senior staff attends those meetings, presents information and answers questions of the public or other officials, as has happened during annual budget deliberations, for example. One of the few occasions that Reed has initiated a public meeting was a town hall meeting in 2010 introducing the three police chief candidates to the public. 
With the new stadium project, no one, or no group, asked Reed’s office to hold a town hall meeting, Jacobs said. 
Reed and Perry have gotten into verbal fisticuffs before. PolitiFact Georgia examined a claim last January by Perry that Atlanta had established a convoluted process for awarding airport concession contracts. Earlier that same month, we checked a claim by Reed that some Common Cause Georgia members had accepted maximum campaign contributions even though the group criticized the contributions given to Reed by airport vendors. 
We checked with political science professors, and the issue falls into a gray area. 
Typically mayors don’t hold public hearings, they are usually done in conjunction with the legislative body (city council) or other department or agency, said Michael Rich, assistant professor of political science at Emory University. But there are other methods of communicating with the public other than town hall meetings and forums, such as establishing a website for comments and soliciting written comments. And in instances involving highly controversial issues, Rich said, mayors have sometimes initiated the public meetings. 
So, does Perry score a touchdown -- or at least a field goal -- with his claim that Mayor Reed did not hold one conversation with the public leading up to the new Falcons stadium deal? 
Hard to say. 
There were meetings held, most of the meetings were open to the public and many were televised and streamed on the city’s website. Reed used the collective ""we"" in describing the information blitz that would be provided on the stadium plan. 
It is typically the legislative branch of government that initiates public meetings -- in this case the Atlanta City Council -- and not the executive branch, or mayor’s office. The mayor or at least one of his senior staff did attend stadium meetings held by the City Council and other city entities. 
But the mayor did not initiate any of those meetings. And Reed did not host any town hall meetings in the communities that will be impacted most by the stadium. 
Perry has a point -- Reed could have done a lot more to engage the public in person. But Perry’s  statement needs a lot of context to be fully understood. 
We rated Perry’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B39880>],/factchecks/2013/apr/01/william-perry/watchdog-says-reed-didnt-talk-public-about-stadium/

Pete Snyder says Medicaid causes higher risk of surgery death
","
Expanding Medicaid in Virginia would imperil the lives of low-income people who have surgery, according to Pete Snyder, a Northern Virginia businessman who is seeking the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. 
""As it stands, Medicaid’s immense price includes a very real and tragic human cost: all too often it actually harms the very people it is meant to help,"" Snyder wrote in a March 6 article for Bearing Drift, a conservative blog. 
""But don’t take my word for it,"" he continued. ""A study by the University of Virginia pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality,’ or as one report summarizes, ‘surgical patients on Medicaid are 13 percent more likely to die than those with no insurance at all.’"" 
We were struck by the ramifications of Snyder’s claim. Under Obamacare, states are being encouraged to expand Medicaid, the government-run healthcare program for the poor and disabled. In return, Washington is offering to pay all the new costs at first, and 90 percent of the new tab in 2020 and thereafter. 
Expansion in Virginia, which is strongly opposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, would open Medicaid to an estimated 400,000 people. Across the nation, about 16 million would become eligible for Medicaid if every state accepted the Obamacare offer.  Almost all of these people are now uninsured -- making too little money to afford private health insurance but earning above the poverty levels that qualify for Medicaid. 
The U.Va. study is being cited by several conservatives -- including former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- as an argument against expansion. They say the study offers evidence that spreading Medicaid will spread bad health care results. 
Fact-checking Snyder’s statement requires two determinations: 1) Did the U.Va. study actually find that Medicaid recipients face a greater risk of surgery-related death than uninsured people and all other categories of patients and, if so; 2) Was the heightened risk caused by Medicaid? 
The U.Va. study, published in 2010, considered how surgical patients fared during their hospitalization based on whether they had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or were uninsured. The researchers looked at almost 900,000 major operations across the country and adjusted for many population and health care variables, including age, income, region, type of hospital, type of operation and other health factors. 
""Even after adjusting for all those things, the payer was still a predictor of poorer outcomes,"" Dr. Gorav Ailawadi, one of the authors of the paper, told us. 
The patients covered by Medicaid had the highest risk. They were 1.97 times more likely to die in the hospital than those with private insurance. Compared to the privately insured, Medicare recipients were 1.54 times more likely to die in the hospital and uninsured patients were 1.74 times more likely. 
With adjustments, Medicaid patients also had the longest hospital stays and greatest total costs. 
So Snyder is correct -- those covered by Medicaid did have an increased risk of mortality during their hospital stays. And he’s right that Medicaid recipients were 13 percent more likely to die in the hospital during or after surgery than uninsured patients. 
But researchers place little of the blame on Medicaid. 
They noted that Medicaid recipients are the poorest, sickest and least educated group of patients. They are the least likely group to seek preventive health care. As a result, they are more likely to enter hospitals in dire conditions that require emergency surgery. 
""Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders and psychoses,"" the study said. ""Furthermore, Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of metastatic cancer."" 
The researchers said that uninsured patients have similar characteristics to Medicaid recipients and that it is ""plausible"" that both groups may suffer from a ""system bias"" that limits their access to private hospitals and top physicians. 
""For many surgical patients, private insurance status often allows for referral to expert surgeons for their disease,"" the study said. ""Alternatively, Medicaid and uninsured patients may have been referred to less skilled and less specialized surgeons."" 
Does the research prove, as Snyder and other conservatives suggest, that it’s safer to be uninsured than on Medicaid? Ailawadi, co-author of the study, said it does not. 
Not all of the uninsured patients in the study were low-income people who would qualify for Medicaid if it is expanded. Thirty-one percent of them lived in zip codes where the average household income was greater than $45,000. Many of these people may have been uninsured by choice. ""The uninsured population in our study included a subgroup that may have had a high income,"" Ailawadi said. 
He added, ""I don’t think we’re able to say a government-sponsored system is beneficial or not."" 
Our ruling 
Snyder is opposed to expanding Medicaid. He said,  ""A study by the University of Virginia   pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality.’"" 
He’s partly right. A U.Va. study in 2010 did find that Medicaid recipients were more likely to die in the hospital during or after operations than all other surgery patients, including those who were uninsured. 
But he runs into trouble when he suggests that Medicaid is the cause of the high death rate. The authors of the report note that those who qualify for Medicaid are a high-risk group to begin with.

Sheila Oliver claims gun violence killed 269 people in New Jersey in 2011
","
More than 250 people in New Jersey died in 2011 because of a weapon, according to Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver. 
And it’s not just any weapon, either, she said in a Feb. 21 opinion piece that appeared in The Times Of Trenton. The column published the day the state Assembly voted on a 22-bill package of gun-control measures. 
""In 2011 alone, 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence,"" Oliver (D-Essex) wrote. 
Assembly Democrats spokeswoman Jennifer Scortino said Oliver’s statistic comes from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report for 2011. We verified its accuracy. 
New Jersey, however, didn’t have the highest number of deaths in 2011 resulting from gun violence. That title goes to California, at 1,220 murders. California was one of 12 states with a higher number of gun-related deaths in 2011 than New Jersey. 
Complete FBI data for 2012 is not yet available, but we also looked at the number of gun-violence deaths dating to 2005. 
The data shows that gun-violence deaths in New Jersey have fluctuated through the years. Prior to 2011, New Jersey had 246 gun-violence deaths in 2010; 220 in 2009; 236 in 2008; 260 in 2007; 289 in 2006; and 276 in 2005, according to annual UCR reports. 
Let’s review some background on how the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports works. More than 18,000 law enforcement agencies from across the country voluntarily report crime data to the FBI, which then compiles volume and rate of crime offenses for the nation, states and many cities and counties, according to FBI.gov. It also includes arrest, clearance and law enforcement employee data. 
But the FBI isn't the only agency that tracks data involving weapons. We also checked mortality data with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. 
For 2010, the latest data available, New Jersey had 456 deaths resulting from injuries caused by firearms, a spokesman said. Of that number, 246 incidents were assaults by unspecified firearms; 11 were assaults by rifles and larger firearms; 181 were suicides; and 18 were other categories involving firearms. 
Oliver noted in her column that the bills package was not a knee-jerk response to the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., but one that resulted after lengthy discussions about other mass shootings around the country as well as efforts to close loopholes in existing gun laws. 
""Our comprehensive package promotes common-sense measures without infringing on the Second Amendment rights enshrined in our Constitution,"" Oliver wrote. ""By keeping dangerous weapons off of our streets, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and addressing mental health issues and school security, we can stop these tragedies from becoming all too common."" 
Although the Assembly passed the bill, Republicans pointed to flaws in the bills package and accused Democrats of rushing the bills through to gain a political advantage with Gov. Chris Christie and the Legislature up for re-election this year. 
""This is simply a way for the Democrats to find a wedge issue in a year when they can’t find a wedge issue,"" Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said before the votes were taken. 
Our ruling 
Oliver said in a column that published the day the state Assembly voted on a package of gun-control bills that ""in 2011 alone, 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence."" 
The FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report for 2011 – the most up-to-date year of complete crime data – verifies that number. It’s worth noting, however, that 12 other states had more deaths attributed to gun violence than New Jersey that year. 
We rate Oliver’s statement True.

R.I. Education Commissioner Deborah Gist says 70-75 percent of CCRI students need to take remedial math
","
Controversy continues to rage over the requirement that Rhode Island high school students score highly enough on the New England Common Assessment Program test to receive a diploma. 
The latest testing data show that 40 percent of students failed to meet the minimum math standard and risk being unable to graduate if their skills don't improve. 
During the March 22 edition of Rhode Island Public Television's ""A Lively Experiment,"" state Education Commissioner Deborah Gist defended the requirement. 
Gist said that if you let students graduate without proficiency you're shortchanging them. 
""Anyone who's telling these students that . . . it doesn't matter that they're able to do math at a basic level when they leave high school is just wrong. And it's not fair to them because what's going to happen to them when they leave our high schools and they go to the community college where 70-75 percent of them have to pay to take remedial courses to get the exact same math that we're talking about?"" 
Seventy to seventy-five percent of Rhode Island high school graduates who go to community college have to take remedial courses in math? That struck us as a huge percentage, even for those graduates who wanted a higher education but might not have had the grades, test scores or money to get into a four-year school. So we decided to check the numbers. 
First stop: Gist's office, where spokesman Elliot Krieger told us that the data came from the Rhode Island Office of Higher Education. 
When we contacted that office, spokesman Michael Trainor sent us to the Community College of Rhode Island, where William LeBlanc, the school's director of institutional research and planning, gave us the data for students enrolled last fall who had graduated from high school -- 97 percent of them from Rhode Island -- within the previous year. 
CCRI uses a placement test called Accuplacer, developed by the same group responsible for the Scholastic Assessment Test for college-bound high school students, to identify students who need remedial work. 
Among those 2,250 recent high school graduates, just over 75 percent needed some type of remedial course, whether it was math, English or writing, LeBlanc said. ""That's the highest we've had in awhile."" The rate usually ranges from 70-75 percent. He said that's not unusual for a community college. 
The biggest need was usually for remedial math -- 65.7 didn't pass the math requirement. They had to take Fundamentals of Math -- which deals with basic arithmetic, percentages and working with fractions -- or high school algebra. 
In addition, 47 percent had to take remedial reading and 36 percent of the recent high school graduates were required to take remedial writing, LeBlanc said. 
Our ruling 
Education Commissioner Deborah Gist said, ""When [students] leave our high schools and they go to the community college . . . 70-75 percent of them have to pay to take remedial [math] courses."" 
The actual rate this past fall at CCRI was 65.7 percent. It's not in the range cited by Gist, but it's close enough to earn her a Mostly True.

Fallone campaign says Roggensack flip-flopped on recusals
","
Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack has come under major attack from opponent Ed Fallone for supporting a rule that says getting a campaign contribution from a litigant is not enough by itself to force a judge to step down from a case. 
Late in her re-election campaign, Roggensack for the first time said she would recuse herself anytime she received a $10,000 donation, and would consider doing so at a $1,000 threshold. 
Fallone’s campaign cried flip-flop. 
This is another case for our Flip-O-Meter, which we use to measure whether a political figure has changed positions. It’s not a measure of whether any change is good politics or good policy, just whether the person has been consistent. 
The relevant history dates to 2008, when the high court revised its ethics rules after two campaigns that saw heavy spending by special-interest groups in Supreme Court races. 
Roggensack complained of efforts to remove judges from cases and manipulate the outcome by making contributions in order to affect who could hear a case. The Wisconsin Realtors Association asked the court to establish a rule that a contribution or endorsement by itself is not enough to require recusal. 
Others took a different approach. The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin asked the court to require judges to step aside in cases involving a party or an attorney who spent $1,000 or more on their election campaign. 
In a 4-3 decision in 2009 supported by Roggensack, the court decided endorsements, campaign contributions and independently run ads in themselves are not enough to force a judge off of a case. The judicial ethics code still requires recusal if the judge has personal bias toward a litigant, has business ties to lawyers in a case, has a financial stake in the outcome, a relative is involved or the judge has taken a public position on the issue. 
Of course, the rule did not preclude judges from voluntarily removing themselves over a donation. But Fallone complained that it would discourage litigants from making recusal motions when they are concerned about the potential effect of a donation by the other side. 
Let’s look at what Roggensack said about the rule. 
""It will send a message that making lawful contributions is not a dishonorable thing to do, and it's not a dishonorable thing to receive,"" Roggensack told reporters in 2009. 
In a 2009 op-ed piece, she wrote: ""If a person made a lawful campaign contribution and that caused the justice to be disqualified from deciding legal issues presented to the court, all of the other voters who chose that justice because they believed he or she was fair, independent and knowledgeable about the law would have their votes cancelled because of the justice's disqualification."" 
The U.S. Constitution, Roggensack wrote in 2010, protected donations. 
""Money spent to communicate during an election has long been held to be an element of speech, and therefore such expenditures are protected by the First Amendment as well."" 
Jump ahead to 2013. 
That’s when Fallone, a first-time candidate backed by many unions and liberal groups, portrayed Roggensack as having an ethics problem. He characterized the effect of the rule she supported as encouraging ""legalized bribery."" 
When Fallone again pressed the issue during a March 8, 2013, debate on Wisconsin Public Television, Roggensack surprised the Fallone camp. 
Asked by ""Here and Now"" moderator Frederica Freyberg how the candidates would show their freedom from the influence of campaign cash, Roggensack said: ""I won’t participate if the contribution is above what I think is something that might give the public pause. You know there’s a $10,000 limit on contributions from individuals, and about $8,625 from a PAC, so my thoughts are much below that."" 
She brought up as a possible ""good benchmark"" some limits she seemed to suggest Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson has used in the past -- $1,000 in individual donations and $8,625 from political action committees. 
(Abrahamson told us through a spokeswoman that she has never based recusal decisions solely on the size of the campaign contribution. Her practice has been to take no donations from parties with cases currently before the court or pending in the court -- and to return any donations received from such parties. For donations from lawyers, she assesses each one individually, weighing a variety of factors, we were told.) 
Roggensack went further March 27, 2010, on WUWM public radio’s ""Lake Effect"" show. 
Asked by host Mitch Teich if  ""there is a threshhold for you on what point there is a conflict of interest,"" Roggensack said: ""Certainly if somebody contributed $10,000 to my campaign, which is lawful, I would not sit on that case."" 
She added: ""So, we’re looking at each contribution that comes in, and you know, when the chief justice ran her campaign, she had contributions of $1,000 from many people, and she never got off a case because of a contribution. Perhaps that’s something to look at. But we are looking at all of that."" 
Indeed, the $10,000 threshold would apply to very few, if any, donations; it is the maximum individual donation allowed by law. If Roggensack were to adopt a $1,000 test, it would apply to many more contributions. Fallone has not specified what his personal threshold would be. 
We asked Roggensack campaign adviser Brandon Scholz if the justice had ever before set a donation threshold for automatically recusing herself. 
No, he said, and added she has not recused herself in her 10 years on the high court based on the size of a donation. 
But doing something for the first time does not a necessarily mean a flip-flop. 
We know Roggensack, in supporting the rule, rejected an alternative that would have set $1,000 as a recusal threshold. And now Roggensack suggests she’s considering that same threshold for herself. 
But there’s a crucial distinction: Roggensack is acting on her own in deciding when to recuse herself, while the League of Women Voters proposal she rejected would have required justices to get off a case. 
She was for judges deciding on their own, and she’s still for judges deciding on their own. 
We couldn’t find evidence that Roggensack ever said, prior to the 2013 campaign, that she would or would not set a personal threshold. 
Even League of Women Voters Wisconsin executive director Andrea Kaminski told us, ""I don’t see that she is straying from anything she said before."" 
So while there may be some irony here, and a political card well played by Roggensack, we don’t see a substantial change in position. 
That’s our official definition of a No Flip.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979DD8C0>],/factchecks/2013/mar/29/patience-roggensack/fallone-campaign-says-roggensack-flip-flopped-recu/

Roggensack says Fallone changed positions on recusal
","
In a campaign with few flash points, the March 22, 2013 exchange between Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack and challenger Ed Fallone qualified as a standout moment. 
At a debate organized by the State Bar of Wisconsin and We the People/Wisconsin, Fallone repeated his criticism of Roggensack for helping change a rule so that getting a campaign contribution from a litigant is not enough on its own to force a judge to step down from a case. 
Roggensack defended the rule change -- but also accused Fallone, a law professor at Marquette University, of changing his position from acceptance of the rule to aggressive criticism of it. 
""I do think his position is a bit different tonight,"" Roggensack said, comparing statements Fallone made in January to his criticism at the debate and in his TV ads. 
Time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to measure whether a political figure has changed positions. It’s not a measure of whether any change is good politics or good policy, just whether the person has been consistent. 
The rule in question was written after several years of intense election activity in Supreme Court races featuring big spending and fundraising by candidates and major TV ad buys by ideological interest groups for or against the candidates. 
In late 2008, the court began considering the standards for when a justice should recuse himself or herself from hearing a case. In 2009, on a 4-3 vote it decided endorsements, campaign contributions and independently run ads in themselves are not enough to force a judge off of a case. 
The judicial ethics code still requires recusal if the judge has personal bias toward a litigant, has business ties to lawyers in a case, has a financial stake in the outcome, a relative is involved or the judge has taken a public position on the issue. 
Roggensack defended the rule, saying it would block mischief by donors who later want to force a judge off a case. Judges, she noted, can still voluntarily remove themselves. Fallone says lawyers should be able to make a recusal motion solely because of concern over a campaign donation. 
Another important bit: Roggensack said in the 2013 campaign that the change was in line with the court’s earlier ruling in Donohoo v. Action Wisconsin. 
In that 2008 case, one side sought to have then-Justice Louis Butler removed from a case because Butler’s campaign had received a $300 donation from a lawyer for the other side, and was endorsed by another lawyer. 
The court ruled, with no dissenters, that neither the endorsements nor the contributions meant that Justice Butler was disqualified by law from participating in the case. 
Now let’s review Fallone’s public statements on recusal. 
In 2011, before his entry into the race, Fallone signed a petition to recall Gov. Scott Walker. 
When he decided to run, the move prompted some to say he would be precluded from hearing matters related to Walker or even state government in general. Fallone disagreed, saying that justices can engage in various forms of political activity without having to recuse themselves from a case. 
In a blog post, he touched on campaign contributions. 
""If the judge has received something of value from a party or an attorney, then they should recuse themselves because they are presumed to be in that person’s debt."" He added: ""However, campaign contributions received by a judge from a party or their lawyer don’t count as something of value unless the contributions are disproportionately large."" 
So, that’s our starting position. 
Fallone entered the race in December 2012 and started actively campaigning in January 2013. When he did, he criticized the court and said people have ""lost faith that it is independent of politics and special interests."" 
His comments on recusal in general were cautious; Fallone warned that ""there’s been a lot of gamesmanship"" in trying to force justices off of cases for their political ties -- something that echoed the point Roggensack made when the rule took effect.. 
Roggensack points to a Fallone interview taped early in his campaign by Wisconsin Eye as evidence of a Fallone flip flop. 
In that January 16, 2013 interview, Wisconsin Eye senior producer Steve Walters asked Fallone to speak about the ""debate over whether lawyers who contribute should force a justice off the case."" 
Here is the exchange: 
Fallone: ""The court has considered that issue. And the current rule is that the justices need not recuse themselves because they’ve been endorsed by a particular person or organization, or received a contribution from that organization."" 
Walters: ""Is that a fair standard? Would you change it?"" 
Fallone: ""I’m not running for the court to change those standards. Were I running for the Legislature, were I still an academic full-time, I might speak out as to my preference, but right now, I think that the court has spoken, the rules are in place. It’s something that at some point the U.S. Supreme Court has said, notwithstanding the Wisconsin rule, that at some point contributions can create a perception of bias that may implicate due process concerns..."" 
End of comment. 
About three weeks later, just before the primary, Fallone directly discussed the Roggensack-supported rule at a candidate forum. Notably, that Feb. 7, 2013, appearance was the first time Fallone and Roggensack had debated. 
""That rule has opened the door for special interest spending on judicial elections, and it certainly creates the perception if not the reality that justice is for sale,"" Fallone said. ""That was a rule that was supported by Justice Roggensack, and after I’m elected to the court I will work with my colleagues to amend or repeal that rule."" 
Fallone said the rule change ""allows a party in a pending case to make campaign contributions to a judge sitting on the case and prevents the opposing parties from challenging the impartiality of the judge solely on the basis of those campaign contributions."" 
On Feb. 28, 2013, shortly after advancing past the primary, Fallone’s campaign issued a news release saying Fallone ""throughout his campaign"" has stated publicly he will work to overturn the rule. 
Turning his attention to defeating Roggensack, he dialed up the volume on his criticism and complaints about court partisanship. 
In a TV ad, he said Roggensack had ""risked the integrity of the court."" An on-screen graphic displayed the phrase, ""Legalized Bribery,"" citing a newspaper editorial about the rule. 
Back on Wisconsin Eye, this time on March 19, Walters asked about the ad’s accusations and Fallone’s objections to the rule. 
Fallone responded: ""This is the problem with campaign cash from special interest groups, flooding into our judicial races. The way to regulate it right now, as a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, the only way to get control on it is to allow it to become the basis of a recusal motion."" 
He added: ""If the party feels that the judge in their case might be biased or influenced because they’ve received campaign contributions … or independent spending on their behalf -- from the people on the other side of the case -- that party could ask the judge to step down. And that’s the way the law was, that’s the way the Supreme Court rules were, in Wisconsin. The ‘Roggensack rule’ was pushed, was a change that Justice Roggensack voted for, and defended very prominently..."" 
Stop the tape. 
That’s the chronology of what happened. Let’s take stock. 
Did Fallone take one position in mid-January and dramatically reverse himself just a few weeks later on his way toward making a big deal out of the recusal issue in March? 
He said no, at the March 22, 2013, debate, and in an interview with us. 
His explanation: He was referring in the January Wisconsin Eye interview to the Donohoo ruling, not the Roggensack-backed rule. 
This gets technical. 
The Donohoo ruling, in the case involving Justice Butler, was a test of whether justices would decide a fellow justice should not hear a case. Fallone thinks the court was correct to decide not to force a fellow justice to step aside, so he told us he spoke favorably about the status quo in the Wisconsin Eye interview. 
In contrast, Fallone said he objects to the rule Roggensack voted for because it goes much further than Donohoo by making it essentially futile for lawyers even to ask judges to step down voluntarily if the issue is just a campaign donation, even a large one. 
Fallone said his recollection was that Walters’ question in January on Wisconsin Eye was ""related to whether or not the justice … could make the determination of impartiality or whether the other justices could make that determination,"" he said at the March 22, 2013, forum after Roggensack accused him of flopping. 
However, the video shows Walters does not present the question that way. He does use the word ""force,"" though, which Fallone says made him think about the Donohoo case. 
Fallone’s other recollection about the January interview was that ""I did not speak to the issue of recusal based on campaign contributions by a party or lawyer in the case."" 
The Wisconsin Eye video, though, shows that Walters did in fact ask directly about campaign contributions by lawyers. 
Political strategy may have played a role in how he couched his answer. Fallone was cryptic when we talked to him about it, saying: ""there was one race before the primary and another one after."" 
In January, Vince Megna, the third candidate in the primary, was running a nakedly partisan race while Fallone was trying to portray himself as above the fray. 
Our rating 
At PolitiFact, we award a Full Flop when an official makes a ""major reversal of position"" that is a complete flip-flop. 
We don’t think that fits here. 
Fallone sharply criticized the rule both in both the primary election and in the general election, and he went after Roggensack on it the first chance he had in a face-to-face meeting. 
But did he partially change his position or make inconsistent statements, which would earn him a Half Flip? 
A plain reading of the Wisconsin Eye interview is that Fallone didn’t express a problem at all with the Supreme Court’s take on recusals. In response to a pretty general, and pretty clear, question, he offered a sweeping endorsement of the status quo, which includes the rule backed by Roggensack. 
So the answer is strikingly inconsistent with his rhetoric only a few weeks later. 
For that, we think this merits a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D00C0>],/factchecks/2013/mar/29/ed-fallone/roggensack-says-fallone-changed-positions-recusal/

Does $1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually go to cover PERS costs?
","
PolitiFact Oregon is no stranger to claims about just how much the Public Employees Retirement System drives state spending.

Not too long ago, we checked into Gov. John Kitzhaber’s claim that half of the $1,000 per student increase in spending in primary and secondary education in the next biennium was due to the retirement costs. (The statement was true.) So when fiscal conservative Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, made his own retirement system claim, our ears perked right up.

In a newsletter to constituents, Richardson noted that ""$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.""

The representative's source was a presentation by Jay Kenton, the Oregon University System’s vice chancellor for finance and administration.

Kenton had given a presentation on what drives the cost of higher education. Naturally, retirement and health care costs are a big piece of the equation.

Essentially what Kenton had done was to take the total retirement costs of employees -- both faculty and staff -- paid in part from tuition. He then prorated the total by actual percentage of it paid with tuition dollars.

After all that math, he found that the projected share of an individual student’s annual tuition going toward university staff retirement benefits for the 2012-13 year was $849. That’s actually about on par for what it was the previous year, too.

So how did Richardson get the $1,100 figure? Well, that’s where Kenton’s projections put the figure for the 2013-14 school year, should Kitzhaber’s proposed reforms not be enacted.

With the technical bits out of the way, we went back to Richardson’s statement. He said that ""$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS.""

He’s right, but only if the projections come to pass. In other words, we may get there, but we haven’t yet. As it is now, that figure is closer to $850. It’s still high, to be sure, but it’s about $250 less than the figure Richardson is using.

The ruling: Richardson’s statement reads as if we’ve been at the $1,100 mark for a while, when in truth we haven’t actually gotten there. If the Legislature passes significant reforms this year -- a big if -- we may never get there.

If we were writing a newsletter, we’d have gone with the most recent solid figure from the 2011-12 school year, which is about $850. Or, we would have made it clearer that the $1,100 was an extrapolation, a prediction. Richardson did neither.

Though his claim is accurate, it requires additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979DD640>],/factchecks/2013/mar/29/dennis-richardson/does-1100-tuition-paid-every-oregon-university-stu/

Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack says she has bipartisan support from sheriffs
","
Conventional wisdom holds that there is a 4-3 conservative majority among the seven justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. 
That would indicate the balance of power is at stake in the April 2, 2013, election. 
Justice Patience Roggensack, who is seeking a second 10-year term, is considered to be one of the conservatives on the high court. She faces Marquette University law professor Edward Fallone, who is supported by labor unions and Democratic elected officials. 
The race is officially nonpartisan. 
Roggensack has resisted the conservative label and contends her support comes from both sides of the political aisle. In particular, she has emphasized her endorsements from Wisconsin sheriffs. 
In a candidates forum on March 26, 2013, in Madison, Roggensack said: 
""I run nonpartisan. But (in) this race, I have tried very hard to have bipartisan support. I'm supported by 53 sheriffs throughout the state, Democrats and Republicans; district attorneys throughout the state, again, Democrats and Republicans. I have strong law enforcement support. The Wisconsin Professional Police Association has just endorsed me; again, Democrats and Republicans."" 
Roggensack made a similar statement several days earlier in an interview and has issued several news releases touting the endorsement from sheriffs. 
Given Roggensack’s reputation as a conservative, one would expect she has strong support from Republican sheriffs. But for her claim of bipartisan backing to be true, she’d also need to show significant support from Democratic sheriffs. 
Let’s see what there is. 
Roggensack lists the 53 sheriffs who have endorsed her on her campaign website. We ran our own check of the list, given that it doesn’t include party affiliations. We also consulted the 2011-2012 Wisconsin Blue Book. 
We did tallies in two ways: 
  
-- Of the 53 sheriffs listed as having endorsed Roggensack, 42 are Republican and 11 are Democrats. That’s a 79 percent to 21 percent Republican-Democrat split. 
  
The Republican sheriffs include Dan Trawicki of Waukesha County, Maury Straub of Ozaukee County and Dale Schmidt of Washington County. 
The Democratic sheriffs include David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, Sam Wollin of Adams County and David Kaminski of Rusk County, who is president of the Badger State Sheriffs’ Association. 
  
-- The 11 Democrats backing Roggensack make up 42 percent of the 26 sheriffs statewide who are Democrats, according to the Blue Book. 
  
Clarke is a conservative and frequent critic of policies favored by Democrats, but runs as a Democrat in a county that leans heavily in that direction. 
  
Fallone, meanwhile, lists two sheriffs among the officials who have endorsed him: Dave Mahoney of Dane County and Bob Spoden of Rock County. Both are Democrats. 
Our rating 
Roggensack said she has bipartisan support, including ""53 sheriffs throughout the state, Democrats and Republicans."" 
As expected, Roggensack has plenty of support from GOP sheriffs, but she has significant backing from Democratic sheriffs, as well.  A little more than one-fifth of the sheriffs backing her are Democrats and those Democrats make up more than 40 percent of all the Democratic sheriffs in the state.

"['Georgia', 'City Government', 'Sports', 'Cleta Winslow']","
Does councilwoman score on stadium longevity claim?
","
Some critics of the proposed $1 billion stadium in downtown Atlanta have raised questions about the idea. One question that keeps surfacing: ""What’s wrong with the Georgia Dome?"" 
Atlanta City Councilwoman Cleta Winslow tried to answer that question during a March 18 council meeting in which she voted in favor of the financial framework for a new stadium. The measure passed 11-4. 
The Georgia Dome may seem spry to some. But in stadium years, it’s pretty old, Winslow said. 
""It may be a young stadium, but in this city, there isn’t a stadium that’s lasted more than 27 years,"" she said. 
The Georgia Dome opened in 1992. 
We wondered how did Winslow’s math stack up when applied to other Atlanta sports facilities? 
Winslow later mentioned the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and the Omni Arena in her remarks during the council meeting. Her council district includes several southwest Atlanta neighborhoods near Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves. 
Twenty-three of the 30 stadiums currently used by National Football League teams are younger than the Georgia Dome. The New York Giants and Jets share use of MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Most of the older stadiums have been renovated. The San Francisco 49ers are moving into a new stadium under construction in Santa Clara, Calif. 
Now, back to Atlanta. Let’s begin with three venues that were built a century ago or more. 
The councilwoman was referring to professional sports facilities in the city, so she was not referring to venues such as Georgia Tech’s Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, which was built in 1913. The stadium’s most recent renovation was completed in 2003. 
A minor-league baseball team, the Atlanta Crackers, played at Ponce de Leon Park from 1907 to 1965. The stadium had a seating capacity of 20,000, making it one of the largest minor-league facilities in the country. The bleachers were segregated by race. Babe Ruth once hit a home run into dead center field (462 feet), where a giant magnolia tree stood. The park was torn down in 1966. The site is now a retail shopping center anchored by a Home Depot. That stadium was in use for 58 years and stood for 59. 
In 1909, the Atlanta Municipal Auditorium opened. It was used for cultural events, an armory, a soup kitchen during the Great Depression, speeches by Presidents Teddy and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Grateful Dead concerts. It was also used for some sports events. The giant ivory structure was the venue for wrestling matches in the 1950s. It was also the site of Muhammad Ali’s return to the fight game in 1970, after his boxing license was reinstated in Georgia. Ali scored a technical knockout over Jerry Quarry, who seemed to spill more blood than land punches in that bout. The building, located at what’s now Gilmer and Courtland streets in downtown Atlanta, was sold to Georgia State University in 1980 and is now its Alumni Hall. 
There are currently three pro sports franchises who play within the city limits, the Braves, Falcons and Hawks. 
The Omni Colesium was built in 1972 and was home to the Atlanta Hawks. It was also home to the National Hockey League’s Atlanta Flames from 1972 to 1980, before they moved to Calgary. In the mid- to late 1980s, Hawks home games were the hottest ticket in town as fans poured in to see star forward Dominique Wilkins, who was known as the Human Highlight Film for his acrobatic dunks and prolific scoring. The Omni became history in 1997, 25 years after it opened. Its eventual replacement, Philips Arena, opened in 1999. 
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium opened in 1965. It's original name was Atlanta Stadium. The Crackers played there that year. The Braves moved there in 1966. For years, it was home to the Braves and Falcons. Baseball fans -- who grew used to seeing home runs hit there by Hank Aaron and other Braves power hitters -- knew it as the Launching Pad. 
In 1997, the Braves moved across the street to Turner Field, which was initially built for track and field events for the 1996 Summer Olympics. After 32 years of service, the old Launching Pad was turned into a parking lot. 
Winslow said through a City Council spokesman that she made an error. 
To sum up, the councilwoman said there hasn’t been a stadium in Atlanta that’s lasted more than 27 years, referring to sports facilities used by professional teams. Most pro football stadiums are younger than the Georgia Dome. 
In Atlanta, Winslow was correct on the Omni but off by five years when you consider Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. 

On balance, we rate her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974BA880>],/factchecks/2013/mar/29/cleta-winslow/does-councilwoman-score-stadium-longevity-claim/

McCain's ultimate maverick move, denial
","During the 2008 presidential campaign, Republican nominee John McCain was so closely identified with the term ""maverick"" that it became a national punchline. On the Oct. 4, 2008, edition of Saturday Night Live, Tina Fey reprised her famed imitation of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, closing an opening skit spoofing the vice presidential debate with the line, ""Oh, and for those Joe Six-packs out there playing a drinking game at home: 'Maverick.' ""So it came as a surprise to us when McCain was quoted on Newsweek magazine's website on April 3, 2010, saying, ""I never considered myself a maverick. I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities.""Debunking this one wasn't a question of ""if"" but rather ""how can we avoid piling on?""We ignored cases in which Palin or other campaign surrogates used the term on McCain's behalf, sticking instead to instances when McCain himself used it, or when he blessed television advertisements using that term with the words, ""I approve this message."" (This message, by the way, is a requirement of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which McCain himself spearheaded.)Here are the instances we found:• ""A maverick, John McCain tackled campaign reform, military reform, spending reform. He took on presidents, partisans and popular opinion. He believes our world is dangerous, our economy in shambles. John McCain doesn`t always tell us what we hope to hear.

""Sometimes it’s meant as a compliment and sometimes it’s not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don’t work for a party. I don’t work for a special interest. I don’t work for myself. I work for you.”Meanwhile, in the prologue to the book that used ""maverick"" in the subtitle, McCain wrote, ""I'm 64 years old as we begin this book, which seems a bit old to be routinely described as a maverick. American popular culture admits few senior citizens to its ranks of celebrated nonconformists. We lack the glamorous carelessness of youth and risk becoming parodies of our younger selves. Witnessing the behavior can make people uncomfortable, like watching an aging, overweight Elvis mock the memory of the brash young man who had swaggered across cultural color lines.""That's not exactly an aggressive embrace of the term. But even if McCain is now listening more closely to his inner ambivalence about the term, it cannot erase the eagerness with which his 2008 presidential campaign touted that particular characteristic as a major selling point for candidacy.

"['Census', 'Texas', 'Silvestre Reyes']","
Rep. Silvestre Reyes says census audit found more than 370,000 Texans were missed by 2000 census, costing $1 billion in federal aid
","Urging constituents to return their filled-out 2010 census surveys to the federal government, U.S Rep. Silvestre Reyes refers to a dramatic blast from the past. The El Paso Democrat states in a March 11 e-mail: “An audit of the last census found that over 370,000 people living in Texas were not counted, and our state lost an estimated $1 billion in federal funds as a result.” Goodness. (And where did that census form disappear to?) Does Reyes get his big numbers right? And if there was an undercount, did it cause Texas to miss out on a big chunk of federal aid? For starters, we found no such audit, and Reyes’ office didn’t provide back-up for his statement. However, a 2001 PriceWaterhouseCoopers study prepared for the U.S. Census Bureau Monitoring Board, an entity that no longer exists, stated that nationally, the 2000 census failed to count some 3.3 million residents, including 373,567 Texas residents. The undercount figures were attributed to the Census Bureau and Eugene Ericksen, a Temple University sociologist. Some perspective: Reyes’ recent e-mail harkens to concerns aired in 2000, especially by Democrats, that without an adjustment the census would fail to account for many residents, mainly racial minorities and renters. The bureau did not adjust its count of the nation’s population. The 2001 report said the undercount could result in a federal funding loss of $4 billion across 31 states (including Texas) and the District of Columbia. It raised the prospect of California and Texas losing the most, $1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, from fiscal 2002 to 2012. A press release accompanying the report included this warning from Peter Merrill of PricewaterhouseCoopers' National Economic Consulting group: “Inaccuracies in the census can cause federal funds to be distributed in a way that is not fully consistent with congressional intent. The census undercount not only misallocates funds among jurisdictions, it also causes a net loss to the states of funds from federal entitlement programs. Compounding the problem, many state-funded grant programs to localities also rely on census counts.” Reyes isn't alone in using figures from the 2001 report to argue the importance of participation in the 2010 census. Since last summer, Texas newspapers including the Austin American-Statesman, Dallas Morning News, Fort Worth Star-Telegram and San Antonio Express-News have mentioned figures from the report.  Does the report still hold water? Our finding: Like a sunk boat. About two months after the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report came out, the Census Bureau said it would reassess how accurately it had counted the nation's residents in 2000. And in 2003, the bureau announced new estimates for what the 2000 counts for each state should have been. And there was another twist: Instead of undercounting the nation's population, the bureau concluded it had over-counted by about 1.3 million people. David Whitford, chief of the bureau’s Decennial Statistical Studies Division, told us that the bureau ultimately realized that undercounts nationally were more than offset by double-counting of many individuals and other errors. One example: counting students away at college while also recording them as part of their parents' household back home. Some population groups were affected more than others. The bureau said it had overcounted whites, Asians, American Indians on reservations and young children, the Associated Press reported, while many blacks and Hispanics were missed. There was still a small net undercount (by 10,245 people, or .05 percent) in Texas, the bureau said. The census count of Texans should have been 20,862,065, the bureau estimated. Where does this leave the PriceWaterhouseCoopers study? Professor Ericksen told us that by repudiating its initial undercount estimates, the bureau effectively invalidated both the population figures and federal aid estimates. And Merrill of PriceWaterhouseCoopers cautioned against using its 2001 report for another reason: ""It is certainly out of date... Our firm is not telling anyone that the analysis done in 2001 is relevant for today."" Vincent Perez, Reyes' press secretary, said he's been unable to get the Census Bureau to confirm that it backed off the estimate that more than 370,000 Texas residents weren't counted in the 2000 census. How does Rep. Reyes’ statement stand up? Reyes incorrectly refers to the consultant’s projections as an audit of the census; it was a report. More importantly, Reyes relies -- as have other entities -- on an outdated report based on numbers the Census Bureau has said were flawed. The bureau long ago yanked the statistical rug out from under the claim that more than 370,000 Texas residents were not counted and that Texas stood to miss out on $1 billion in aid as a result. This isn't a close call. We rate Reyes' statement as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976EEB40>],/factchecks/2010/apr/06/silvestre-reyes/rep-silvestre-reyes-says-census-audit-found-more-3/

Kottkamp says solar water heater will cut energy consumption by 17 percent
","
In a race for the state attorney general, we'd usually expect to hear about consumer protection, fraud, and corruption. So we were surprised when Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican candidate for attorney general, brought up the question of energy efficiency in a recent interview with Newsmax TV, a conservative Web site.

""If every house in Florida had a solar-heated water tank, that would eliminate consumption by 17 percent,"" said Kottkamp.

He's right they would help. But would they help that much? 
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, solar water heaters are indeed a cost-effective way to generate hot water. Although they are generally more expensive to install than conventional systems, the cost is offset through long-term savings: On average, water heating bills drop by 50 to 80 percent. That also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. 
First, we contacted Kottkamp's campaign to ask about the source of their claim. A press representative told us that because water heating makes up anywhere from 17 to 20 percent of the utility bill, a solar water system would reduce our consumption by up to 20 percent.

We checked a variety of sources to see how much water heating makes up of the average utility bill. We found a few different numbers, but for the most part, Kottkamp was in the ballpark. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, it's about 12 percent. An MSN Money article puts the figure between 14 and 20. The Western Area Power Administration says that it's 18 percent.

But there's a flaw in Kottkamp's conclusion because he's assuming a solar heater would eliminate energy consumption. Kottkamp didn't note that most solar water heaters also require a back-up system, usually in the form of an electric or gas heater. And it takes energy to power them. 
Dan Olney, vice president of operations for Suntrek Industries, a California company that installs solar systems, said he tells customers that solar heating ""can only supplement conventional water heating."" 
That's why the Department of Energy says the reduction for water heating energy costs is more along the lines of 50 to 80 percent of the current cost. That means rather than the 17 percent savings Kottkamp cites, it could be as low as 8.5 percent. 
So Kottkamp's underlying point is correct, but he's overreaching with his conclusion that it would reduce energy costs 17 percent. According to the federal estimate, the actual savings could be only half of that -- as low as 8.5 percent of total energy costs. So we find his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097102A00>],/factchecks/2010/apr/06/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-says-solar-water-heater/
"['Health Care', 'States', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry says uninsured number in Bay State ""about the same"" since health care reform
","Criticizing the new federal health care law's requirement that most Americans have insurance starting in 2014, Texas Gov. Rick Perry argues in an April 2 column in the Austin American-Statesman that such broad mandates are ""ineffective."" The column also was published by the San Angelo Standard-Times.As evidence, Perry turns the spotlight onto Massachusetts, which has required that adults have health coverage since July 2007. ""The number of uninsured people in Massachusetts is about the same as it was when the mandates were passed in 2006,"" Perry wrote.In a state held up as a shining example by health care reform advocates, that's quite an indictment. Is it true? While waiting last week for Perry's office to elaborate, we looked into how many people are insured in the Bay State.In April 2006, Mitt Romney, then-governor of Massachusetts, signed into law a health care plan with the aim of helping that state reach nearly universal insurance coverage. The plan — similar in some respects to the new federal law — included an expansion of the state's Medicaid program, subsidized coverage for eligible residents and the creation of exchanges where individuals and small businesses could buy coverage.The Massachusetts individual mandate applies to residents who are 18 or older and has penalties for not complying, although people whose incomes are at or below the federal poverty level are exempt. Dick Powers, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Health Connector, an agency that administers parts of the state's health care system, said children were not included in the mandate because virtually all of them already had insurance in 2006.Now for the numbers: According to Powers, about 600,000 Massachusetts residents did not have insurance when the state's health care legislation was signed. Since then, he said, 408,000 people have obtained coverage.The Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy estimates that in 2009, the share of people without insurance was down to 2.7 percent, the lowest uninsured rate in the nation. The division says that translates roughly into 171,000 people — a far cry from the 2006 ""before"" number of 600,000.It's also a far cry from Perry's claim that the number of uninsured people in Massachusetts is relatively unchanged, a statement that Powers called ""outrageous"" and wrong.“Someone saying that probably doesn’t believe Nolan Ryan ever pitched a no-hitter either,” Powers said.For another source, we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, whose most recent data on the subject are from 2008. According to estimates based on the bureau's Current Population Survey, a sampling of about 100,000 households that has been done for more than 50 years, Massachusetts had about 657,000 uninsured residents in 2006. That roughly matches up with the state's estimate of 600,000.By 2008, the number of uninsured in Massachusetts had dropped to about 350,000, according to the Census Bureau's CPS data.Another Census Bureau measure puts that estimate even lower. Based on the American Community Survey, a more reliable source of state data than the CPS because the surveys are sent to more households, about 263,000 people in Massachusetts lacked health insurance in 2008. (That was the first year the ACS included a question about health insurance coverage.)However you do the the Massachusetts math, the number of people without health insurance has dropped by at least 300,000 since 2006 — not the ""about the same"" that Perry airs in his column.So where does this leave Perry's statement?After we'd visited with officials elsewhere, a Perry aide told us by e-mail Monday that the governor's statement was ""an error."" Perry's office also sent us a new version of his Friday column that removes the Massachusetts claim while adding one that references Hawaii, which we're not reviewing in this article.But Perry's original column has already been widely circulated on the Internet, making a correction problematic. Perry's retraction does not change the ridiculous nature of his Massachusetts claim.We rate Perry's unamended statement — the one published in the Austin American-Statesman — as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809768DCC0>],/factchecks/2010/apr/05/rick-perry/perry-says-uninsured-number-bay-state-about-same-h/

Libertarian Senate candidate claims he is ignored by mainstream media
","Alexander Snitker's U.S. Senate campaign says the mainstream media has ignored the lone registered Libertarian candidate seeking to succeed George LeMieux on Capitol Hill, a race that has shone a bright spotlight on three more prominent contenders – Charlie Crist, Marco Rubio and Kendrick Meek.""What is most shocking about this phenomenon is that Snitker has been virtually ignored by the major media,"" a March 29, 2010, release on the candidate's campaign Web site said. ""On an average news day, the other leading Senate candidates enjoy a 200-to-1 advantage over Snitker in media coverage.""Snitker, a 34-year-old former Marine who grew up in Pasco County, entered the race on June 30, 2009, according to the Florida Division of Elections Candidate Tracking system. On April 1, 2010, the site showed 25 active candidates for the Senate elections – 11 Republicans, eight Democrats, three with No Party Affiliation, and one each for the Veterans Party of America and Constitution Party of Florida – plus Snitker as the lone Libertarian. He advocates adoption of the ""FairTax,"" which raises federal funds not from income or payroll taxes but through a national retail sales tax and also vows to support term limits and a balanced budget amendment. ""What I stand for, the tea party is all about,"" Snitker said at a March speech in Orlando. A video of the speech was posted on YouTube.To check Snitker's claim, we looked for media references.A recent Nexis search in the category of ""Florida News Sources,"" an aggregator, found two mentions of Snitker in the past three months. Both were in the Orlando Sentinel's ""What's happening"" column, and both were bulletin-board style items letting readers know about an upcoming candidates forum. In comparison, Republican candidate Rubio got 861 and Democrat Meek 286. Crist, who's campaigning for the Senate while he serves as Florida's governor, got 2,292.We also found eight mentions of Snitker on the St. Petersburg Times political blog, ""The Buzz."" All were in the comments section of blog posts and all but one apparently posted by the candidate himself. Campaign media director Adrian Wyllie says the Snitker for Senate 2010 campaign periodically sends e-mail blasts to hundreds of reporters and media members across the state and ""not one has gotten published in any paper, not one has gotten any follow up from any TV station."" Wyllie says the only place the candidate has had success is on talk and Internet radio, an example of which was his February interview with a trio of Libertarians on KKNT in Phoenix’s weekly program, The Libertarian Solution Radio. We found a Podcast of it on iTunes.Wyllie concedes that the Snitker campaign has never scheduled a news conference. But the campaign’s claim is that the major media has ignored his campaign – not that the campaign has necessarily tried to lure it in.So, just to be sure, we rang up Justin Sayfie, Fort Lauderdale attorney and publisher of Sayfiereview.com, considered by some to be a daily must-click site for Florida political junkies. We asked if he’d ever seen an article about Snitker.Sayfie: ""How do you spell his last name?""PolitiFact Florida: ""S-n-i-t-k-e-r.""Sayfie: ""S-n-i-t-k-e-r. Snitker? Never heard of him.""Sayfie boasts that his Web site reviews 10 to 15 major Florida daily newspapers ""seven days a week, 365 days a year, and we do it manually, looking for news coverage about Florida politics."" But when it comes to the Snitker for Senate campaign, he says, ""I have not seen any news coverage at all. At all. Whatsoever.""We find little reason to disagree.

Alex Sink says controversial education bill is unfunded mandate for local schools
","Count Alex Sink among those fighting a controversial series of education reforms being pushed by state Republican leaders.SB 6 would link teacher pay increases to student performance, eliminate long-term job security for new teachers and require end-of-course exams for subjects not covered by the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test starting in the 2013-2014 school year. Most Democrats and some moderate Republicans in the Legislature oppose the changes; so does the teachers union.Sink, the state's chief financial officer and a Democrat running for governor, added her opposition in a March 31, 2010, statement.""These proposals are bad for our children and our state,"" Sink said. ""As a mother whose two children went to Florida public schools, I feel strongly that our local school districts should be the ones making these kinds of decisions for our students and teachers -- not politicians in Tallahassee. I also have a serious problem with placing even more unfunded mandates on our local school districts, as they are already facing significant budget concerns.""The education bill proposed by Sen. John Thrasher, R-Jacksonville, has been one of the more hotly debated issues of the 2010 legislative session. It passed the Senate 21-17 on March 24, 2010, and awaits action in the House. As part of the bill, teachers hired after July 2010 would work under one-year contracts instead of the current multi-year contracts awarded to teachers after three years of service, which is informally known as tenure. School districts would have to create base salaries and set aside a pool of money for performance bonuses that would be based on test scores and other guidelines developed by 2014. The legislation would cause a major shift from current pay scales, which base salaries on degrees and years of experience.A good recap of the bill and what's happened so far is here.In this item, we want to explore Sink's claim about who would pay to implement the new education initiatives, and whether or not the bill creates an ""unfunded mandate."" We've heard others make a similar claim, including Duval County Schools superintendent Ed Pratt-Dannals and Republican state Rep. Julio Robaina of Miami.What's the cost?First, we need to set some boundaries -- in this case, by defining unfunded mandate.We like this definition, which was offered by the presidents of the Florida Association of Counties and the Florida League of Cities in a recent guest editorial: A mandate is a program or service that the state or federal government requires local governments to provide, but they do not provide funding to pay for it. Second, it's very clear there are costs associated with passing SB 6. The actual price tag, however, is ""indeterminate,"" according to a legislative analysis. It points to unknown costs associated with: ""School districts will incur additional costs associated with the development or acquisition of end-of-course assessments for each subject area and grade level that is not tested by statewide assessments or AP, IB, AICE, or industry certification examinations,"" a House analysis of the companion bill, HB 7189, found. ""However, the fiscal impact of these activities is indeterminate."" The Department of Education says overall teacher salaries could also increase, depending on how teachers perform in the new system. The overall pricetag depends on how much it costs local districts to implement the changes and how teachers perform, spokesman Tom Butler said. Butler noted that the implementation costs ""could be supplemented"" if the state receives a federal Race to the Top grant award. Florida lost in round 1 of the grant process, but plans on applying in round 2. Applications are due June 1, Butler said. Who's got the bill? At this point, it's crucial to get background about how Florida's schools are funded.Florida's K-12 schools are funded through a combination of federal, state and local dollars. The core funding is filtered through the Florida Education Finance Program, a 1973 legislative initiative that attempts to equalize funding levels among school districts.The state's contribution is almost entirely set by the Legislature, while local funds come almost entirely from property taxes.The Legislature sets how much property taxes a school district must collect in order to receive state funding. The local school district then has the ability to levy additional property taxes. According to the Florida Department of Education, school districts in 2007-08 received 40.27 percent of their financial support from state sources, 51.05 percent from local sources, and 8.68 percent from federal sources.SB 6 sets aside 5 percent of federal, state and local Florida Eduaction Finance Program funds beginning in 2011 (roughly $900 million) to implement the new education initiatives, including end-of-course exams and the new performance pay system. Starting in 2014 that money would then be used to actually pay teachers (remember, that's when linking pay increases to student performance would start). The money isn't new money, in the sense that it's in addition to current school budgets. It's simply carved out of the existing funding structure.Let's think this through from both sides. On one hand, the money is set aside to implement SB 6, so it clearly cannot be an unfunded mandate.But on the other hand, the money essentially is being taken out of existing school budgets and spent a different way. ""I've heard that maybe they won't take it out of district money, that they'll take it out of state money,"" said Duval County Schools superintendent Ed Pratt-Dannals, who recently wrote a letter to the editor about SB 6. ""Well, however they carve it up, if they fence in 5 percent, I'm still 5 percent down.""Pratt-Dannals said his district would face a $42 million budget shortfall beginning in 2011 if SB 6 is approved, the same year the district also loses $43 million in federal stimulus money. A Race to Top grant could help, but it's unclear if the money would cover all the costs associated with SB 6.""This is an UNFUNDED mandate,"" state Rep. Julio Robaina, R-Miami, said in a press release April 1, 2010. ""School districts will have to 'cobble-wobble together' the funding to put all the provisions into place or they will be PENALIZED and lose state funding."" The rulingIn its simplest terms, SB 6 identifies funding for the education policy changes. What's different is the funding the Senate identified already is being used by schools for something else. It's not like the Senate is paying for the education reforms with an increase to the cigarette tax, or some other revenue stream. To fund their proposed reforms, Republicans in the Legislature are essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul. And it's that funding scheme that produces the same result as if the Legislature didn't fund SB 6 at all. They are fencing in 5 percent of a school district's budget to implement the statewide changes, without any promise that additional funds will be coming down the road. The funding mechanism will force school districts to either cut budgets or raise taxes. Yes, a Race to the Top grant may help. But no one knows if the money's coming, or if it's enough.  Sink called the Republican education plan an ""unfunded mandate."" We rate her claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D6E600>],/factchecks/2010/apr/05/alex-sink/alex-sink-education-bill-unfunded-mandate/

Drug czar says more people drive under influence of drugs than alcohol
","Much has been made of the United States' success in reducing the amount of drinking and driving over the past few decades. But is there a growing problem with drivers on drugs?

During a March 31, 2010, interview on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal, Gil Kerlikowske -- the head of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and more commonly known as the drug czar -- seemed to suggest as much.

""More people are driving under the influence of drugs than are driving under the influence of alcohol,"" Kerlikowske said. ""A recent roadside survey showed that 16 percent of the people tested, tested positive for illicit or licit drugs. That's significantly higher than alcohol.""

This surprised us, so we decided to take a closer look.

We located the study that Kerlikowske was referring to -- the National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers. It was conducted in 2007 for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- part of the federal Department of Transportation -- through a contract with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. It was the fourth major roadside survey (earlier ones were undertaken in 1973, 1986 and 1996) and was the first to look at drugs as well as alcohol.

The 2007 study randomly stopped drivers at 300 U.S. locations on weekend nights (10 p.m. through midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, and 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays) and also made some daytime stops for comparisons. Participation in the survey and its testing was voluntary. The stops targeted private vehicles, including motorcycles, but they excluded commercial vehicles such as semitrailer trucks. In all, 11,000 drivers participated, with 86 percent tested by breathalyzer, 71 percent by oral fluid samples and 39 percent by blood samples. (The blood test was for nighttime drivers only.)

Because the nighttime sample provides the most complete data on drug use, we'll stick to the nighttime sample for alcohol use as well.

During the nighttime tests, 2.2 percent of drivers registered a blood-alcohol content of at least .08 percent -- the level at which a driver is presumed impaired under Florida law.

By contrast, a whopping 16.3 percent of drivers tested positive for drugs, defined in the study as ""illegal, prescription, and over-the-counter products, including stimulants, sedatives, antidepressants, marijuana, and narcotic analgesics."" The most commonly detected drugs were marijuana (8.6 percent), cocaine (3.9 percent) and methamphetamine (1.3 percent).

If that were the end of the story, Kerlikowske's comment would be resoundingly accurate -- 16.3 percent is indeed ""significantly higher"" than 2.2 percent.
But there are two caveats that deserve a mention. •  Legal vs. illegal levels of alcohol. The 2.2 percent of drivers registering .08 or above is, by historical standards, impressively low -- that number has steadily declined since the first survey, from 7.5 percent in 1973 to 5.4 percent in 1986 to 4.3 percent in 1996 before dropping to 2.2 percent in 2007.

Still, that number underestimates the total percentage of drivers who registered some alcohol in their bloodstream. In all, the survey found that 12.4 percent of drivers had some alcohol in their bloodstream -- 7.9 percent with levels between .005 and .049 and an additional 2.3 percent with levels between .05 and .079.

Low, but detectible, blood-alcohol levels do not impair a driver as much as illegal levels do, but they can have an effect. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, such symptoms as ""mild euphoria, talkativeness, decreased inhibitions, decreased attention, impaired judgment and increased reaction time"" can begin at .03 percent, and numerous countries have set legal thresholds lower than .08.

Indeed, the California Department of Motor Vehicles says that blood-alcohol content below .08 percent ""does not mean that it is safe or legal to drive."" The state calls levels from .01 to .04 a ""possible DUI"" (driving under the influence) and .05 to .07 a ""likely DUI."" For drivers under 21, both categories are illegal outright.

•  We don't know much about how drugs affect the act of driving. Compared to the effects of alcohol, the impact of drugs on driving is not yet well understood. Some of this has to do with the long head start in research on alcohol and driving, and some has to do with the greater chemical complexity of drugs compared to alcohol.

The authors of the study were open about the limitations of today's knowledge. ""In addition to the prevalence of drug use by drivers,"" they wrote, ""several other questions need to be answered in order to assess the drug-impaired driving problem, including: Which drugs impair driving ability? What drug dose levels are associated with impaired driving? Which drugs are associated with higher crash rates?""

They added a strongly worded caveat. ""The reader is cautioned that drug presence does not necessarily imply impairment,"" they wrote. ""For many drug types, drug presence can be detected long after any impairment that might affect driving has passed. For example, traces of marijuana can be detected in blood samples several weeks after chronic users stop ingestion. Also, whereas the impairment effects for various concentration levels of alcohol are well understood, little evidence is available to link concentrations of other drug types to driver performance.""

To offer a more concrete example, it's unclear how much impact a joint of marijuana inhaled two weeks ago may have on a driver today. It could well be that the two-week-old joint is less of an impairment than a legal level of alcohol in the blood -- even though the study would count the marijuana user as part of that 16 percent ""under the influence of drugs"" yet exclude someone with .07 percent alcohol from the 2.2 percent of alcohol-impaired drivers.

Thomas McLellan, deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, told PolitiFact that the sensitivity of the oral swabs makes it ""highly unlikely"" that marijuana use ""even half a day earlier would have shown up"" in the survey. Still, in addition to the survey authors' written caution, several independent experts we contacted agreed that the lack of data on drug-use-and-driving interactions suggests that the survey's results be taken with a degree of caution.

Barbara Harsha, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, added that there's strong evidence that, regardless of the comparative data on substances in drivers' systems, ""drunk driving is still the bigger problem. . . . Alcohol-related crashes were 32 percent of the total in 2008. There’s no comparable data for drug-related crashes, since there are no standards for drug impairment while driving, but the estimates are in the 10 percent to 15 percent range."" If you look no further than the outcome of the survey he cites, Kerlikowske's comment are accurate. But the caveats listed above reduce our confidence that, as he puts it, ""more people are driving under the influence of drugs than are driving under the influence of alcohol."" There's reason to believe that not all of the 16 percent of drivers testing positive for drugs would have been ""under the influence of drugs."" The survey only reveals who has some level of drugs in their system, and does not provide an accurate measure of who was impaired by drugs when they were surveyed. By the same token, it's quite possible that many more than 2.2 percent of the study participants were indeed ""driving under the influence of alcohol"" even if they weren't over the .08 legal threshold. Did these two percentages approach each other in the middle, thus undermining Kerlikowske's statement? Maybe -- or maybe he is right after all. Ultimately, the research isn't yet detailed enough to be sure. With this degree of uncertainty, we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B84680>],/factchecks/2010/apr/05/gil-kerlikowske/drug-czar-says-more-people-drive-under-influence-d/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Lloyd  Doggett']","
Rep. Lloyd Doggett says that health care reform has consumer protections and everyone can become insured
","
Days before President Barack Obama signed the health care reform bill into law, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, delivered a speech on the House floor saying ""you can certainly sum up our many, many pages with four words: 'You've got health care.'

""With this reform,"" Doggett said March 21, ""every insured American gets valuable consumer protections, and every uninsured American can become insured.""

We wondered if Doggett accurately characterized those many pages of the law.

Let's start with his proclamation of consumer protections.

Sarah Dohl, Doggett's communications director, pointed to 11 consumer protections in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that Obama signed on March 23, plus the House reconciliation bill he signed March 30.

This year, for starters, adult children can stay on their parents' health insurance policies until they turn 26. Second, insurers are prohibited from rescinding coverage except in cases of fraud. Third, insurers can't refuse coverage for children for a particular illness — say, asthma — if the child is accepted into a plan or is currently covered on a plan.

There's more: Insurers can no longer place lifetime caps on how much they'll pay out. Consumers in private plans will have access to an independent appeals process to contest decisions made by their insurers. Also, insurers won't be able to deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person's gender or pre-existing medical conditions.

What about Doggett's statement that every uninsured American can now become insured?

Keeping in mind that ""can"" is not the same as ""will"" and that some parts of the new law will take years to kick in, more people do stand to be insured.

Today, some 83 percent of Americans — excluding illegal immigrants — have coverage either through their employer, the private market or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. The new law is expected to increase the share of insured Americans to 94 percent by 2019, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.

As of June, people with pre-existing medical conditions can get coverage from a temporary national high-risk pool set to last until 2014 when insurers will be barred from denying coverage to anyone for any reason. Also starting in 2014, most people will be required to have health insurance. There are a handful of exceptions, but individuals who aren't exempt and refuse to sign up with a plan will be required to pay an annual penalty of the greater of $695 per person, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater.

Other aspects of the new law are aimed at easing access to insurance.

In 2013, the federal government will create the ""consumer operated and oriented"" plan to foster the creation of nonprofit, member-run health insurance cooperatives in each state and the District of Columbia. Come 2014, individuals and small businesses with up to 100 employees can purchase coverage administered by a governmental agency or nonprofit organization. That year, Medicaid will be open to anyone under 65 making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level — which this year is $14,404 for an individual and $29,327 for a family of four.

According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has analyzed all the major health care proposals: ""This expansion will create a uniform minimum Medicaid eligibility threshold across states and will eliminate a limitation of the program that prohibits most adults without dependent children from enrolling in the program today."" Per current law, undocumented immigrants won't be eligible for Medicaid.

Another future change, according to Kaiser: Individuals whose incomes are greater than 133 percent of the poverty level who don't have access to affordable coverage through their employer will be able to purchase it through a state-based exchange by 2014.

2014 is the year when Doggett's characterization will prove true.

John Greeley, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance, told us that every Texan can already obtain insurance if they choose to do so. Greeley pointed to the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool, a high-risk pool created by state lawmakers to provide health insurance to residents who lose coverage under a group plan or who can't obtain coverage from an insurer on the private market because of a pre-existing medical condition. (Texas is one of 34 states that have such high-risk pools.)

But Stacey Pogue, senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, noted that access to insurance is not always a cinch. An individual may not qualify for coverage, she said, or may not be able to afford it. Per the Texas Insurance Code, the pool's premiums rates are double the rates premiums offered by private insurers,in the private market, to avoid competition with them.

As of March, 26,564 Texas residents were insured through the pool, and 6.1 million residents were uninsured, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Now, where does that leave us with Doggett's floor statement?

He's right about the law introducing consumer protections. Also, the law is expected to ease access to coverage, though not everyone benefits immediately. Still, starting in 2014, every American will be able to sign up for insurance.

We rate Doggett's statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974BA480>],/factchecks/2010/apr/02/lloyd-doggett/rep-lloyd-doggett-says-health-care-reform-has-cons/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Florida Education Association']","
Teachers' group says state House schedules critical hearing in the middle of spring break
","A controversial education bill that would link teacher pay increases to student performance is scheduled to get its final public hearing April 5, 2010, and the teachers union fighting the measure is lining up troops to voice opposition.The Florida Education Association is calling on educators to appear before the House Education Policy Council during a public hearing scheduled to start at noon. Their rally cry comes with a not-so-subtle dig at Tallahassee lawmakers.""The Florida Senate held hearings on this terrible piece of legislation during FCAT testing. So it should be no surprise that the Florida House of Representatives is holding the FINAL public hearing on this bill smack dab in the middle of spring break...when they hope you are not watching or listening,"" the FEA says in a message on its Web site. ""The FINAL hearing has been scheduled for Monday, April 5th from 12:00 noon until 8:15 p.m. and they are hoping you don't show!""In this item, we wanted to see if the Florida Legislature is scheduling this critical hearing so as to avoid a confrontation with teachers.The education initiative -- SB 6 in the Senate and HB 7189 in the House -- would link teacher pay increases to student performance, eliminate long-term job security for new teachers and require end-of-course exams for subjects not covered by the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test starting in the 2013-2014 school year. The legislation would cause a major shift from current teacher pay scales, which base salaries on degrees and years of experience.The Florida Education Association says the bill, which passed the Senate 21-17 on March 24, 2010, and awaits action in the House -- could push experienced teachers out of the classroom.To judge the FEA's claim, we wanted to see how many school districts will be on spring break on April 5, 2010. So we built this spreadsheet after visiting the Web sites for each of Florida's 67 public school districts.By our calculation, 33 of Florida's public school districts will be closed April 5, 2010. Some of the schools will be on formal spring break. Others are having a teacher work day, while students are off.What does any of that mean?On the surface, it seems to mean a lot of teachers won't be working and could possibly attend the bill hearing, if they chose. From the teachers' perspective, that would be a good thing, right?But then we looked back at the FEA's statement. The FEA previously was upset that the Senate held its hearings during FCAT testing, when teachers were working. That had us confused. The FEA was upset hearings were held when teachers had to be working. And now the group's upset because the House is holding hearings when teachers are off. Is there some other category between working and not working?But that's only part of the problem with the FEA's statement. The Florida Constitution limits the Legislature to one, 60-day legislative session each year. The Constitution also says the session must begin in March (the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March).The constraints in many ways bind the hands of legislators.The bill the House Education Policy Council will consider, HB 7189, wasn't filed until March 25, 2010 -- after its companion piece was approved by the Senate. The measure had a hearing at the House PreK-12 Policy Committee on March 25, 2010 (passing 9-6) and was forwarded to the House Education Policy Council. April 5 is the council's first meeting since March 17, 2010. If the bill advances through the House Education Policy Council, it must be passed by the full House. If the bill differs from the version approved in the Senate, the Senate would have to weigh in a second time.The session is scheduled to end April 30.That's a lot to happen in what amounts to 20 work days.House Republican spokeswoman Jill Chamberlin said House leaders decided to wait to consider the education reforms until the bill had passed the Senate. When it did, on March 24, the House was debating the state budget.Going forward, Chamberlin said, the weeks of April 12 and 19 have been set aside for more budget negotiations.Chamberlin said House leaders blocked eight hours for the education hearing, including evening hours to make sure people had an opportunity to speak. She also noted that many teachers visited Tallahassee in the last week of March -- when they were on spring break -- to oppose the measure.State Rep. Bill Heller, D-St. Petersburg, told PolitiFact Florida the compressed schedule is a perfect example of why the Legislature should have called a special session to handle proposed education reforms.""We can call a special session for a railroad project, when it only serves a portion of the state,"" said Heller, who opposes the bill and is the ranking Democratic member of the House Education Policy Council. ""But when there's something that touches every city and every county, we're going to do just in a few hours.""Heller agreed with concerns that people might not be able to attend the April 5 hearing, but he also expected a full committee room, and almost eight hours of public testimony.Heller said he has received about four e-mails in support of the legislation and about 1,600 against. Another 8,000 Floridians have signed a petition sent to Gov. Charlie Crist opposing the education proposals. House Speaker Larry Cretul's office had to add additional telephone lines to handle the flood of calls, more than 5,200, most of whom were from people opposing the bill, said Chamberlin, the Ocala Star-Banner reported..That means the message is getting out.The state's big teachers union, the Florida Education Association, said the Florida House is holding the final hearing of a controversial education bill in the middle of spring break, when ""they hope (teachers) are not watching or listening."" We find the scheduling of the hearing is much more of a practical matter than an attempt to stomp out the voice of teachers.

"['Bipartisanship', 'Education', 'Florida', ""Foundation for Florida's Future""]","
Foundation for Florida's Future claims there's bipartisan support for using student test scores to measure teacher effectiveness
","The Foundation for Florida's Future, founded and chaired by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, says both Democrats and Republicans are advocating the use of student test scores to measure teachers' effectiveness.The group issued the claim in a bid to refute the notion that reform is ""a purely partisan effort"" at a time when an education bill making its way through the Florida Legislature is causing a political firestorm. It has grown so heated that the sergeants-at-arms had to form a barrier between angry educators and lawmakers at the end of a March 25, 2010, hearing of the House Pre-K-12 Policy Committee.The foundation made the claim in an e-mail sent to Florida political editors on March 26, 2010, entitled ''Myth vs. Fact: The Truth About Reform [Round Two] Modernizing Teacher Evaluations, Tenure and Compensation for the 21st Century.'' It goes on to say that reform advocates include President Barack Obama, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and cites Florida's business community as calling on the Florida Legislature to act on these issues. The e-mail contains many interesting facts, but we decided to focus on whether former Gov. Bush's own state – clearly a focus of the foundation's e-mail – is the bipartisan paradise his organization describes.On March 24, the Senate voted 21-17 to approve a bill (SB 6) that included language that would link teacher pay raises to student standardized tests rather than years of service. The legislation includes creation of a ''Performance Fund for Instructional Personnel and School-Based Administrators.'' The Associated Press reported that the bill passed ""the Republican-controlled Senate on largely party-line vote,"" over the opposition of ""the Florida Education Association,"" the statewide teachers union, which AP described as ""an important Democratic constituency group.""In the Senate roll call vote, four GOP senators broke with the party and voted against it. So did every single Democrat who voted on the measure. One of those who voted against it was Paula Dockery, the Lakeland Republican who is challenging Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum for their party's gubernatorial nomination. Two lawmakers – Sen. Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, and Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston – did not vote.The House version of the Senate bill (HB 7189) is pending a vote in the full House the week of April 5. It was approved by the House PreK-12 Policy Committee, 9-6, on March 25. Every Democrat voted against it along with one Republican, Mike Weinstein, R-Orange Park.Some opponents call it a union-busting bill. Other critics say linking teacher pay to pupils' performance on standardized tests would pile on more tests in an already test-preoccupied state. Moreover, parent-teacher groups opposing the measure – and urging the House to vote it down – are pushing for defeat of the legislation sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher, a Republican and chairman of the state Republican party.Even former Gov. Bush on March 25, 2010 – the morning after the Florida Senate passed the bill – acknowledged a Republican-Democratic divide in talking about education reform efforts on the MSNBC cable network program Morning Joe.""I think Secretary Duncan and President Obama deserve credit for a) challenging a really powerful core constituency in their own party but b), more importantly, putting students first rather than the adults in the system,"" he said. ""And so there's all sorts of common ground now that is very exciting. And I think that is perhaps one of the reasons why there's a lot of new energy around this. But charter schools in places that historically haven’t had them, a stronger form of accountability, a real focus on children that lag behind, has yielded incredible results in places like Florida … ""President Obama and Duncan may be advocating some education reforms. But in response to a reporter's question on March 10, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs seemed to draw a distinction between ''merit pay'' and ''performance pay.''Here's part of the March 10 exchange:Q: So he does support merit pay increase for performance.MR. GIBBS: He supports the pay for performance, and I think a grand expansion of those ideas across a number of school districts was one of the many things – including early childhood education, changes in data and innovation -- that I think lay out the strong foundation for an educational reform agenda that the President believes will ultimately lead to increased economic growth.Moreover, Obama acknowledged the partisan rancor himself in a March 10, 2009, speech to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on a Complete and Competitive American Education: ""For decades, Washington has been trapped in the same debates that have paralyzed progress and perpetuated our educational decline. Too many supporters of my party have resisted the idea of rewarding excellence in teaching with extra pay, even though we know it can make a difference in the classroom.""...I think you'd all agree that the time for finger-pointing is over. The time for holding us – holding ourselves – accountable is here. What's required is not simply new investments, but new reforms. It's time to expect more from our students. It's time to start rewarding good teachers, stop making excuses for bad ones.""Patricia Levesque of the Foundation for Florida's Future says the ""Myth vs Fact"" claim intentionally focused on the federal landscape, which is more favorable to the notion of rewarding teachers for accomplishment in the classroom. Asked why Florida Democrats don't follow what she sees as a national trend, she replied: ""That's the million-dollar question. It really is federally and in other states a bipartisan issue."" It is true that President Obama and Education Secretary Duncan support performance pay for teachers, which is among the key provisions in SB 6.

"['States', 'Texas', 'Rick Green']","
Supreme Court candidate Green, former state rep, says he was fourth-most conservative
","Rick Green of Dripping Springs, in an April 13 Republican primary runoff for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court, told a Montgomery County group that voters don’t have to guess his judicial philosophy -- they can look at his legislative voting record. Green served two terms in the Texas House from 1999 to 2003; he lost his seat in 2002 to Democrat Patrick Rose. According to a video of his Jan. 14 Montgomery County remarks posted on his campaign Web site, Green encouraged listeners to check his House history, saying: ""As a state rep, I was considered the fourth-most conservative in the Legislature.”Is that so? To support his claim, Green's campaign pointed us to the 1999 Texas Conservative Report, a publication of the Free Enterprise PAC, an advocate for limited government and ""traditional values."" It has since become the Heritage Alliance PAC.The 1999 report tracks dozens of votes made by every legislator in that year's regular session. To evaluate House members, a panel chose 64 votes on ""economic, social, governmental and education issues"" that the group said “showed signs of a liberal or conservative philosophy.” Lawmakers were graded based on the number of times they voted with the conservative position.Green and two other members of the 150-member House voted the group's preferred way 88 percent of the time; only three members leaned the group's way more often. (The average score was 43 percent.) By that measure, Green shared the “fourth-most conservative” honors with GOP Reps. John Davis of Houston and Charlie Howard of Sugar Land. Senators were rated separately, leaving Green's statement open to interpretation whether he was claiming to be the fourth-most conservative in the whole Legislature (which would be an overstatement) or just the House (which was accurate).The report lists 28 criteria that define how positions were identified as conservative, including if legislation made government more efficient, strengthened the family's importance as the foundation of the nation, reduced the overall tax burden or protected a citizen's ability to make a living.In summarizing its ratings, the group highlighted 12 votes on topics ranging from property taxes to abortion to standardized testing.One vote was on a bill that would have expanded the state's hate crimes law by, among other things, enhancing criminal penalties and specifying which groups would be protected against bias crimes, including those targeted because of their ""race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, status as a pregnant person, gender, or sexual preference.""   The Free Enterprise PAC said ""nay"" was the conservative vote in this case because the measure would have given ""special rights to an individual or group"" and did not support ""traditional Judeo/Christian moral values."" Green was in the minority in voting no. That bill eventually failed, though a hate crimes measure later passed into law during the 2001 legislative session. Green also received a thumbs-up from the group for voting against a bill requiring people younger than 18 to wear a bicycle helmet when riding on public roads or paths. That measure did not become law.  All in all, Green was one of 32 House members the group designated a Leader of Excellence in 1999. Not noted by Green in Montgomery County: Based on some of his votes in the 2001 legislative session -- Green's last -- he slipped in the group's conservative rankings.Not that Green became a liberal. The group's 2001 report states that Green took its favored position 65 percent of the time, compared to a House average of 34 percent. He tied with three others as the 11th-most conservative House member. Thirty members sided more often with the group's preferred positions. Green, who served on Heritage Alliance's board of directors from March through November 2009, was not designated a Leader of Excellence by the group in 2001 because he sided with it in less than 70 percent of the rated votes.As before, the group's 2001 report spotlights 12 votes, which covered topics ranging from the death penalty to the minimum wage to mental illness. The votes included two that the group penalized Green for, both voice votes, in which passage is determined by choruses of ""ayes"" and ""nays"" on the House floor.The first was on a proposal to mandate that health insurance policies in Texas cover anorexia and bulimia as serious mental illnesses, and the second was on a bill requiring the state attorney general's office to use gender-neutral terminology in publications. Neither became law. For both, the group's preferred position was to oppose them. When we asked Heritage Alliance President Richard Ford how the group was able to tell tell whether a legislator had voted yes or no in those instances, he said he could not recall how those votes were treated because the report was done so long ago.We have a hunch why the group marked Green as voting the wrong way on the two bills. After a voice vote is held, individual members may request that their vote be separately recorded as for or against. It appears that Free Enterprise gave conservative credit only to the lawmakers who did that on those two measures, and Green was not one of them, according to the House Journal.His wife, Kara Green, the campaign's treasurer, said her husband did not support either measure. Summing up: Green accurately recaps his conservative ranking — albeit by a single group, the Free Enterprise PAC, during his first of two terms. He omits the fact that he was not considered fourth-most conservative in his second term, according to the group. We rate his statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097381100>],/factchecks/2010/apr/01/rick-green/green-says-he-was-fouth-most-conservative-texas-ho/

Comparing Obama's recess appointment of Craig Becker with Bush's nomination of John Bolton
","With Congress in recess after passing major health care legislation, President Barack Obama took the opportunity to install several of his appointees without receiving approval from the Senate.The move is known as a ""recess appointment,"" and it stems from a power enumerated in the U.S. Constitution, which states, ""The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session."" That means Obama can make the appointments now, and those appointees will be able to serve until the end of 2011. Other presidents have made recess appointments, both recently and throughout history, and those appointments have regularly drawn criticism from the opposite party. We remembered that Obama, while serving as a U.S. senator, opposed the recess appointment of John Bolton, President George W. Bush's pick to become U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. So we decided to test Obama on the Flip-O-Meter to see whether his decision to make recess appointments represents a change in position.We'll start with the 2005 Bolton appointment, and then compare it with what Obama did in 2010.President George W. Bush appointed Bolton to be ambassador of the United Nations after senators held up the confirmation in two separate votes of 56-42 and 54-38. The nomination required 60 votes before formal approval.Opponents said Bolton was the wrong person for the job because he was known as a critic of the United Nations. Democrats said that history made him poor choice to become ambassador to the organization. But Democrats were also angry that Bolton had submitted inaccurate information to the Senate. The State Department inspector general had interviewed Bolton about the accuracy of intelligence leading up to the Iraq war, but Bolton had submitted testimony indicating that he had not been interviewed. That dispute prompted Senate Democrats to send a letter to Bush protesting the recess appointment. Obama was one of 36 senators to sign the letter. (Joe Biden, now Obama's vice president, and Hillary Clinton, Obama's secretary of state, signed it as well.)""In light of the fact that John Bolton was not truthful to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the questionnaire he swore was truthful, we ask that you do not make a recess appointment of Mr. Bolton to be the Ambassador to the United Nations, and instead submit a new nomination to the Senate,"" the letter said. ""Mr. Bolton's excuse that he 'didn't recall being interviewed by the State Department's Inspector General' is simply not believable.""Sending someone to the United Nations who has not been confirmed by the United States Senate and now who has admitted to not being truthful on a document so important that it requires a sworn affidavit is going to set our efforts back in many ways,"" the letter said. Obama, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Chicago Tribune, ""To some degree, he's damaged goods,"" adding, ""I think that means we'll have less credibility and, ironically, be less equipped to reform the United Nations in the way that it needs to be reformed."" But Obama also said that he thought Bush was within his rights in making the appointment. ""The president is entitled to take that action, but I don't think it will serve American foreign policy well,"" Obama said in an interview. Obama issued his own separate statement on the Bolton nomination after the recess appointment. He offered strong words of criticism -- ""John Bolton is the wrong person for the job and the decision to appoint him today will not serve American foreign policy well at all"" -- but the future president did not complain in his statement that it was a recess appointment. In fact, he didn't even mention it. In making his recess appointments on March 27, 2010, Obama said he was moving forward on nominees in the face of Republican intransigence.""The United States Senate has the responsibility to approve or disapprove of my nominees. But if, in the interest of scoring political points, Republicans in the Senate refuse to exercise that responsibility, I must act in the interest of the American people and exercise my authority to fill these positions on an interim basis,"" Obama said in a statement. ""Most of the men and women whose appointments I am announcing today were approved by Senate committees months ago, yet still await a vote of the Senate. ... I simply cannot allow partisan politics to stand in the way of the basic functioning of government.""One of his 15 recess appointments likely wouldn't meet that criteria. In February, 33 senators voted to block the nomination of Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board with only 52 -- short of the 60 needed -- voting to proceed.Becker is an attorney who previously worked for the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO, unions that strongly supported his nomination. Senators critical of labor unions opposed Becker's nomination because they said he would favor unions on the National Labor Relations Board, which is responsible for resolving labor-management disputes. ""Parties before the Board, whether union or employer, have a right to a fair and impartial tribunal,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, in February. ""The confirmation of an officer and associate general counsel of two of our nation's largest unions for a term on the National Labor Relations Board will make the appearance of justice and many of the decisions in which he participates impossible to achieve.""McCain said he feared Becker would promote the policy known as ""card check,"" which makes it easier for unions to organize using signed authorization cards rather than a secret ballot. Critics say that card check makes it easier for unions to intimidate workers into joining, but unions say that it helps workers to sidestep management efforts to suppress unions.So where does that leave us on the Flip-O-Meter? Obama opposed a controversial recess nomination in 2005 but put forward his own in 2010.Keeping in mind the statement Obama put out on Bolton, it's worth noting that Obama opposed Bolton on his merits, but didn't complain about it being a recess appointment. Indeed, Obama specifically said Bush was within his rights to make the nomination, just as Obama as president now has the right to make recess appointments.On the other hand, Obama did sign on to a group letter that urged Bush to ""submit a new nomination to the Senate"" rather than go forward with a controversial recess appointment.If every appointee for whom Obama made a recess appointment was noncontroversial, Obama would have a good argument that the two situations were different. But just as Democrats opposed Bolton on policy grounds, so too are Republicans opposing Becker on policy grounds. While Democrats raised issues of personal honesty in the case of Bolton -- accusations that Republicans have not leveled at Becker -- we think the cases are similar enough to make Obama's recess appointment for Becker a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973923C0>],/factchecks/2010/apr/01/barack-obama/obama-recess-appointment-craig-becker-bush-john-bo/

Obama says Heritage Foundation is source of health exchange idea
","EDITOR'S NOTE: An analysis of this comment by President Barack Obama was published on April 1, 2010. After it appeared, the Heritage Foundation's communications office contacted us to argue that our rating of Mostly True was too generous to the president. We did some additional reporting to review our ruling. Our second round of reporting -- primarily talking to conservative policy experts outside of Heritage -- solidified our initial conclusions. Below is the updated version of our story, which retains the rating of Mostly True, published April 26, 2010.Democrats like to parry Republican criticism of the recently passed health care law by talking about how it includes ideas that originated with conservatives. During an interview on NBC's Today show on March 30, 2010, President Barack Obama offered a specific example.Obama told host Matt Lauer that ""when you actually look at the bill itself, it incorporates all sorts of Republican ideas. I mean a lot of commentators have said this is sort of similar to the bill that Mitt Romney, the Republican governor and now presidential candidate, passed in Massachusetts. A lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation. ...""We zeroed in on the notion that the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that is no fan of Obama's health care law as a whole, might have ""originated"" the idea of the health insurance exchange -- a virtual marketplace where individuals can purchase health insurance. Our interest only grew after we received an e-mail from Heritage president Ed Feulner that blasted Obama's claim.""President Obama this morning cited the Heritage Foundation's research in an attempt to sell his health care package as a 'middle-of-the-road, centrist approach,'"" Feulner wrote. ""We take great exception to this misuse of our work and abuse of our name. This is but the latest act in a campaign to sell this big-government program as a moderate law that incorporates conservative ideas. Americans should not be fooled.""Feulner went on to argue that ""the president knows full well — or he ought to learn before he speaks — that the exchanges we and most others support are very different from those in his package. True exchanges are simply a market mechanism to enable families to choose their health insurance. President Obama’s exchanges, by contrast, are a vehicle to introduce sweeping regulation and federal standardization on health insurance.""Heritage continued its campaign against Obama's claim in an April 19, 2010, op-ed column in the Washington Post. The director of Heritage's Center for Health Policy Studies, Robert Moffit, wrote that ""the version of the exchange we did develop couldn't be more different than that embodied in this law."" He charged that ""the Obama health-care law 'builds' on the Heritage health reform model only in the sense that, say, a double-quarter-pounder with cheese 'builds' on the idea of a garden salad. Both have lettuce and tomato and may be called food, but the similarities end there.""We see two related, but distinct, questions here. The first is whether Heritage did in fact ""originate"" the idea of health insurance exchanges. The second is whether the exchange prescribed by the new law mirrors the one that Heritage has supported.• Did Heritage originate the idea? Our research suggests that while Heritage has advocated for health insurance exchanges for many years, others did, too. Scholars credit Alain C. Enthoven -- an emeritus professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business who worked in the Defense Department during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations -- with popularizing the idea for an exchange as many as three decades ago.Still, there's little doubt that Heritage has been a consistent and eager promoter of the exchange idea, especially during the effort to design a new health care system for Massachusetts. That effort concluded with the Democratic legislature joining with the Republican governor, Romney, to implement a system that includes a health insurance exchange.On numerous occasions, Heritage scholars wrote approvingly of the exchange system in Massachusetts, known as the Connector. In a paper about the Massachusetts plan published on April 11, 2006, Edmund Haislmaier, a Heritage fellow in health care policy, wrote of the ""truly significant and transformative health system changes that the legislation would set in motion.""Specifically, Haislmaier wrote that ""this concept of organizing a state's insurance markets around a central clearinghouse represents a dramatic departure from recent state health insurance reform proposals. States have spent the past 15 years trying to expand health care coverage to small-business employees, with virtually no positive results. The Massachusetts legislation represents a bipartisan commitment to move away from the policies that have largely failed to make progress in covering the uninsured for the past 15 years.""In another paper, titled, ""The Rationale for a Statewide Health Insurance Exchange,"" and published on Oct. 5, 2006, Heritage scholar Robert Moffit wrote that ""the best option is a health insurance market exchange."" Comparing it to a farmers' market or the used-car dealer CarMax, Moffit said the exchange ""would expand coverage and choice"" and would represent ""a revolutionary change in the health insurance market.""Journalists seemed to give Heritage credit, as well. During 2006, columns and articles citing Heritage's role in promoting the health exchange idea ran in such publications as the Washington Post, the Dallas Morning News, the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the National Review.We feel the president is largely right on this point. The idea for exchanges may have ""originated"" outside Heritage, but in well over a decade leading up to the introduction of the president's health care plan, Heritage clearly took a high-profile role in touting it, culminating in the proposal enacted in Massachusetts. And given that, they can hardly be shocked that the president is noting the think tank's role in developing the overall concept (even if he did so in a self-serving way).• Is it the same idea? After Obama made his comment, we spoke to both Haislmaier and to Stuart Butler, Heritage's vice president for domestic policy. Both argued that the plan now enacted into law is fundamentally different in structure than the one Heritage advocated.""What Obama and Capitol Hill did was to take a mainstream idea and push it toward a much more interventionist, regulatory model, as opposed to the original idea, which was more market-based,"" Butler said in an interview.To prevent Heritage scholars from moving the goalposts after the fact, we decided to analyze how similar the proposals are only by referring to policy stances that can be documented in briefing papers published prior to Obama's election. We found at least four papers that spoke directly to the health insurance exchange idea, and in these papers, we noticed several passages that advocated elements of an exchange that differ from how the bill was ultimately written.Here are some of those differences:-- Who can use the exchange? In a 2006 paper, Moffit wrote, ""Ideally, an exchange should be open to all state residents and all interested employers, regardless of the size of the firm, who want to arrange health insurance through the exchange.""That's not the case with the exchanges in the new law -- at least not any time soon. When the exchanges go live in 2014, they will only be open to people already buying insurance on the individual market (that is, those buying insurance independent of their employer) and to employees of small businesses with up to 100 employees. A provision does allow employees of businesses with more than 100 employees to purchase coverage from the exchange, but not until 2017, and only if their state decides to allow it. (The exception is that employees who are paying too large a percentage of their income on their employer-based health insurance will be eligible in 2014.)-- How much federal regulation will there be? Heritage scholars have regularly argued that the key regulatory role for the exchanges should be handled by the states, rather than the federal government.In a 2007 paper, Butler wrote that ""each state would determine on its own such features as the infrastructure for handling premiums, as well as the regulations and requirements for accepting insurance plans into the exchange. The state also would be responsible for determining pooling, reinsurance, and risk adjustment arrangements and the degree to which firms would, if at all, be required to offer plans available through the exchange to their employees.""It's true that the new health care law will create state-based exchanges. However, they will have to adhere to many federal requirements.For instance, the federal law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to define an ""essential health benefits package"" (and update its details every year). This will become the minimum package offered on the exchanges. The law also limits plans sold on the exchange to charging differential premiums only based on age (in a 3-to-1 ratio), geography, family composition and tobacco use (on a 1.5-to-1 ratio). And health plans on the exchange will have to abide by an assortment of other rules governing marketing requirements, provider networks and standards for presenting information to consumers.-- How portable will insurance be? In a 2007 paper published by Heritage, researcher Connie Marshner argued that health insurance exchanges would promote portability of health insurance. ""When individuals are able to purchase health insurance for themselves in an (exchange) marketplace, the insurance belongs to them,"" Marshner wrote. ""Even if they change jobs, move, or quit working and retire, they own the policy and can keep the same health insurance if they so choose.""That should be the case for many people on the health care law's exchange, especially those who bought their insurance individually, as long as states don't erect high barriers that bar people from moving from one state's exchange to another. But full portability will be unlikely for those who purchased insurance on the exchange with the help of their employer. While the exchange should make it easier for those switching jobs to find new insurance, there will most likely be a disruption when that employee switches companies -- and whenever there's a disruption in coverage, there's a likelihood that their plan will have to change to one degree or another.So where does this leave us?Edwin Park, a senior fellow with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, sees significant similarities in approach despite the differences outlined above. Park said the differences involved ""rules of the road within the exchange, rather than fundamental differences in the underlying concept or structure.""Henry Aaron, a fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, called the new health care law ""a close relative"" of Heritage's plan -- ""not identical to be sure, but a sibling or at least a first cousin. The essence is that you have a government or nonprofit entity that regulates the sale of insurance to individuals or businesses in order to standardize offerings and to control selling methods in order to produce real, head-to-head competition and to provide customers information in forms they can readily understand. ... Yes, they are all different; but they are all of the same family. ""We also solicited the views of conservative policy experts beyond Heritage.One -- Tevi Troy, a visiting senior fellow at the Hudson Institute -- thought Heritage had a legitimate gripe. ""In the policy world, there is often a vast gulf between theoretical ideas and policies as implemented, and this case is no exception,"" Troy said. ""While Heritage had been a leading advocate for health insurance exchanges, the law as written creates something so different from what Heritage sought that I understand why they want to remove their name from the list of proponents.""However, we heard from nine people affiliated with conservative policy organizations other than Heritage who thought that the president's statement was reasonably accurate.Seven of them declined to publicly express their differences with Heritage for fear of making waves within the tight-knit conservative policy world. But two did allow their names to be used. One was Dan Miller, executive vice president of the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, who acknowledged that Obama's statement was so carefully worded that the president ""was able to exploit"" the issue ""for his own ends.""The other was Daniel McCarthy, senior editor of the American Conservative magazine who has written recently about the conservative origins of the president's health care plan.""Every think tank on the left and right knows that its recommendations will undergo some deformation before they make their way into law, if they ever do,"" McCarthy told PolitiFact. ""Heritage might prefer state insurance exchanges with greater individual choice, including for workers already covered by their employers. But I don't imagine Ed Feulner would be complaining at all if a Republican president or a Republican Congress had passed a plan that deviated from the Heritage blueprint to the same degree that Obama's bill has. While it's not true that 'lots of' the specifics in the Obama plan were dreamed up by Heritage, the overall approach is similar to policies Heritage has long championed, including the individual mandate as well as the insurance exchanges. This is only controversial because the wrong party happened to pass the law, and it's poison for any conservative to be identified with it.""We agree with Heritage that the differences between its original vision and the version enacted into law are not trivial, and are enough to undercut the president's effort to secure a Heritage Foundation seal of approval for his bill. But the president helped his case by wording his statement with extreme care. Intentionally or not, he gave himself subtle linguistic running room by saying that ""a lot of the ideas"" for the exchange came from Heritage, including the concept of ""just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market."" Even if not all of the ideas in the two plans are identical, we feel that it was fair of him to say that ""a lot of the ideas"" are in common, including the notion of pooling. So we conclude that the president's statement qualifies as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F0BB40>],/factchecks/2010/apr/01/barack-obama/obama-says-heritage-foundation-source-health-excha/

Rapper J. Xavier says Farouk Shami is on fire
","
Stop, drop and roll? 
Houston businessman and first-time candidate Farouk Shami wasn't successful in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but we're still, um, singing his praises for a song his campaign debuted the night before the primary election. 
From a March 1 press release issued by his campaign: ""In a last-minute push to win supporters and motivate Texans to go to the polls tomorrow, Farouk Shami has publicly released the song 'Farouk' ..."" 
Playing on the well-worn lyric ""the roof is on fire,"" 17-year-old Houston hip-hop artist J. Xavier penned a catchy refrain that stuck: ""Farouk, Farouk, Farouk is on fire, serving da community his number one desire."" 
We wonder: Was Shami ever on fire? 
First, let's review the lyrics the campaign sent in March. 
Who got da new solutions for Texas... Farouk! / when it comes to da state who's gon rep it... Farouk! / now say it Farouk Farouk Farouk is on fire / serving da community his number one desire...  
Came to America 44 years ago / 71 dollars to his name now dat's pocket change / kinda like President Obama a few years ago, in his mind frame it's time to change / creating Texas jobs & reforming health care / he cares if nobody else cares, elsewhere / providing quality education / preserving our environment / Farouk is on fire please call da fireman / his drive is inspiring / lives he inspire them... 
Xavier, a Houston native, wrote ""Tell Your Mama to Vote for Obama"" during the 2008 presidential campaign, but that song made no reference to pyrotechnics. 
However, chants of ""fired up, ready to go"" were often heard during Obama's campaign rallies. 
Shami falls in line with a other office-seekers who have dabbled with fire. The late Reagan Brown, who once served as state agriculture commissioner, infamously stuck his hand in a fire-ant mound as a campaign stunt in 1982, only to have the fiery pests swarm up and bite his arm. 
What about Shami's personal relationship with fire? 
On Nov. 19, the Houston Chronicle reported that Shami had come ""under fire"" when a conservative commentator claimed his support for Palestinian rights put him opposition to Israel. The Chronicle later pointed out that Shami could fire his employees, some of whom quit rather than be fired. 
We couldn't reach Shami to gauge if he was ever truly ""on fire."" 
But seeing as we've previously rated a Shami statement as Pants on Fire, he definitely was en fuego here. 
So, we must rate J. Xavier's statement as True. 
And we wish you a happy April Fools' Day.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1A9E80>],/factchecks/2010/apr/01/j-xavier/rapper-j-xavier-says-farouk-shami-fire/

U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns says Cuba and China are partnering to drill for oil off Florida's coast
","Longtime Ocala U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns, a proponent of increased oil and natural gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, says drilling may be coming near Florida's shores whether we like it or not.""Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch, as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast,"" Stearns says on his campaign Web site.Stearns' point -- that if Cuba is going to drill anyway, why shouldn't we -- is obvious. But are his facts right? First some background. In 1977, Cuba and the United States negotiated maritime boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico and the waters south of the Florida Keys, called the Florida Straits, according to the U.S. Department of State. The boundaries, called Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), give countries special rights of exploration and marine usage. Mexico, Cuba and the United States all have Exclusive Economic Zones in the Gulf of Mexico, and Cuba and the United States control the Florida Straits. You can see a map of the boundaries here. When it comes to oil, Cuba decides who drills in its EEZ -- and the money and oil that may come from it -- and the United States controls who can drill in its territory. The United States currently bans drilling in much of the eastern Gulf of Mexico (including waters within 234 miles of Tampa Bay, and 300 miles from Naples), and all of its portion of the Florida Straits. But on March 31, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed to open new areas to oil and gas exploration along the eastern seaboard south of New Jersey and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico within 125 miles of Florida's coast. U.S. drilling would still be banned in the Florida Straits under Obama's proposal. Now onto Cuba, the heart of Stearns' claim. Cuba's maritime boundary in the Florida Straits extends to within 45 miles of the Florida Keys, as Stearns suggests. Cuba, unlike the United States, has no drilling moratorium. Its EEZ includes a total of 74,000 square miles, and is broken down by the country into 59 areas. In 2002, Cuba's state-run oil company, Cubapetroleo (often called Cupet), started leasing individual areas to foreign oil companies in both the Florida Straits and the Gulf of Mexico for exploration. So far, Cuba has leased 15 of the 59 areas, said Jorge Pinon, a former oil executive with Shell and Amoco who is an expert on Cuba's energy sector and a former energy fellow with the University of Miami's Center for Hemispheric Policy. The areas leased include the waters just north and to the northwest of Cuba. The waters closest to the United States have not yet been leased. Who holds the rights to the areas? Oil and gas companies based in Spain, Norway, India, Malaysia, Venezuela, Vietnam and Brazil. But not China.China has an onshore, land-based lease in Cuba but not an offshore lease, Pinon said.A February 2008 analysis by the Congressional Research Service backs this up. ""While there has been some concern about China's potential involvement in offshore deepwater oil projects,"" the report read, ""to date its involvement in Cuba's oil sector has been focused on onshore oil extraction in Pinar del Rio province through its state-run China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation."" However, that could be changing. The China National Petroleum Corporation is negotiating a lease for four areas in the waters northwest of Cuba, Pinon said. The areas under negotiation are among those northwest of Cuba, farther away from the United States. Is there drilling happening, now?""No,"" Pinon said.Here's why: The decades-old embargo between the United States and Cuba makes oil production much more difficult for Cuba (which now imports about two-thirds of its oil from Venezuela). Under terms of the embargo, Cuba would not be able to send its oil to the United States to be refined into gasoline and other petroleum products. And the companies drilling off Cuba's coast wouldn't be able to rely on American parts and machinery for drilling.""Cuba doesn't have refinery capacity,"" Pinon said. ""That oil should come to the U.S. gulf coast where we have refineries where we can process that crude oil. But the embargo doesn't allow that."" Trying to linking China and Cuba when talking U.S. oil policy is nothing new. In 2008, then-Vice President Dick Cheney told the board of directors of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that ""oil is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of Florida. But we're not doing it, the Chinese are, in cooperation with the Cuban government. Even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply.""Cheney, who said the information came from a column by George Will, later walked back his remarks. So did Will, as part of a correction.Stearns' Congressional office, realizing Cheney's misstatement, noted that Stearns said that ""Cuba wants to let China"" drill, not that China is drilling. The distinction is important. Spokesman Paul Flusche also said the information on Stearns' campaign Web site hasn't been updated since 2008, so the information could be out of date.On this point, it really isn't.Stearns' statement, when it comes to specifics, is a little sloppy. He said: ""Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch, as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast.""Cuba is negotiating a lease with China for offshore oil exploration, but it's not in the ""very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch."" Cuba controls its own offshore, just like the United States. And the Chinese lease wouldn't be 45 miles from the Florida coast. The areas closest to the United States haven't been leased yet. But he's right in suggesting that Cuba could end up drilling closer to U.S. shores than America currently allows in its offshore waters. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097169F00>],/factchecks/2010/mar/31/cliff-stearns/cliff-stearns-cuba-china-oil-drilling/
"['Environment', 'National', 'Energy', 'Barack Obama']","
Once wobbly, Obama not inconsistent in latest oil drilling proposal
","President Barack Obama is back to doing his shake and shimmy on the offshore drilling issue.On March 31, 2010, he announced that he'd be opening up new coastal areas to oil production. ""And in the short term, as we transition to cleaner energy sources, we’ll have to make tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development in ways that protect communities and coastlines,"" he said in his announcement at Andrews Air Force Base. ""This is not a decision that I’ve made lightly... But the bottom line is this: given our energy needs, in order to sustain economic growth, produce jobs, and keep our businesses competitive, we’re going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable, homegrown energy.""In 2008, we gave him a Half Flip because early in his campaign he said he intended to maintain the long-standing moratorium barring drilling off the Florida coast, telling oil companies to drill on the land they already had leased. Then, amid soaring gas prices in the summer of 2008, he shifted and announced he was receptive to a plan for opening new areas for drilling. On Aug. 1, 2008, Obama said he would compromise and support the New Energy Reform Act of 2008, a bipartisan bill that, in addition to spending $84 billion on the development of better batteries and energy-and-fuel saving technologies, would have allowed for drilling for oil and natural gas as close as 50 miles from Florida's west coast. ""Like all compromises, it also includes steps that I haven't always supported,"" Obama said in his announcement. ""I remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short-term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long-term, though I do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact. But I've always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis, and today's package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning."" By the time he won the race for the White House, Obama was squarely behind some new efforts to produce more oil domestically. Before Obama took office, former President George W. Bush lifted that ban on new oil and gas leases and ordered a five-year plan for awarding new leases. After Obama took office, Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar extended the public comment period on those proposals. And that brings us to Obama's most recent announcement, which would open even more areas for drilling -- including some originally proposed under the Bush administration. We wondered whether Obama had shifted even further since he took office. His strategy calls for developing oil and gas resources in new areas, including in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and increasing exploration in parts of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. Other areas, such as the environmentally vulnerable Bristol Bay in Alaska, would remain protected.At the same time, Obama also announced new efforts to green the federal fleet of vehicles and the upcoming finalization of a new rule establishing greenhouse gas emission reductions for some vehicles. Defenders of Wildlife, a national environmental group, pointed out that Obama's plan may reverse a 2006 effort to protect waters near Florida through 2022 that Obama had voted for as a senator. But again, our benchmark for this analysis is where Obama stood on the issue back in the summer of 2008, when we last visited the issue. We asked a number of environmental groups if they thought the announcement represented a dramatic shift for the Obama administration, and the resounding response is that they oppose the plan, but it's also no surprise given where Obama was on the issue the day he was elected to office. Josh Dorner, a spokesman for Sierra Club, said that it ""doesn't seem to be a huge step away from where he ended up at the end of the campaign. We're disappointed, but we're not surprised.""Adam Rivera, an advocate for Environment Florida, said it's a dramatic change from where Obama started out when he was first running for office, but ""it isn't necessarily that surprising given the rhetoric on the campaign.""And Enid Sisskin, a representative for Gulf Coast Environmental Defense, agreed that she was not surprised, although she thought it was a ""terrible, stupid idea.""So, has Obama gone from a Half Flip to a Full Flop on the issue of offshore drilling? Not if you're basing the ruling on his position on Election Day.   Back in August 2008, he did clearly change his stance on the issue. This time, according to all the environmental advocates and experts we spoke with, his latest announcement isn't much of a departure from his rhetoric during the last part of the campaign and during his first year in the White House. As a result, we say there's been No Flip in Obama's latest stance on offshore drilling.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC9AC0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/31/barack-obama/once-wobbly-obama-not-inconsistent-latest-oil-dril/

Gov. Rick Perry cites GOP complaint against Democratic foe Bill White for not reporting $83,000 to state
","GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign excels at producing provocative videos, the latest one attacking Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White with excerpts from Texas TV newscasts about a Republican complaint against White. A link to the “Liberal Bill” video went to reporters on Friday accompanied by this message: “This week liberal Bill White faced an ethics complaint about more than $83,000 he failed to report to the state Ethics Commission.” Undisputed: Such a complaint was filed by the Perry-allied Republican Party of Texas. The commission hasn't ruled on it. Unproven: Perry's characterization of White as ""liberal."" That label, which isn't backed up in Perry's statement or the video, might not reflect White's record. For now, we'll let the word slide as a rhetorical swipe. Our lingering question: Did White fail to report more than $83,000 to the state, as Perry's campaign says? In a March 23 complaint to the Texas Ethics Commission, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party, states that White’s state-required personal financial statement, submitted in February, lists no income received in 2009 from Wedge Services, LLC though White separately reported $83,677 in wages from Wedge Services on his 2009 federal tax return. White acknowledges that his tax return, which he recently made public, specifies his Wedge Services’ income as part of “Wages Received and Taxes Withheld.” He also admits that his personal financial statement doesn’t have an entry showing Wedge paying him. But, White says, there’s a reasonable explanation; he wasn’t required to detail his Wedge Services’ income—which was deferred compensation—on his personal financial statement in the way it's spelled out on his tax return. White last worked for the company in 2003. While there's no one entry on the financial statement showing Wedge Services paying White, his campaign says the income came from a brokerage account, invested in stocks and mutual funds, that was established for his deferred compensation. We confirmed that a list of the stocks and funds provided by White's campaign is on his ethics filing. While it's possible to estimate how many shares of stock White's family had in five entities plus the number of shares he had in three mutual funds, the form doesn't show the total value of such holdings or precisely how much income they produced. But proceeds are shown in categories such as $5,000 to $9,999. The categories enable anyone (provided they get help from the White campaign identifying relevant stocks and mutual funds) to estimate that White took in $36,500 to $94,992 in 2009 due to his holdings in the Wedge-originated brokerage account. In a March 25 sworn statement, White states the “proper recording” took place with the commission based on instructions for filing the statement and conversations with commission attorneys before and after the filing. Confusing? There's a reason. The Texas law governing personal financial statements doesn’t speak explicitly to reporting deferred compensation. Broadly, the relevant section (which runs about 900 words) states that each statement must reflect the filing individual’s financial activity in the preceding calendar year including a list of “all sources of occupational income."" Filers must identify any person or group from which they received fees or retainers paid in advance of future services. They also must report income from stocks, bonds, notes and other commercial paper, plus each source of more than $500 from interest, dividends, royalties and rents. There's more to report, according to the law, but there's no mention of deferred compensation. We found no past commission opinions on whether filers have to specify income from deferred compensation. Austin lawyer Buck Wood, an expert on ethics law, agreed there's nothing on the record. ""That's a new one on me,"" Wood said. Could White have reported the money from Wedge Services to the state in the same way he did on his federal tax return anyway? Of course—if only to avoid shots like the one fired by the Texas GOP. Not the point, his campaign said, stressing that White consulted accountants to make sure he complied with the law. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said a CPA for White spoke to an attorney for the ethics commission the day after the GOP filed its complaint. Bacon said Robert Mannas, an assistant general counsel for the commission, told the CPA, Nancy Wakefield, that White had reported his income correctly. Bacon said the commission's general counsel, Natalia Luna Ashley, later cautioned that Mannas's advice didn't constitute a ruling on the complaint. Commission spokesman Tim Sorrells declined to comment on Bacon's account. Generally, Sorrells said, whether anyone has complied with relevant laws and commission rules is a call for the agency's eight appointed commission members to make. So, where does this leave Perry’s statement? White does face a complaint, but Perry's statement leaves out a key piece of context: That complaint was filed by the GOP. And it's misleading to conclude, as Perry's statement does, that White failed to report more than $83,000 to the commission. White's camp said he accounted for his deferred compensation as directed. The law doesn't specify if or how candidates should report deferred compensation. We rate Perry’s statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F02240>],/factchecks/2010/mar/31/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-cites-complaint-against-democratic-/
