Is 20 percent of housing in Portland’s Pearl District really affordable?
","
In a recent guest column in The Oregonian, Metro president Tom Hughes talked up the benefits of spending public money on urban renewal projects. One of his examples was the well-groomed Pearl District in Portland’s Northwest quarter.

""In Portland, urban renewal-based investments in roads, parks, sidewalks and streetcars spurred $3 billion of investment in private projects that repaired dilapidated buildings and created new ones on vacant and underutilized land in the Pearl District. Today, the Pearl supports thousands of homes -- 20 percent affordable -- and many new middle-class jobs.""

A PolitiFact Oregon reader wondered if the part about affordable housing was true. We did too. One-fifth isn’t that big, but it might make us think twice about painting the entire neighborhood as filthy rich.

Let’s back up. In 1998, the Portland City Council created the River District Urban Renewal area -- which includes the Pearl -- gradually transforming a cluster of empty buildings into a bustling neighborhood. Old Town/Chinatown, Tanner Creek and Union Station are included in this district.

City leaders were concerned about the effect of development on housing, so the next year, they endorsed a housing strategy that called for 5,000 new housing units by 2020. Here are the goals: 
We know we’re throwing a lot of numbers at you. But please, bear with us while we tackle the question of how the city met those goals.  

According to the PDC’s latest report, in 2007, about a quarter of the 7,400 units in the River District could be afforded by households in the lower two income brackets. The affordability percentage climbed to 40 percent with families up to 80 percent of median income.

But remember, these figures include Old Town/Chinatown, a grittier neighborhood by the river that has long served the poor and homeless. In fact, much of the river district’s low-income diversity comes from Old Town/Chinatown, with 97 percent of 1,338 housing units open to people at 80 percent or less of median income.

On the opposite end, only 16 percent of 3,156 units in the ""Central Pearl"" are open to households in the three lower income brackets. In fact, more than 70 percent of homes in the Pearl are for households at 120 percent or more of median income. So it’s as we suspected. The Pearl caters to the wealthy!

More important to PolitiFact Oregon, these figures don’t back up Hughes, who specifically cited housing in the Pearl.

We turned to Jim Middaugh, Metro’s communications director. He said Hughes was trying to make the point that development in urban renewal areas, including the Pearl, had ""a broad set of benefits for all income classes,"" including housing. Middaugh also argued for including Tanner Creek as part of the Pearl in our analysis. 
We re-considered. The Tanner Creek neighborhood at the north end of the River District is not as built up as the area between Burnside and Lovejoy, but it has attracted in recent years a Safeway supermarket, a chic park with a water feature, and several high-end restaurants that claim to be in the Pearl.

If we include the nearly 1,200 units in Tanner Creek, the percentage of homes affordable to low and very low income households grows to 15. The percentage grows to 23 if we include households earning up to 80 percent of median income. That would back up Hughes’ statement. 
We know others might view the ""Pearl"" in Hughes’ statement as the development cluster along Burnside and not the area north of Lovejoy. 
But in PolitiFact Oregon's humble opinion, we think it's fair to include Tanner Creek as part of the Pearl District because of its design layout, proximity and amenities. Dave Davis, president of the Pearl District Neighborhood Association, concurs that Tanner Creek is solidly within his group’s boundaries. In fact, the residential Pearl District stretches from Burnside to the river, and Broadway to Interstate-405, according to a map.

We rate the statement Mostly True, and that’s not meant as a knock on Hughes. What he said is accurate, but it needs a tiny clarification on what is included in the Pearl.

The largest numbers of gamblers come from poorest segment of population, says Florida Family Policy Council
","
In the ongoing war about gambling in Florida, some critics have turned to the Bible to state their case.

The Florida Family Policy Council, an Orlando-based conservative Christian organization, has sided with gambling opponents. In a post on its blog, the council poses the question Is Gambling Morally Wrong?

The blog post from Oct. 20, 2011, uses partial quotes from Wayne Grudem, a theology professor at Phoenix Seminary in Arizona and author of the book Politics According to the Bible:

""My own judgment is that large commercial gambling outlets such as casinos and state-sponsored lotteries bring much more harm to a society than the benefits they generate (such as tax revenue)… First, it is socially harmful (and fiscally regressive) because the largest numbers of gamblers comes from the poorest segments of the population. Second, (it) leads to an addiction to gambling … and this addiction destroys marriages, families … and increases societal breakdown. Third, studies have shown that where gambling businesses are established, crime rates increase."" (Here is the page in the book that contains these quotes.)

There are a few interesting claims in that statement but for this Truth-O-Meter we will explore whether the largest number of gamblers come from the poorest segments of the population.

The council's president, John Stemberger, said the blog was about gambling in general, not just casinos or lotteries in Florida.

Gambling is a hot topic in Florida. Two South Florida Republican state legislators -- Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff and Rep. Erik Fresen -- have proposed opening the door to full-scale gambling by allowing three mega-resort casinos to bid on licenses for Las Vegas-style games. One company, Genting, has proposed a massive casino for downtown Miami.  

We reviewed six studies that included information about gambling and income as well as several news articles or websites. We also interviewed about a dozen academics who have studied gambling. Some of the sources came from Stemberger and Grudem, while others came from professors, the gambling industry or gambling opponents. 

The research we examined fell into a few general categories. 
Research from the casino industry. Not surprisingly, those involved in the casino industry found that the bulk of their visitors are middle or upper-class. American Gaming Association's 2011 State of the States survey of casino entertainment states that compared to the general population, casino visitors are less likely to have a household income of less than $35,000 and more likely to have incomes between $35,000 and $100,000. ""The demographic profile of casino visitors is similar to that of the general U.S. population. While men are more likely to have visited a casino than women, and the average casino visitor is slightly older, the breakdown by income and level of education mirrors that of the general population."" (For more from the casino industry check out Harrah's 2006 survey.)

Lottery studies. There is a lot of evidence -- some focused on particular cities or states -- that lotteries draw in poor people. 

""A number of studies have investigated the demographic predictors of lottery gambling and have tended to find that, on average, state lottery products are disproportionately consumed by the poor...,"" states this 2005 Brookings Institution paper. ""Average annual lottery spending in dollar amounts is roughly equal across the lowest, middle and highest income groups. This implies that on average, low-income households spend a larger percentage of their wealth on lottery tickets than other households."" 

One of the best examples we found was this 1998 investigation by the Washington Post, which found that the lotteries in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia rely on ""a hard core of heavy players, who, on average, have less education and lower incomes than the population as a whole, according to lottery documents and data."" For example, among heavy players in Virginia, ""one in six had household incomes of less than $15,000, according to the lottery data."" In Washington, data showed that ""the city's most anemic lottery market lies west of Rock Creek Park in an area with the highest education and income levels and the thinnest concentration of minorities."" (To find more articles or studies about gambling in particular cities or states, check out this bibliography at the end of this article or from this anti-casino group.)

Researchers at Duke University published a 1999 report, ""State Lotteries at the Turn of the Century."" It found that lottery participation increased as people made more income but only up to the $100,000-per-year level. Still, among those who do play, ""players with incomes less than $50,000 spend more than others, and the lower income categories have the highest per capita spending,"" it said. 
One of the report's co-authors, Philip Cook, told PolitiFact in an e-mail that his research shows ""poorer households spend a higher percentage of their income on state lotteries (which are the most common form of gambling). The percentage who participate in lottery play is not higher for low income households. But those who do play, play a lot."" 

National gambling research. The most extensive research we reviewed stemmed from The National Gambling Impact Study Commission, a 1999 report done for the federal government. For that study, The National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago published a 768-page report compiling surveys of nearly 3,000 gamblers and non-gamblers. 

The report included detailed statistics on gambling, by income and by type of game. 
To summarize the report's key findings, we turned to Dean Gerstein, the report's principal investigator who now works as a vice provost and professor at Claremont Graduate University.

""If you define gambling fairly broadly — placing a bet on a game of chance at least once in a lifetime, or once in the past year, or even once in the past month — then members of the poorest segment of the population are, in general, less likely to gamble than members of the middle segments. By any reasonable definition, the largest numbers of gamblers are clearly not poor,"" he wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact. ""The richest Americans, the 10 percent or so with incomes greater than $100,000/year, are actually the most likely to spend money gambling -- as they are to spend money on everything else, since they have far more money to spend. But since this group of well-off people is relatively small, only 10 percent of the population, the number of gamblers from the middle income segments ($25,000 - $100,000) is much larger.""

But when poor people gamble, a larger proportion have serious problems related to their gambling than wealthier people, Gerstein said. ""In general, gambling very heavily doesn’t do nearly as much damage to rich people as it does to poor people — rich people can afford to throw away a lot more money on gambling without getting into hot water."" 

What the experts and Stemberger said

Many of our experts said the council's claim was too vague -- research about gambling and income typically specifies the type of gambling, the frequency, and sometimes the location. The regular purchaser of lottery tickets at a store in inner-city Baltimore probably isn't the same as the occasional high roller at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. 

""In my opinion this is a poorly worded and misleading statement,"" said David Just, an economics professor at Cornell, who has studied poverty and lotteries. ""By no means does this group constitute the majority of those playing the lottery. Those in poverty are just 16 percent of the U.S. population. They do not outspend the other 84 percent of the country. There is some evidence that a larger proportion of them play, but this is weak evidence and heavily disputed. It is widely believed they spend a higher portion of their income than wealthier individuals. While I can sympathize with the motive behind the FFPC (Florida Family Policy Council) statement, it seems they should have been more careful in making their argument. Lottery tickets and casino visitors are really different crowds for the most part.""  
John Welte, a senior research scientist at the Research Institute on Addictions at Buffalo State University of New York who wrote about geographic factors and gambling in this article, told us that the council's claim was wrong.

""That statement is not correct,"" Welte said in an e-mail. ""Gamblers are generally not more common in the poorest segments, although poorer gamblers tend to gamble more often. What is true, and perhaps more relevant, is that problem gamblers are more prevalent in the poorest segments of society.""

But research shows that lotteries can hurt the poor. 
""The bottom line is a lot of this gambling is directed toward the poorer segments of society who are spending proportionally more,"" said John Kindt, a business administration professor at the University of Illinois who studies gambling. Kindt said he was speaking primarily about lotteries but that lotteries are like a gateway drug to creating new addictive gamblers. ""We are making poor people poorer.""

We sent our findings to Stemberger, and he asked us to consider two additional reports. One was a 1997 article from the Minneapolis Star Tribune about a study of state treatment programs for problem gamblers that found that poor problem gamblers had debts proportionally higher than more affluent gamblers. But the article stated, ""state officials said they couldn't conclude that compulsive gamblers are disproportionately poor. That's because state-funded programs may attract the poor more than affluent people who have insurance or other options for treatment.""

Stemberger also pointed to studies about gambling in Wisconsin. This 1995 study of Native American casinos found gamers have an average household income of between $20,000 and $30,000 a year. Fewer than 15 percent enjoy household incomes in excess of $60,000, while almost 30 percent have household incomes less than $20,000. But the study didn't state that the gamblers were disproportionately poor compared to the population near the casinos. 

Our ruling 
The council's blog stated ""the largest numbers of gamblers comes from the poorest segments of the population."" The council's president said he was speaking in general about gambling -- not specific to lotteries or casinos or to any specific location. The data about the income demographics of gamblers must be explained in the context of the type, frequency and sometimes location of gambling. There is a lot of data to suggest that lottery sales outlets are concentrated in poor neighborhoods and that poor lottery ticket buyers end up spending a higher portion of their income. But that isn't what the council claimed. And the research about lotteries would not necessarily apply to the Las Vegas-style casinos that the Florida legislature is now considering. We rate this claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2011/nov/18/john-stemberger/largest-numbers-gamblers-come-poor/

Biden says middle income earners lost ground before the recession
","
Vice President Joe Biden visited a New Hampshire university Oct. 20, 2011, to promote President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act before an audience whom he called ""the 9/11 generation.""

Speaking to a full house inside Plymouth State University’s lecture hall, Biden talked about the need to restore the middle class and to bring jobs back to America. He said middle-income-earning Americans have been ""under siege,"" long before the economic recession hit.

""In the previous decade, before the current recession, the middle class was getting killed,"" said Biden. ""During that period between 2001-07, productivity of American workers was up 20 percent, but median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 during this time.""

Did the median of middle-income households really take a $2,100 hit before the economy hit the fan?  We looked into Biden’s claim to find out.

First we contacted Biden’s staff to find out which figures they were using to come to the $2,100 decrease in the median income for middle-class households.

Tobin Marcus, Biden’s deputy economic policy adviser, told us the vice president was referring to real median household income for working age households. ""We’re looking at the core wage-earning households as opposed to retirees,"" Marcus said.

""Working age households"" are typically considered houses headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 54, and the median income was chosen to represent middle income wage earners.

Biden’s office cited the Census Bureau’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Surveys for year-ending data for 2000 and 2007.

They said they compared inflation-adjusted numbers, using the ""annual average"" increase column of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index.

We took a look at their numbers, and their calculations checked out.

To be sure, we contacted Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies and a New Hampshire State Forecast Manager for the New England Economic Partnership.

He confirmed the calculations Biden’s campaign provided.

""I looked at the data sources, and they appear to be correct, and the data calculated correctly,"" Delay said.

Delay then pointed us to a report by the Economic Policy Institute which used the same data. From 2000-07, the Institute said the real median income of working age households fell from $61,574 in 2000 to $59,460 in 2007—a decrease of $2,114.

The White House Task Force on the Middle Class cited a ""weak labor market"" and ""anemic job growth of the 2000s"" among some of the problems that contributed to the approximately 3.4 percent decline in the median of middle class incomes over the seven years leading up to the economic recession.

""Clearly median inflation adjusted income fell much faster during the recession (2007 to present),"" Delay said. ""But the fall in that indicator during a period of economic expansion (2000 to 2007) is very troubling. I don’t believe any other period of economic expansion saw a commensurate decline in median inflation adjusted income.""

Our ruling:

Vice President Biden said the median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 from 2001-07, and the numbers check out. We rate Biden’s claim True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/18/joe-biden/biden-says-middle-income-earners-lost-ground-reces/

State Treasurer Kurt Schuller says recall petitions must be signed in presence of another person
","
Recall election season is underway again in Wisconsin, and there’s plenty of advice being bandied about. Sign the petitions, don’t sign them. You can do this, you can’t do that.

Some of it is deliberate confusion (or simplification) on the part of those who favor or opposed to recalling Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. Some of it is just general confusion about laws and rules that until recently most had never encountered.

The rules for signatures gathered on recall petitions to be valid are relatively simple. Yet missteps or flaws will be used by election officials to disallow signatures, or by Walker’s team in challenges. That’s one reason recall organizers are hoping to collect up to 700,000 signatures, well more than the 540,208 valid signatures required to trigger a recall election.

A key rule governing the petitions is meant to insure that they are signed in the presence of someone called the ""circulator.""

""You don’t want them sitting in the back of a church, in bars or on bulletin boards"" unattended, said  Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel for the state Government Accountability Board.

So when State Treasurer Kurt Schuller tweeted some legal advice about recall petitions, it caught our attention.

The first-term Republican treasurer and prolific tweeter (@WITreasSchuller) opposes the recall effort and offered his advice after he saw this tweet from a recall supporter called @Legaleagle: ""If you can’t make it to a petition signing location, print one at home, sign it and return it.""

Schuller re-tweeted that message with this advice: ""This is a violation of election law. All signers must sign in the presence of the circulator.""

Schuller told us he wanted to make it clear that the ""instructions that the tweeter gave out were wrong.""

""If everyone who saw that (tweet) followed those instructions exactly as they put it"" the petitions would be invalid, he said. ""That would be fraud. … For God’s sake, you’ve got to give them all of the information. If you just send back an individual affidavit, the election’s board won’t allow it.""

Kennedy, whose agency enforces election rules, said Schuller has a point. Each recall petition signer must do so in the presence of a circulator. But he’s wrong the key point: You can function as both the signer and the circulator.

""You can certify your own signature,"" Kennedy said.

It’s done all the time in other state races, including that for treasurer, where candidates must gather signatures on nomination papers, he said.  

And it’s not illegal. The elections board took up the matter on Nov. 9, 2011 as it relates to recall petitions. The decision was that if someone prints out a petition and signs it, they must sign it a second time, at the bottom, as a circulator.

So what do we make of the treasurer’s tweets?

Schuller said on Twitter that it’s a ""violation of election law"" to print out and sign your own recall petition. He said he was responding to a tweet he felt was incomplete. But it’s not a violation of election law. The same person can be both the signer and the circulator.

We have a 10-character response for our rating of Schuller’s tweet: It’s False.",/factchecks/2011/nov/18/kurt-schuller/state-treasurer-kurt-schuller-says-recall-petition/
"['Georgia', 'Financial Regulation', 'Herman Cain']","
Where does Cain stand on auditing the Federal Reserve?
","
Republican presidential candidate and Atlanta-area resident Herman Cain has encountered intense scrutiny in recent weeks for alleged sexual harassment, the viability of his 9-9-9 tax plan and, most recently, his difficulty with a question concerning President Obama’s policies on Libya.

But there’s another question that we here at PolitiFact Georgia just couldn’t let go.

Some GOP activists and Libertarians say the plain-spoken Cain is not shooting straight on whether he believes the Federal Reserve Bank needs to be regularly audited.

The issue has come up in recent months and arose anew during a debate last month. Cain and Texas congressman Ron Paul engaged in some verbal jousting over what Paul said has been a lack of support from Cain on the idea. Cain’s and Paul’s core constituency -- fiscal conservatives and strict constitutionalists -- is the same, and both men appear to be fighting for their support in the crowded field of Republican candidates.

Said Paul: ""Mr. Cain, in the past, you’ve been rather critical of any of us who would want to audit the Fed.""

Cain, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said as part of his reply, ""[T]o be precise, I do not object to the Federal Reserve being audited. I simply said if someone wants to initiate that option, go right ahead. It doesn’t bother me. So you — I’ve been misrepresented in that regard. I don’t have a problem with the Federal Reserve being audited. It’s simply not my top priority.""

We wondered if Cain flip-flopped on this issue, as some have claimed.

One website, The Liberty Papers, contained a blog post saying Cain ""is either a liar or has a very short memory"" concerning auditing the Federal Reserve. The site included audio from Cain to argue he’s changed his position.

Jason Pye, an Atlanta-area Libertarian activist who knows Cain, wrote a piece claiming the candidate has been dismissive of plans to audit the Federal Reserve. Pye said Cain has been as steady as Jell-O on auditing the Federal Reserve.

""Which story are you going to get with a President Cain?"" Pye told us. ""There’s an inconsistency there.""

In one video posted by DraftCain2012, the candidate wanted to change the subject with folks who wanted to talk about auditing the Federal Reserve. One man told Cain they can’t audit the Federal Reserve.

""We can audit them,"" Cain replied.

Cain told the crowd that they should focus on setting up a meeting with Federal Reserve officials and ask questions about what control measures the bank has in place. He called the Federal Reserve ""one of the tightest-run federal entities I have ever seen.""

Cain is asked specifically in that January meeting if he would ask for an audit of the Federal Reserve if elected president.

""But first we need to find out the audits that are already going on,"" Cain said, raising his arms in exasperation. ""What I’m saying is this request for an audit, I’m not sure if that’s the answer to any problem other than people think that they don’t want to be audited.""

In another YouTube clip, which is on other sites, there is audio of Cain from a guest appearance on ""The Neal Boortz Show"" discussing all of the audits already in place with the Federal Reserve.

""We don’t need to waste money … with another audit that’s unnecessary,"" Cain said.

That YouTube clip also contains video of Cain praising Paul’s efforts to get more information from the Federal Reserve, adding that the congressman ""will have the ability to require an audit of the Federal Reserve Bank"" as chairman of the House Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology Committee. Paul is currently chairman of that committee. The YouTube clip was posted on May 8, but it does not show when the video of Cain was filmed.

Cain tries to set the record straight in his new book, ""This Is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House,"" released in September, albeit with some acerbic language directed at Paul and some of his supporters.

""[T]hey’ve stretched the truth, saying that I did not want the Federal Reserve to be audited,"" Cain wrote. ""I have never said that. I have said: ‘I don’t’ think you’re going to find anything to audit on the Federal Reserve.’ But they want you to believe that Herman Cain doesn’t want the Federal Reserve to be audited.""

In general, Cain has said an audit is counterproductive, but he will not object to it. That is largely consistent with his statement at the debate. However, there have been occasions where Cain has been confusing on the topic, like when he appeared to take a more definitive stance, saying on Boortz’s show that ""we don’t need to waste money"" with an audit. Because of that confusion, we rate his position on auditing the Federal Reserve as a Half Flip.",/factchecks/2011/nov/18/herman-cain/where-does-cain-stand-auditing-federal-reserve/

Service Employees International Union President Philip Keefe says the state pension fund has enough money for the next 16 years
","
Leading up to Thursday’s debate over legislation to overhaul Rhode Island’s pension system, unions representing state employees pushed back hard. One of the questions they asked was ""What’s the rush?""

That theme came up during the Nov. 13 edition of WJAR-TV's ""10 News Conference"" when Jim Taricani asked Philip Keefe, president of the Service Employees International Union, Local 580,  whether he agreed with General Treasurer Gina Raimondo that there is a pension funding crisis.

""I don't think there's a crisis,"" he said.

Why?

""Because there's still $7.7 billion in the fund. This fund is not going to empty out tomorrow,"" he said. ""By the treasurer's own information that she provided to the advisory panel,  . . .  if they made no changes whatsoever, the plan still had enough money to go forward for approximately the next 16 years.

""So I've been advocating right along -- let's not rush this through. This is a problem that's been in the making for two decades. And now we're going to try to solve it in two weeks?""

In fact, the state has been trying to solve the problem for several years. But we were interested in whether the state employee pension plan is destined to run dry in 16 years -- around the year 2027.

We asked Keefe for his source and he referred us to Raimondo's June 2011 report, ""Truth In Numbers: The Security and Sustainability of Rhode Island's Retirement System."" On Page 9, it says a Boston College study said, ""Rhode Island's retirement plan for state employees and teachers could run completely out of assets between 2019 and 2023 (much sooner than most public plans in other states).""

That's 8 to 12 years, not 16.

To explain the variation, we looked at the full Boston College study, ""Can State and Local Pensions Muddle Through?"" dated March 2011 and written by experts at the Center for Retirement Research.

It predicts that the pension fund will run dry, and all the money that current employees had paid into their retirement system would be lost, in:

* 12 years (in 2023) if the system remained unchanged and the state's investments earned 8 percent;

* 11 years (in 2022) if the state's investments earned 6 percent;

* 8 years (in 2019) if the pension fund were frozen for existing employees and retirees, new workers were excluded and the rate of return was 6 percent.

The end could come a lot sooner. The actual annual rate of return during the last 10 years has been 2.28 percent after fees and administrative expenses.

We sent an e-mail asking Keefe why he said 16 years when the report he was citing said 8 to 12 years. He didn't respond.

So what would happen if the fund ran out of money?

The state is legally obligated to pay pension benefits. There would be no income from investments to cover those payments. The money contributed by current state employees would be used to pay retirees. The state would have to pay the rest out of the general revenue budget, so taxpayers would be funding retirees on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
Our ruling

Philip Keefe said that if no changes were made to the state pension plan, ""the plan still had enough money to go forward for approximately the next 16 years.""

But the report he cites as evidence states a range of 8 to 12 years, not 16. And even that projection may be optimistic because the report assumes that the state will be making 6 percent to 8 percent on its investments, far higher that the rate of return over the last 10 years.

His time frame is so far afield from the report he says he was citing, we rule his statement False.

Do more than half of all tax filers really pay no federal income tax?
","
Trying to figure out how much federal taxes a person paid in any year is almost as random as predicting the airfare of the person next to you on a flight.

Republican Rob Cornilles, who’s running for Oregon’s 1st congressional district, can’t.

""Our federal tax system is broken,"" he says on his website. ""A dizzying number of credits, deductions, and loopholes have created a maze where people spend money on things designed to avoid taxes rather than generate economic growth.""

""As a result"" of all the deductions, exceptions and accumulated gifts in the tax code,"" Cornilles continues, ""fifty-one percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax"" in 2009, the most recent year for which full details are available.

What? More than half of all people who filed federal taxes two years ago did not pay a penny? Really? This is the kind of question PolitiFact Oregon loves most, a hard number attached to a specific claim. Let’s take a look.

We start with the Joint Committee on Taxation, a respected and decidedly wonkish bipartisan committee of Congress. The committee found that for tax year 2009, roughly 22 percent of ""tax units"" (not exactly ""households,"" but we’ll give Cornilles a pass on the terminology) ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got all their tax money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, a longstanding policy that encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code. By contrast, the committee found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government.

Put another way, 51 percent of taxpayers in 2009 had zero liability, according to the committee’s research.

Later studies reached a similar conclusion. A July 11 report issued by the Tax Policy Center, which is a joint effort by the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, concluded that ""about 46 percent of American households will pay no federal individual income tax in 2011.""

Bob Williams, a tax policy specialist at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks, which are sometimes called ""tax expenditures.""
  
""There are lots and lots of them,"" he said. ""We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes, and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution.""
  
However, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks they get still don’t lower their taxes to zero. By contrast, popular lower- and middle-income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook.  

Tax demographics are a lot like the weather; it changes year to year though the general framework holds - August is hot and January is cold. In this case, a substantial percentage of Americans pay no taxes each year even though the percentage bounces up and down over time.

Figures from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center show that since 2004, the percentage of no-liability tax units has been as low as 39.9 percent in 2007. In fact, 2009 -- the year Cornilles cites on his webpage -- may prove to be a high point. The center’s projections suggest that the rate could fall to 49.5 percent for tax year 2010 and 46.4 percent in 2011.

There’s no doubt, then, that the 51 percent figure Cornilles cites holds up. The Joint Commission on Taxation and the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center have strong reputations. But when we asked, Cornilles’ campaign said he relied on another source as his primary defense - a national PolitiFact item written in July that examined Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s assertion of the same claim. Good source, we think.

Just as Cornyn did from the Senate floor last summer, Cornilles was clear and precise that his reference to 51 percent not paying taxes relates to 2009. The claim held up then and it does now. We rate his claim: True.

Rick Perry says Barack Obama thinks Americans are lazy
","
In a 30-second television ad airing across the country, Texas Gov. Rick Perry lashes out at President Barack Obama by using the president's words. 
The ad, which debuted Nov. 16, 2011, opens with a video clip of Obama saying, ""We've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades."" Perry then appears, saying: ""Can you believe that? That's what our president thinks is wrong with America? That Americans are lazy? That's pathetic."" 
Perry made a similar claim a day earlier during an Iowa speech, according to the text of his remarks. Referring to the United States' economic troubles, Perry said: ""In recent weeks, our president has taken to pointing the finger of blame instead of taking responsibility. He has called us soft and lazy."" 
We'd heard the ""soft"" charge before. In an Oct. 14 speech unveiling his energy policy proposals, Perry said Obama ""has labeled Americans as soft."" We rated that statement, which amped up a statement Obama had made about the country getting soft in the past, Half True. 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Perry rival for the Republican presidential nomination, has also accused Obama of calling Americans lazy. According to a Nov. 16, 2011, post on a MSNBC.com political blog, Romney said this while campaigning a day earlier in South Carolina: ""Sometimes, I just don't think that President Obama understands America. I say that because this week — or was it last week — he said that Americans are lazy. I don't think that describes America."" 
In his ad, Perry accuses Obama of thinking Americans are lazy. We can’t test what anyone, including Obama, is thinking. So, in this article, we're gauging whether Obama really indicated that he thinks Americans have been lazy. 
We traced Obama's comment to a question-and-answer session with the head of Boeing on Nov. 12, 2011, at a meeting of business leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Honolulu. 
The conversation between Jim McNerney and Obama touched on the regional economy, world trade and what the president characterized as a ""re-engagement"" by the United States with Pacific Rim countries. Obama said that there is no area he considers more vital and that the United States wants to work with other Pacific Rim countries to ""enhance job growth, economic growth, prosperity and security for all of us."" 
""I think we spent a decade in which, understandably, after 9/11, we were very focused on security issues, particularly in the Middle East region,"" Obama said. ""And those continue to be important. But we've turned our attention back to the Asia-Pacific region, and I think that it's paying off immediately in a whole range of improved relations with countries, and businesses are starting to see more opportunities as a consequence."" 
The conversation soon turned to the complicated relationship that the United States has with China. Obama made his ""lazy"" comment in response to a question from McNerney about impediments that China might see to investing in the United States. 
""Well, this is an issue, generally,"" Obama said. ""I think it's important to remember that the United States is still the largest recipient of foreign investment in the world. And there are a lot of things that make foreign investors see the U.S. as a great opportunity — our stability, our openness, our innovative free market culture. 
""But, you know, we’ve been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades. We’ve kind of taken for granted — well, people will want to come here — and we aren’t out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America. And so one of the things that my administration has done is set up something called SelectUSA that organizes all the government agencies to work with state and local governments where they're seeking assistance from us, to go out there and make it easier for foreign investors to build a plant in the United States and put outstanding U.S. workers back to work in the United States of America."" 
Two days later, a reporter asked White House spokesman Josh Earnest to explain what Obama meant by his ""lazy"" remark. Earnest said Obama ""was making the case"" that it's time for U.S. foreign policy to focus on the Asia-Pacific region because there's ""an enormous economic opportunity"" there. 
Earnest continued: ""And so that is why the president has made this a focus of his foreign policy moving forward. I don't think that — it's the president's view that this region has not been the focus in recent history, and that's what the president was alluding to, that we are in a circumstance where we need to redouble our efforts to be engaged in this region."" 
So where does that leave us? Partly pondering who Obama meant by ""we."" 
In the MSNBC.com blog post, Mark Murray, deputy political director for NBC News, says Obama ""wasn't calling Americans lazy; rather, he was calling U.S. business practices to attract foreign investors lazy."" 
Another possibility: Speaking with McNerney, Obama often used ""we"" to refer to the U.S. government or his administration. So the president may have been criticizing the federal government's efforts to help attract investment from abroad. After all, in his next sentence, Obama points to a Commerce Department website (SelectUSA) that says it ""seeks to highlight the many advantages the United States offers as a location for business and investment."" 
Our ruling: Obama said America had acted lazily in some regard. Exactly whom he considers lazy, we're still not sure. But it’s clear that he was not wagging his finger at the American public at large. Perry's presentation distorts the president's remark by taking it out of context. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/nov/17/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-barack-obama-thinks-americans-are-/

Mitt Romney says failed solar company Solyndra 'had robots that whistled Disney songs'
","
When a presidential candidate says a controversial solar factory had robots that whistled Disney songs, then says, ""I'm not kidding,"" we just can't resist. Really? 

We've checked other recent claims about Solyndra, the once-hot solar panel manufacturer that won $535 million in federal loan guarantees, then collapsed into bankruptcy court this year. But only this one had us humming a merry tune.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is seeking the Republican nomination, talked about the robots to distinguish between his private sector experience and government largesse in a recent speech to conservatives in Washington. 
The Disney reference planted an irresistible image of Snow White's dwarfs stacking solar panels. We asked Romney's campaign for evidence for his claim.

Spokesman Ryan Williams provided us with a Bloomberg article from Sept. 28, 2011: ""Solyndra plant had whistling robots, spa showers.""

It began: 
Later in the story were more robot details.   
We chatted with Pierce, the facilities manager, who now works at a California university, and Myron Moreno, Solyndra's director of automation, who's since picked up a job at another solar company.

They explained that at an automated plant like Solyndra's, when stacks of panels need to be moved around the factory, a machine called an ""automated guided vehicle"" does the work. It's basically a driverless forklift. Just like a forklift, it sounds an alarm when it moves to alert workers to stay out of the way. (You can see them at work in this Solyndra video.)

Versions of the vehicles have been around since the 1950s, according to the American Society of Safety Engineers. Their main benefit is that they reduce labor costs.

But the incessant beep-beep-beeping can drive workers nuts — and sometimes they tune it out, presenting a safety hazard. So vehicle makers have experimented with other sounds to make sure the alarms get heard. For example, melodies.

Moreno said the new factory used about 10 automated guided vehicles from equipment manufacturers Murata and Savant, in two sizes. One carried about 1,000 pounds, the other about 2,000 pounds.

The Japanese Murata vehicles came preloaded with a beeping noise and music. The other machines Solyndra equipped with an alarm box that included music.

""They gave you a menu, so we had each one playing a different medley,"" Moreno said. ""Any time they're moving, it's preferable to have some music versus the alarming sound. I've been in factories all over the U.S., and that's the typical thing.""

Of course, even the wordless music had its downside: Songs could get stuck in your head, Moreno said. So they avoided the better-known movie soundtracks, like E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial and Raiders of the Lost Ark, he said. 

It was a relief, Moreno said, that some of the tunes were Japanese folk songs.

""Those weren't too bad, because nobody knew what those were,"" Moreno said.

What about Disney songs? Neither Pierce or Moreno specifically recalled any.

Our ruling

We were heartened that Romney was able to quickly provide a source for his information about Solyndra's factory. But as an example of wasteful spending, ""robots that whistled Disney songs,"" doesn't quite hold up. Automated guided vehicles are common in warehouses and factories, as a labor-saving device. Some of them come preloaded with melodies as an alternative to beep-beep-beep — to boost workers' attention to them, and thus safety. The Solyndra vehicles may have played some Disney tunes along with their movie medleys and Japanese folk songs, but it wasn't their most memorable feature.

Did the program that funded the Solyndra loan start under George W. Bush? David Plouffe says so
","
With the collapse of Solyndra generating bad headlines for the Obama administration, White House officials are defending the program that helped fund the solar power company's now-shuttered Silicon Valley factory.

White House senior adviser David Plouffe said on Meet the Press that the loan program had bipartisan support — including from former President George W. Bush. 

We wondered: Did the Energy Department's loan guarantee program have Bush's support?

Solyndra, which manufactured unique solar panels based on cylindrical cells that didn't require silicon, was once a burgeoning clean energy superstar, attracting more than $1 billion from private investors. In 2009, the Obama administration approved a $535 million loan guarantee that helped the company build a new factory in Fremont, Calif. It became a poster child for the president's stimulus efforts. But in August 2011, the factory suddenly closed, and by September the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

The company's failure prompted an FBI raid, a congressional investigation and claims of ""crony capitalism"" by critics of the administration, because a major Solyndra investor was connected to a billionaire who had raised campaign cash for President Barack Obama. (We explained that connection when we rated a recent political ad that said Obama used taxpayer money ""to help his friends at Solyndra."" We found the ad's claim Mostly False.)

Meanwhile, the loan guarantee program itself has attracted greater scrutiny.

On Oct. 30, 2011, Meet the Press host David Gregory brought up Solyndra in an interview with Plouffe, asking if taxpayers had been ripped off. Plouffe defended the administration's efforts to ""win the clean energy race."" Here's the part of the exchange we're checking:

Gregory: ""Should government be playing venture capitalist to try to prop these industries up?""

Plouffe: ""Well, we believe this loan program is very important. By the way, it was a program that was supported by President Bush. So there's been support in both parties. Many of the members of Congress who offered criticism themselves were lobbying for funds for companies like this.""

Program dates back to 2005 
The Energy Department's loan guarantee program was created as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by Bush.

In his signing speech, Bush lauded the bill's support for clean technology, though he didn't specifically mention the loan guarantees.

The loan guarantees were designed to ""support innovative clean energy technologies that are typically unable to obtain conventional private financing due to high technology risks."" 
Republicans, including Bush, emphasized the program's benefits for nuclear energy and biofuels. The president touted the new energy law in his 2007 State of the Union address. His energy secretary, Samuel Bodman, regularly mentioned the loan guarantees in speeches on renewable energy. The Energy Department issued its final rules for the program in 2007, along with a list of 16 companies that made the cut for to apply for its first round of awards, and Solyndra was among them.

House Republicans investigating Solyndra have claimed that the Bush administration ultimately rejected the Solyndra loan, but that's not quite the case. Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and news media point out that Bush energy officials wanted to get the loan closed on their way out the door — it was listed as the first of their ""three highest priorities through January 15."" (Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009.) But the Energy Department's credit committee held things up for more analysis. 

""The number of issues unresolved makes a recommendation for approval premature at this time. Therefore, the committee, without prejudice, remands the project to the LGPO [Loan Guarantee Program Office] for further development of information,"" the committee said.

It noted Solyndra's project ""appears to have merit."" But the clock had run out.

That didn't keep Bush from touting the loan guarantee program on his way out of office. On Jan. 6, 2009, in remarks on conservation and the environment from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, he said, ""We dedicated more than $18 billion to developing clean and efficient technologies like biofuels, advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, solar and wind power, and clean, safe nuclear power. We're providing more than $40 billion in loan guarantees to put these technologies to use.""

Ultimately, the Bush administration program didn't finalize a single loan guarantee. 
Stimulus expands old program 
While the loan guarantee program originated under Bush, it grew under Obama.

Solyndra applied for help under Section 1703 of Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The federal stimulus bill signed by Obama expanded Title XVII by adding Section 1705. The new program was temporary, designed to boost certain types of clean energy projects that could start construction by Sept. 20, 2011. The new section was an even better deal for winning projects, because taxpayers covered the ""credit subsidy costs"" that under Bush businesses had to pay themselves. Solyndra's loan guarantee was awarded under Section 1705.

Is it fair to say the loan guarantee program ""was supported by President Bush"" when it was updated under Obama? FactCheck.org took issue with a similar statement by Obama — that the loan guarantee program predated him — pointing out that the Bush administration created 1703, while Solyndra won funding under 1705.

But the Energy Department says pretty clearly that ""Section 1703 and Section 1705 fall under the LGP (loan guarantee program)."" We think Bush's broad support for loan guarantees for high-risk clean energy provides reasonable support for Plouffe's statement — especially since the Bush administration program also found merit in Solyndra's project.

Our ruling 
Plouffe said that the loan guarantee program that awarded half a billion dollars in guarantees to Solyndra ""was supported by President Bush."" The program was created on Bush's watch by a law he signed and promoted. The program grew under the Obama administration, which ultimately awarded Solyndra's loan guarantee under a new section of the law created by the stimulus. The Bush administration, though, promoted the loan guarantee program, and Bush himself touted it on his way out of office. There's also evidence his administration specifically prioritized Solyndra's project. We find Plouffe's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/17/david-plouffe/solyndra-loan-george-w-bush-david-plouffe/

Chris Christie says graduation rate, spending levels in Newark public schools show the ‘model is broken’
","
When Gov. Chris Christie discusses his education reform agenda, he talks about Newark’s public schools.

In two national speeches on education this year and in a live interview on Facebook on Monday, Christie pushed his proposals for education reform after citing statistics about Newark.

""If you look at Newark as an example, for the kids who two months ago entered the ninth grade, in four years 23 percent of them will graduate with a high school diploma and we spend $100,000 on their education in those four years, more than is spent on any other set of students in the United States,"" Christie said in an interview at Facebook’s headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. ""So what's that tell you? It tells you the model is broken. We have to fix the way we are teaching these children.""

PolitiFact New Jersey previously checked a similar claim by Christie on Newark’s graduation rate and deemed it False. We’ll review that ruling, then tackle Christie’s claims about per-pupil costs.

There are several ways to calculate graduation rates and no solid consensus on whether one method is more credible than any other.

The graduation rate Christie references comes from a study by Global Education Advisors, a private consulting firm incorporated by Christopher Cerf before he became New Jersey’s acting state education commissioner.
   
A presentation based on the study’s findings said 22 percent of ninth graders in Newark graduate in four years by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment.

But students can graduate through alternate routes, without taking that exam.

Newark’s graduation rate for all students who graduate in four years is 55 percent.

By not specifying who is included in the graduation rate he cites, Christie omits an entire group of students recognized by the state as having graduated.

Now, let’s look at the rest of Christie’s claim.

Per-pupil expenditures vary, depending on what’s included in calculating the total and other factors. There’s also no broad consensus on whether one measure is more accurate than any other.

The state Education Department developed a new method to calculate per-pupil costs in fiscal year 2011 to account for transportation costs, debt payments and other factors. The new calculation showed Newark spent $22,992 per student for the 2009-2010 school year, or $91,968 for four years.

Our analysis of state data found several other districts in New Jersey that exceed Newark’s per-pupil spending.

By the new state measurement, Camden spent $23,770 per student; Atlantic City, $24,142; and Asbury Park, $29,819.

We also analyzed school district data from the U.S. Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics and found other districts in the United States that spend more than Newark per student. But it’s worth noting that among districts with larger student enrollment, Newark ranks near or at the top in per-pupil spending, depending on the data set.

A state Education Department spokesman, citing statistics that put New Jersey at the top nationally in per-pupil spending, said in an e-mail that Christie’s remarks ""were based on the fact that NJ has the highest spending in the country, and Newark far exceeds even NJ’s average.""

Still, Christie said more is spent on students in Newark than on ""any other set of students in the United States"" and that’s incorrect.

Our ruling

Christie claimed that 23 percent of ninth graders in Newark will graduate in four years, costing $100,000 per student, more than is spent on any other set of students in the country.

Christie’s graduation statistic only includes students who graduate after passing a particular state standardized test and omits a group of students who also graduate in four years through alternate routes.

A state measure that includes debt payments and other factors shows Newark spent $22,992 per pupil in the 2009-2010 school year, or $91,968 for four years. But that’s not the highest per-pupil cost in the country.

Overall, we rate Christie’s statement Mostly False.

Gov. John Kasich says one-third of Ohio's college grads leave the state within 3 years
","
Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been giving a lot of speeches lately to a variety of groups but the message is typically the same: that, in his opinion, the state was on life-support when he took office in January and is slowly recovering thanks to his initiatives.

To drive his point that Ohioans have become increasingly disenchanted with the Buckeye state, the Republican leader suggests that many college graduates are giving up hope of ever making a career here and instead are choosing to leave to pursue life elsewhere.

""One-third of our college grads leave Ohio within three years,"" Kasich said at a highway engineers conference in Columbus on Oct. 25. ""We lose our best and brightest.""

Losing 1 in every 3 Ohio college graduates would be a classic example of what academia has come to refer as the ""brain drain."" PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know whether the governor accurately captured the girth of the problem.

To start, the statement seems to overlook the fact that not all college graduates are Ohioans to begin with.

The Ohio State University, for example, is one of the largest universities in the country with more than 56,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. About 22 percent of them are not Ohio natives. It stands to reason that some would return to their home state or be recruited for work outside of Ohio.

That point aside, we decided to look at Kasich’s point of reference.

His information comes from the Ohio Board of Regents, which in 2008, under a previous administration, said that just 66 percent of Ohio public college grads were still in the state three years after graduation. Then-Chancellor Eric Fingerhut  aimed to raise that figure to 70 percent by 2017.

The Regents said that figure still holds today. Regents spokeswoman Kim Norris said 66 percent of Ohio’s Spring 2008 public college graduates were employed in Ohio during the fourth quarter of 2010.

To put it in numerical terms, Ohio had 39,736 graduates — associate, Bachelor’s, graduate and professional degrees and certificates combined — in Spring 2008 and 26,082 of them were working in Ohio late last year.

Norris said the Regents came up with the figure by cross-matching college graduates with employment data from the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services.

But there is a catch.

The Regents figures only count people who are employed. It assumes the other 33-percent left the state. That would support the governor’s statement, but isn’t it possible that many of those 14,000 people earning degrees in 2008 are still in Ohio and unemployed?

Norris conceded that also could be the case.

Ohio’s unemployment rate in September was 9.1 percent, matching the national rate. There were more than 530,000 Ohioans out of work and actively looking for a job, according to data from the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services.

The Board of Regents did not have a figure of 2008 college grads who were still in Ohio three years later that includes those that might be unemployed. PolitiFact Ohio thinks it is safe to say that there are not just two options at play here for those college graduates: that either they found a job here or that they left Ohio. Unfortunately, given the state and nation’s economy, some are likely unemployed and looking to put their college degrees to work.

If the 9.1 percent unemployment rate is applied to the 14,000 people who earned degrees but are not employed in Ohio, it accounts for 1,274 people. That would amount to slightly more than 3 percent of the people who got degrees in 2008.

The governor is making a salient point, that as the economy limps along, bright, young minds might be encouraged to look for their opportunities elsewhere and that should worry anyone concerned for Ohio’s future.

The Board of Regents figure does not account for the possibility some of those grads didn’t leave, but are unemployed. That’s information that provides clarification.

And even if the unemployment rate is taken into consideration, the figure the governor used is still in the ballpark.

And the message behind his statement, that Ohio is losing some of its youngest talent, is a accurate.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/nov/17/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-one-third-ohios-college-grads/

Fact-checking which Trump supporters and allies got PPP loans
","A popular Facebook post claims that some wealthy Republicans and other public figures have benefited from the federal government’s $2 trillion coronavirus relief package. The post, which was published July 7 by a page called Feminist News, includes a collage of photos depicting eight public figures. It claims that businesses ranging from Kanye West’s apparel company, Yeezy, to ""Devin Nunes’ winery"" have received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program. ""All these millionaires got millions (or close to it) in PPP loans while tens of millions of Americans got a bullsh*t $1200 check months ago,"" reads text in the collage. ""This is how a mafia state works. The small inner circle gets rewarded. Everyone else suffers."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 50,000 times, and other popular liberal pages have published similar posts. (Screenshot from Facebook) The Paycheck Protection Program is a federal loan initiative to encourage businesses to keep workers on their payrolls during the coronavirus pandemic. The loans are forgivable, meaning some recipients may be able to keep the money. It passed as part of a larger legislative package in late March and was extended by President Donald Trump on July 4.  Two days later, the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department released a dataset with details about the millions of loans awarded to businesses and nonprofits so far. We used that data to take a closer look at the Facebook post. The post is correct in saying that some businesses connected to prominent Republicans have received money as part of the program. But in some cases the post oversimplifies their connection to those businesses, and the data do not show that each person personally received ""millions (or close to it)."" Some of the Republicans mentioned in the Facebook post directly benefited from PPP loans. Others own stakes in PPP beneficiary companies or have more indirect relationships. The loan database released by the SBA and the Treasury Department does not specify exactly how much money each entity received. Instead, it offers wide ranges. We took a look at the database, as well as news reports, to see how each person mentioned in the Facebook post is connected to PPP beneficiaries. (Search the database for yourself here.) What the post says: ""Kanye West’s company, Yeezy"" Who got the money: Yeezy LLC Prior to a July 8 interview in which he said he is no longer supporting the president, West was one of Trump’s biggest celebrity supporters. According to the PPP loan database, Yeezy received between $2 million and $5 million. What the post says: ""Jared Kushner’s family"" Who got the money: Several companies wholly or partially owned by the Kushners Several companies connected to the family of the president’s son-in-law benefited from the PPP, according to reports from ProPublica and the Daily Beast.  Observer Holdings LLC, the parent company of Observer Media — which Kushner used to run and is currently owned by his brother-in-law’s investment firm — received between $350,000 and $1 million. A company called Princeton Forrestal LLC — 40%-owned by Kushner relatives, according to a 2018 securities filing analyzed by the Daily Beast — received between $1 million and $2 million. Esplanade Livingston LLC, a company connected to the Kushners, received between $350,000 and $1 million. The Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy in Livingston, N.J., received between $1 million and $2 million. It was named after Kushner’s grandfather and is supported by the family. Hollwich Kushner Architecture, a firm headed by Marc Kushner, Jared Kushner’s first cousin, received between $150,000 and $350,000. What the posts: ""Mitch McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao"" Who got the money: The Foremost Group LLC Chao is the U.S. transportation secretary. A shipping business run by her family benefited from the PPP. The Foremost Group received between $350,000 and $1 million, according to the loan database. Contrary to what the Facebook post says, Chao herself did not receive a loan. The Foremost Group is not listed on Chao’s 2017 financial disclosure, but her relationship with the company has been the subject of a House of Representatives ethics investigation. The Facebook post notes she is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. What the post says: ""Trump’s campaign manager’s company"" Who got the money: CloudCommerce Inc. CloudCommerce, a digital marketing company whose largest shareholder is Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager, received between $350,000 and $1 million from the PPP, according to CBS News and the loan database.  Between 2017 and 2018, CloudCommerce acquired several of Parscale’s companies, and he joined the company’s board of directors. On Dec. 10, 2019, Parscale resigned from the board, but he retained his 34.9% stake in CloudCommerce, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  As of that date, Parscale was not a ""director, officer, employee or contractor"" of the company, according to the filing. The current chairman and CEO of CloudCommerce is Andrew Van Noy. Van Noy told CBS that Parscale ""no longer has any involvement in decision-making for the company, including the PPP loan."" Neither Parscale Properties LLC, an investment company that Parscale set up with his family, nor Parscale Strategy LLC, a company that was set up by Parscale and has billed millions to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, has received money from the program. What the post says: ""Trump’s super PAC"" Who got the money: Companies that have donated to a pro-Trump super PAC A pro-Trump super PAC did not receive money from the PPP. Vital Pharmaceuticals, the company that owns Bang Energy, was lent between $5 million and $10 million. In 2019, Vital Pharmaceuticals gave $250,000 to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC that spent $36 million during the 2018 campaign cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. Another firm that has donated to the super PAC, G.H. Palmer Associates, received between $350,000 and $1 million, according to the loan database and CNBC. Companies connected to other major Trump donors were among the earliest recipients of PPP loans, the Associated Press reported. What the post says: Betsy DeVos Who got the money: Renaissance Acquisition Co. LLC The education secretary herself did not receive a loan, but the Facebook post framed it that way. Bloomberg reported that a company with the same name as one listed on her 2017 financial disclosure report did. Renaissance Acquisition Co., which operates an Indianapolis-based company that provides services to nonprofits, received between $2 million and $5 million, according to the loan database.

Nunes, R-Calif., is not the sole owner of Phase 2 Cellars, a vineyard in San Luis Obispo that received between $1 million and $2 million from the PPP. But he is a partial owner, holding between $50,001 and $100,000 in equity in it, according to a Daily Beast analysis of Nunes’ most recent financial disclosure.

JRW Corp., a Fort Worth, Texas, car dealership where Williams serves as the sole director and president, was lent between $1 million and $2 million. His own stake in the company exceeds $50 million, according to Williams’ most recent financial disclosure. We reached out to Feminist News for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. A Facebook post says eight wealthy public figures received loans as part of the federal Paycheck Protection Program. The post correctly characterizes how West, Kushner and Williams are connected to companies that received money. However, it oversimplifies how Chao, Parscale, DeVos and Nunes benefited from the program.  The federal government lent millions of dollars to companies connected to, but not wholly owned by, Parscale, Nunes and DeVos. A shipping company owned by Chao’s family received between $350,000 and $1 million, but she did not receive a loan herself, and the company is not listed on her financial disclosure.

No, the CDC is not on the verge of lifting 'epidemic' label for COVID-19
","Amid news headlines that the United States set a daily record for the number of new coronavirus cases, an article widely shared on Facebook made a contrarian claim. Referring to the lead federal agency fighting COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the article’s headline said: ""The CDC may have to stop calling COVID-19 an ‘epidemic’ due to a remarkably low death rate."" The July 9 article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is flawed in a number of ways. The article appears on the website of Collective Evolution, which describes itself as a ""conscious media company focused on personal transformation."" The article claims the CDC might have to stop calling COVID-19 an epidemic because the death rate is becoming so low that it wouldn’t meet the CDC’s definition of epidemic. It does not cite any death rate figures.  The article cites a CDC webpage, but that page does not refer to death rates in describing what an epidemic is.  The CDC page says: ""Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area."" Health officials and leaders have made several official declarations about the novel coronavirus. But the major ones weren’t about declaring an epidemic, and none were made by the CDC: Jan. 30: The World Health Organization declares a global health emergency. Jan. 31: U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declares a public health emergency. March 11: The WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic. March 13: President Donald Trump declares a national emergency. In its weekly summary of COVID-19 activity, the CDC gave no indication that a drop in deaths signaled a turning point. The latest report available when the Facebook post was made was for the week ended June 27.  It said about death rates:  ""Mortality attributed to COVID-19 decreased compared to last week and is currently at the epidemic threshold, but will likely increase as additional death certificates are processed."" The same statement was made in the latest report, for the week ended July 4. Here’s what that means, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund told PolitiFact: The epidemic threshold ""refers to the point at which the observed proportion of deaths is significantly higher than would be expected at that time of the year in the absence of substantial influenza, and now COVID-related mortality."" Deaths are a lagging indicator of COVID-19, partly because of a delay in the processing of death certificates. Death rates alone don’t ""have bearing on whether COVID-19 is still an epidemic,"" given that the extent of the outbreak is the primary factor. An article widely shared on Facebook claimed: ""The CDC may have to stop calling COVID-19 an ‘epidemic’ due to a remarkably low death rate."" The latest CDC statement made public when the Facebook post was made said deaths attributed to COVID-19 decreased from the previous week, but remained at the epidemic threshold, and were likely to increase.

No, Trump didn’t tell Americans infected with the coronavirus to drink bleach
","Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying during a speech on the economy that Trump had given up trying to manage a crisis he’s ill equipped to solve. ""And when it comes to COVID-19, after months of doing nothing, other than predicting the virus would disappear, or maybe if you drank bleach you may be okay, Trump has simply given up,"" said Biden, who delivered his remarks at a metalworks factory near his hometown of Scranton on Thursday. Trump spoke about the role he thought disinfectants could play in tackling an infection caused by the virus during a now infamous April 23 briefing. But he didn’t say people should drink bleach. His comments came after William Bryan, the undersecretary for science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, presented a study that found sun exposure and cleaning agents like bleach can kill the virus when it lingers on surfaces. Trump remarked on the effectiveness of those methods and wondered if they could help address infections in the human body. Here are his full comments: ""A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. (To Bryan) And I think you said you’re going to test that, too. Sounds interesting, right?"" He continued. ""And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that, so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful."" Later, Trump clarified his comments after a reporter asked Bryan whether disinfectants could actually be injected into COVID-19 patients. ""It wouldn’t be through injections, almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t work, but it certainly has a big effect if it’s on a stationary object."" Trump did not explicitly recommend ingesting a disinfectant like bleach. Nevertheless, his remarks led some companies and state agencies to issue warnings about ingesting disinfectants. The maker of Lysol said in a statement that ""under no circumstance"" should its products be used in the human body. The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment about what evidence the former vice president relied on when he claimed the president suggested Americans drink bleach to combat the virus. Biden said Trump said drinking bleach could help fight the coronavirus. Trump did not specifically recommend ingesting disinfectants, but he did express interest in exploring whether disinfectants could be applied to the site of a coronavirus infection inside the body, such as the lungs.

Pence takes Biden’s comments on police funding, ‘enemy’ out of context
","Former Vice President Joe Biden has rejected the notion of ""defunding the police,"" but that hasn’t stopped his critics from trying to pin the slogan on him. A recent Trump campaign ad misrepresented Biden’s stated position. And now a chorus of conservative voices is seizing on snippets of an interview as evidence that the former vice president does support defunding the police after all. Vice President Mike Pence on July 9 visited the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 in Northeast Philadelphia for a Back the Blue rally with an audience of 300 police officers and their supporters. Pence recognized officers killed or injured in the line of duty and denounced calls to defund police departments across the country. ""And I heard that, just yesterday, Joe Biden said that well-armed police in his words ‘become the enemy’ and he said that he would ‘absolutely cut funding for law enforcement,’"" Pence said. But Biden’s actual comments didn’t go as far as Pence claimed. Biden said in the interview that he is open to shifting some federal police funds to other programs. Otherwise, he has proposed increasing federal funding for community policing, and has consistently called for linking federal law-enforcement funding to policing reforms. And while Biden did use the word ""enemy"" in his comments, Pence distorted what Biden actually said. Trump has falsely claimed that Biden wants to ""defund the police."" That term isn’t a precise concept. While some protesters seeking police reform want to eliminate police departments entirely, most public officials who have used the phrase want to revisit the functions of police departments and redirect some of their funding toward social services. Biden has repeatedly stated his opposition to defunding the police. ""I don't support defunding the police,"" Biden told CBS News in a clip aired June 8. ""I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness — and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community."" He repeated that stance in a June 10 op-ed in USA Today. ""While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people’s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police,"" Biden wrote. ""The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms."" Biden has actually taken some heat from activists for his relatively moderate position on the issue. In June, more than 50 liberal groups signed a letter to Biden calling on him to support defunding police and criticizing his promise to add $300 million for community policing programs. Pence’s statement followed a video interview Biden did with liberal activist Ady Barkan that posted July 8. The Biden campaign told us that the video was edited before being shared online. Barkan spent most of the 27-minute remote interview asking about health care. But about 20 minutes in, the discussion turned to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both of whom were killed in encounters with police.  Alluding to demands made by Black Lives Matter, Barkan said deadly police encounters with citizens could be reduced if some police funding were redirected to social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing.  ""Are you open to that kind of reform?"" he asked. Biden replied: ""Yes. I proposed that kind of reform.""  Biden said he has called for more mental health funding, as well as police reforms such as transparency in officer misconduct records. He did not speak directly about reducing police funding.  Biden then talked about police using military equipment in their communities, which is where the ""enemy"" comment came up: ""Surplus military equipment for law enforcement — they don't need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood; it's like the military invading. They don't know anybody; they become the enemy, they’re supposed to be protecting these people.""  Barkan then interjected, asking: ""But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?"" Biden replied: ""Yes. Absolutely.""  The Biden campaign gave PolitiFact an audio recording of that portion of the interview. After, ""Yes. Absolutely,"" according to the recording, Biden said, ""And by the way, not just redirect, condition them."" He offered holding up federal law enforcement grants if agencies used no-knock warrants or did not eliminate choke holds. So, Biden said he ""absolutely"" would shift some funds from police to other services, but he has also proposed adding funding for community policing. Pence said Biden ""said that well-armed police in his words ‘become the enemy’ and he said that he would ‘absolutely cut funding for law enforcement.’""  Biden said police become the enemy when they use military equipment in a way that’s like invading a neighborhood. That context is missing from Pence’s portrayal. Biden also said he is open to redirecting some police funding to social services, but he has stated opposition to fully defunding the police. In fact, he has proposed more funding for community policing and using federal funding to incentivize police reform. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Some COVID-19 deaths have been children
","Texas schools will be open this fall, but parents will be allowed to choose between sending their children to in-person classes or keeping them home for virtual instruction, per new guidance issued by the state’s education agency on Tuesday. The decision received mixed reviews from educators, parents and state officials, some of whom cited rising infection rates, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 in the state as a point of concern. In an interview with a television station in Dallas on Thursday, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said he thinks the most important factor in opening schools should be safety. ""The good news is, when you look at the numbers, no one under the age of 20 has died of the coronavirus,"" said Cornyn, a Republican. ""We still don’t know whether children can get it and transmit it to others."" But is that accurate? Cornyn did not return a request for comment seeking more information about his statement. A spokesperson for the senator told NBC DFW on Friday that Cornyn ""could have been more precise with his language,"" but his information came from a July 9 tweet shared by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. In reply to a question about children and the coronavirus, Gottlieb wrote: ""Balance of data clearly shows they’re less likely to become infected and less likely to transmit infection. But IMHO we need to have humility on this question and recognize we don’t fully understand all the risks; and while kids are less vulnerable, less risk doesn’t mean no risk."" Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie told the Houston Chronicle that Cornyn ""was not questioning whether children can catch the virus — of course they can. He was questioning the likelihood that children can catch it and THEN transmit it."" Let’s dive in. Looking at infection numbers, deaths People of any age can contract the coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19. ""Everyone is at risk for getting COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus,"" reads a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage on the virus. ""Some people are more likely than others to become severely ill, which means that they may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die."" Some independent research and a preliminary report from the CDC show that children may be less likely to contract the virus than adults. Plus, the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age.  But that does not mean children cannot contract the virus or experience illness as a result. The latest analysis from the CDC shows that roughly 6% of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States have been among people 17 years old and under — 1.4% have been in people under 4 and 4.6% between 5 and 17. In Texas, about 7% of the 24,459 coronavirus cases with a completed investigation have been people under 19 — 2.3% have been people under 9 and 4.8% between 10 and 19. National and state data also show that Cornyn is wrong to say no person under 20 has died from the coronavirus. Across the United States, 29 people under the age of 14 and 142 people between the ages of 15 and 24 have died after contracting the coronavirus. In Texas, state data does not show any coronavirus fatalities for people younger than 19 — but the state has investigated just 703 of the state’s reported 2,918 fatalities. According to media reports, some children have died after contracting the virus in the state. In April, a 17-year-old girl in Lancaster died of complications related to the coronavirus, according to the Dallas Morning News. On Friday, health officials in Corpus Christi reported ""a COVID-19 related death of a six week old infant,"" according to Ben Molina, a city council member in the area. Exploring transmission Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease at UT Southwestern Medical Center, told NBC DFW in a July 3 interview that children are able to contract and transmit the virus. ""We know that children should be less prone to severe disease and viral infections, that’s not to say children can’t get sick,"" he said. ""We’ve had many examples of children getting sick. We also know that children can spread the virus and not be symptomatic."" But the extent to which children spread the virus remains under-studied, and it is likely that children play a small role in the bulk of virus transmission. ""So far, researchers agree that children are not contracting the new coronavirus at the same rate as adults,"" reads a report from the Advisory Board, a health care research and consulting firm. ""But research has yet to show whether young children transmit the new coronavirus at a similar rate as adults."" Robert Redfield, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke about whether children returning to schools pose a risk of spreading the virus during a briefing of the White House Task Force on Wednesday.  ""We really don’t have evidence that children are driving the transmission cycle of (the coronavirus),"" he said. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said that could be due to lack of testing among children. ""It really comes to the evidence base of: what do we have as far as testing and children?"" she said during the same press briefing. ""So, if you look across all of the tests that we’ve done and when we have the age, the portion that has been the lowest-tested portion is the under-10-years-old."" Two international studies conducted on children— one focused on China and the other based in Germany — offer ""compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus,"" according to the New York Times. A preliminary report from the CDC on the coronavirus in children said children are less likely to show typical symptoms of the coronavirus like fever or cough.  ""Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups as patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission,"" the report reads. Our ruling Cornyn said that ""no one under the age of 20 has died of the coronavirus. We still don’t know whether children can get it and transmit it to others."" Cornyn’s claim is wrong on multiple counts: First, numerous children across the country and in Texas have contracted the coronavirus and some have died as a result. Research indicates that children are able to transmit the coronavirus, but there has been little research into how the rate of transmission may vary compared to adults. Transmission involving children does not appear to make up the bulk of the spread. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/10/john-cornyn/some-covid-19-deaths-have-been-children/

California Lawmaker Makes ‘Oversimplified, Untrue’ Claim About COVID-19 And Lack Of Risk To Children
","A California state lawmaker jumped into the national debate on whether to reopen schools this fall amid the rapid spread of COVID-19, by claiming there’s no evidence children are in harm’s way.  ""There is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID,"" Republican state Sen. Melissa Melendez tweeted on Thursday.   Melendez, who represents much of Riverside County, went on to argue for a full reopening. ""Students should return to school, in person, and all school sports/activities should resume. Let’s stop robbing our kids of the education we owe them. We can do this safely.""   We won’t put a Truth-O-Meter rating on the second half of her tweet because it’s her opinion. But the first part makes a claim about the facts.  Are there really no COVID-19 studies showing a risk to children? We decided to check that out.   Our research Benjamin Linas is an associate professor of epidemiology and an infectious disease physician at Boston University School of Medicine. He wrote a recent article in Vox advocating for the reopening of schools this fall. But when asked about Melendez’s claim, he called it ""an oversimplification and untrue.""  ""There absolutely are studies of COVID-19 risk in children. It is silly to say that kids do not have risk,"" Linas wrote in an email. ""The good news is that medical consensus at this time, based on data, is that children generally have a mild form of COVID and that many are asymptomatic. Overall, if your child contracts COVID, they will be OK. That is good news. But to take that and say that kids are ‘not at risk’ is an oversimplification and untrue. Some children have died of COVID, some have been in ICUs."" In his Vox article, Linas pointed to public health reporting that showed children under the age of 18 made up only 2% of coronavirus cases in the United States, even though they represent 22% of the total population.  He wrote that similar studies in Chicago and Massachusetts found that children make up fewer COVID-19 cases than anticipated, as have studies in Italy, South Korea, and Iceland. Looking at data nationally and worldwide at the end of May, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded: ""Based on these early studies, children of all ages are at risk for COVID-19; however, complications of COVID-19 appear to be less common among children compared with adults based on limited reports from China and the U.S."" Lee Riley, professor and chair of infectious disease and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, also disputed Melendez’s claim.  ""This lawmaker is wrong,"" Riley wrote in an email. ""Though rare, there are well documented cases of severe complications kids develop with COVID-19. In Europe and the US, several cases of Kawasaki-like disease have been reported. (New York City) had about 100 cases with 3 deaths."" Riley is referring to a rare but serious condition found in young people this spring known as Multisystem-Inflammatory Syndrome. Doctors in Europe and the United States have attributed it to complications linked to COVID-19.  While the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is low for children, the professor added that ""kids can serve as a reservoir for transmission to their parents and other relatives. Parents who may have diabetes, high blood pressure, and other underlying medical conditions will be at risk for severe complications and even death."" When asked about the claim in question, a spokesperson for Sen. Melendez said her tweet was based on statements made at recent White House Coronavirus Task Force events. He acknowledged ""the exact phrasing"" of those statements ""is not the same"" as the senator’s tweet. Here’s a sample:  ""We really don’t have evidence that children are driving the transmission cycle of this,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield stated on Wednesday at the task force briefing.  ""Children are less likely to become infected and they are less likely to spread infection,"" American Academy of Pediatrics President Sally Goza said at a White House event on Tuesday. Those statements line up with what other health experts have said. But they don’t specifically support Melendez’s broad claim ""There is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID.""  A day after Goza’s remarks, White House health advisor Dr. Deborah Birx disputed the idea that children have been proven to be less likely to spread COVID-19, saying there’s not enough data to arrive at that conclusion, CNBC reported. Looking at the age groups tested in the United States, ""the lowest tested portion is the under-10-year-olds,"" Birx said Wednesday. ""There’s no data one way or the other right now,"" to determine how much children will spread the disease, added UC Berkeley’s Dr. Riley, in a follow-up phone interview.  Our rating  California State Sen. Melissa Melendez recently claimed there is ""no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID.""  Medical experts say that’s just plain wrong. There are studies that have examined children and found they are at risk of COVID-19, albeit less risk than adults. As one infectious disease expert put it, some ""children have died of COVID, some have been in ICUs.""  While children aren’t at a high risk for complications of the coronavirus, experts said the data is not yet clear about their role in transmitting it. There’s a tense debate nationally about whether reopening schools will lead to a greater spread of COVID-19 not just among children but also among family members and wider communities.  That debate is still playing out.

Yes, science-led New Zealand currently has no locally transmitted COVID-19 cases
","Do the Kiwis have something exceptional to show the world on how to fight COVID-19? A Facebook account called ""God"" with more than 3.94 million followers shared an image of a tweet that made this claim: ""today i learned that new zealand let health experts make the decisions about how to deal w the pandemic rather than politicians and as of today they have 0 covid cases. wow almost as if science and common sense works."" The July 7 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The country has earned headlines such as, ""New Zealand has ‘effectively eliminated’ coronavirus"" in National Geographic and ""How New Zealand beat the coronavirus"" in Politico.  So, let’s see what’s happening there. The number zero is accurate in terms of the number of active cases in which the coronavirus was contracted within New Zealand.  In fact, the New Zealand Ministry of Health told PolitiFact on July 9 it had been 69 days since the last case of COVID-19 was confirmed as ""acquired locally from an unknown source."" This isn’t to say New Zealand, which has a population of 5 million, has had no cases. As of July 7, the date of the Facebook post, there were 22 active cases in the country — all detected at the port of entry among New Zealanders who were returning from overseas travel, the ministry told us. In total, the country has counted 1,540 confirmed and probable cases during the outbreak, including 22 deaths.  A probable case does not have a positive laboratory result, but ""is treated like a confirmed case based on its exposure history and clinical symptoms."" As for the whys of New Zealand’s success, both health experts and politicians can be credited — along with New Zealanders’ willingness to abide by stay-at-home orders — according to a number of news analyses. National Geographic credited New Zealand’s success to mandatory quarantines for all visitors beginning March 15, which it called one of the strictest policies in the world at the time — even though there were just six cases nationwide. Just 10 days later, it instituted a complete, countrywide lockdown, including a moratorium on domestic travel. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ""made clear, concise statements about the situation to the nation, bolstered by a team of scientists and health professionals"" and citizens abided by the restrictions, wrote a reporter who became one of the quarantined visitors. How strict? The lockdown from March 24 to April 9 allowed non-essential workers to leave home only for essential exercise within close proximity to their residences, Forbes reported. ""New Zealanders didn’t complain, they didn’t protest, they simply followed the rules,"" another foreign reporter who was in New Zealand for the lockdowns, wrote in Politico. When Ardern’s health minister took his family for a 20-minute ride to the beach, he was demoted, the reporter wrote. Ardern announced the reopening of schools in May. The BBC credited Ardern’s leadership as well as the presence of New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield at Ardern’s daily briefings. Bloomfield effectively explained complex health issues, and that made New Zealanders more compliant in following orders, the network reported. The New York Times reported June 8, the day the New Zealand lifted its lockdown and declared the virus eliminated, that Ardern ""has been praised internationally for her approach to New Zealand’s outbreak, which was among the most stringent in the world. ""Her live video updates on Facebook, streamed from her own home, offered a relatable understanding of the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on the lives of New Zealanders, but a firm resolve to eradicate the disease from the country."" A Facebook post claimed that ""New Zealand let health experts"" rather than politicians make decisions about how to deal with COVID-19, ""and as of today they have zero COVID cases."" As of July 7, the date of the post, New Zealand reported having 22 active cases of COVID-19 — but each had been detected at the port of entry among people returning from travel abroad. In other words, the country had zero active, locally transmitted cases. Health experts, along with New Zealanders’ compliance with stay-home orders, are partly credited for the success.

MSNBC’s Chris Hayes right on economic impact of international college students
","A new Trump administration directive targeting international students at U.S. colleges is being challenged by universities in court — and by pundits on the cable news channels. The new Immigration and Customs Enforcement guidance would bar foreign college students from staying in the country if they take all their courses online. International students enrolled at Harvard University and other U.S. colleges that have moved fall-semester classes entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic will have to leave the U.S. or transfer to a school with in-person teaching, according to the new rule. The rule, if put into effect, could trim the number of foreign students in the U.S. and at specific universities. It could also deal a blow to the U.S. economy, said MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who argued on his primetime TV show that the policy has ""no upside."" ""Higher education is one of America's strongest export sectors,"" Hayes said, while displaying a chart on U.S. education exports. ""Over 1 million international students studied at American universities, (in the) 2018-19 school year. They contributed over $40 billion to the economy."" Hayes’ statistics are accurate. In 2019, U.S. service exports from education totaled roughly $44 billion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That made education the sixth largest service export for the year, behind services such as personal travel and professional and management consulting, a spokesperson for the International Trade Administration said.  Academic experts and representatives from nonprofits focused on international education also backed Hayes’ claims. An ICE spokesperson said Hayes’ statement was accurate but declined to comment further due to pending litigation. ""Higher education is one of the few areas in which we have a big surplus of exports over imports,"" said Dick Startz, professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote about the economics of education in a 2017 article for the Brookings Institution. All three of the statistics Hayes cited are correct.  More than 1 million international students studied at U.S. institutions during the 2018-19 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education and NAFSA: Association of International Educators, two nonprofits dedicated to international education. The two organizations reported that those international students contributed more than $40 billion to the U.S. economy during the year. Experts said higher education can be considered an export because international students pay their tuition and living expenses to colleges and universities using money from abroad. ""International students are buying an American education,"" Startz said. ""Hence it’s an export."" Exports from education amounted to roughly $44 billion in 2019, up from about $42.6 billion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s more than the U.S. made from exporting many other goods and services in the same timeframe.  Education ranked sixth among service exports in 2019, the International Trade Administration spokesperson told us. It was fifth in 2018. Those numbers make sense when you factor in the cost of college, said Judith Scott-Clayton, professor of economics and education at Columbia University’s Teachers College. ""If there are 1.1 million international students in the country, and each of them spends about $40,000 on U.S. tuition and living expenses, that gets you to $44 billion,"" she said. In an email to PolitiFact, Hayes also cited the International Trade Administration and an article in the New York Times Magazine in which an Institute of International Education adviser was quoted saying ""higher education is one of America’s biggest exports."" But the article said U.S. schools were losing their international appeal for a number of reasons, including rising tuition costs and various policies enacted under President Donald Trump. Rachel Banks, NAFSA’s senior director for public policy and legislative strategy, said in a statement that new international student enrollment is down over 10% since the fall of 2016, a trend NAFSA estimates has cost the U.S. economy $11.8 billion. ""That’s before the impacts of a global pandemic and related travel restrictions, several presidential proclamations targeting immigrants and nonimmigrants, and this guidance,"" Banks said. ""Therefore, we don’t anticipate this downward trajectory to reverse itself anytime soon."" Hayes said, ""Higher education is one of America's strongest export sectors. Over 1 million international students studied at American universities, 2018-19 school year. They contributed over $40 billion to the economy."" Government agencies, academic experts and nonprofit organizations said Hayes’ statistics are correct. The money the U.S. gets from foreign students studying at its colleges and universities makes education one of the country’s top service exports.

Are Texas education officials working at home while asking teachers to go back to classrooms?
","This week, the Texas Education Agency announced it would give parents a choice of sending their kids to classrooms or continuing to teach them online for the fall semester. Regardless of what they choose, in-person instruction will be offered on a daily basis, the education agency said, meaning many teachers will be back in schools come August.   The news didn’t sit well with many educators across the state, including members of Education Austin, the area’s school employees’ union. During a July 8 press conference, Education Austin President Ken Zarifis criticized the agency’s decision. ""What is selfish is a commissioner that requires teachers and workers returned to unsafe environments,"" he said. ""That is the person that is selfish. All the while he has closed his offices at TEA through January. The hypocrisy of this is palpable."" Similar allegations have circulated online since the TEA’s announcement, but are they true? Is the Texas Education Agency requiring teachers to return to work while their office is closed through January? TEA gives staffers choice to return this month When asked about the source of the info, Zarifis said he had seen it referenced in several social media posts and on the TEA website. Later, Zarifis said he misspoke, and said he was unable to find any post that mentioned the offices staying closed through January.  The TEA website says agency employees began a mandatory telework policy on March 17, and the office is not accepting visitors at this time. But Morath and at least 30 other employees have been working in the office since March, according to TEA spokesman Frank Ward. ""Commissioner Morath and other Texas Education Agency staff whose job duties require them to be in the office have been working from the William B. Travis Building since March — just as they did before the pandemic hit,"" Ward said in an email.  Also, starting this month, all TEA staff have the ability to return to the building on a voluntary basis this month, Ward said, but did not specify how many people had chosen to return so far.  ""Based on local public health conditions, the individual and the family needs of our team, and the agency’s organizational needs, we are currently determining additional next steps for our staff for later this summer and beyond,"" he said.  Meanwhile, the number of teachers who will be physically in classrooms this fall depends on the local needs of students and parents in each individual district, said Ward. While the agency is requiring districts to offer in-person classes, some parents may opt to keep their children at home, and thus, lower the demand for teachers who are physically in classrooms. Under Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide mask mandate, all people on campus over 10 years old will be required to wear masks, presuming that the order is still in effect when classes resume.  Our ruling The president of the Austin school employees’ union said the leader of the Texas Education Agency is requiring teachers to return to classrooms while keeping his offices closed through January.  While the new rules for the fall semester do mean that some teachers will have to go back into school buildings, it doesn’t look like Morath is hunkering down through January — in fact, he’s been in-office since March, along with other staff who are deemed essential.  Although it’s unknown how many TEA staffers are back in the office at this moment, they did have the option to begin returning this month.

Did Pa. send more Black troops to fight for the Union during the Civil War than any other state?
","Speaking to a group of ironworkers about his new $700 billion economic revival plan, Joe Biden on Thursday criticized President Donald Trump over his defense of the Confederate flag and touted the prominent role Pennsylvanians played in the Civil War. ""Three hundred sixty thousand Pennsylvanians fought on the side of the Union to defeat the flag, that Confederate flag, including more Black soldiers coming from Pennsylvania than any other state in the nation,"" Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee, said in Dumore, Pa. We wondered whether Biden’s telling of the state’s Civil War history was accurate. Biden is correct that about 360,000 Pennsylvanians fought for the Union Army during the war, according to a Civil War tourism website maintained by Pennsylvania and several history websites dedicated to commemorating the recent 150th anniversary of the war’s end.  He’s also right that more Black soldiers hailed from the Keystone State than any other free state in the Union. During the war, roughly 185,000 Black men served in what was then known as the United States Colored Troops or the United States Colored Infantry, even though Black men couldn’t serve at all when the war began in 1861. And 8,612 of those men called Pennsylvania home, army records maintained by the National Archives show. According to those records, the first three Union regiments of Black soldiers formed in New Orleans in the fall of 1862, after the Second Confiscation and Militia Act was signed earlier that summer. But it was not until President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863 that the Union Army could use Black soldiers in combat. Six months later, in June 1863, Camp William Penn in Cheltenham opened as a training facility for Black troops. More than 11,000 Black soldiers trained there. They fought at Fort Wagner, the Battle of Olustee, and the Battle of New Market Heights. Frederick Douglass occasionally visited troops stationed at the camp. In the end, Pennsylvania had more Black Union soldiers than any other northern free state, with 8,612.  Kentucky had more Black Union soldiers than any other Union state where slavery was legal, with 23,703. And Louisiana had the largest number of Black Union soldiers among the Confederate states, whose economies depended on the inhumane practice of slavery. When the Civil War ended, the Union Army snubbed its Black soldiers and declined to invite them to march in a victory parade held in Washington. In fact, some Black soldiers were still standing guard in the South when the parade took place. But six months later, Pennsylvania officials invited Black soldiers to march through Harrisburg, making Pennsylvania the only state to honor Black troops this way. Biden said that 360,000 Pennsylvanians fought for the Union Army during the Civil War and that more of the army’s Black soldiers hailed from Pennsylvania than any other state. Those statistics both check out. But Biden failed to explain the distinction between the number of Black Union soldiers who hailed from Union free states where slavery was illegal, the number who hailed from Union states where slavery was legal, and the number who hailed from Confederate states whose economies revolved around enslaving people.  We rate Biden’s statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/jul/10/joe-biden/did-pa-send-more-black-troops-fight-union-during-c/

Unions limit police accountability, but Moore claim exaggerates impact
","What should happen to police officers who injure or kill someone while making an arrest? That’s the crux of a debate that played out in Congress and streets across America in the wake of the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd. He died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly 9 minutes as three other officers declined to step in. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act on June 25, 2020, which would crack down on excessive force and create a national database of officer misconduct. But a similar policing bill failed to pass the U.S. Senate the day before, leaving the future of federal police reform in doubt. In the leadup to that House vote, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, weighed in on police misconduct, criticizing the role of police unions in the accountability process. ""I think it’s outside of the scope of a union to be able to negotiate lack of accountability, to be able to negotiate those kinds of things away."" Moore said in a June 12, 2020, appearance on PBS Wisconsin’s ""Here & Now."" ""You can’t train out of a person the propensity to kill, to, if that is, in fact, written into a contract that they are not going to be accountable. And so I think that we have to get rid of that provision in union contracting."" The contract language description caught our eye. Do police unions really have it written into contracts ""that they are not going to be accountable""? That’s a vague and loaded statement, which leaves us with a lot of ground to cover. Let’s get started. When asked for clarification of her remarks, Moore said she backs the ability of unions in general and police unions to negotiate hours and wages. But ""the power of collective bargaining should not be used to negotiate contracts or special benefits that shield police officers from accountability for misconduct and thus subvert the fair, impartial administration of justice and rule of law."" Moore’s claim and explanation don’t specify what kind of accountability she’s referring to, so we’ll break this down by the three primary ways law enforcement officers can be held accountable: Internal police discipline, criminal charges and civil lawsuits. Several of these elements were addressed in the House-passed Justice in Policing Act. The measure would lower the criminal intent standard — from ""willful"" actions to ""knowing"" or ""reckless"" actions — needed to convict an officer in a federal criminal case, and it limited the use of qualified immunity as a defense against liability when an officer is sued in a civil action.  Qualified immunity is a judicial standard under which officers acting in their official capacity are protected from lawsuits unless they have violated a ""clearly established"" statutory or constitutional right. But Moore’s claim was that union contracts ban accountability, so we’ll look specifically at how those three elements are affected. And since her claim was broad rather than limited to a single department, we’ll look generally at police union power around the country. Experts in police accountability say unions wield considerable power in many departments, having negotiated rules and limitations that give police protections the general public doesn’t have and limit some elements of accountability. These protections apply primarily to internal investigations. ""Union contracts can impede internal investigations into police conduct,"" said Stephen Rushin, an associate law professor at Loyola University Chicago who has reviewed more than 650 police union contracts while studying police labor law. ""While this might not be uniformly true across all agencies in the United States, it appears to be the case in many."" Here are some common protections, as detailed by Rushin and Seth Stoughton, associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina. They noted many contracts have language in this vein, but not all. Interview delays — Some contracts require agencies to wait a set amount of time (typically 24 or 48 hours) before they can interview an officer about an incident. Information access — Some contracts require an agency to provide the officer with the complaint, witness statements and other documentation prior to being interviewed — access that wouldn’t be allowed to any civilian criminal suspect. Complaint limitations — Some contracts ban anonymous complaints or require complaints to be made within a certain time period. Disciplinary history — Some contracts require agencies to destroy disciplinary records after a set amount of time (in some cases less than a year) or mandate prior discipline not be considered in future cases. Arbitration/grievance requirements — Some contracts allow officers to contest disciplinary findings through an arbitration process. Samuel Walker, emeritus professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha, noted the arbitration process consistently tends to find a middle ground. In other words, a reduction of department-ordered discipline. ""There’s been a long record of officers who were fired and went to arbitration and got their jobs back,"" he said. Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, said arbitration clauses are rare in Wisconsin. Union contracts don’t have a direct impact on criminal charges since those decisions are made by prosecutors. Police officers are ""supposed to get the same rights as any private citizen during the criminal investigation,"" Rushin said. One complication is that departments may have an internal investigation running at the same time as a criminal investigation. A 1967 Supreme Court decision (Garrity v. New Jersey) said statements compelled as part of an internal investigation can’t be used against the officer in criminal court. So there are procedural hoops to make sure statements given by officers would be admissible. But this is a protection afforded by case law, not union contracts. The bigger impact, potentially, is that protections afforded as part of the internal investigation — particularly the delayed interview and access to case information beforehand — can give officers a chance to strategize how they present their version of events, which could affect the outcome of both the internal and criminal cases. ""No civilian would have the right to do that,"" said David Harris, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. ""Of course, one can't make the civilian answer questions; civilians could shut up or lawyer up. But the police officer, in the same situation, can't be approached.  They call it a ‘cooling off’ period. One might also call it a ‘get your story straight’ period."" Rushin said it is common for union contracts to make sure officers aren’t held personally liable in the event of a civil judgment against them, and to require the municipality to provide legal representation for the officer. But that practice, called indemnification, is so widespread it’s not necessarily fair to assume unions are the reason for that, Rushin said. A 2014 study of civil rights claims against 81 police agencies around the country found governments paid 99.98% of the $730 million plaintiffs received in lawsuits alleging civil rights violations by law enforcement between 2006 and 2011. ""Officers did not contribute to settlements and judgments even when they were disciplined, terminated, or criminally prosecuted for their misconduct,"" the study says. ""And officers were not required to contribute to settlements and judgments even when applicable law prohibited indemnification."" So the evidence is clear that union contracts have an impact on police accountability. Contract language varies between jurisdictions, but many union contracts give officers rights during investigations that a civilian would not have. They are given time and material to prepare statements, they are shielded from certain types of complaints, they can’t have some past misconduct held against them, and they have the right to appeal discipline leveled against them. But these impacts are largely limited to internal investigations, which are just one of three main ways police can be held accountable. The protections can have an impact on how criminal cases proceed, but contracts can’t keep officers from being prosecuted. And civil lawsuits are still filed against officers, though officers are almost never held personally liable. Other civil-related protections such as qualified immunity don’t come from union contracts. And Moore’s claim wasn’t simply that union contracts limit accountability. She said police are banned from being held accountable. Walker, the Nebraska professor, called that a ""gross exaggeration."" Moore said police unions have it ""written into a contract that (officers) are not going to be accountable"" for misconduct. The context implies that this is referring in particular to deaths they cause. This is a sweeping claim that implies by its lack of specificity that officers are shielded from internal, criminal and civil liability by language in their union contract. Unions simply don’t have that kind of power. Police unions do offer protections that can make it more difficult to discipline officers, or result in lesser punishments. But officers protected by union contracts are routinely fired, criminally charged and successfully sued in civil court. There’s a point to be made about union contract influence, but Moore’s attempt to make it was greatly exaggerated. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/10/gwen-moore/unions-limit-police-accountability-discipline/

NC Republican wrongfully says masks 'do not work'
","At a campaign event in western North Carolina on July 4, the state’s Republican candidate for governor dismissed the need for face coverings during the coronavirus pandemic. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who’s running for governor against incumbent Democrat Roy Cooper, said scientific evidence doesn’t support mask mandates. ""There have been multiple comprehensive studies at the deepest level held to scientific standards in controlled environments that have all said for decades, masks do not work with viruses,"" he told a reporter for The Hendersonville Times-News. Is it true that studies ""all said"" that masks ""do not work on viruses?"" Forest’s statement that they ""do not work"" ignores recent studies -- and federal healthcare guidance -- showing that mask-wearing does reduce the spread of coronavirus. While virologist and Trump advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and other experts have said masks alone don’t guarantee protection from the virus, they do believe masks can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. But, by saying ""all"" studies show no use for masks, Forest left himself no margin for error. So we asked the Forest campaign to cite Forest’s sources. Campaign spokesman Andrew Dunn noted an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on April 1 titled, ""Universal masking in hospitals in the Covid-19 era."" Dunn quoted a line from the authors’ opening statement, which reads: ""We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."" Authors go on to say the purpose of their article is to examine ""whether a mask offers any further protection in health care settings in which the wearer has no direct interactions with symptomatic patients."" Authors later noticed that people were quoting their article to discourage mask-wearing, so they released a follow-up letter to clarify their position.  ""We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less,"" researchers wrote in a June 1 letter. They acknowledged writing the sentence that Dunn cited, then said: ""but as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, we intended this statement to apply to passing encounters in public spaces, not sustained interactions within closed environments. A growing body of research shows that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is strongly correlated with the duration and intensity of contact."" Dunn also cited a study, published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine in 2015, that examined the use of ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"" to reduce the spread of the flu. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are public health strategies used to reduce virus transmissions. These interventions include home quarantine for infected persons, social distancing, reduction in public gatherings, and masks. Dunn pointed out that researchers wrote that there are ""widely disparate findings on masks' effectiveness in combating viruses."" The study examined existing reports on NPIs, but found that many of the reports were flawed. Researchers reviewed 100 studies on intervention strategies and found inconclusive results for most of them, including masks. Of those 100 studies, researchers wrote that ""only seven met all selection criteria and pooled analysis was not feasible"" because they had ""significant design flaws."" Researchers wrote: ""Reduction of viral transmission by non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) has a significant appeal and is often recommended. However, the efficacy of such interventions is unclear … Despite the potential for NPI in preventing influenza transmission, there is very limited data available. … Properly designed studies evaluating large populations including ‘at risk’ patients and in a variety of communities are needed."" That was 2015. Now fast forward to the emergence of COVID-19. Researchers have launched multiple studies on potential methods for stifling the outbreak, finding that masks could help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Back in April, researchers wrote in the U.S. National Library of Medicine that ""to date, no study has been done to examine the effectiveness of masks against the SARS‐CoV‐2 causing COVID‐19. However, a recent study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses has demonstrated that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in droplets."" A study published in The Royal Society on June 10 found ""the results of two mathematical models and show that facemask use by the public could make a major contribution to reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."" Another study, published in The Lancet medical journal on June 1, found that ""face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection."" Another study, coming out in the August edition of the International Journal of Nursing Studies, concluded that ""community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic."" Rachel Graham, assistant professor of epidemiology at the UNG Gillings School of Global Public Health, noted that a study out of Germany found that a mask mandate decreased the COVID-19 growth rate by about 40%. When it comes to mask-wearing, Graham said: ""It’s not that there’s no transmission, it’s that there’s less."" The CDC, which earlier this year said masks weren’t necessary in public places, changed its guidance on April 3 after studies found that the virus can be spread by asymptomatic individuals. Now, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering saying they ""help protect people around you"" and are ""most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.""  PolitiFact has reported on the effectiveness of masks on several occasions, quoting experts who say coverings, when worn properly, can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 when combined with other prevention methods such as frequent hand washing and social distancing. Forest said ""there have been multiple comprehensive studies at the deepest level held to scientific standards in controlled environments that have all said for decades, masks do not work with viruses."" His statement overlooks recent data, news stories, CDC guidance and the advice of one of President Trump’s top pandemic advisors. While face coverings alone can’t guarantee protection from a virus, recent studies show they do reduce the risk of spreading the virus. And that’s the goal in this pandemic: to stop the spread. So Forest’s claim that masks ""do not work"" is inaccurate. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/09/dan-forest/nc-republican-wrongfully-says-masks-do-not-work/

The CDC says people should ""wear a cloth face mask covering their nose and mouth in community settings,"" especially in areas of widespread COVID-19 illness.  The World Health Organization has a slightly different view on masks. It recommends health workers, anyone with COVID-19 symptoms and anyone caring for someone with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 should wear medical masks.  But WHO says it doesn’t recommend masks for ""widespread use among the public for control of COVID-19.""

We wondered whether Cartwright, whose reelection bid in a district Trump carried in 2016 and is expected to be one of the state’s most competitive, really backs a movement that the president and his allies have seized on as an example of Democratic overreach. He does not. During a virtual listening session he hosted last month with the Black Scranton Project and the Wilkes-Barre and Monroe County chapters of the NAACP, Cartwright was asked whether he supports calls to defund the police, a movement that has gained steam in some progressive circles in the weeks since the police killing of George Floyd. His response was clear. ""There have been voices calling for defunding and disbanding police forces. I personally do not agree with that,"" Cartwright said, advocating instead for new investment in law enforcement officer training and an expansion of community policing. An audio clip of the exchange is available on Cartwright’s Facebook page. ""I think that’s the answer,"" he continued. ""The idea of defunding, I don’t agree with that."" The Bognet campaign news release accusing Cartwright of supporting the movement linked to another audio clip of the congressman speaking during that same virtual listening session. The clip appears on the YouTube channel of the Congressional Leadership Fund, which works to elect Republicans to Congress. In this clip, a listening session participant can be heard telling Cartwright that Wilkes-Barre funds its police force more generously than several other departments, and asks if there’s a way to reallocate some of those funds. ""The answer is absolutely yes,"" Cartwright says.

Batch of faulty CDC COVID-19 tests didn’t contain the live virus
","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn’t send out COVID-19 testing kits that were ""seeded"" with the live virus, as one Facebook post claims. The post shows an illustration of a nasal swab being used to test for the virus. Text on the graphic reads:  ""COVID-19 test HAS the virus … ‘the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent states tainted lab test kits in early February that were themselves seeded with the virus, federal officials confirmed.’"" This is wrong. The CDC initially sent out a batch of defective COVID-19 testing kits to a limited number of laboratories in early February that had to be recalled — but the tests weren’t contaminated with the live virus and didn’t have the capability to infect people being tested. In fact, the tests were early in their development at the time and never made it to the stage of being used for patient testing. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The CDC first dispersed diagnostic COVID-19 testing kits to a network of public labs in February, but the agency had to recall the tests after a component turned out to be contaminated. The defective tests came out of the public health agency’s central laboratory complex in Atlanta. Media outlets first reported about the faulty tests in March.  The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General released a special report about what happened on June 19.  A summary of the report said that the batch of tests relied on a reagent that was likely contaminated. Reagents are chemical substances that are used in tests to produce reactions. The defective tests were in the second of two sets of kits developed by the CDC in late January, the report says. The first set was sent to a limited number of public health labs and had no reported issues. The problem came with the second batch, which the CDC intended to manufacture for the first wave of testing — at least until commercial labs and diagnostic companies were able to mass-produce their own. ""One of the three reagents in this initial batch of manufactured test kits was likely contaminated. These tests are so sensitive that this contamination could have been caused by a single person walking through an area with positive control material and then later entering an area where tests reagents were being manipulated,"" the report stated.  The public health labs attempted to validate the test kits before using them on swabs from people, but a negative control gave a positive result, and the kits were scrapped. Scientists eventually redesigned the test to be run without the reagent and in February began to distribute the approved kits. The CDC also confirmed that there was no live virus in the test. And Dr. Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of the Clinical Virology Lab at Stanford Medicine, told PolitiFact that infectious live viruses are not used to produce tests. ""The HHS investigation indicates that there was likely contamination of the N3 reagents with the positive control material,"" Pinsky wrote in an email. ""No infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus is part of the kit, nor is it used in any step of its manufacture."" A Facebook post claimed that the CDC ""sent states tainted lab test kits"" in February that ""were themselves seeded with the virus."" This is inaccurate. The CDC sent out early COVID-19 tests to a limited number of public health labs that turned out to be defective due to a contaminated reagent.  But these tests didn’t and couldn’t contain the live virus, as live virus isn’t used in test production in the first place. Meanwhile, the tests were early in their development and never made it to the stage of being used for patient testing.

Claim that Democratic leaders aren’t using masks based on old picture
","One of the many COVID-19 conspiracies circulating on Facebook focuses on the supposed benefits Democrats get from the presence of the virus. A June 30, 2020, post in a conservative Facebook group said ""hype"" about COVID-19 allows Democrats to limit President Donald Trump’s campaign rallies, minimize public attention on former Vice President Joe Biden and to cancel the national convention scheduled for Milwaukee to block Bernie Sanders from gaining support there. The post includes a picture of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talking with several other Democratic leaders in Congress. In addition to facebook, the picture and claim were posted on an array of conservative websites, all implying a conspiracy while asserting COVID-19 hype benefits Democrats. But the Facebook post added one other element. The text above the list of supposed benefits says in bold letters, ""NO MASK in private. NO SOCIAL DISTANCE."" Let’s take a closer look at that part of the claim. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Did Democratic leaders including Pelosi huddle up as pictured without standard COVID-19 precautions? Pelosi has been a strong proponent of mask-wearing (in contrast to Trump’s refusal to wear one in public). Two days before this Facebook post, CNN quoted her as saying a federal mandate on mask wearing is ""long overdue."" A New York Times story from a month earlier said Pelosi has ""relentlessly, and strategically, made masks a part of her platform."" So the allegation of hypocrisy here is noteworthy, particularly with the supposed photographic proof. But the picture is not what it seems. The image, taken by Andrew Harnik of the Associated Press, dates to Dec. 18, 2019. It shows Pelosi speaking with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal after the House voted to impeach President Trump, the original caption says. At that point, the COVID-19 outbreak was just beginning in Wuhan, China. The first case in the U.S. wasn’t confirmed until more than a month later. The first stay-at-home order enforcing social distancing wasn’t imposed until March 2020, in California. So, of course, Pelosi and the others pictured would not be social distancing or wearing masks. And we’ll note, Pelosi has been very conscious of mask and social distancing recommendations. When joined by other Democrats at a recent news conference, the dozens of lawmakers were spaced for social distancing. House committee meetings have been held virtually, and for in-person meetings, masks have been the norm. What’s more, Pelosi consistently wears a mask when appearing in public. A Facebook post shows Pelosi and other Democratic leaders huddled together, criticizing them for not wearing masks or following social distancing guidelines. But the image is from December 2019, months before masks and distance became part of the national response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Citing it as proof in a dramatically different landscape eight months later is ridiculous, particularly when Pelosi has actually been a strong supporter of mask-wearing and social distancing for herself and the Congressional body she oversees. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/jul/08/facebook-posts/claim-democratic-leaders-arent-masks-Pelosi/
