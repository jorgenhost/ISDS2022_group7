Hillary Clinton says American 401(k)s lost $100 billion after Brexit vote
","In a speech attacking her opponent, Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump cheered while the economy reeled in the aftermath of Britain’s shocking vote to leave the European Union. ""On Friday, when Britain voted to leave the European Union, he crowed from his golf course about how the disruption could end up creating higher profits for that golf course, even though, within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s,"" Clinton said in Ohio June 27. ""He tried to turn a global economics challenge into an infomercial."" Trump did say last week that Brexit would benefit Turnberry, his golf course in Scotland, because a weaker pound would bring more tourists. We wondered, though, about the other part of Clinton’s claim: that Brexit caused 50 million Americans with 401(k) retirement savings accounts to lose $100 billion in just 24 hours. The nitty-gritty Most 401(k) accounts are tied, at least in part, to the stock market. And the market took a pretty big hit from the British referendum, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 3.4 percent and the S&P 500 index falling 3.6 percent. However, we couldn’t find an ongoing daily log of the total value of Americans’ 401(k)s. The Investment Company Institute puts the figure at $4.8 trillion as of March 31, 2016. The Clinton campaign explained to us how they calculated that $100 billion figure, and experts told us the reasoning was sound. Basically, the campaign took that March figure for the total value of all 401(k) accounts, $4.8 trillion, and calculated any growth through June 23, the day before the Brexit vote, and then the subsequent fall. They based the growth on changes in the U.S. stock market, as stocks account for about 66 percent of 401(k) assets, and fixed income, which accounts for 27 percent. Their end result: An estimated drop of $110 billion in 401(k) assets from June 23 to June 24. Click here to see the full explanation of the campaign’s math. The campaign approached this analysis correctly, said Wade Pfau, an expert in retirement finance and founder of RetirementResearcher.com. ""They may have even underestimated the loss by assuming all stocks are U.S. stocks. International stocks fell a lot further,"" he said. ""But, certainly, I think their analysis is a fair and reasonable assessment about the extent of the impact on 401(k)s."" Jack VanDerHei, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, also said the campaign’s calculation was a decent approximation of 401(k) losses after the Brexit vote. Running his own numbers, he came up with an estimated $104 billion loss. Experts said, though, that average 401(k) account holders don’t need to panic. The big picture ""The number sounds big, but it is a small percent of the total, and it is not as though this money is lost forever,"" Pfau said. Four days after the Brexit vote, the U.S. stock market is starting to stabilize and creep back up. Consequently, so are the values of Americans’ 401(k)s. Spokesmen at 401(k) providers Charles Schwab and Fidelity told us they had received many calls from account holders worried about their assets following the Brexit vote. They both said they encourage clients to stay the course and remember that saving for retirement is a long-term investment that shouldn’t be irreparably harmed by last week’s market volatility. Generally, 401(k) accounts belonging to younger people have a higher concentration of stocks, in order to maximize growth for as long as possible. But as account holders get closer to retirement, they should reduce that concentration, effectively reducing their accounts’ exposure to market volatility, said Fidelity spokesman Mike Shamrell. ""People who have the most stock in 401(k) are those who will be impacted the most, so young people,"" Shamrell said. ""But they’ve got the longest until they retire, so years and years and years to make it up."" Alternatively, if someone were to sell some of his or her assets amid the post-Brexit vote market turmoil, that would permanently lock in some of their losses, Pfau said. Our ruling After Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, ""within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s,"" Clinton said.  Experts told us that Clinton’s calculation was a reasonable approximation of the loss of 401(k) assets amid market turmoil following the Brexit vote. That being said, those losses are very likely impermanent. 401(k) accounts are long-term investments designed to withstand brief shocks like this. The claim is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.","[('Clinton campaign, Cincinnati speech transcript, June 27, 2016', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-markets-steadier-after-brexit-related-rout-1467099488'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Global Markets Steady After Brexit-Related Rout,"" June 28, 2016', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Dow Industrials Tumble After ‘Brexit’ Vote,"" June 25, 2016', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/pound-plunges-on-u-k-vote-to-leave-eu-1466753711'), ('CNBC, ""Dow closes down 600 after Brexit surprise; financials post worst day since 2011,"" June 27, 2016', 'No link'), ('Investment Company Institute, ""Retirement Assets Total $24.1 Trillion in First Quarter 2016,"" June 23, 2016', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/24/us-markets.html'), ('Investment Company Institute, ""401(k) Plan Asset Allocation, Account Balances, and Loan Activity in 2014,"" April 2016', 'No link'), ('Investment Company Institute, ""Frequently Asked Questions About 401(k) Plans,"" Sept. 2014', 'https://www.ici.org/research/stats/retirement/ret_16_q1'), ('Email interview, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, June 27, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview, EBRI research director Jack VanDerHei, June 27, 2016', 'https://www.ici.org/pdf/per22-03.pdf'), ('Email interview, American College retirement income professor Wade Pfau, June 27, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Charles Schwab spokesman Mike Peterson, June 27, 2016', 'https://www.ici.org/policy/retirement/plan/401k/faqs_401k'), ('Phone interview, Fidelity spokesman Mike Shamrell, June 27, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/jun/28/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-american-401ks-lost-100-billi/

The dark money that helped pass a soda tax and the mayoral candidate who opposed it
","Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney made it clear during his candidacy that he was against the use of dark money in politics. But his months-long campaign to make Philadelphia the first major U.S. city with a soda tax benefitted from just that. In 2015, when Kenney was running for mayor, he threw support behind a bill in City Council that aimed to remove dark money from elections. ""I support Council President Clarke’s bill,"" he said of the measure, according to the Philadelphia Tribune. ""And, as mayor, I will fight to eliminate the influence of money in campaigning and governance."" Which brings us to Monday, when Philadelphia Magazine revealed that a pro-soda-tax nonprofit, which paid for a television ad campaign, was funded with dark money. Philadelphia law does not place the same limits on policy campaigns as elections. Lobbyists backing legislative actions only have to report donors who give more than a tenth of their cash overall. Reporting these larger contributions is required not on a frequent basis, but a quarterly one. Philadelphians for a Fair Future is a coalition that counts a deep list of local nonprofits, advocacy groups, unions and community organizations as members. Aside from the rallying that came from within its ranks and the commercials, the group also backed polls. Kenney absolutely supported the efforts of Philadelphians for a Fair Future. At the press conference announcing their formation, he introduced them. ""It's going to be an air war. It's going to be a ground war, and there are going to be lobbyists out the wazoo, all right? And they're going to be making big money doing it,"" he said, according to Newsworks. ""These,"" Kenney said of the nonprofit, ""are my lobbyists."" Committee of 70 president David Thornburgh said addressing the lack of transparency should trump placing limits on civic campaign contributions. ""In a perfect world, those contributions and/or expenditures would be required to be reported in as near to real time as possible,"" he said. ""The technology doesn’t stand in the way. We could literally do this same day if we wanted to. That’s the best antidote to the sense that there’s something fishy going on here."" Michael Bloomberg, the largest donor according to Philadelphia Magazine, gave roughly $1.5 million to Philadelphians for a Fair Future. Without a full public accounting, there’s no way to know how much funding the nonprofit received from donors like that. Kevin Feeley, a spokesman for Philadelphians for a Fair Future told PolitiFact PA the nonprofit will disclose ""all of its donors"" with the next filing, due July 30. This means the coalition would be reporting more than it is legally required to. Dark money was a topic of conversation during the lead-up to the mayoral primary last year, especially after candidate Lynne Abraham called on her fellow candidates to reject such funding. Kenney told Newsworks, ""We don't have the capacity to ban 'dark money.' It's the United States Supreme Court that said they're allowed to do it, and they're doing it. ""If you can get me some idea of how I can stop them from doing it other than turning off everyone's televisions, I don't know what it is I can do. Am I glad it exists? No. But it exists, and I didn't create the situation. I assume I'm going to see something negative about me that I won't like coming from one of those [independent expenditure groups]. But, that's life until the Supreme Court changes a ruling."" Philadelphians for a Fair Future is not able to submit additional filings between the quarterly schedule as updates. The group is able to share the names of donors as it pleases for public reading. According to Feeley, no such plan exists. The current lobbying law was the city’s first ever; it passed in 2010. It would take another City Council ordinance to lower the 10-percent threshold, and require lobbying to report more donors contributions. Kenney has yet to support such reforms publicly. ""Of course, not everything can be done in the administration’s first six months, so we anticipate future action on campaign finance reforms in the months and years to come,"" Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said in an email. ""The mayor is open to reforms related to lobbying, campaign finance or regulations specific to the use of 501(c)4s in policy pushes like the soda tax,"" she later clarified.   Our Ruling Kenney told the Philadelphia Tribune, ""As mayor, I will fight to eliminate the influence of money in campaigning and governance."" In regards to reforming the current city lobbying law, he hasn’t ""fought"" to tighten it. Philadelphians for a Fair Future’s pro-soda tax efforts were well-funded civic campaigns that did not come out of the mayor’s office. He did call them his lobbyists however. Kenney did not distance himself from the group that, so far, has not shared its full donor list. A concern on current reporting requirements is not solely on their totality, but on their frequency. We cannot expect to know all the donors until a month from now. Kenney did not push for lobbying law reform during the soda tax debate, and he isn’t at present. We rate Kenney’s promise on eliminating dark money in politics a Full Flop.","[('""Kenney releases \'ethical, accessible and transparent government\' policy paper,"" Newsworks, March 23, 2015', 'http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/ninetynine/79886-kenney-releases-ethical-accessible-and-transparent-government-policy-paper'), ('""Pro-soda tax group will disclose donors, spokesman says,"" Newsworks, March 25, 2016', 'No link'), ('""Meet the Dark Money Forces Behind Philly’s Soda Tax,"" Philadelphia Magazine, June 27, 2016', 'http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/92208-pro-soda-tax-group-will-disclose-donors-spokesman-says'), ('Email, Kevin Feeley, spokesman for Philadelphians for a Fair Future, June 27-28, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email, Lauren Hitt, communication director for Mayor’s Office, City of Philadelphia, June 27-28, 2016', 'http://www.phillymag.com/citified/2016/06/27/jim-kenney-soda-tax-dark-money/#xokqpDfSLJSOKer1.99'), ('""Philadelphia Board of Ethics, Regulation No. 9, Lobbying,"" Philadelphia Board of Ethics, 2012', 'No link'), ('\'Dark Money\' ban gets support from Williams, Kenney,"" Philadelphia Tribune, April 25, 2015', 'http://www.phillymag.com/citified/2016/06/27/jim-kenney-soda-tax-dark-money/#xokqpDfSLJSOKer1.99')]",/factchecks/2016/jun/28/jim-kenney/the-dark-money-that-helped-pass-soda-tax/

Nevada Democrats correct in attacking Donald Trump's nonexistent plan to reduce cost of college
","What would Donald Trump do to lower the cost of higher education as president? Absolutely nothing, says Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange, who along with fellow Democrats has constantly berated Trump in press conferences and news releases. Here’s what she said after a Moody’s report claimed Trump’s proposed economic policies would result in millions of lost jobs and a contracting economy. ""He says ‘wages are too high’ and has literally no plans to make higher education more affordable,"" she said in a press release. So is it true that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has ""literally no plans"" to make higher education more affordable? After reviewing the candidate’s stated policy positions and various media appearances, we’re pretty confident in saying that Trump has no clearly defined plan to reduce the cost of higher education. Schooling Trump Higher education reform and student loan debt are not detailed on Trump’s campaign website — his ""Issues"" and ""Positions"" pages don’t touch on education outside of two short videos of the candidate promising to repeal Common Core. (The federal government is prohibited from directing states to adopt or not adopt the standards.) The Trump campaign didn’t return emails seeking comment, but the candidate has mentioned student loan debt and the rising cost of college on a few occasions. In a 22-second Twitter video from last year, Trump called student loan debt a ""tremendous problem,"" but he only made a vague promise to ""restructure"" it and make college more affordable. Trump also indirectly addressed rising student loan debt during a question-and-answer session with students at Simpson College in Iowa, acknowledging it as a ""huge problem"" but identifying job creation and ""great leadership"" as ways to fix the problem. But other than a handful of interviews, Trump hasn’t described how exactly he’d make college more affordable. It’s a far cry from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who in May 2012 released a 35-page white paper in part detailing his plans to reshape higher education policy. And 2008 GOP nominee John McCain also proposed several specific higher education policy changes on his campaign website. Trump’s likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has spoken at length about her plans for higher education. She released her ""New College Compact"" plan in August 2015. The closest thing the Trump campaign has to a ""higher education plan"" was revealed in a Inside Higher Ed interview with Trump’s national co-chairman and policy director, Sam Clovis. Clovis said a Trump administration would focus on overhauling the student loan system by transitioning the responsibility for lending from the government to private banks, and floated the idea of basing loan eligibility on which majors college students pick. ""If you are going to study 16th century French art, more power to you. I support the arts,"" Clovis said in a May interview. ""But you are not going to get a job."" So Trump’s closest thing to a higher education ""plan"" is returning to a system where private banks, not the federal government, would extend loans to students while requiring colleges to have more ""skin in the game."" As PolitiFact has previously reported, the federal government in 1965 took several steps to help more students attend college, including guaranteeing loans against default and promising a set interest rate to banks extending the loans to students. That changed in 2010, when Democrats approved a new law cutting out the bank subsidies and replacing them with direct loans overseen by federal agencies and funded by the U.S. Treasury. High-profile critics like Trump and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. D-Mass., have panned the change as generating profit on the backs of over-burdened college students, but it’s not clear that a shift to the old system or Trump’s proposal would make college cheaper. Our ruling Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lange says Donald Trump ""literally has no plans to make higher education more affordable."" Trump hasn’t released any sort of traditional higher education reform plan — much less any details on how to make college more affordable — unlike Clinton, Romney and McCain. However, Trump has commented several times on the spiraling cost of student loan debt and said he doesn’t want the federal government making a profit on the backs of students.

Texas Republican Kevin Brady errs in comparison of U.S. tax code
","House Republicans announced last Thursday legislation that they say would simplify the tax code, lower taxes, boost job creation and improve international competitiveness. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, co-hosted the press conference — part of the GOP’s ""Better Way"" initiative — along with Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. During the announcement, Brady compared the United States tax code to other countries’ and made one notable claim about United States exporters. ""No longer will we be the only major country that taxes its own exports,"" Brady said. He wrote something similar in a Wall Street Journal editorial. This caught our eye, given a clause in the Constitution — Article I, Section 9 —  stating ""No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State."" So what was Brady referring to? A spokesperson for Brady referred us to the GOP’s ""Our Better Way"" tax plan. So we dug in. ‘Our Better Way’ The plan points to one aspect of the current tax code: the use of a federal corporate income tax rather than a federal consumption tax. Let’s explain. Many countries beside the United States use a ""value-added"" consumption tax in addition to an income tax. The VAT is complicated to explain, but in essence applies taxes throughout the production chain and not just at the end like a normal sales tax. One aspect of the VAT is ""border adjustability,"" which means the country removes the ""value-added"" tax when it’s applied to exports, said Richard Schmalbeck, a professor of law at Duke University. ""VATs are consumption taxes, and it wouldn't be appropriate for the French to tax consumption by residents of other countries,"" Schmalbeck said. ""The border adjustments assure that the tax will be borne only by French consumers."" Point being, other countries’ national consumption taxes (which the United States does not have) do not tax exports. But Brady is missing something in his comparison. Income taxes Other countries’ income taxes do capture exports under their umbrella, experts told us. Some of the income from exported goods is still made from domestic manufacturing, said H. David Rosenbloom, a professor of taxation at New York University, who called Brady’s claim ""incomplete."" ""When BMW manufactures an automobile in Germany, I would doubt very much that the income attributable to the manufacturing activity is exempt from German income taxation,"" Rosenbloom said. Exempting foreign export sales from income tax is also not an easy task, said Peter Barnes, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke University. Companies would have to keep separate books on domestic and foreign sales. He added that some countries in the past, China and India notably, have done this. However, such exemptions are not standard practice, Barnes said. Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, agreed. He said other countries’ income taxes would impose some burden on exports, even if exports are exempted from their consumption taxes. ""The ‘territorial’ corporate income taxes that most countries have are still origin-based taxes (i.e., not border adjusted),"" Rosenberg said. ""The base is essentially domestic production and those taxes apply to domestically produced goods whether they are sold at home or abroad."" A new system Among other measures designed to promote international competitiveness, the GOP plan wants to transform the United States’ current corporate income tax system, which currently lacks border adjustments, into what is called a ""destination, cash-flow based"" income tax. This new system would tax net cash flow, deduct exported sales and impose the income tax on imports. Thus, the new tax protocol provides for income taxes on the ""border adjustments"" other countries use for VAT consumption taxes. To deduct exports, companies would subtract sales abroad from revenue otherwise taxed, Rosenberg said. However, Rosenberg and other economists are also not sold on how problematic the current state of affairs actually is. ""Most economists would not expect any significant change in the terms of trade from this tax swap,"" he said. Barnes also suggested that the new tax system could compel other countries to move to a destination-based system, hurting U.S. businesses. ""Imagine if Boeing owed income tax to every country where it sold a plane,"" Barnes said. ""Or Apple."" It is also unclear that border adjustments under the new approach would be allowed by current international tax law, Rosenberg said. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also wrote the World Trade Organization might not approve this new plan. A few exceptions Even if you believe Brady broadly has something of a point comparing the U.S. system to VAT countries, he’s wrong on the specifics. Other countries do apply a direct export tax on goods. Most of these are in developing countries and are imposed only on select agricultural goods, according to a WTO report. But a few countries that impose export taxes are countries belonging to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (a typical benchmark for a major country). Norway, Turkey and Mexico have export taxes for a few select goods. Brazil has an export tax on all goods, up to 30 percent, although officials say these taxes are typically not applied. Our ruling Brady said that the United States is the only country that taxes its own exports, a problem the GOP tax plan intends to fix. Other countries do exempt exports from their consumption taxes using ""border-adjustments."" However, experts told us that Brady’s statement ignores the income taxes of other countries, which do end up taxing export income, at least in part. For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/232eaee9-6d5f-4e86-863e-162ba667e2af","[('Committee on Ways and Means, ""House Republicans Unveil 21st Century Tax Plan Built for Growth,"" June 24, 2016', 'http://waysandmeans.house.gov/house-republicans-unveil-21st-century-tax-plan-built-growth/'), ('The Wall Street Journal, ""The GOP Plan for Tax Sanity,"" June 24, 2016', 'No link'), ('National Archives and Records Administration, ""The Constitution of the United States: A Transcription.""', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gop-plan-for-tax-sanity-1466740802'), ('Congressional Research Service, ""Export Clause: Limitation on Congress’s Taxing Power,"" October 18, 2012', 'No link'), ('Speaker of the House, ""A Better Way, Our Vision For A Confident America: Tax"" June 24, 2016', 'http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html'), ('World Trade Organization, ""The Role of Export Taxes in the Field of Primary Commodities,"" 2004', 'No link'), ('OECD, Glossary of Statistical Terms: Export Taxes,"" November 11, 2001', 'https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42780.pdf'), ('The Atlantic, ""How does a ‘Value Added Tax’ Work, Anyway?""

Stephen Colbert wrong that Paul Ryan killed the House cameras in response to the Democratic sit-in
","It was June 22, 2016. House Democrats had staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to try to force a vote on gun-control legislation. The House, in response, went into recess and the cameras in the House chamber were shut off. It may not sound like the makings of a viral late-night joke, but stay tuned. Undaunted, Democrats started transmitting video and images of the sit-in via social media tools such as Periscope, a live video streaming app. The sit-in, which House Speaker Paul Ryan subsequently blasted as a publicity stunt, lasted 26 hours. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert carried a 25-second comedy bit about the event, which began with a pan up the facade of the Ed Sullivan Theater, where the show is taped, followed by a quick cut to Colbert, holding a dog and sitting on a couch with supervising producer and writer Paul Dinello. Both were watching the feed from the House floor on a wall-mounted TV. ""Why am I watching Congress on Periscope?"" Colbert asks. ""That's because Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in,"" Dinello responds. ""Really?"" Colbert responds. ""Wow, what a petty son of a —"" Suddenly the picture cuts to a cartoon of Ryan holding two ends of an unplugged power cord and the sign, ""Sorry! Technical Difficulties.""  The crowd inside the Ed Sullivan Theater cackled. But they didn’t have the full story. Did Ryan really shut off the C-SPAN cameras in the House chamber? Facebook posts said yes. Elizabeth Warren tweeted, ""@SpeakerRyan shut off the camera so you can't watch. Shameful."" The Daily Show said so as well. The real answer is no. Congress' rules for operating the cameras — which Congress controls — call for video transmission to end as soon as the gavel goes down for recess or adjournment. What happened when the protest started Roll Call provided a good timeline of the protest and the reaction of Republicans. The House was in session and cameras were rolling the morning of June 22. Lawmakers were in something called  ""Morning Hour,"" which basically allows members to speak to any issue. At about 11:25 a.m., Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., took to the House floor with a group of Democrats and demanded lawmakers vote on gun legislation. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., spoke next with a similar message. At that point, Larson yielded the floor to Lewis, who said, ""Now is the time to find a way to dramatize it, to make it real."" Lewis and a number of Democrats then sat down in the House well. At the time, Ryan wasn't at the speaker's rostrum. The presiding officer was Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla. Webster, after conferring with House staff, declared a recess. When Webster declared the recess, the cameras in the House went dead. About a half-hour later, around noon, Republicans tried to gavel the House back into session and the cameras came back on. Again, Ryan was not the presiding officer. This time it was Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas. Democrats remained in the well of the House. Poe declared that the House ""is currently not in a state of order"" and called another recess. The cameras went black again. Fast-forward to shortly after 10 p.m. The House came back into session and the cameras turned on again. This time, Ryan asked Democrats to end the protest. They didn't, and the protest continued as Republicans struggled off and on to conduct some House business into the early morning hours. At 3:13 a.m., they adjourned until Friday, and the cameras were turned off. The key point The main takeaway in all of this is what triggered the camera going on and off. The camera was off because the House was not in session, not because of an order from Ryan. That's been a House standard going back years.  This isn't the first time this has happened. During a sit-in eight years ago, cameras were cut for the Republicans when Democrats controlled the House. Minority Leader John Boehner wanted a vote on offshore oil drilling, a motion to adjourn was passed, and the C-SPAN cameras were turned off. The Republicans kept talking anyway. In that case, the lights and the microphones were turned off for a while as well. Yet the Republicans kept talking. As Politico reported, ""Democratic aides were furious at the GOP stunt."" That protest lasted five hours. But back then, social media and video streaming services weren’t in the palms of every lawmaker’s hand. When the Democrats staged the latest protest, several members were broadcasting on Facebook and Periscope. C-SPAN picked up both feeds and continued to show the events, using the same style and logos they use when they're tapping into the House cameras. We note that, in the sketch, Colbert isn't the person saying, ""Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in."" But just as we make candidates responsible for all the statements in their ads, we have no doubt Colbert approved this message. A CBS spokeswoman, who identified Dinello for us, declined comment on the content of the sketch. Our ruling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert asserted that Ryan ""shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in."" Ryan didn't order the cameras shut off in response to the protest. They were turned off because House Republicans declared the House session in recess. That's a standard policy of Congress, even if it was Republicans making the decision. Colbert's bit was funny, but on its factual basis we rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92344eb8-90bb-4f8f-8538-82fe220e5176","[('YouTube, ""Why Am I Watching Congress on Periscope?""

Hillary Clinton correct that analysts have called Donald Trump a top global economic risk
","Hillary Clinton, riding a bump in the polls, kept the heat on Donald Trump during a speech in Cincinnati that marked the first time she had campaigned alongside Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the progressive wing of her party. ""Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism,"" Clinton said during the speech on June 27, 2016. We don’t take a position on whether Trump actually is one of the top threats facing the global economy. But we thought we’d check to see whether Clinton has solid evidence that professional risk analysts have made that argument. So is Clinton right about how analysts have rated Trump? Basically, yes. When we asked the Clinton campaign what she was referring to, they pointed us to the periodic rankings of global risk published by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Economist Intelligence Unit -- an affiliate of The Economist, the London-based newsweekly -- is a research and analysis firm that supplies clients, including businesses, with information about opportunities and risks around the world. The firm made headlines in March 2016 when it listed the possibility of a Trump presidency as one of the biggest threats to ""companies’ capacity to operate at target profitability."" The rankings are based on ""qualitative"" judgments of a how powerfully an event could affect the world and how likely it is to happen, the firm says. In its March ratings, the firm rated the risks from a Trump presidency as 12 on a 25-point scale. That ranked Trump sixth among the 10-item list of biggest threats, tied with ""the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy."" But the Trump threat level increased in the July 2016 rankings. A Trump presidency now ranks as the third-biggest global threat, with an increased score of 16 on the 25-point scale. In the meantime, the risk from jihadi terrorism has remained constant with a score of 12. In the July ratings, the only higher scores were 20 for ""China experiences a hard landing"" and, in a tie with Trump, a 16 for ""currency volatility and persistent commodity prices weakness."" Specifically, the firm wrote that ""although we do not expect Mr. Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil or a sudden economic downturn."" The writeup cited his ""hostility"" to free trade, his hard line on Muslims, his ""militaristic tendencies,"" his skepticism toward NATO, and his ""indifference"" to nuclear proliferation in Asia. The firm had never rated a pending candidacy to be a geopolitical risk to the United States and the world, an official told Politico.  We checked with Robert Powell, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s New York-based global risk briefing manager, to see whether he thought Clinton’s phrasing was accurate, and he said it was. ""Her quote does accurately describe our global risk scenarios,"" Powell told PolitiFact. ""Despite the high likelihood of more terrorist attacks, the impact on the global economy tends to be relatively slight -- indeed, most global stock markets rose on the day of the Brussels attacks, for instance. However, given that the U.S. economy is the biggest in the world, we believe a Trump presidency would have a major impact on the entire global economy."" Clinton said ""risk analysts"" -- plural -- had determined Trump to be a threat, but we were unable to find any equivalent of the Economist Intelligence Unit report. (Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said that ""analysts"" was intended to refer to the multiple analysts within the Economist Intelligence Unit who came up with the ratings.) But we did find another major economic report that painted a grim picture of what could happen to the economy if Trump wins. On June 17, Moody’s Analytics, an economic research and data-services firm, published its projections of what could happen to the economy under Trump-backed policies on taxes, government spending, immigration and international trade. (We fact-checked the political background of one of the Moody's authors in another report.) ""Four basic conclusions regarding the impact of Mr. Trump’s economic proposals can be reached,"" the Moody’s team wrote. ""One, they will result in a less global U.S. economy; two, they will lead to larger government deficits and more debt; three, they will largely benefit very high-income households; and four, they will result in a weaker U.S. economy, with fewer jobs and higher unemployment."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism."" The analysts at one firm, the Economist Intelligence Unit, have declared the possibility of Trump’s election to be the third-greatest global risk in its current rankings, a risk level that has only grown since the firm began including Trump in its rankings in March. And Clinton has accurately noted that the risk factor given to a Trump presidency is higher than the rating for Islamic terrorism on the firm’s list.

Bryce Reeves falsely says Terry McAuliffe has stated his desire to be in Clinton's cabinet
","State Sen. Bryce Reeves is out to prove that Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s restoration of voting rights to more than 200,000 felons who served their time is a ploy to help Democrat Hillary Clinton win the presidency this fall. On June 17, Reeves filed a request under the Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act for all communications between the governor’s office and Clinton’s campaign. In a news release that day, the senator said that McAuliffe’s restoration order was ""motivated by his attempt to help Hillary Clinton win Virginia in the fall."" Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, elaborated during a June 19 interview on NewsRadio WINA in Charlottesville. ""Certainly, he’s looking out for his own skin,"" Reeves said of McAuliffe. ""It goes without saying that he’s made several statements that he would love to be in a Cabinet secretary position with the Clinton administration, and we’re trying to uncover that. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. One way or another, we’re going to find out what’s going on."" No doubt McAuliffe, a Democrat, is a longtime close friend and key fundraiser for Clinton and, should she win, we wouldn’t be surprised to see him working for the White House in some capacity. But we hadn’t heard the governor say once - let alone ""several"" times - that he’s aiming for a Cabinet seat. On the other hand, we have heard the governor promise to serve out his term, ending in January 2018. And during a June 3 interview on radio station WURV (103.7 FM) in Richmond, McAuliffe questioned whether his ""temperament is right to be sitting in a Cabinet"" and said he’s ""never worked for someone else in his life."" So we asked Reeves for evidence that McAuliffe has stated his ambition to be in Clinton’s Cabinet. Bill Clinton  Reeves, in an email, pointed to a story McAuliffe told in his 2007 autobiography, ""What a Party!"" McAuliffe devoted a large part of the book to talking about his friendship and fundraising feats for another Clinton - former President Bill Clinton. McAuliffe wrote that during a 1 a.m. game of cards with the Clintons at the White House in May 1999, the president mentioned that Secretary of Commerce Bill Daley would be resigning. Dorothy McAuliffe said her husband would be a good replacement, and both Clintons agreed. ""I was excited driving home that night with Dorothy thinking about being in Bill Clinton’s cabinet as secretary of commerce, and was especially pleased by the prospect of not raising money any more,"" McAuliffe wrote. But the appointment was scrubbed the next morning. McAuliffe wrote that John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, told him it would be hard to win congressional approval of a Cabinet nominee who had such close political ties to the president. McAuliffe wrote that Bill Clinton instead was willing to name him to be ambassador to the United Kingdom - a job he also would ""love"" to land. But at the request of then-Vice President Al Gore, McAuliffe wrote that he instead agreed to become chairman of the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Hillary Clinton Reeves never mentioned Bill Clinton during the radio interview. But he and radio host Rob Schilling named Hillary Clinton five times during the six-minute chat and referred to her campaign three more times. And, of course, Reeves said the goal of his FOIA request is to uncover what he claims is a political deal between McAuliffe and Hillary Clinton. So what evidence does Reeves offer that McAuliffe has said he would love to be in Hillary Clinton’s Cabinet? The senator points to: •Five articles from newspapers and electronic publications about McAuliffe’s intentions to help Clinton’s campaign. None of them mention a Cabinet position. •A partial transcript of a March 31 radio interview on WVMP in Roanoke during which McAuliffe talks about his friendship with Hillary Clinton and says, if she’s elected, ""I’m going to try to convince her that everything should go to Virginia."" No mention of an administration post. •An April 22 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on McAuliffe’s announcement of the blanket restoration of voting rights for felons. Reeves points to a disapproving quote by House Speaker Bill Howell, R-Stafford, who said McAuliffe views the governorship ""as a stepping stone to a job in Hillary Clinton’s Cabinet."" We searched the archives of four newspapers - The Times-Dispatch, The Washington Post, The Virginian-Pilot and the Daily Press -- from the start of McAuliffe’s term in January 2014 to present. We didn’t find a single article in which the governor said he wanted a Cabinet post, or any White House position, should Hillary Clinton become president. Our ruling Reeves says McAuliffe ""has made several statements that he would love to be in a Cabinet secretary position with the Clinton administration."" We wouldn’t be surprised to see McAuliffe wind up in the White House if Hillary Clinton becomes president. The two are longtime friends and political allies. Perhaps they’ve had private conversations about this. But Reeves says the governor is pining for a position and uses that statement as the basis of an attack: that McAuliffe has restored voting rights to more than 200,000 felons as part of an agreement to help Clinton win the presidency and to receive a Cabinet seat in return. There’s a burden on Reeves to provide evidence that McAuliffe is seeking a Cabinet seat, and he comes up empty. We rate his statement False.","[('State Sen.

"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Is Scott Walker right that there are more people working than ever?
","Jobs have been a constant theme for Gov. Scott Walker -- and a persistent point of attack from his opponents. In the run-up to the state Democratic Party convention, Gov. Scott Walker issued a string of 10 claims about the state’s economy on Facebook and Twitter. The first one caught our attention. ""FACT CHECK: Despite the rhetoric from Democrat politicians, more people are employed this year than at any point in the history of Wisconsin,"" Walker tweeted June 3, 2016. We’re in the fact-checking business, of course. And we closely followed Walker’s 2010 campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term. In the end, the number totaled 146,795. We rated it Promise Broken. So, is employment really at an all-time high?

Looking at the numbers When asked for backup, Walker’s team sent us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and its Local Area Unemployment Statistics report, the gold standard for statewide employment data. We looked at employment numbers going back to the 1930s. The agency counts someone as employed if during the week examined they did any work as a paid employee, work for their own business or farm, or worked 15 or more hours unpaid for an enterprise operated by a family member. People who had a job but were not working because of vacations, illness or other reasons are counted as employed. In March of 2016, the most recent date for which figures are available, more than 3 million people were employed -- the highest ever. Previously, the employment number peaked in 2008 at around 2.9 million. We wondered how many other states could make the same claim. Of the 12 states in the Midwest, six others are also at their highest number of employed persons, for seven in all. (Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska.) Some of that can be attributed to population growth. In 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated Wisconsin’s population at 5.7 million, up from 5.6 million in the 2010 census and up from 5.3 million in 2000. During the last 10 years, Wisconsin’s population grew 3.7 percent, while over the same period employment grew 2.4 percent. In the last five years, population grew 1.1 percent and employment increased 6.3 percent. ""Population growth plays a role in driving employment higher, which is why many economists like looking at things like the unemployment rate as a measure of the health of the labor market,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management. As of March, the state’s unemployment rate sat at 4.5 percent, down from recession highs of over 9 percent. The unemployment rate itself is an imperfect measure. The rate does not include people who have dropped out of the labor force and stopped looking for work, nor does it consider job quality -- that is people who are considered ""underemployed."" By that measure, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, employment was down in the 3 percent range. Our rating Walker said ""more people are employed this year than at any point in the history of Wisconsin."" Employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics back up his point, but the picture is more complex than he suggests and economists generally prefer a different measure -- the unemployment rate -- that accounts for population growth over time. We rate the claim Mostly True.    ","[('Twitter, Tweet from Scott Walker, June 3, 2016.', 'https://twitter.com/ScottWalker/status/738778654222622721'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin, Walk-O-Meter, create 250,000 new jobs, accessed June', 'No link'), ('New York Times, Which labor market data should you believe?, June 13, 2016.', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/upshot/which-labor-market-data-should-you-believe.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0'), ('Phone interview with Tom McDonald, economist, Office of economic analysis and information, Chicago, Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 13, 2016.', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Laura Dresser, associate director, Center on Wisconsin Strategy, June 16, 2016.', 'https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/55'), ('Email exchange with Tom Evenson, Deputy communications director, Gov.

"['China', 'Virginia', 'Thomas Perez']","
Tom Perez erroneously tags all Trump products with 'Made in China' label
","U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says Donald Trump does a fine job of creating jobs - in China. Perez made that dig in an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch shortly before he gave the keynote speech at the Democratic Party of Virginia’s Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner on June 18. ""Go look at a Trump product. They’re all made in China,"" Perez said. No doubt, many Trump products are made overseas, a point the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has acknowledged in debates and interviews. Perez went a few leaps beyond that in saying all Trump products are made in China. So we checked to see whether the secretary is right. We asked Perez’s office for the source of his information. Mattie Munoz, his press secretary at the Department of Labor, said that since his comments were made on private time during a political event, she couldn’t comment. She suggested contacting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, which in turn forwarded our request to the Democratic Party of Virginia. Emily Bolton, a state Democratic Party spokeswoman, said she couldn’t comment on Perez’s statement but sent us links to a series of articles about Trump products that are made overseas. So we set out on our own window-shopping spree, eying items listed on The Trump Organization’s website and searching for where they are manufactured. We found that many Trump items are made in China, including cuff links, sport coats, shirts, eyeglasses, lamps and mirrors. It’s impossible to get an exact read on what percentage of items are from China, because many items don’t disclose their exact origin. Some listed on Amazon.com and other shopping websites merely say that they’re ""imported."" We emailed the Trump campaign twice to see what percentage of his products are made in China but didn’t get a response. China isn’t the only country that makes Trump products. The billionaire candidate acknowledged during a June 21 interview on ABC that his company manufactures neckties in China, suits in Mexico, furniture in Turkey, and barware in Slovenia. We found that some Trump ties were made in Indonesia and Vietnam in addition to China. Many Trump shirts were made in Bangladesh, and some sport coats were made in India. If you’re wondering, some Trump products also are made in the U.S., including the candidate’s iconic ""Make America Great Again"" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. PunditFact gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China. Here are some other Trump products that we found are manufactured in the U.S.: •bedding comforters, advertised as being ""master suite worthy""; •cologne, called ""Success by Trump""; •Trump Natural Spring Water, served at Trump facilities. It’s bottled in Willington, Conn. by the Village Springs water company; and •Trump Wine, made on a 1,300-acre estate near Charlottesville. A disclaimer on the winery website says the GOP presidential candidate doesn’t personally own the winery, which is run by his son, Eric. We also found a few Trump suits online that were made in the U.S. Trump has said he’d like to make more products domestically, but the U.S.  can’t compete with foreign countries that ""manipulate their currencies"" to reduce manufacturing costs. Trump’s overseas product lines have become a central campaign issue for Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. In a June 21 speech, she accused the GOP candidate of hypocrisy for outsourcing his own products. Our ruling Perez said Trump’s products are ""all made in China."" There’s an element of truth to his statement in that Trump clearly relies on China to produce many products -- ties, shirts, cuff links, sport coats, jackets, lamps, eyeglasses and mirrors. That buttresses the labor secretary’s broader point that Trump relies on foreign labor to produce much of his product line. But Perez goes too far in saying all of Trump’s products are made in China. They come from a lot of other places as well. We rate his hyperbolic claim statement Mostly False.","[('Labor Secretary Thomas Perez’s comments to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, June 18, 2016.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-_C3X8Nf70'), ('Hillary Clinton’s speech in Columbus, Ohio, June 21, 2016.

The value of the pound tumbled, as did stock markets worldwide, and the International Monetary Fund downgraded the United Kingdom’s prospects of growth. Popular anger with a 10-year influx of European workers was a major driver behind the ""Leave"" vote, former British lawmaker David Miliband told NBC host Chuck Todd. There was a strong sense that immigrants, particularly those from the former Eastern Bloc, were taking advantage of Britain’s welfare services. For the largest group, Poles, Miliband said that wasn’t the case. ""The unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is lower than the unemployment rate among Brits,"" he said on Meet the Press on June 26, 2016. Miliband is certainly correct that an influx of immigrants from countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Romania (and their reliance on government services) was a central theme in the ""leave"" movement. He’s also correct that Poles working in the United Kingdom are less likely than natives of the United Kingdom to find themselves unemployed, according to the latest numbers we could find. Britain’s Office of National Statistics conducts the country’s quarterly Labour Force Survey. According to Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, in the last quarter of 2015, the unemployment rate for Poles was 3.5 percent, while the national rate stood at 5 percent. Sumption cautioned us on the numbers, noting that as in the United States, the unemployment rate is based on a survey. And with a relatively small amount of Poles living, and thus working, in the United Kingdom (a bit under 800,000 vs. the total population of 64 million), the data is somewhat thin. ""The numbers hop around a bit from quarter to quarter,"" Sumption cautioned. That’s due to the small number of Poles in the survey, ""but it has always been the case that Poles have lower unemployment than Brits."" The gap has been consistent. We used the labor survey from the first quarter of 2015 and got results similar to Sumption. (We looked at the unemployment rate of British nationals, not the average rate for the nation as a whole.) First quarter 2015 Employed Unemployed British 94.80% 5.20% Polish 95.90% 4.10%   Further confirmation comes from a 2011 Office of National Statistics report that found Polish unemployment was 5.5 percent back when the overall British rate was 7.8 percent. The problem with low unemployment While Miliband had his numbers right, his statistic missed one of the major complaints against the Poles -- that their presence makes life harder for the average British worker. When Poland along with seven other Eastern and Central European countries joined the European Union in 2004, the United Kingdom was one of only three nations that allowed the newcomers to come and work immediately. Over the years, more than half a million Poles arrived. In the 2010 European parliament elections, the pushback in Britain was palpable. The UK Independence Party, a right-leaning group, made immigration control a key issue, running ads that claimed immigrants were driving wages down. Our fact-checking colleagues in the United Kingdom, Full Fact, reported that such complaints had merit. They found that a 1 percent increase in the population of migrants was tied to a drop of .3 percent to .6 percent in wages. On the other hand, there was no clear relationship to say that immigrants took jobs away from native British workers. Our ruling Miliband said, ""The major immigration issue was about Poles, and Bulgarians, and Romanians,"" and that they weren’t contributing economically. ""The unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is lower than the unemployment rate among Brits."" The official government numbers back him up. The most recent data we found had Poles with a 3.5 percent rate,compared to 5 percent for the nation as a whole. The gap has been consistent for at least several years.

Tim Kaine on Brexit vote: Young people voted to stay, old people voted to leave
","Since the United Kingdom’s stunning vote to leave the European Union, political observers have wondered what the ramifications will be in the United States, especially what it will mean for the 2016 election. On June 26, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., for his take on Britain’s exit (Brexit). Kaine, believed to be on Hillary Clinton’s shortlist for vice president, said the United States has to maintain its ties with Europe and the United Kingdom. He also noted the generational gap among those who voted to stay in the European Union and those who voted to leave. ""Young voters, those under 50, especially millennials, overwhelmingly voted to stay,"" Kaine said. ""And it was older voters who voted to leave."" The United Kingdom voted to leave the union 52 percent to 48 percent, and it seems generally understood that older generations pushed the ""leave"" campaign over the threshold toward a win. But how do the numbers actually stack up? Usually, journalists and others rely on exit polling to learn about demographic breakdown of votes and also to call the results of an election before all ballots have been counted. However, there were no official exit polls from the Brexit vote, in part because of the difficulty of constructing a good poll on such a rare referendum. However, we did find an unofficial exit poll of more than 12,000 people, conducted by Michael Ashcroft, a British former politician and businessman who also conducts public polls. His Brexit findings support Kaine’s claim. According to Ashcroft, who supports Brexit, a majority of voters 44 years old and younger voted to remain, while those 45 and older voted to leave. (Kaine specifically mentioned voters 50 and younger, and this is as close as Ashcroft’s poll gets to that bracket.) Kaine also said millennials were especially enthusiastic about remaining in the European Union, and he’s correct. Those between 18-24 years old voted 73 percent against Brexit, and those between 25-34 years old voted 62 percent to stay, according to Ashcroft’s poll. That’s in stark contrast to voters 65 and over who voted 60 percent in favor of leaving the European Union.  Ashcroft’s polling is in line with the results of surveys conducted in advance of the vote. ""Call your nan!"" was a pitch in the last days of the ""stay"" campaign, pushing youngsters to try and flip their grandparents. The Wall Street Journal analyzed and consolidated polling from several agencies and found that among those polled, people aged 18-24 opposed Brexit 60 percent, compared to 20 percent in favor, while the rest were undecided or were not planning to vote. Among those aged 24-49, 45 percent wanted to remain, while 39 percent favored leaving. The balance flipped among older groups, with 48 percent of those aged 50-64 supporting Brexit, while 42 percent opposed. And 60 percent of those aged 65 or older supported Brexit, and just 34 percent wanted to remain in the European Union. In further support of the generational gap, the Telegraph found that areas with a higher concentration of people over the age of 65 tended to have a higher percentage of people voting in favor of Brexit compared to areas with a lower concentration of older voters. In light of this split, many young people in Britain are now expressing frustration that an older generation has made a monumental decision about the future, yet it’s the younger people who will spend many more years of their lives living with that decision. British millennials have only ever known the United Kingdom as part of a larger European community, as it joined the the European Union’s precursor more than 40 years ago, noted Cassie Werber, a Britain-based writer, in Quartz. They’re used to the freedom to work and travel throughout Europe, as well as the presence of many different cultures in their own country, particularly in a post-Soviet world. ""By the time we were born, the U.K. already had become a country in which people with widely diverse heritages coexisted, for the most part in peace,"" Werber wrote. Our ruling Kaine said of the Brexit referendum, ""Young voters, those under 50, especially millennials, overwhelmingly voted to stay. And it was older voters who voted to leave."" Based on the best polling we have, all signs point to a significant generational divide on the question of whether the United Kingdom should have remained in the European Union. It’s clear as day that millennials — those about 34 or younger — favored remaining. It seems that those between 35-50 slightly favored staying, too, while older generations heavily favored Brexit. The only caveat is that we don’t have official exit polls to support Kaine’s claim. For that reason, we rate Kaine’s claim Mostly True. ","[('Lord Ashcroft Polls, ""How the United Kingdom voted on Thursday… and why,"" June 24, 2016', 'http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/#more-14746'), ('BBC, ""The UK\'s EU referendum: All you need to know,"" June 24, 2016', 'No link'), ('BBC, ""Brexit: How much of a generation gap is there?""

Ted Cruz makes Mostly False claim about Obama directing men and boys into girls' bathrooms
","Nothing gives the president ""power to be the bathroom police,"" U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz declared at the Republican Party of Texas convention as he took fierce issue with an Obama administration letter to public schools distributed the day before. In the May 13, 2016, letter, federal agencies cited a decades-old federal law barring discrimination in educational settings as the basis for telling school superintendents nationally to let transgender students use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Cruz, fresh off his bid for president, told delegates: ""The president issued a decree to every public school in America demanding that they change their bathroom policies, demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into little girls’ bathrooms. We have entered the world of politically correct lunacy."" Did Cruz accurately sum up the Obama directive? To our emailed request for the basis of Cruz’s statement, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack said only: ""By the very text of the directive you linked, anyone in a public school, whether they are students or adults (which includes adult 18-year old students), would be able to enter any restroom."" Novack also accurately noted the guidance also applies to colleges that accept federal aid. Obama administration letter We asked a Department of Education spokeswoman, Dorie Nolt, if the directive, particularly the portion on access to restrooms and locker rooms, would also apply to adults in schools. By email, Nolt replied: ""Our guidance is related to students."" For our part, we noticed that the letter in question doesn’t tell schools to let men into girls’ restrooms; it doesn’t say anything about adults in public schools. And its language about students is focused on transgender boys and girls whose gender identity doesn’t match their sex assignment at birth. The eight-page letter from the U.S. departments of Justice and Education tells school districts to be compliant with Title IX protections against sex discrimination by allowing students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms of the gender they identify with. The letter, also affecting says the agencies are offering ""significant guidance"" on policies related to transgender students in relation to athletics, housing and overnight accommodations and education records, among areas. In regard to restrooms and locker rooms, the letter states: ""A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity. A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so. A school may, however, make individual-user options available to all students who voluntarily seek additional privacy."" Defining transgender And what qualifies as ""transgender""? Here’s how the Obama administration letter defines it: ""Transgender describes those individuals whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. A transgender male is someone who identifies as male but was assigned the sex of female at birth; a transgender female is someone who identifies as female but was assigned the sex of male at birth."" The letter defines gender identity as ""an individual’s internal sense of gender. A person’s gender identity may be different from or the same as the person’s sex assigned at birth."" The National Center for Transgender Equality, a social justice advocacy organization for transgender people, says a transgender individual is a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. Otherwise, the American Psychological Association defines transgender as ""an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth."" Then again, there are professionals who dispute such definitions. For instance, Paul McHugh, a psychiatrist formerly at Johns Hopkins University, said in a June 12, 2014, Wall Street Journal commentary: ""At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. ‘Sex change’ is biologically impossible,"" McHugh said. ""People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder."" Bathroom debate Debate over whether a transgender person should use the bathroom aligning with his or her gender identity or gender assigned at birth picked up steam after North Carolina lawmakers in March 2016 passed a measure into law requiring people to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender on their birth certificate in public multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities. In Texas in April 2016, the superintendent of the Fort Worth Independent School District, Kent Scribner, approved bathroom policy guidelines Scribner described as a call to meet the needs of the district’s transgender students. Then on May 9, 2016, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick called for the superintendent to resign. Less than a week later, the Education and Justice departments sent their letter, which was met with a lawsuit, filed May 25, 2016, against the administration by Texas and 10 other states. Our ruling Cruz said Obama issued a decree ""demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls’ bathroom."" Federal agencies told schools to let transgender students use the restrooms corresponding to their gender identity. Yet that letter of guidance says nothing about grown men or other adults, leaving this claim with just an element of truth provided you believe, as Cruz apparently does, that a transgender person born a boy remains a boy.

Gun claim by California congressman doesn’t fly
","During the chaos of a sit-in protest by Democrats on the House floor this week, California Rep. John Garamendi, D-Fairfield, delivered an impassioned, unscripted plea to tighten America’s gun laws. The rare and sometimes raucous demonstration came in the wake of the deadly Orlando nightclub shooting. Garamendi urged a vote on the proposed ‘No fly, no buy’ legislation to ban individuals on the FBI’s ""no fly"" list from legally purchasing guns. That list is a subset of the FBI’s much larger terrorist watch list. Estimates place about 10,000 Americans on the terrorist watch list and a small fraction on the no fly list. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of individuals from other countries are estimated to be on the comprehensive list. During his speech, Garamendi made a claim about people tied to terrorism buying guns in the U.S. ""You can’t get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun. This is not only crazy; it is downright dangerous,"" Garamendi told his colleagues on June 22, 2016. Rep. Garamendi makes the claim we fact-checked at the 4:10 minute mark in this video. With his airplane reference, Garamendi appears to be referring to the no fly list. We decided to check whether 2,000 people on that smaller tally have successfully purchased guns in the U.S. Sorting out the facts A U.S. Government Accountability Office analysis of FBI data shows nearly 2,500 successful applications for firearms by individuals on the terrorist watch list over the past decade. Garamendi’s spokesman pointed us to this GAO analysis. We fact-checked a similar statement in December by California Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena. After the San Bernardino shooting, he said, ""Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States."" We rated Thompson’s claim Mostly True, relying on a similar GAO analysis. We noted, however, that an audit showed many people still on the list are no longer suspected of having ties to terrorism, bringing into question the term ""suspected terrorists."" The GAO analysis does not say how many people on the smaller no fly list applied for firearms. The office has said in the past it was not able to share that information because the Transportation Security Administration ""considers the no-fly list numbers sensitive information,"" according to a December fact check by the Washington Post. It’s safe to assume, however, that there have been far fewer guns purchased by people on the smaller no fly list than the larger one. We asked Garamendi’s spokesman to further clarify the congressman’s comments, but we have not yet heard back. Our ruling Rep. John Garamendi said this week ""You can’t get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun."" He appears to be talking about the TSA’s ‘no fly’ list. Garamendi connected the right number with the wrong register. His claim has a wisp of truth in that people on the larger terrorist watch list, including the much smaller no fly list, have made more than 2,000 successful firearm purchases over the past decade. But it strains reason, and seems mathematically impossible, that most of those purchases came from people on the no fly list. We rate Garamendi’s claim Mostly False.

Loretta Weinberg claims New Jersey voted down 1915 referendum giving women the right to vote
","
The results of a referendum nearly a century ago shows the rights of one group should not be determined by public vote, according to a New Jersey senator opposed to a state referendum on gay marriage.

Asked in a recent interview about Gov. Chris Christie’s desire to let New Jersey voters decide whether to allow marriage between same-sex couples, Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) said, ""we’re not going to do that.""

""So he can want to do it, but there is a strong feeling, and I know the feeling on the part of our Senate President Steve Sweeney, that we don't put equal justice ideas on the ballot. The last time that happened in New Jersey apparently was around 1915, it was women's right to vote, women's suffrage. And by the way, it went down in New Jersey. And it took the Legislature to pass it,"" Weinberg said in a Feb. 7 appearance on NJToday.

PolitiFact New Jersey found Weinberg is right. In 1915, the men of New Jersey decided a woman’s place was not in the voting booth. Five years later, the state Legislature ratified the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which confirmed a woman’s right to vote.

Here’s the history:

Under New Jersey’s 1776 state Constitution, women were not specifically excluded from the right to vote. And some women did vote, according to ""Reclaiming Lost Ground: The Struggle for Woman Suffrage in New Jersey"" by Neale McGoldrick and Margaret Crocco. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 women in New Jersey voted between 1790 and 1807, the year the state Legislature restricted voting rights to men.

Suffragists waged state and national campaigns. Though some states succeeded in granting women the right to vote before the federal amendment was ratified in 1920, states on the East Coast struggled, ""challenged by political bosses, liquor interests, and others who feared that woman suffrage would result in prohibition,"" McGoldrick and Crocco wrote.

By 1915, suffragists in New Jersey -- as well as in New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania -- managed to put a woman’s right to vote on the ballot. All four measures failed.

In New Jersey, more than 184,000 residents voted against the referendum, compared with more than 133,000 who voted for it. Majorities in every county voted the ballot question down, except for Ocean County where it passed by less than 160 votes, according to a breakdown of the vote from the New Jersey Historical Society.

""New Jersey law did not permit the amendment to be reintroduced into the Legislature for five years. Since the amendment had to be submitted to two successive Legislatures for approval, this meant that a New Jersey amendment was at least seven years off,"" according to McGoldrick and Crocco.

But women in New Jersey didn’t have to wait seven years. In 1919, Congress passed the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which declared no citizen could be denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. The New Jersey Legislature ratified the amendment in 1920, making the state the 29th to do so.

Our ruling

Weinberg claimed that when women’s suffrage was put to a referendum in 1915 ""it went down in New Jersey. And it took the Legislature to pass it.""

Nearly a century ago, New Jersey defeated a measure giving women the right to vote by 184,390 to 133,282. Five years later, the state Legislature ratified the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

We rate this claim True.

U.S. Chamber of Commerce ad attacking Tim Kaine says health care law 'will kill jobs across America'
","
In a recent television ad, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- the nation’s leading group representing businesses -- jumped on former Virginia Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine for his support of President Barack Obama’s health care law. 
It's a job-killer, the ad charged. 
Kaine, who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee when the battle to pass the health care battle was underway, is running for an open Senate seat this fall, likely against another former Virginia governor and former senator, Republican George Allen. 
The chamber’s ad shows a news clip of Kaine saying, ""I think health care reform is going to go down in history as one of the greatest achievements of this president."" 
The ad counters that comment by saying, ""Obamacare could cost Virginia up to $2.8 billion and will kill jobs across America."" 
Killing jobs across America seems like a pretty serious side effect, so we decided to check that claim. 
We should note that the health care law is complicated, and projections about what it may or may not do are to a large degree speculative. Key parts of the legislation don't take effect until 2014, and even after that, it will take time for workers and employers to see how the law plays out. 
Still, we think we have enough expert information to analyze the chamber’s claim. 
Below, we’ll first recap what we wrote about a similar claim about a year ago. Then we’ll analyze some of the material the Chamber provided us as support for the ad’s claim. 
Our previous analysis 
In January 2011, we fact checked a claim by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, also of Virginia. that the health care law was ""job killing."" We rated that False. 
He backed up that claim with a Republican document titled, ""Obamacare: A budget-busting, job-killing health care law,"" which said ""Independent analyses have determined that the health care law will cause significant job losses for the U.S. economy: the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that the law will reduce the 'amount of labor used in the economy by … roughly half a percent...,' an estimate that adds up to roughly 650,000 jobs lost. A study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the nation's largest small business association, found that an employer mandate alone could lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs, with 66 percent of those coming from small businesses."" 
The CBO study, published in August 2010, concluded that the law will reduce ""the amount of labor used in the economy."" But that’s not exactly what the GOP had said. The CBO concluded that some workers are staying in jobs mostly to keep their health insurance, and once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, for instance, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might voluntarily work less. 
The CBO describes this as a ""small segment"" of the population and described it in reduced work hours, not lost jobs. So it never used the 650,000 number that the Republican document cites. In addition, someone who chooses to work less is not a victim of a job being ""killed"" by federal legislation. (We checked with CBO and they confirmed that the agency’s numbers from August 2010 remain its most recent estimate.) 
Meanwhile, the other piece of evidence offered by the GOP leadership document -- the NFIB study titled, ""Small Business Effects of a National Employer Healthcare Mandate,"" -- was problematic for several reasons. 
For starters, NFIB isn’t neutral. The small-business group has long been critical of Obama’s approach to health care. The group formally advocates repealing the law, calling it ""deeply flawed"" and ""built on a foundation of destructive employer and individual mandates that hamper job growth and threaten our nation’s economic recovery."" 
Second, the NFIB study assumed that all companies would be required to offer private health insurance to their employees, and that the employers would have to pay for at least half of the cost of insurance premiums. That didn't turn out to be the case in the final version of the health care law. The law exempts companies with 50 or fewer workers from any mandate, so many of the small firms ""most adversely affected"" in the NFIB study are not required to offer insurance. 
For all these reasons, we rated Cantor’s claim that the health care law was ""job-killing"" was False. 
The new Chamber of Commerce claim 
What about the ad criticizing Kaine? The chamber pointed us to two documents as support for their claim. One of those is a brief from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been critical of trhe law; the other is a newer study from NFIB. We’ll take these documents in order. 
The Heritage brief argues that the cost of the tax penalty on employers with more than 50 employees ""will ultimately be borne by workers (lower wages and fewer jobs), shareholders (lower profits), and consumers (higher prices)."" Since the ad only looked at the question of employment, we won’t consider the other issues here. 
On the law’s employment impact, the brief reiterated the CBO point that we discussed above (and disagreed with). Separately, it argued that ""many individuals earning close to the minimum wage will not be worth hiring if the employer is required to offer them health insurance coverage. Research by Katherine Baicker and Helen Levy finds that a third of uninsured workers earn within $3 of the minimum wage and therefore have a higher risk of losing their jobs because of an employer mandate. Furthermore, these workers are disproportionately likely to be high school dropouts, minority, or female."" 
We looked up the paper by Baicker and Levy and found that Heritage left out a key bit of context that undercuts the paper’s relevance for the notion that the health care law is a job killer. The paper the two economists wrote -- which came out in 2007, long before the health care law was being debated -- addresses a more aggressive mechanism of employer mandates than the one included in the final version of the bill. 
We asked the authors whether they approved of how Heritage used their paper. In a joint email to PolitiFact, Baicker and Levy wrote that they don't. 
""As we noted in the paper,"" they wrote, ""anything that exempts employers from the mandate or reduces the cost borne by employers will mitigate the impact on employment. In the Obama plan, the fact that small employers (fewer than 50 employees) are exempt from the mandate and the fact that the penalty associated with not providing health insurance ($2,000 per worker, or about one dollar per hour for a full-time worker) is fairly small would both suggest relatively little impact on employment. Furthermore, the presence of an individual mandate has implications for workers' valuation of health insurance benefits offered by employers. All of this means that our paper does not provide evidence that the (health care law) would cause job loss."" 
So the authors of the paper cited by Heritage disagree that their research backs up the notion that the health care law is a job killer. Others feel similarly. 
Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who advised Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on health-insurance programs, said he’s skeptical lower-wage employment will be affected in a big way, given that many of the firms that employ low-wage workers are small (and thus are exempt from the law) and that many low-wage workers employed by bigger companies already have access to health insurance (and thus shouldn’t see changes from the law). 
Henry Aaron, a health care expert at the Brookings Institution, pointed to a couple additional reasons to doubt the low-wage worker argument. Many low-wage workers are teens or in their early 20s, and they may be covered under their parents' plans if they wish. (In fact, the Obama law actually raised the upper age limit for dependents covered on a parent’s plan to 26, a provision that’s already in force.) In addition, some low-wage workers work fewer than 30 hours per week, and under the law, the mandate does not apply to workers who work less than that threshold. 
So what about the second piece of evidence, the NFIB study? That study also attracted criticism when we ran it past economists with expertise in health care and labor policy. 
The newer NFIB study projected that changes made by the health care will lead to price increases that ""reduce private sector employment by 125,000 to 249,000 jobs in 2021, with 59 percent of those losses falling on small business."" 
But experts outlined a number of reasons to be skeptical that the impact will be so large. 
First, the employer payments under the law are ""tiny,"" said David Cutler, a Harvard University economist. The CBO estimated that employer and individual penalty payments will be $3 billion in 2014 and $12 billion in 2016. ""Even today, total employee compensation is $8.3 trillion,"" Cutler said. ""So, they are claiming enormous effects from payments that are less than 0.2 percent of employee compensation."" 
A March 2011 analysis by the Urban Institute -- an independent research organization -- concurred, concluding that, on balance, the health care law is ""unlikely to have major aggregate effects on the U.S. economy and on employment, primarily because the changes in spending and taxes are very small relative to the size of the economy."" 
The NFIB report doesn’t appear to take into account the subsidies in the health care law, only the costs. Specifically, the Urban Institute report noted that firms with fewer than 50 workers will receive $4.5 billion in employer subsidies in the form of tax credits. Taking both premiums and assessments into account, ""small businesses would save 8.7 percent compared with their current premium contributions,"" the report said. This means that smaller firms would actually have ""lower costs of labor and should be more willing to expand employment."" 
Medium-sized firms, for their part, would find their premium costs drop modestly, though individual companies that do not already offer health care coverage could see notable cost increases. And large firms would see an increase in premium costs by about 1 percent overall. 
Aaron added that employment decisions are not as cut-and-dried as critics suggest. ""To the extent that workers are part of a team or group or division that is judged on its overall performance, such computations may be done on a group basis,"" rather than an individual basis, he said. 
Finally, Aaron noted that increased usage of the health care system because of the law should create jobs within the health care industry itself. These job gains would should partially offset potential job losses elsewhere. 
Given all of these factors, ""the rhetorical hysteria explicit in the term ‘job killer’ is enough to make one despair for rational public debate,"" Aaron said. 
Our ruling 
The ad said that ""Obamacare … will kill jobs across America."" The chamber of Commerce has failed to prove that it will, and the best projections we’ve seen, based on how the law is actually written, do not suggest that the law will ""kill"" jobs. A close look at the studies cited by the Chamber of Commerce in support of the ad -- as well as other independent analyses of the health care law -- provide little, if any, evidence that the health care law will result in a significant net number of job losses. We rate the statement False. ","[('\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, ""Tim Kaine -- No Great Achievements"" (television ad), Feb. 8, 2012\n\nPolitiFact\xa0 ""The health care law a \'job killer\'?

Citing Congressional Budget Office, chamber ad says unemployment could exceed 9 percent
","
This ad is a positive push for business-friendly policies and politicians, brought to you by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But in making its case, the video ad aimed at Illinois voters includes a couple of scary phrases: 
• 13.1 million Americans out of work 
• CBO: Unemployment Could Top 9 percent in 2013 
We wondered if the Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan arm of Congress that analyzes the financial impact of federal laws, is really projecting that high an unemployment rate next year.

The CBO report

The CBO’s Budget and Economic Outlook report for 2012 through 2022 looks at numerous economic benchmarks and how existing and possible legislation will affect them.

The day the report was released, Jan. 31, 2012, CBO Director Doug Elmendorf wrote in his blog a bit about the methodology behind the report.

""Each January, CBO prepares ‘baseline’ budget projections spanning the next 10 years. Those projections are not a forecast of future events; rather, they are intended to provide a benchmark against which potential policy changes can be measured,"" he wrote.

The benchmark unemployment figure for 2013: 9.2 percent, the level cited in the chamber ad.

But again, benchmark numbers are ""not a forecast.""

‘Alternative fiscal scenario’

To create its forecasts, the CBO moves beyond benchmarks and makes some assumptions that popular programs and tax policies will be retained, as they have been in past years. In the scenario CBO created: 
• Expiring tax cuts are extended. Those include income tax cuts enacted under former President George W. Bush and extended in 2010, as well as lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends. 
• The Alternative Minimum Tax is indexed for inflation. The AMT, targeted at the wealthy, does not take inflation into account. But according to the Tax Policy Center, since 2001 Congress has repeatedly increased the individual AMT exemption on a temporary basis to prevent middle-class taxpayers from being subject to the tax. 
• Medicare's payment rates to doctors are held at their current level and not allowed to drop. 
• More than $100 billion in automatic spending reductions required by law do not take effect. 
We asked Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center, about the reasonableness of that scenario. 
""There are an infinite number of scenarios one could create. The one they’ve chosen is in line with what I would call the dominant view of how things are going to turn out,"" Williams said . ""It’s a set of numbers people want to see."" 
Under this more politically realistic scenario, the CBO forecast that in 2013 unemployment would not top 9 percent. It predicts a rate between 7.4 percent and 8.9 percent. 
The CBO's benchmark figure is higher than the forecast because, if Congress did nothing, the tax cuts would expire, triggering a big tax increase which would suck money out of the economy. As a result economic growth would be slower.

And that would lead to higher unemployment, Williams said.

U.S. News & World Report story

The chamber ad pulled the headline from a Jan. 31, 2012, story in U.S. News & World Report. It led with this ominous paragraph:

""Alarming news came from the Congressional Budget Office today: the economy is on track to grow by only 1.1 percent next year, with unemployment climbing to 9.2 percent.""

But in the very next paragraph, the U.S. News story explained what Elmendorf outlined as the more likely alternative scenario:

""...That is, if Congress does nothing. Under current law, a bevy of tax breaks, such as the temporary payroll tax cut, will expire in coming months and years, along with the extension in unemployment benefits.

The story went on to point out that the Federal Reserve predicted unemployment in 2013 will hover between 7.4 and 8.1 percent.

Our ruling

The chamber ad flashed a headline saying ""CBO: Unemployment Could Top 9 percent in 2013.""

But that figure represents a benchmark on which the CBO bases its forecast -- not the forecast itself. The CBO’s stated prediction puts unemployment at between 7.4 and 8.9 percent in 2013. The chamber ignored that reality, instead cherry-picking a higher number and making it sound like a prediction when it wasn't. We rate the claim Mostly False.","[('\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce video ad, ""Judy’s for Jobs,"" Feb. 8, 2012\n\nCBO, ""The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022,"" January 2012\n\nU.S. News & World Report, ""CBO: Unemployment Could Top 9 Percent in 2013,"" Jan. 31, 2012\n\nCBO Director’s blog, ""CBO Releases the Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022,"" Jan. 31, 2012\n\nTax Policy Center, ""Index to Inflation the 2011 Parameters of the Individual Alternative Minimum Tax""', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHxRFJIUJjc'), ('\nInterview with Roberton Williams, Tax Policy Center, Feb. 15, 2012\n\nFactcheck.org, ""Chamber Misuses Report, Misleads Voters,"" Feb. 10, 2012', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/15/us-chamber-commerce/citing-Congressional-budget-office-chamber-ad-says/

Can you drive the length of a football field in the time it takes to check a text?
 ","
U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., is part of a central Oregon campaign to encourage drivers not to text and drive. The campaign is called ""TXT L8R.""

""When you take your eyes off the road for up to, just to look at a text for five seconds, you may have covered the distance of a football field,"" Walden said while shooting a commercial for the campaign.

As a public service to you, PolitiFact Oregon decided to verify the statement. We, too, know the mystery and allure of an incoming text message. Or how hard it is to to resist the urge to send just one more text -- for example, ""on my way"" -- to that person who won’t stop texting, just to find out if you’re on your way.

So does it take up to 5 seconds to send or read a text? Personal experience tells PolitiFact Oregon that this is entirely possible. And apparently, this is a repeated fact in the distracted driving world. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s distracted driving website -- www.distraction.gov -- says this on its page of frequently asked questions:

""Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 4.6 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field, blindfolded. It's extraordinarily dangerous.""

Next, how long is a football field? According to the NFL rule book, a field is 360 feet, or 120 yards, long. (By the way, did you know that NASA’s International Space Station is about the size of a football field? Neither did we.) However, we hear from sports experts in the newsroom that most people, when they think of it at all, think of football fields as 100 yards, or 300 feet.

So let’s do some math. A person driving at 55 m.p.h. would cover 80.7 feet per second. Multiply that by 5 and the person would drive 403 feet over 5 seconds -- or more than the 300 feet or 360 feet length of a football field.

Finally, we checked to see how the U.S. Department of Transportation had derived its 5-second figure. In its ""Facts and Statistics"" section, the department states that ""sending or receiving a text takes a driver's eyes from the road for an average of 4.6 seconds."" Click on that link and you go to a 2009 study about driver distraction in commercial vehicles.

We can’t say we understand all 285 pages of it, but at page 99 we see that in incidents where there was a crash or near crash involving a text, the mean duration of eyes off roadway was 4.6 seconds. We even talked with Richard Hanowski, director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, to make sure we had it right. 
Now, most people probably aren't driving 55 while texting. Most likely they are driving at lower speeds, say 20 miles per hour, which would be closer to half the length of a football field, if you think of one as 100 yards. 
Walden didn’t specify speed in his statement, but he hedged it to say that the driver may have covered the length of a football field while texting. We find his statement True. And the message remains: Don’t text and drive.","[('\nKTVZ.com, ""NewsChannel 21 Urges \'TXT L8R\' Pledge,"" Feb. 9, 2012\nU.S. DOT, ""U.S. Department of Transportation Releases ‘Faces of Distracted Driving’ Public Service Announcement,"" April 7, 2011\nNASA’s International Space Station (web page)\nDistraction.gov, ""Frequently asked questions,"" (web page)\nEmail from Andrew Whelan, Walden’s staff, Feb. 10, 2012\nEmail from Amy Storey, \xa0Assistant Vice President, Public Affairs CTIA - The Wireless Association, Feb. 13, 2012\nInterview with Richard Hanowski, Director, Center for Truck & Bus Safety, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, Feb. 15, 2012\nEmail from Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Feb. 14, 2012\nU.S. Department of Transportation, ""DRIVER DISTRACTION IN COMMERCIAL VEHICLE OPERATIONS,"" February 2009\nNFL Rule Book', 'http://www.ktvz.com/news/30423253/detail.html')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/15/greg-walden/can-you-drive-length-football-field-time-it-takes-/

U.S. Chamber says Rep. Tammy Baldwin backed raising taxes $858 billion by voting against extension of Bush-era tax cuts
","
There was never any doubt that opponents of U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, a Madison Democrat running for the U.S. Senate, would brand her as a liberal who loves taxes.

On the day Baldwin announced her candidacy in September 2011, Republican Senate candidate Tommy Thompson called her the most liberal member of the House.

Based on annual ratings of House members’ votes, we gave Thompson a Mostly True on that claim.

Now two major business organizations say Baldwin loves taxes enough to raise them ""by $858 billion"" -- and they cite Baldwin’s own website as evidence.

A politician touting an $858 billion tax increase?

This could get interesting.

The claim is made in a TV ad sponsored by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and paid for by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The ad was released Feb. 9, 2012.

It begins with a narrator saying:

""Washington has made things tough for job creators. More red tape doesn't help. ‘Obamacare’ will kill jobs; Tammy Baldwin fought hard for it. Taxes? Tammy Baldwin thinks they're too low and wants to raise them.""

At that point, a message on the screen reads: ""Tammy Baldwin -- raise taxes by $858 billion"" and lists Baldwin’s official House website as the source.

Is it an accurate attack?

‘Bush-era tax cuts’

The Wisconsin business group referred us to the U.S. Chamber, which referred us to the taxes page on Baldwin’s website. It discusses her vote against an $858 billion bill that extended what are known as the Bush-era tax cuts.

The tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- were enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. They were temporary -- their major provisions were to expire at the end of 2010.

The bill Baldwin voted against was adopted and signed into law in December 2010. On the web page cited by the chamber, Baldwin says she supported continuing the tax cuts only for families that earn up to $250,000, because ""adding $858 billion to the national debt just to give a special tax break to those with incomes over $250,000 is fiscally irresponsible.""

The ad’s claim about Baldwin is based on that single no vote.

But, as we’ll see, it wasn’t the only measure put to a vote in the House on extending the Bush tax cuts. And the $858 billion figure -- though widely cited -- is more complicated than presented in the ad.

What’s in the $858 billion

The law extends the Bush tax cuts two more years -- but it also provided a new, temporary payroll tax cut, made other tax changes and extended unemployment benefits for 13 months.

The total ""cost"" of the package -- in terms of how much it adds to federal budget deficits -- is estimated at nearly $858 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

About $721 billion of that is reduced revenue from the tax changes -- including $408 billion from the two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts -- and the rest is from additional spending.

So, does Baldwin’s vote against an $858 billion bill composed primarily of tax cuts mean she supported raising taxes by $858 billion?

Not exactly.

Had Baldwin’s side defeated the bill -- and had the Bush tax cuts been allowed to expire -- the people who benefited from those tax cuts would have been paying higher taxes as of January 2011.

But, as we’ve noted, the bill also contained other measures such as the new cut in payroll taxes and the extension of unemployment benefits. So, it can’t be argued that taxes would have been raised by a full $858 billion had Baldwin’s side prevailed.    

Secondly, had the $858 billion bill been defeated, it doesn’t necessarily mean the debate would have ended and that the Bush tax cuts would have expired; another bill could have emerged.

Baldwin campaign spokesman Phil Walzak pointed out that a week before the vote on the $858 billion bill that became law, Baldwin voted for an alternative that would have extended the Bush tax cuts, permanently, for families earning less than $250,000. The failed measure also would have made other changes that would have added a total of $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Nearly all of that, $1.34 trillion, would have been revenue lost from making most of the Bush tax cuts permanent.

To compare the two bills only in terms of extending the Bush tax cuts:

The bill Baldwin voted against reduces revenue by $408 billion for two years, or $204 billion on an annual basis.

The bill Baldwin voted for would have reduced revenue $1.34 trillion over 10 years, or $134 billion per year.  

So, Baldwin supported extending most of the Bush tax cuts, although taxes would have gone up for families earning $250,000 or more.

In the end, there were two votes on competing proposals. By using the approach the ad uses, Democrats would be able to argue that those who voted against the first, more limited package, opposed cutting taxes.

Our ruling

In a TV ad, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Baldwin supports raising taxes by $858 billion, citing her vote against a bill that primarily contained tax cuts.

It’s true that had Baldwin’s side prevailed and if no other action was taken, taxes would have increased, although not by the full $858 billion.

"['New Jersey', 'Transportation', 'John Wisniewski']","
Many high-ranking Port Authority officials earn larger salaries than governors of New Jersey, New York, assemblyman says
","
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are earning close to $180,000 annually in their roles as chief executive, but most of the highest-ranking officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are doing even better.

As the Port Authority’s finances come under greater scrutiny, New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) pointed out in a recent radio interview how many of the top agency officials are earning larger salaries than the two governors charged with overseeing their operations.

""Clearly, the Port Authority is needed, because to coordinate bi-state transportation, you can’t be continually going back and forth between two cities and two states and multiple jurisdictions,"" Wisniewski told host John Gambling on WOR-AM. ""But the Port Authority’s grown beyond its original mission. It’s now a real estate empire in addition to everything else.""

Wisniewski, also chairman of the state Democratic Party, went on: ""It’s become so large. Many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them.""

Could many top agency officials really be taking home more money than Christie and Cuomo?

That’s right, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Based on the latest data released by the Port Authority, 11 of the 12 highest-ranking agency officials earn larger annual salaries than Christie and Cuomo.

Let’s start with the governors’ paychecks.

Christie is earning an annual salary of $175,000, according to Bill Quinn, spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury.

In New York, Cuomo receives slightly more, earning $179,000 per year, said Morris Peters, spokesman for the New York State Division of the Budget. But Cuomo reimbursed the state for five percent of his 2011 salary, Peters said.

Now, let’s turn to the Port Authority officials.

In December, the transportation agency posted information on its website about annual salaries and other earnings for all of its more than 6,000 employees. To evaluate Wisniewski’s claim, we looked at annual salaries for the top 12 positions listed on the agency’s organization chart.

Here’s how the salaries for those positions break down, as of Nov. 30:
  

So, of the 12 ""top officials"" at the Port Authority, 11 of them were getting larger paychecks than Christie and Cuomo.

Those figures back up Wisniewski’s statement, but it’s worth noting that even Port Authority workers at lower points in the pecking order earned more in salary and additional pay last year than the two governors' annual salaries.

For example, 65 police officers earned more than $200,000 in salary and additional pay, according to a Star-Ledger analysis.

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Wisniewski claimed, ""Many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them.""

The assemblyman’s comments are on the money, according to data released by the Port Authority in December. Christie and Cuomo earn $175,000 and $179,000, respectively, earning less than 11 of the 12 highest-ranked Port Authority officials.

We rate the statement True.

"['Abortion', 'Ohio', 'Patrick Johnston']","
Leader of personhood issue claims abortion the most common surgery in the country
","
Nearly four decades after the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case legalized abortion, it remains an emotionally-charged debate.

It was against that backdrop that Dr. Patrick Johnston, the director of Personhood Ohio and a  leader of the effort to get the so-called ""Personhood"" issue on the Ohio ballot, began his remarks on Cleveland public radio on Jan. 30 with a statement.

At the outset of his remarks, Johnston referred to abortion as ""the most common surgery in our country.""

The statement became the launching point for the Zanesville-area doctor to make his case that abortions have become too routine and for why Ohioans should back a rewriting of the Ohio Constitution so that a fertilized egg is defined as a person -- a change that effectively would outlaw abortion.

Johnston’s claim seemed like the kind of straightforward assertion that Politifact Ohio can dig into while steering clear of the moral questions that surround the divisive issue.

We began by checking with Johnston to see where he got his numbers on abortion, and the frequency of other procedures. He directed us to the website for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy analysis group, as the source for his abortion numbers—they count about 1.21 million abortions in 2008.

He also pointed us to several websites for gall bladder surgery, which assert that the procedure is one of the most common surgeries in the United States with about 500,000 patients a year.

The Guttmacher Institute numbers for abortions were much higher than those we found from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported about 828,000 abortions in 2007. However, the CDC numbers are based on reports from state health departments and do not include abortions done in California, Maryland and New Hampshire — three states where the reporting of abortions is apparently voluntary.

Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman with the Guttmacher Institute, said her group’s numbers include all 50 states and are based on actively surveying abortion providers rather than pulling data from state health department reports.

Over the past several years, the Guttmacher Institute’s estimated number of abortions in the United States have basically held steady going from 1,206,200 in 2005 to 1,212,350 in 2008.

But are there more common forms of surgery?

The federal CDC keeps close tabs on what people are discharged from hospitals for based on a pair of national annual surveys, one for inpatient and one for outpatient clients.

By far, the most common form of surgery in 2006 was eye surgery for cataracts. There were about 5.63 million eye surgeries that involved either removing or replacing the eye lens, according to the 2006 National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (the latest outpatient survey available).

There were about 1.4 million endoscopic polypectomies, which involves the removal of presumed pre-cancerous lesions such as polyps on the colon, according to the outpatient numbers.

Meanwhile, there were about 1.34 million Caesarean sections where the fetus is delivered by cutting open the pregnant woman’s abdomen, according to the 2007 National Hospital Discharge Survey (the latest inpatient survey available). Abortion would rank fourth behind that trio in most common surgeries.

But are they all examples of surgery or could they be considered just medical procedures?

We spoke with Dr. Lisa Keder, an obstetrician and associate professor with the Ohio State University Medical Center, and she said that while the term surgery isn’t strictly defined, the way that patients are billed for medical procedures reflects whether it is officially considered ""surgery.""

Keder said that eye operations, endoscopic polypectomies, C-sections and abortions are all coded for billing purposes as surgeries.  

Additionally, we should note here that because so many people go to the hospital for medical procedures -- almost 45 million inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in 2007 in the United States -- that virtually every type of surgery on a human system when classified broadly was much more common than abortions.

There were, for example, 6.94 million heart operations, but no specific procedure more than the 1.06 million cardiac catheterizations. So if you classify surgeries in broad terms, abortions tumble much farther than No. 4 on the most common surgeries list.

Johnston , while trying to make his case that abortion has become too routine, told a Cleveland radio audience that abortion was ""the most common surgery in this country.""

He’s not even close.

The most comprehensive abortions statistics show about 1.21 million abortions a year in the United States. But annual surveys show there are about 5.63 million eye surgeries involving the removal or replacement of the lens in the eye. That procedure occurs more than four times as often as abortion.

And abortion didn’t rank No. 2 or No. 3.

There were about 1.4 million cases where presumed per-cancerous polyps were removed from inside a patient’s body the year of the most recent outpatient survey numbers available.

Meanwhile, a procedure that is common among women who are giving birth -- a Caesarean section -- occured more frequently that year than did abortion.

Newt supported China's one-child policy, Super PAC says
","
There they go again.

With Georgia’s Republican presidential primary just a few weeks away, the four remaining candidates and their supporters are expected to blanket the airwaves with attack ads in this delegate-rich state.

One that we’ve seen -- scheduled to hit the airwaves Wednesday -- takes aim at former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who represented portions of Atlanta’s western suburbs for 20 years in Congress.

""He co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy,"" says the voice in the ad paid for by Restore Our Future. The super PAC is run by supporters of Republican hopeful Mitt Romney.

There’s nothing that makes conservatives see more red than a reference to Pelosi, the liberal California congresswoman and House minority leader. Or talking about China for that matter.

The ad that will soon be on your TV screens in Georgia is different than what Restore Our Future aired in Florida and South Carolina before their primaries. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida looked into this claim and rated it a Pants On Fire.

We wondered: Did the group get its facts right this time?

Gingrich is ahead in the polls in Georgia, a state where he desperately needs to do well to keep his campaign from becoming an episode of ""The Walking Dead."" His GOP rivals, particularly Romney, are trying to make Gingrich work hard for every vote here. Romney made a campaign stop in Atlanta last week and took a couple of shots at Gingrich. Restore Our Future has another ad on its website that says Gingrich ""is no Ronald Reagan.""

The Georgia ad contains the same language as the one that aired in Florida and South Carolina. Here’s some more detail about the issue:

Restore Our Future refers to House Resolution 1078, which was introduced on Feb. 22, 1989, before Gingrich became speaker and when Democrats had control of the House of Representatives.

The legislation was called the Global Warming Prevention Act of 1989. It set national goals to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and encouraged international agreements to address global warming, PolitiFact Florida reported. It required the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor global warming and create plans for future action. It supported stricter fuel standards for cars and alternative energy. It also sent money to developing countries to encourage practices that reduce carbon emissions.

The bill had several hearings but received unfavorable reviews from the administration of George H.W. Bush and never became law.

The resolution was introduced by Rep. Claudine Schneider, a Rhode Island Republican who left Congress in 1991. Yes, Gingrich and Pelosi co-sponsored the bill. In all, there were 144 House members who sponsored the legislation. Most were Democrats, but there were a handful of Republicans in the mix, such as Olympia Snowe of Maine and Jim Kolbe of Arizona.

China’s one-child policy generally refers to the government’s efforts to limit population growth to one child per couple. Human rights advocates say the policy has resulted in forced sterilizations and abortions.  

The Restore Our Future website says the $60 million went to the United Nations Population Fund and that President Ronald Reagan withheld funds from the program after he determined the program, which supports family planning and contraception, was supporting Chinese actions.

The bill did propose money for the United Nations Population Fund. But Section 1102, Part C, of the bill prohibits using any of the funds for ""the performance of involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning."" That is the exact opposite of the language in Restore Our Future’s ad about Gingrich.

As we mentioned, PolitiFact Florida rated this claim Pants On Fire.

The language is the same in this ad. And the facts haven’t changed.

'Glee' says the Census Bureau projects the majority of Americans will use Spanish by 2030
","We’re gonna make this fact-check sing.

Or -- since this fact-check was inspired by a Spanish teacher played by singer Ricky Martin on the TV show Glee -- we will make it cantar.

Our fact-check is about how many people will be speaking Spanish as their first language in the year 2030. But before we hit play on our claim, we will catch you up with the show that follows a fictional Glee Club, named the New Directions, at a high school in Ohio.

The show is about a group of musically talented misfits who belt out songs in between typical teenage plot twists about dating, spats with their parents, applying to college and the ever-present quest for popularity. The worst is getting ""slushied,"" which means having slushy drinks tossed in their faces by cool football players.

The cast of characters includes Artie, the bespectacled skinny guy in a wheelchair; Santana, the bad-ass Latina lesbian from the wrong side of town; Quinn, the blonde cheerleader/chastity club leader who gets pregnant; and many more. They are led by the Glee Club director/Spanish teacher William Schuester, who is on an annual quest to lead his club to victory at nationals.

The plot of the Feb. 7, 2012, episode: Schuester enrolls in a night Spanish class taught by Ricky Martin’s character, David Martinez. (Yep, Mr. Schuester is a Spanish teacher whose Spanish es muy muy malo.) Martin tells his students that they need to learn Spanish to function in the U.S. in the future: ""Do you know that the U.S. Census believes that by 2030 the majority of Americans will use Spanish as their first language?"" (Here’s a clip of Martin singing ""Sexy and I know It"" and ""La Isla Bonita"" on the episode.)  Schuester uses Spanish as the inspiration for his weekly assignment for the Glee Club: sing a song by a Spanish artist or that includes Spanish.

We decided to take a short intermission from politics to test Glee’s claim about whether the Census Bureau believes the majority of Americans will speak Spanish as their first language by 2030.

U.S. Census projects growth in Hispanic population

Glee’s claim surprised the folks at the U.S. Census Bureau.

""We don’t do projections of language spoken,"" on a regular official basis, said Robert Bernstein, a census spokesman. ""That’s very strange someone would cite us.""

Bernstein pointed us to projections about the Hispanic population released in 2008 based on data from 2000.

The census projected that by 2030 there will be about 85.9 million Hispanics out of about 373.5 million people in the U.S., representing about 23 percent of the population. That projection is compared to about 16 percent of the population (49.7 million people) in 2010. So it’s true that the Hispanic population in the U.S. is on track to grow.

But the census projections are about the number of Hispanics -- not how many people will speak Spanish as their first language at home.

Spanish spoken in U.S. in 2010

The American Community Survey, which is a part of the census program, provides estimates of population characteristics including language.

For 2010, the survey showed about 37 million of 289 million people over age 5 spoke Spanish -- or about 13 percent. It doesn’t ask respondents what their ""first"" language is, but asks what they speak at home and how well they speak English.  And those Spanish speakers include Hispanics and non-Hispanics.

""We don’t know how frequently they speak one (language) or the other, or which one they use exclusively or first,"" said Tiffany Julian, an analyst with the Census Bureau.

The survey also showed that for 2010, of the 45.6 million Hispanics, about 11.2 million speak only English while 34.3 million speak Spanish (including those who don’t speak English and those who speak English of varying ability.) That means 75 percent of Hispanics speak Spanish.

So if we know in 2010 that 75 percent of Hispanics speak Spanish, we could apply that figure to the 85.9 million Hispanics projected for 2030. That would bring us to a projection of 64 million Hispanics speaking Spanish by 2030, and if we divided that into the overall projected population of 373.5 million, we find that Hispanic Spanish speakers would represent about one-sixth of the population.

But what we’ve spelled out here is not a projection by ACS or the Census and may not be accurate: it’s pure math without taking into account any changes in immigration or fertility over the next two decades. Plus, we’ve also left out non-Hispanics who could speak Spanish at home as their first language.

Paper on language projection

At this point, we were about ready to say hasta la vista.

But wait -- we found a couple of experts at the Census Bureau who took a stab at language projections and presented a paper at the Federal Forecasters Conference in April 2011. Their paper projects that somewhere between 13 and 15.3 percent of the age 5 and older population will speak Spanish by 2020 -- the last year cited in the paper.

The authors of the paper, census demographer Jennifer Ortman and survey statistician Hyon Shin, told us that even if they projected out to 2030, the percentage of Spanish speakers likely would have continued to grow slightly -- but nowhere close to a majority of Americans speaking Spanish as their first language.

""That is just blatantly wrong,"" the two agreed. ""We don’t have anything that can support that.""

While nationwide immigrants typically continue to speak their native language, their children and grandchildren tend to use mostly -- if not only -- English. That means as the Hispanic population in the U.S. continues to grow, in part due to the descendants of immigrants, those children will speak English.

Spanish is projected to remain the language spoken by a majority of what census researchers call ""Language Other Than English"" speakers.

But  ""English is expected to continue to be the only language spoken by a substantial majority of all U.S. residents 5 years and older,"" the paper by the census experts said.

Our ruling

Ricky Martin’s character said on Glee, ""The U.S. Census believes that by 2030 the majority of Americans will use Spanish as their first language."" The Census Bureau predicts that in 2030 about 23 percent of the U.S. population will be Hispanic -- but all of those Hispanics in the future won’t speak Spanish as their first language. Two census researchers projected that somewhere between 13 and 15.3 percent of people in the U.S. will speak Spanish in 2020 -- a far cry from the majority of Americans, and we don’t know how many of those will speak it as their first language. They said the numbers from 2030 would still be nowhere close to the 50-percent mark.

"['Legal Issues', 'Supreme Court', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio said a U.S. Supreme Court justice suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law
","
Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio spoke to his fellow Republican brethren at the Conservative Political Action Conference -- the annual gathering of big-name conservatives. In his speech Rubio defended those who believe in the Constitution. Let’s make that crystal clear -- the U.S. Constitution.

""So the majority of Americans are conservatives,"" Rubio said Feb. 9, 2012. ""They believe in things like the Constitution. I know that’s weird to some people but they believe in it. Of course, if you listen to one of our Supreme Court Justices recently she believes that. ...’’

At this point, the audience interrupted Rubio with boos.

""Yeah,"" Rubio continued. ""Let me just say if you are an appellate lawyer, you need to brush up on your South African law because that is how some cases apparently are going to be decided here going forward. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah -- America.""

We wondered what Rubio was talking about; it sounded like he was saying that a Supreme Court justice had suggested that future cases will be decided based on South African law. (We fact-checked whether the majority of Americans are conservatives in a separate report.)

Rubio didn’t name the justice in that part of his speech, but it didn’t take long to find a flurry of media reports about comments U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made on Egyptian TV, in which she mentioned the South African Constitution. But when we listened to her entire interview, we found that her point didn’t relate to decisions about U.S. cases at all. 
Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told us in an email that ""Ginsburg recently praised the South African constitution, said it was better than ours."" He also pointed to this post in Foreign Policy magazine, which reviewed the response of conservative blogs to her comments.

When we contacted Conant again and told him that we thought Rubio’s claim was inaccurate, Conant replied, ""I think it was pretty clear that Sen. Rubio was joking."" (Watch Rubio's remarks and decide for yourself.)

What Ginsburg said

Once an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She is widely viewed as one of the court’s most liberal justices.

Ginsburg went to Egypt in January 2012 to meet with Egyptian judges and legal experts, and while there gave an interview to Al Hayat TV.

The interviewer asked Ginsburg her advice about whether Egypt should look to other countries’ constitutions as a model.

Ginsberg replied:

""You should certainly be aided by all the constitution-writing that has gone on since the end of World War II. I would not look to the U.S. Constitution, if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the constitution of South Africa. That was a deliberate attempt to have a fundamental instrument of government that embraced basic human rights (and) had an independent judiciary. It really is, I think, a great piece of work that was done. Much more recently than the U.S. Constitution is Canada, (which) has a charter of rights and freedoms (and) dates from 1982. You would almost certainly look at the European Convention on Human Rights.....I'm a very strong believer from listening and learning from others.''

During the 18-minute TV segment, Ginsburg made several other comments -- many positive -- about the U.S. Constitution:

• The Egyptian Constitution ""should safeguard basic fundamental human rights, like our First Amendment is the right to speak freely, to publish freely without the government as a censor.""

• ""One of my favorite provisions in our Constitution is the one that says that government shall not deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.""

• The U.S. Constitution includes a separation of powers between Congress, the president and the judiciary, and the judiciary has independence.

•  ""We have the oldest written constitution still in force in the world. And it's a constitution that starts out with three wonderful words: ‘We the people.""

•  The men who wrote the U.S. Constitution were ""some of the most brilliant minds"" and ""very wise.""

Ginsburg also noted that at the time the U.S. Constitution was written in 1787, slavery was legal, and women weren’t part of the Constitutional Convention (though Ginsburg notes that John Adams' wife Abigail urged him to not forget the ladies as he wrote it).

""The genius of the Constitution, I think, is that it had this notion of who composes 'We the People.' It has expanded, expanded over the years. So now it includes people who were left out at the beginning: Native Americans were left out, certainly people held in human bondage, women, people who were newcomers to our shore,"" she said.

The left and right respond to Ginsburg

Ginsburg’s comments set off fire from the right. Consider these headlines: ""Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Anti U.S. Constitution"" wrote the Liberally Conservative blog, and from U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., posting on RedState, ""Our constitution is not irrelevant, Justice Ginsburg."" Mathew Staver, founder and chairman of the Liberty Counsel and Dean of Liberty University School of Law, said,  ""For a sitting U.S. Supreme Court Justice to speak derisively about the Constitution she is sworn to uphold is distressing, to say the least.""

On the left, Media Matters said the right was showing ""misplaced outrage"" and linked to the blog of Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California at Los Angeles. (Volokh told us he considers himself center-right or libertarian-conservative.)

Volokh argued that Ginsburg, who swore an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution, probably thinks it works well for our country.

""But why should she (or we) think that the 1787 constitutional text, coupled with the 27 amendments that have come in fits and spurts since then, would necessarily work well for a completely different country today? … None of this tells us whether Justice Ginsburg is committed to following the U.S. Constitution in the U.S. Maybe you think she is so committed and maybe you think she isn’t, but you’d have to figure that out from other sources than from the advice she gives to a different country about whether to adopt the constitutional text in a completely different political and legal requirement.""

A Boston Globe editorial wrote that there was no outrage when Justice Antonin Scalia told a congressional panel in October 2011:

""The bill of rights of the former ‘evil empire,' the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was much better than ours. I mean it literally: It was much better. We guarantee freedom of speech and of the press. Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account. Whoa, that is wonderful stuff!''

The Globe explained: ""Why no outrage? Because Scalia went on to make the point that the Soviet constitution was nothing but ‘words on paper,' a fig leaf for tyranny. By contrast, America's constitutional system - with its careful separation of powers and government institutions checking and balancing each other - has proved a bulwark against tyranny. Only someone brazenly yanking Scalia's words out of context could have accused him of revering the Kremlin's Potemkin constitution more than the one drafted in Philadelphia in 1787."" 

Our ruling

Rubio mentioned a female Supreme Court Judge and then concluded, ""if you are an appellate lawyer you need to brush up on your South African law because that is how some cases apparently are going to be decided here going forward."" Rubio was implying that Justice Ginsburg favored South African law rather than the U.S. Constitution, and that some cases in the U.S. might be decided based on South African law. 
Rubio’s spokesman says he was joking, but even a joke can leave some viewers with a false impression. Rubio could have poked fun at Ginsburg’s comments without distorting them.

There is nothing in Ginsburg’s interview in which she suggested that any legal matter in the U.S. should be decided based on anything from South African law. Ginsburg was giving advice to another country on how to draft a constitution, and she suggested examples written more recently than the U.S. Constitution. She didn’t dis the U.S. Constitution -- she explained that it was written at a time when slavery was legal and women didn’t have equal rights. In fact, Ginsburg also heaped lots of praise on the U.S. Constitution. We rate this claim False.","[('\nYouTube, U.S. Sen.

Rhode Island director of administration Richard Licht says Rhode Island isn’t only state cutting back on spending for public television
","
The prospect of clipping the wings of Big Bird came up Feb. 5 when  Richard Licht, Governor Chafee’s director of administration, made an appearance on ABC6’s ""On the Record with Buddy Cianci.""

The host, former Providence Mayor Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci was grilling Licht on Chafee’s proposal to eliminate funding for Channel 36, now known as Rhode Island PBS, the state’s only public television station.

Chafee's proposed budget, crafted to close a projected shortfall of $120 million to $125 million, would cut off funding to the station after Dec. 31, 2012.

CIANCI: ""What have you got against 'Sesame Street'?""

LICHT: ""I love Sesame Street. I have grandchildren and I always watched it with all four of my children. Tough times make for tough choices.""

CIANCI: ""But 'Sesame Street'? My God.""

LICHT: ""Hopefully, Channel 36 will be aggressive, go out and find some good charitable sponsors to help support this.""

CIANCI (facetiously): ""Especially in this economy, they're going to just fork over $800,000.""

LICHT: ""We aren't the only state cutting back on public television. It's not anything that we're happy about and, again, that's something that might be reversed [if better higher revenue estimates come in], but the facts are, tough times, tough choices.""

We were interested in whether Licht was correct that other states are cutting back on public television and, if so, how many.

We called the governor's office to ask for Licht's source.

Meanwhile, we talked to David Piccerelli, president of Rhode Island PBS.

""The proposal is to fund us through December 31 of 2012 and then shut off funding altogether,"" he said. In the current fiscal year, the state contributes $922,000 to RIPBS's total budget of $2.9 million. That's 31 percent.

Another 27 percent comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund stations throughout the United States. (The CPB itself has been repeatedly threatened with the cutoff of federal funds by conservatives.)

The remaining 42 percent comes from fundraising. Piccerelli said about 85 cents out of every dollar raised is from individual donors. Corporate support accounts for no more than 15 cents, down from close to 30 cents on the dollar around 2004-2005, before the Rhode Island economy took a faceplant.

Piccerelli said some states HAVE been cutting back their support; Chafee's office sent us information confirming that.

Last June, New Hampshire Public Television eliminated 20 full-time workers and cut staff salaries by as much as 10 percent after it lost $2.7 million in state funding, or about 30 percent of its budget.

At the same time, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, backed by the state legislature, eliminated funding for New Jersey public television, which resulted in the 40-year-old New Jersey Network being taken over by WNET in New York and NJN's nine radio licenses being sold to stations in New York and Philadelphia.

Stacey Karp, director of communications for the Association of Public Television Stations, said four other states -- Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania and South Carolina -- have also eliminated funding. For details, she sent us to Skip Hinton, president of the National Educational Telecommunications Association, a professional association that represents stations in every state.

He told us that 38 states were providing direct support to public broadcasting in 2007. It's now down to 32.

Of the 32, ""most have seen pretty significant reductions in state funding over the last four years,"" he said.

At least one state -- Illinois -- increased its contribution to public television, boosting funding by 16 percent last year, following cuts in previous years. 

Our ruling

Richard Licht, Chafee's director of administration, said, ""We aren't the only state cutting back on public television.""

Turns out, he’s right. Five states have eliminated funding and others have cut their contributions. 

We rate his statement True.

NRA leader says Barack Obama endorsed a 'total ban' on handguns
","
Wayne LaPierre, a longtime leader of the National Rifle Association, says President Barack Obama is biding his time to destroy the Second Amendment.

The group’s executive vice president spoke for the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Feb. 10, 2012, arguing the president’s strategy has been to ""hide, shroud and cloak"" his anti-gun plans.

One piece of evidence for that hidden agenda against the right to bear arms, LaPierre said: ""(Obama) endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns.""

A @PolitiFact Twitter follower wanted to know: Really?

Flashback

Turns out, we’ve seen a similar claim before.

Back in 2008, the NRA said that then-Sen. Barack Obama had a 10-point plan to ""change"" the Second Amendment, including a ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.

We found it False, saying a ""fuzzy stand in ‘96 does not amount to a plan.""

This time, LaPierre said that Obama ""endorsed a total ban."" Does his wording make a difference?

Here’s the shred of truth behind LaPierre’s rhetoric: In 1996, Obama’s campaign for Illinois Senate filled out a questionnaire for a state voter group. (Maybe Obama did it; maybe his campaign manager did. A spokesman for his 2008 presidential campaign later said that staff ""unintentionally mischaracterized his position,"" and that he never saw the survey.)

The questionnaire asked about Obama’s stance on various issues, including, ""Do you support state legislation to … ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns?""

The typed answer: Yes.

(You can see the questionnaire here and here, and read stories about it by the Associated Press and POLITICO.)

Obama never endorsed a ""total ban."" But his campaign for state Senate almost 16 years ago did say yes to supporting such a ban on a state level in a questionnaire.

What came of the campaign endorsement of such a policy?

The Associated Press noted that Obama's legislative record in Illinois ""shows strong support for gun restrictions, such as limiting handgun purchases to one a month, but no attempts to ban them."" On a different questionnaire eight years later, Obama’s position was that ""a complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable"" but that reasonable restrictions should be imposed, AP reported.

The president’s policies

Has Obama’s presidential administration shown sympathy for banning handguns?

In 2009, FactCheck.org said, ""We’ve seen little or no evidence that the Obama administration is doing much to regulate guns or gun ownership.""

In 2010, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave the president a report card of seven F’s for his first year in office, including on ""standing up the to the gun lobby.""

We talked with Caroline Brewer, director of communications for the Brady Center’s sister organization, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

""We certainly don't have a record of him calling for a ban of any kind on handguns in the United States,"" she said. ""... There's no logical reason to believe the president would ever advocate the banning of all handguns, and we as organization don't advocate for that, either.""

She noted that after the Tucson, Ariz., shootings that injured former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, the president called for better background checks, not banning guns.

Here’s a quote from that Obama op-ed, as published in the Arizona Daily Star on March 13, 2011: 
(It’s true, by the way, that Obama repealed Reagan-era rules to keep loaded guns out of national parks, something else that didn’t sit well with the Brady Campaign.)

LaPierre argues Obama’s rhetoric is a sign that he’s biding his time until a second term, when he’ll unfurl his full anti-gun agenda — an uncheckable prediction. (See: ""Obama’s Secret Plan To Destroy The Second Amendment By 2016."") However, none of Obama’s previous years in office hint at the kind of extreme policy push the NRA claims he’s yearning to unleash.

Our ruling

LaPierre said ""(Obama) endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns."" Obama’s 1996 campaign for state Senate did endorse a state-level ban, on a questionnaire from which he has since distanced himself.

He never suggested such a law in office, and later questionnaires showed a more nuanced approach, as have his more recent statements on gun control, including those during his time in the U.S. Senate and as president. In fact, his gun-control agenda has earned him failing grades from a prominent gun-control advocacy group.

We can’t rule on a shadowy conspiracy to destroy the Constitution in Obama’s second term. But we can say that LaPierre’s claim that Obama endorsed a total ban on handguns contains a small element of truth (a typewritten ""yes"" on a long-ago questionnaire about a state ban) but ignores critical facts — that is, Obama's statements and record — that would give a different impression. That's our definition of Mostly False.","[('\nWayne LaPierre, ""CPAC 2012: Wayne LaPierre,"" Feb. 10, 2012\n\nWayne LaPierre, ""Obama’s Secret Plan To Destroy The Second Amendment By 2016,"" accessed Feb. 10, 2012\n\nAmerican Conservative Union, CPAC 2012, accessed Feb. 10, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Andrew Arulanandam, director of public affairs, National Rifle Association, Feb. 10, 2012\n\nOn the Issues, ""Barack Obama on Gun Control,"" Nov. 22, 2009\n\nInterview with Caroline Brewer, director of communications, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Feb. 10, 2012\n\nBrady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, ""President Obama\'s First Year: Failed Leadership, Lost Lives,"" January 2010\n\nPolitiFact, ""Fuzzy stand in \'96 does not amount to a plan,"" Sept. 23, 2008\n\nPolitiFact, ""Chain e-mail says U.N. treaty would force U.S. to ban, confiscate guns,"" Jun 9, 2010\n\nPolitiFact, ""Yes, and outlaw apple pie as well,"" Sept. 23, 2008\n\nAssociated Press via USA Today, ""Obama’s views have changed with time,"" Dec. 22, 2007, via Nexis\n\nPOLITICO, ""Liberal views could haunt Obama,"" Dec. 11, 2007 (Questionnaire Part 1 | Part 2)\n\nArizona Daily Star, ""President Obama: We must seek agreement on gun reforms,"" March 13, 2011\n\nFactCheck.org, ""Has Obama found a \'legal way around the Second Amendment\'?""

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Jack Lew']","
White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew says budget requires 60 votes in Senate
","
With President Barack Obama a day away from offering his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal, Jack Lew -- now the White House Chief of Staff and previously director of the Office of Management and Budget -- defended the Democratic-controlled Senate against Republican criticism about not planning to pass a budget. 
On the Feb. 12, 2012, edition of CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley, the host said to Lew, ""I want to read for our viewers something (from) Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the U.S. Senate, who said, we do not need to bring a budget to the floor this year. It's done. We don't need to do it, talking about last year's two-year agreement and saying that, you know, … it's already done."" 
Lew responded, ""Well, let's be clear. What Sen. Reid is talking about is a fairly narrow point.  In order for the Senate to do its annual work on appropriation bills, they need to pass a certain piece of legislation which sets a limit. They did that last year. That's what he's talking about. He's not saying that they shouldn't pass a budget. But we also need to be honest. You can't pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes, and you can't get 60 votes without bipartisan support. So unless Republicans are willing to work with Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid is not going to be able to get a budget passed. And I think he was reflecting the reality that that could be a challenge."" 
Critics of the Obama administration and a flurry of news outlets jumped on that comment as factually incorrect. 
So we decided to take a look for ourselves. 
The annual congressional budget resolution plays a very specific -- and for outsiders, arcane -- role in the process of spending the federal government’s money. It’s not a piece of legislation that actually spends money -- in fact, as a resolution, it doesn’t even have the force of law and does not go to the president to be signed  -- but rather helps provide a general spending blueprint and helps define benchmarks in the budget process. 
""The budget resolution was designed to provide a framework to make budget decisions, leaving specific program determinations to the Appropriations Committees and other committees with spending and revenue jurisdiction,"" the Congressional Research Service writes. The process of writing a budget resolution begins following the submission of the president’s budget in January or February. 
We’ll skip a few interim steps (including floor consideration in the House) but when the budget resolution is ready to hit the floor in the Senate, its consideration is governed by section 305(b)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the law that enshrined the current federal budget process. 
Most business in the Senate is subject to filibustering -- that is, actions, or even just threats, to talk a bill to death. Filibusters can be overcome by what’s known as a ""cloture"" vote that shuts off debate and moves a measure toward final consideration. For the Senate to agree to cloture requires 60 votes -- a high threshold that many Senate majorities are unable to muster on controversial votes (and, increasingly, even on relatively uncontroversial votes). 
However, the filibuster cannot be used to block a budget resolution. That’s because the Budget Act sets out a specific amount of time for debate in the Senate -- 50 hours. If a specific amount of debate time is enshrined in the controlling statute, the filibuster is moot. So a simple majority -- not 60 votes -- is all that’s required to pass a budget resolution. 
Indeed, passing a budget resolution by at least 60 votes has become increasingly rare in recent years, according to CRS data. Since 1994, the Senate vote has exceeded that vote threshold just three times, either in the initial vote or on a subsequent vote in which lawmakers consider an identical House-Senate version of the resolution. 
More common in recent years are votes where 51 was enough to prevail. In 2009, the Senate even passed the final budget resolution by a 48-45 margin. 
""The budget resolution vote is always a partisan affair, and rarely does it gain any minority party support,"" said Steve Ellis, a vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense. 
So Lew is clearly wrong to say that ""you can't pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes."" As a longtime senior official at OMB and other federal agencies, he should have known better. 
The White House, for its part, has said that Lew was referring to the general gridlock in Congress and not to the specific budget resolution. 
Some federal budget experts think the White House has a point, despite being wrong on the vote threshold for the budget resolution. A budget resolution is just a blueprint; being able to implement many of its provisions would likely require 60 votes eventually,said Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in budget issues. ""Lew is absolutely on the mark on the bigger picture,"" Meyers said. 
Still, Lew was precise in his wording, and on that claim, he was wrong. 
Our ruling 
On the specific question he was asked -- about the congressional budget resolution -- Lew said you need 60 votes to pass it. That’s flatly wrong. On the larger question of putting together what we think most people would call the ""federal budget,"" a majority party may be able to get its budget resolution passed, but that’s not the same thing as actually enacting spending bills to implement it. In all likelihood, these bills would require 60 votes in the Senate. Still, Lew's specific claim was False.","[('\nJack Lew, comments on CNN\'s State of the Union with Candy Crowley, Feb. 12, 2012\n\nText of Congressional Budget Act\n\nCongressional Research Service, ""Congressional Budget Resolutions: Historical Information,"" April 4, 2011\n\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, ""Policy Basics: Introduction to the Federal Budget Process,"" Jan. 3, 2011\n\nABC News, ""WH Chief of Staff Errs on Senate Budget Rules,"" Feb. 12, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Norm Ornstein, congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Feb. 13, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Roy T.

Gov. O'Malley says Maryland is creating jobs at 2 1/2 times rate of Virginia
","
The growing rivalry between Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley is on national tour.

The two faced off Feb. 5 on CNN’s State of the Union, disagreeing on why the economy has improved.

McDonnell, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, gave all the credit to job-creation policies by GOP governors and was dismissive of President Barack Obama’s efforts. O’Malley, head of the Democratic Governor’s Association, lauded the president’s ""choices and policies.""

McDonnell criticized O’Malley’s proposals this year that Maryland raise its income tax on top earners, as well as increase levies on gas and cigars. McDonnell boasted that Virginia’s 6.2 percent unemployment rate trumps Maryland’s 6.9 percent rate.

O’Malley corrected McDonnell; Maryland’s rate was 6.7 percent in December, the most recent figures available.

""And we’re creating jobs at 2 ½ times the rate Virginia is,"" O’Malley said.

We’ll stipulate O’Malley is correct about about his state’s unemployment rate. But his claim that Maryland is creating jobs at 2 ½ times the pace of Virginia was news to us. So we checked it out.

Raquel Guillory, O’Malley’s chief of communications, told us her boss’s statement was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She sent us two sets of BLS numbers to back O’Malley’s claim. The data compared seasonally-adjusted employment figures in Maryland and Virginia.

In January 2011, Maryland had 2,508,300 non-farm jobs. The number rose by 30,300 in December, to 2,538,600. That’s a 1.21 percent increase.

Virginia had 3,641,100 non-farm jobs in January 2011. The number rose by 22,000 in December, to  3,663,100. That’s an 0.6 percent increase.

Maryland’s rate of increase, under O’Malley’s formula, would be two times Virginia’s rate.

The second set of numbers compared private-sector employment.

In January 2011, Maryland had 2,011,900 private jobs. The number rose by 25,600 in December, to 2,037,500. That’s a 1.27 percent increase.

Virginia had 2,941,200 private jobs in January 2011. The number rose by 15,900 in December, to 2,957,100. That’s an 0.54 percent increase.

So Maryland’s rate of increase, under O’Malley’s formula, would be roughly 2-1/3 times Virginia’s rate.

Do O’Malley’s numbers prove Maryland is outperforming Virginia?

Terry Rephann, a regional economist with the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, questioned O’Malley’s methodology of comparing the first month of 2011 with the last. He said economists usually compare job numbers from the same month over a period of years to remove any possibility of seasonal distortion, such as Christmas or summer employment.

Kara Markley, a mid-Atlantic regional economist with the BLS, made a similar observation. ""We would typically compare the same month year-to-year with the not seasonally-adjusted data,"" she said.

That data paints a far different picture from the one O’Malley framed.

In December 2011, Maryland added 24,700  jobs to its 2,529,300 tally from the previous December -- a 0.98 percent increase. Virginia added 35,600 jobs to its total of 3,644,500 from 2010 -- an 0.97 percent increase.

By that method, Maryland’s job creation rate topped Virginia by 1/100th of 1 percent.

Using the same month-to-month method, we ran a comparison for all of 2010 and 2011. Virginia came out ahead in eight months, Maryland did better in four.

Howard Wial, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said monthly employment numbers from each state are voluble and can be greatly impacted by the hiring or firing decisions of a single corporation.

So who’s the better job creator, Maryland or Virginia? O’Malley or McDonnell?

Rephann said these are complicated questions that would require many years of data, and analyses of policies and the impact of federal employment in each state.

""I don’t know how you could demonstrate, over a given year, which state had the better policies,"" he said.

Time and again, economists have told us politicians take far too much credit for job gains and assign far to much blame for losses. The O’Malley-McDonnell squabble evoked the same response.

""Governor’s really don’t control their economies,"" Wial said.

""It’s political theater,"" Rephann said.

Our ruling:.

O’Malley said Maryland is creating jobs at 2½ times the rate of Virginia.

He based his statement on the two state’s employment numbers in January and December of 2011 and comparing the percentages of increase. Maryland came out ahead under O’Malley’s formula, but not quite by the magnitude the governor claimed.

Two economists told us better measurements would come from comparing unadjusted job figures from the same month in different years. Under this formula, using numbers from December 2010 and December 2011, the two states essentially came out even. When we compared each month in 2010 to its counterpart in 2011, Virginia usually came out ahead of Maryland.

So O’Malley’s claim only approaches validity when he gets to cherry-pick the data. We rate his statement False.

Conservative black sheriff says Milwaukee blacks have high unemployment, truancy, infant mortality; low graduation rate, reading scores
","
When an African-American tea party congressman held a ""conservative black forum"" on Capitol Hill on Jan. 23, 2012, the Milwaukee County sheriff was among the dozen panelists.

David A. Clarke Jr. told the host, U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Florida, and a national C-SPAN audience about the woes of Wisconsin’s largest city.

""I come from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city with a lot of issues, a lot of issues,"" Clarke said in his opening remarks.

Then he rattled off a set of startling statistics:

""Fifty-five percent black male unemployment. Truancy rate of sixty percent -- sixty percent of students in the Milwaukee Public Schools system do not attend school regularly. They only graduate fifty percent of the students that do, and when they come out of there the diploma is not worth the paper that it's written on, and they probably can't even read it. We have the worst fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores in the nation. We lead in infant mortality rate and I could go on and on and on.""

Clarke is a Democrat in a largely Democratic county, but he is an outspoken conservative who often speaks bluntly about issues outside of law enforcement.

So is the Milwaukee area really as bleak as the sheriff paints it? We’ll look at each of the five parts of Clarke’s claim: Unemployment, truancy, graduation rate, reading scores and infant mortality.

Clarke's spokeswoman, Fran McLaughlin, confirmed that Clarke was speaking about African-Americans, rather than the total population, with the statistics he cited. She said Clarke’s statements were based on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories, but she didn’t provide any specific one.

Unemployment

Clarke said Milwaukee has ""55 percent black male unemployment.""

Does that mean the unemployment rate among black males is 55 percent?

No.

Clarke was likely referring to a Journal Sentinel article, published the same day as the forum, about a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study that reported an employment rate -- as opposed to the more commonly reported unemployment rate -- among black males.

The study says nearly 45 percent of the area's black males ages 16 to 64 were employed in 2010.

So, presumably the remaining 55 percent were unemployed.

But the study arrived at its figures by counting virtually all black males, including those who aren’t actively looking for work, such as those who are incarcerated, disabled or full-time students.

In contrast, unemployment -- the rate most commonly measured by the government and reported in the news media -- is based on the number people who are unemployed but actively looking for work. That’s a much smaller group.

Indeed, the UWM study said that black male unemployment rate for metro Milwaukee in 2010 was 29.5 percent.

So, this part of Clarke’s claim is misleading in that ""black male unemployment"" is far less than 55 percent.

Truancy

Clarke said the truancy rate among black students in Milwaukee Public Schools is 60 percent.

The latest data from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, for the 2009-2010 school year, show 59.5 percent of black MPS students were habitually truant -- absent from school without an acceptable excuse for part or all of five or more days during a semester.  

So this part of Clark’s claim, rounded up a half-percentage point, is accurate.

Graduation rate

Clarke said the graduation rate among black Milwaukee Public Schools students is 50 percent.

But, as a May 2011 Journal Sentinel article reported, the 2010 high school graduation rate for black MPS students was 59.5 percent, according to the latest available figures from the Department of Public Instruction.

That means this part of Clarke’s claim is wrong.

Reading scores

Clarke said black Milwaukee Public Schools students have ""the worst fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores in the nation.""

The Journal Sentinel reported in December 2011 on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests administered by the federal government in urban school districts.

On the reading test, black fourth-graders in MPS tied with Cleveland for last place among 20 districts studied. Black MPS eighth-graders ranked 18th, ahead of the District of Columbia and Fresno, Calif.

So, Clarke is a bit off on quoting the study. This part of his claim is also overstated in that the study considered only 20 school districts; the study doesn’t indicate whether MPS reading scores are among the worst for all U.S. districts.

Infant mortality

Clarke said ""we lead"" in black infant mortality.

The Journal Sentinel reported in January 2011 on a Milwaukee Health Department study which found that, from 2005 through 2008, the black infant mortality rate in Milwaukee was 15.7 deaths for every 1,000 births -- 2.5 times higher than the white rate.

The report said that for a slightly shorter period -- 2005-2007 -- Milwaukee’s black infant mortality rate was lower than Detroit’s and Philadelphia’s, but higher than many large cities, including New York, Chicago, St. Louis and Minneapolis.

So, although the study didn’t cover a large number of cities, Clarke’s suggestion that Milwaukee is among cities with a higher black infant mortality rate is accurate.

Our rating

Clarke was correct in two parts of his claim: Black Milwaukee Public Schools students have a 60 percent truancy rate and Milwaukee has one of the higher black infant mortality rates among U.S. cities.

Clarke was wrong in two parts. He overstated unemployment among black males in metro Milwaukee, which was 29.5 percent in 2010, and he understated the graduation rate among black MPS students; it is nearly 60 percent.

On the remaining part of the claim, reading scores among black MPS students were nearly the worst among 20 school districts in a study. But that doesn’t mean they were the worst in the nation, which is what Clarke said.

On balance, we rate Clarke’s statement Half True.","[('\nC-SPAN, conservative black forum video, Jan. 23, 2012 (at 18:00)\n\nEmail interview, Milwaukee County sheriff public information officer Fran McLaughlin, Feb. 8, 2012\n\nU.S. Rep.

GOP challenger Joseph Kyrillos blames U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez for rising annual deficits in federal budget
","
U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez is one of hundreds of federal officials responsible for spending taxpayer dollars, but state Sen. Joseph Kyrillos is pinning blame for the nation’s rising annual deficits on the Democratic incumbent.

Kyrillos, a Republican representing part of Monmouth County, made that accusation during a Feb. 1 speech announcing his plans to seek the GOP nomination and challenge Menendez, who is seeking re-election.

""Senator Menendez said he would spend our money wisely,"" Kyrillos told the crowd at the Lincroft Inn. ""But our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch.""

For this fact-check, PolitiFact New Jersey is tackling two related claims made by Kyrillos. The first claim concerns the specific budgetary figures that he cited, and the second claim deals with whether it’s fair to blame Menendez for those deficits.

We found that Menendez bears some responsibility for the increased deficits, but Kyrillos’ numbers are slightly off and his argument ignores the impact of the recession on federal coffers.

First, let’s talk about the deficit figures.

Kyrillos spokesman Chapin Fay claimed that the annual deficit increased from about $250 billion in fiscal year 2006 -- when Menendez joined the Senate -- to about $1.6 trillion in fiscal year 2011, which ended in September 2011.

The number for fiscal year 2006 is accurate, but the fiscal year 2011 figure cited by Kyrillos is not.

Federal officials had estimated an annual deficit of $1.645 trillion for fiscal year 2011, but the actual deficit turned out to be slightly under $1.3 trillion. During Menendez’s tenure in the Senate, the annual deficit reached its highest level in fiscal year 2009, at about $1.4 trillion.

Now, let’s turn to the larger question: how much did Menendez have to do with the rising deficits?

With regard to the spending increase in fiscal year 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pointed to three major factors: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus); the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP; and payments to mortgage guarantee agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Following its inception, TARP provided federal dollars to financial institutions and automakers.

Menendez voted for the three bills that led to increased spending under those measures.

But two professors with expertise in federal budgeting also pointed to another major factor behind the rising deficits: the recession. The economic downturn caused a steep drop in revenues at a time when more people were seeking unemployment benefits.

""But I think it is silly to blame an individual Senator for changes that were fundamentally driven by the worst recession since the 1930s,"" Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an e-mail.

Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also said Kyrillos was giving Menendez ""too much blame."" Menendez deserves some blame, but members of both parties contributed to the increased deficits.

""It’s been a bipartisan problem with all of them going along with it,"" Mitchell told us.

Fay said Kyrillos believes both parties contributed to the deficit, but maintained that Menendez’s voting record was a significant factor.

""The deficit has risen dramatically during Sen. Menendez's time in office - and as you cited yourself, he has taken an extraordinary number of votes during that time to increase spending,"" Fay said in an email. 
A spokeswoman for Menendez declined to comment.

Our ruling

During his campaign announcement, Kyrillos criticized Menendez by saying ""our annual national deficit climbed from $250 billion a year to $1.6 trillion on his watch.""

His numbers are slightly off, because the highest annual deficit during Menendez’s tenure in the Senate was about $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009.

Menendez bears some responsibility for the large deficits by supporting various measures such as the stimulus and TARP. But experts told us the recession largely contributed to the deficits, and both parties are to blame for increased spending.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['Energy', 'Virginia', 'Bob Marshall']","
Del. Bob Marshall says ""you're supposed to throw away your shoes"" if a CFL light bulb breaks on them
","
Del. Bob Marshall says breaking a compact florescent light bulb is hazardous to the environment and to your shoes.

Marshall, R-Prince William, sounded warnings about the mercury inside each of those curly-cue CFL bulbs. If one bulbs shatters, it creates a ""hazardous materials situation in your home,"" he said in Feb. 2 testimony before a House Commerce and Labor subcommittee at Virginia’s General Assembly.

""If (the mercury) contaminates your shoes, you’re supposed to throw away your shoes,"" he said.

We’d hate to needlessly throw away a pair of shoes because a light bulb broke on them. So we decided to see if Marshall was correct.

An average CFL contains 4 milligrams of mercury -- about enough to cover the tip of a ballpoint pen, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing light bulb makers.

To put that in perspective, the association notes on its website that older glass thermometers contain about 500 milligrams of mercury, 125 times more than what’s in an average CFL.

Debate over CFL use has been burning since 2007, when Congress passed a law requiring greater energy efficiency from light bulbs. The law phases out many traditional incandescent bulbs that don’t meet the standards, although manufacturers are making more efficient forms of the old-style bulbs. They’re also making more CFLs -- touted by state and federal officials as a much more efficient light source.

The new standards have ignited conservative protest that the long arm of government has reached too far when Congress tells citizens they can no longer use an old-fashioned light bulb in their homes.

Marshall, who is challenging George Allen this year for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat, urged the General Assembly to shield Virginians from the regulations. He introduced a bill that would allow Virginia companies to continue producing and selling the old-fashioned incandescents.  

At hearings, Marshall sought to convince legislators that increased use of CFL bulbs could expose Virginians to new risks of mercury exposure. But the bill died in subcommittee Feb. 2.

We asked Marshall for information supporting his statement that shoes need to be tossed if they touch the debris from a broken CFL bulb. He sent us links to environmental agency websites from four states.

But some of the sites Marshall cited don’t specifically say they’re providing instruction on how to handle a broken CFL bulb. They are advising how to deal with a larger mercury release, such as the dispersal of the ""quicksilver"" liquid mercury when a glass thermometer breaks.

For example, the fact sheet from the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection that Marshall cited urges homeowners get rid of contaminated shoes and clothing after cleaning up ""visible mercury beads.""

But as Indiana’s Department of Environmental Management notes, breaking a thermometer or thermostat with liquid mercury inside is different than breaking a fluorescent bulb. In the case of a broken bulb, ""you will not be able to see the mercury,"" according to Indiana’s DEM.

Robert Francis, manager of the environmental response branch at the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection, said his agency’s recommendation for getting rid of shoes tainted by mercury is a reference to what should be done in case of a larger spill than a light bulb break. He said his agency doesn’t have a recommendation on whether shoes should be thrown out if they’re contaminated by a bulb breakage.

The Arizona Department on Environmental Quality says on its website that any clothing coming in direct contact with broken glass or powder should be thrown away. But when it comes to
shoes, it recommends wiping them off with a damp cloth or paper towels.

But Mark Shaffer, a spokesman with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, said his state would recommend throwing out shoes even if the smaller amount of mercury from the bulb gets on them.

What about other states?

In a quick search, we found agencies in West Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Mississippi all recommend homeowners should wipe off shoes with damp towels after they come in direct contact with mercury from a broken CFL bulb. The shoes don’t need to go, but the towels and wipes do.

NEMA, the light bulb makers trade group, also advises wiping off -- not throwing out -- shoes that have bulb fragments or mercury powder on them.

Virginia’s guidelines on CFL cleanup don’t speak to shoe contamination. Bill Hayden, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, referred our queries about how to handle contaminated shoes to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA website, in a section detailing how to clean up a broken CFL, offers no guidance on shoes. It does, however, recommend steps for dealing with a broken CFL at home. It suggests clearing everyone out of the room where the bulb shattered and opening a window or door to let it air out for 5-10 minutes. Heat or air conditioning should be shut off and then cardboard, tape or damp towels should be used to pick up the glass and powder from the bulb.

But if you don’t clean up perfectly, the agency says that’s OK.

""Don’t be alarmed: These steps are only precautions that reflect best practices for cleaning up a broken CFL,"" the EPA’s website states. ""Keep in mind that CFLs contain a very small amount of mercury -- less than 1/100th of the amount in a mercury thermometer.""

For some additional perspective, we also spoke with Edward Groth, a former senior scientist with the Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. He  said throwing away shoes tainted by a CFL bulb break would be a ""fairly extreme"" response.

""If you get some on your shoes, the best solution, in my mind, would be to take them outside on the porch and let them air out for several days,"" Groth said.

Our ruling:

Marshall said that when shoes are contaminated with mercury from a broken CFL bulb, ""you’re supposed to throw them out.""

To back his statement, he referred us to the websites of environmental agencies in four states. They advise throwing out clothing -- and sometimes shoes -- contaminated by a significant mercury release, such as the amount that would come from an old thermometer.

But CFL bulbs have a tiny fraction of a thermometer’s mercury. None of the agencies specifically advise throwing shoes hit by a broken CFL. Two of the states’ websites say to clean off the shoes. Our quick search found five additional state websites that recommended wiping off the shoes off and not a single state that advised to throw them out. The Environmental Protection Agency offers no shoe advice.

Marshall hasn’t proved his claim. We rate his statement False.
