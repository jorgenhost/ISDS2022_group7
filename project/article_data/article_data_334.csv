State senator says price for tests would be low to for benefit recipients
","
State Sen. Stacey Campfield, R-Knoxville, wants drug testing for individuals seeking government-related benefits, and he said in an interview that costs of testing, to be paid for by the applicant, should not be expensive. ""It’s not going to cost that much, just $4 or $5, if it’s limited to hardcore illegal drugs.""

We wondered if a drug test that can withstand legal scrutiny can be purchased so cheaply.

Research backs up Campfield’s claim, and reliable tests can actually be had even more cheaply. But figuring the state’s tab and actual costs for such a program is not as simple as running a price check on individual drug tests. Administrative costs and potential re-tests of individuals who test positive could raise the actual price tag. 
In the interview, Campfield acknowledged there would be other costs but said the savings from having fewer people on the government dole will more than offset them. Still, we wondered just how expensive such a program would be.

First, a little background.

Campfield said he plans to push three bills calling for drug testing: one dealing with persons on welfare, one for those drawing unemployment compensation and one for those receiving workers’ compensation benefits.

One state that recently tried something similar, Florida, had only 32 people fail the test and 1,600 refused to take it, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The cost to the state has been substantial. Then U.S. District Judge Mary Scriven issued an injunction against the law in October. The state is appealing.

Campfield said he is aware of the Florida situation and plans to avoid its pitfalls. A big one:  the state was on the hook for the $25 to $45 each test costs if the individual passed. Campfield’s measure would have the applicant assuming the cost regardless. His test would not cover prescription drugs -- the biggest area of abuse in Tennessee but also a legal hot potato because of the thousands who take prescription drugs legally.

For Ron Hanaver, director of the Knox (County) Drug Court,  drug testing is a key tool, so we asked him if drug tests could be had for $4 or $5. His emailed response:

""Those tests can, in fact, be tested for about that price.  We are currently using a 5-panel test that tests for opiates, cocaine, THC, and 2 other drugs for about $3.50.""

American Screening Corp owner Ron Kilgarlin says his company offers a five-panel test  for $1.63 apiece, but Hanaver describes five-panel tests as ""instant ‘dip’ tests"" that ""are not 100% accurate."" Hanaver says that failures of those tests may mean administering a backup, known as a ""gcms test,"" but what he calls ""non-negative"" tests needing the backup occur only about 2 percent of the time or less.

Kilgarlin says those ""gcms"" tests usually run for $25 apiece but could be reduced to $14 apiece for a big enough client.

And, what other costs are there? A report put out in October by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation office in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services looking at various costs of programs aimed at drug testing recipients of government benefits.

It lists many areas: purchasing the drug tests, laboratory fees, staff time to administer the test, staff time to monitor compliance and eligibility, staff time to deal with increased administrative hearings, modifying facilities to accommodate the testing, modifying computer programs to include drug testing in eligibility, substance abuse treatment, hiring a contractor to administer the test, legal fees if the law is challenged. A table included in the report looks at the expected costs of programs offered by the 12 states that are considering such programs (or, in Florida’s case, have instituted). Those estimates range from $20 million in New York to  $92,487 in Louisiana.

Count Hanaver, the Knox County drug-court director, among those skeptical about keeping costs low for a statewide program that tests benefit recipients for illegal drug use. ""When you talk about doing drug screens on a state-wide scale, the cost would be huge,"" he says.

Campfield clarified to us that he was referring just to the cost of the individual tests, and believes the legislation will result in the state saving a substantial amount of money, not spending more. He said the savings would come from not paying benefits to people who test positive - or who don’t apply for benefits knowing they will test positive. Once the bill is filed, legislative staff of the state’s Fiscal Review Committee will do a fiscal note estimating costs to the state.

Our Ruling

Campfield’s claim that initial five-panel tests for illegal drugs can cost $5 or less is accurate, although it is unclear how other costs, for things like re-testing and administration, could affect the ultimate per-person cost of each individual test. We rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4A80C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/13/stacey-campfield/state-senator-says-price-tests-would-be-low-benefi/

Memphis schools superintendent says county, state tax funds for education rank among lowest in U.S.
","
  
At the Nov. 3, 2011, meeting of Shelby County’s schools merger Transition Planning Commission, Memphis City Schools Supt. Kriner Cash responded to a statement made by a suburban commissioner, Tommy Hart of Collierville, about Shelby County having ""the highest tax rate in the state of Tennessee.""

Cash didn't quibble with that but claimed the rate is still ""one of the lowest in the country.""

In some ways, Cash and Hart were talking past one another. Hart, a real-estate developer, used the more general term ""tax rate"" but clearly was referring to property taxes, which produce 60.1 percent of county revenues, with 30.6 percent of the county’s budget going to public schools budgets. Hart was asking Cash and the merger transition team to keep in mind that people are concerned about keeping local taxes from rising, even as the county moves toward funding a consolidated school system.

The transition team is charged with creating a plan for merging Memphis City Schools with suburban Shelby County Schools in time for the 2013-14 school year.

Cash took the opportunity to push back with a larger point he has emphasized in other settings -- the county and the state actually have an overall education tax burden that is very low compared to the rest of the country.

Is Cash correct? To sort that out, we looked at tax burdens at the state and local levels, as well as education spending at the per-pupil level.

Education Counts, the research and data center for Education Week, includes a table that shows the percentage of total taxable resources spent on education. By that measure, Tennessee tied for fourth-lowest in the country in 2008, the most recent year included in the database. In terms of per pupil spending, Tennessee ranks sixth-lowest, according to Education Counts.

The state also rates low in a 2011 U.S. Census Bureau publication that examines school finances from 2009. It is the third-lowest state in the country for per-pupil spending ($8,141 compared to national average of $12,250) ahead of only Idaho and Utah, and, again, third-lowest in terms of education spending per $1,000 of personal income ($36.90 per $1,000 in Tennessee vs. national average of $47.74), ahead of only Florida and Washington, D.C.

In terms of total state-local tax burdens, the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation shows Tennessee as fourth-lowest in the nation, with 7.6 percent of Tennesseans’ incomes going toward local and state taxes.

So clearly, Tennessee’s tax burden and spending on education rank among the lowest in the country. But what about Shelby County’s in particular?

It actually ranks in the middle of pack nationally. The Tax Foundation built a database with census data showing that, in terms of median property taxes paid on owner occupied housing, Shelby County ranks 345th of the 792 U.S. counties with a population of 65,000 or more. The median property tax of $1,902 is just behind Williamson County’s $1,914 and well above the next Tennessee county, Davidson, at $1,562.

So while property taxes in Shelby County may be high for the state, they fall in the middle nationally -- below many counties in states where residents also pay state income taxes and/or local payroll taxes to help fund public education. However, it’s important to note that the majority of education funding for Tennessee school districts comes from the state, not the county.

Our ruling

So Cash is right about the state's ranking. The county is more in the middle of the pack nationally, but it accounts for a smaller share of education funding. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1EC700>],/factchecks/2012/jan/13/kriner-cash/memphis-schools-superintendent-says-county-state-t/

UPDATED: Craig James, Republican Senate candidate, says Rick Perry cut Texas taxes
","
CORRECTION, 4:45 p.m. Jan. 17, 2012: This fact check originally presented per-capita state and local sales tax collections for 2000 and 2010 attributed to information from the U.S. Census Bureau. But, as a reader helpfully pointed out, those figures solely reflected state taxes. This article has been revised accordingly. The changes do not affect the rating of the statement. 
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Craig James, a former ESPN football analyst, saluted Gov. Rick Perry in an online video posted Jan. 3, 2012, saying Perry ""changed Texas--cut waste, reduced taxes, put people back to work. And that’s just what I’ll do in Washington.""

We’re not sure how to gauge how Perry cut waste or personally put people to work. But it’s possible to gauge if he reduced taxes.

Caveat: Per-person tax collections go up and down partly due to changes in state tax policy, though they’re also affected by population growth and the economy.

Another vantage point: Each resident’s taxes change depending on personal circumstances -- a job change, a move, the purchase or sale of a house.
   
Until a few years ago, the U.S Census Bureau calculated per-capita state and local taxes collected. In 2000, the year that Perry became governor, state government collected $1,315 per person, a rate that was the 49th lowest among the states. That would have been $1,665 in 2010 dollars, according to our calculation using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator.

In 2010, state government in Texas collected $1,567 per person; we reached this figure by dividing the bureau’s tabulation of Texas state taxes collected that year, nearly $39.4 billion, by the state’s April 2010 population of 25.1 million. So, those collections ran about $100 less per person than the inflation-adjusted amount collected in 2000.

There are other calculations. Per-person state tax collections were slightly higher in 2007 than in 2001, according to information published by the advisory Legislative Budget Board. In 2001, Perry’s first full year as governor, the state reaped nearly $1,377 in tax revenue per resident. In 2007, according to the board’s latest Fiscal Size-Up publication, the state gathered nearly $1,691 per resident, which was equivalent to $1,444 in 2001 dollars, according to our check on the BLS calculator. So, that suggests a $67 per person increase in state taxes.

However, experts cautioned us against reaching sweeping conclusions about Perry and taxes based on measures of total tax collections.

The reality is he’s signed both tax hikes and cuts into law.

Neither the state sales or gas tax -- two major revenue generators -- has been hiked during Perry’s governorship. But in 2006, he approved a package of changes including a $1-a-pack cigarette tax hike, modification in how the state taxes used-car purchases and an overhaul of the state’s business franchise tax, all toward covering a mandated one-third reduction in local school property tax rates.

Separately over the years, as we noted in a November 2010 fact check, Perry signed into law higher taxes on smokeless tobacco, fireworks and the purchase or rental of diesel equipment. He also has agreed to fee increases, which some liken to tax bumps.

Perry has said the 2006 increases shouldn't be counted against him because the cuts in property taxes set in motion by lawmakers were bigger. Told by the Texas Tribune in 2010 that some people consider the franchise tax change to be an increase, Perry replied: ""That was a net tax decrease.""

An August 2008 analysis of the 2006 changes by the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association says that while some taxes clearly were raised, those increases were dwarfed by nearly $7 billion for 2007 in legislated property tax cuts.

That’s not to say, though, that taxes went down -- only that they did not continue escalating as they would have under previous law, the association said.

If lawmakers had not acted, its analysis says, taxpayers would have seen an estimated $4.7 billion tax increase to fund school maintenance and operations between 2005 and 2007. Instead, the average Texan’s total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been without the legislative action, the analysis says.

The analysis says many Texans were still paying higher property taxes in 2007 than they did in 2005, before the tax changes, for several reasons:
--Almost all school districts exercised their authority to increase tax rates above the state-mandated one-third reduction;
--Local voters approved additional taxes to pay for debt service for facilities, which went up 37 percent from 2005 to 2007;
--Residential property values accelerated;
--And city, county and special district property taxes continued to increase.

These factors combined produced a total property tax bill for Texans that was $1.7 billion higher than came due in 2005, the analysis says. It closes: ""Even so, there is no doubt the actions taken in 2006 have saved Texans an estimated $7 billion a year in property taxes. The average Texan’s property tax bill may not be lower than it was two years ago, but it is unmistakably much, much lower than it would have been.""

By email, the group’s president, Dale Craymer, recently told us that Perry reduced taxes overall. ""The 2006 package raised the franchise and cigarette taxes, but for each dollar raised the property tax was lowered by more than $3,"" Craymer said, ""so the package clearly nets out as a sizable tax cut (overall, probably the biggest tax cut in history).""

In 2011, he added, the state cost of school property tax relief as required by the 2006 law amounts to about $7 billion -- with the state tax changes from 2006 generating $2.2 billion of that, he said. That is, the local property tax load was lightened considerably more than state taxes were up.

By email, Dick Lavine, a tax expert for the Austin-based, liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, agreed school taxes were cut, though, Lavine said, lawmakers also left a multibillion-dollar gap between available revenue and ""necessary"" state expenditures, or ""structural deficit,"" that must be addressed each legislative session.

Eva DeLuna Castro, the center’s senior budget analyst, separately pointed out that total collected state and local taxes, including property taxes, annually increased all but one year from 2006 through 2010. The year-to-year increase from 2008 to 2009 was only $300 million, while from 2009 to 2010, such collections dropped $1.7 billion to $81 billion, a decrease DeLuna attributed to the national recession.

""Sorry, I’m going to give all of you a Pants on Fire,"" Castro said by email. ""Taxes have not been reduced. At best, (Perry) ‘bent the curve?’""

In an interview, Will Newton, executive director of the Texas chaper of the National Federation of Independent Business, pointed out that Perry also signed into law changes that increased the number of businesses exempted from the revised franchise tax. The 2006 law excused businesses with total revenues of $300,000 or less. A few years later, Perry agreed to exempt businesses with total revenue of $1 million or less. ""That’s a really big thing for smaller businesses,"" Newton said.

In another fact check, we looked at another way of gauging Texas taxes under Perry.

The non-partisan Tax Foundation, based in Washington, annually estimates how much residents of each state cough up for state and local taxes. In 2000, Texans were taxed at an effective rate of 7.1 percent, meaning 7.1 cents of every dollar in income went to state and local taxes. That year, the foundation says, each resident paid about $2,214, on average.

In 2009, the latest year checked, Texans paid an effective rate of 7.9 percent; the per-person amount of state and local taxes paid was $3,197-- up 44 percent from 2000, or 17 percent adjusted for inflation.

As noted in a July 17, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article, the 7.9 percent compared with the national average of 9.8 percent and only five states (Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming) had lower state-local tax burdens than Texas.

Our ruling

Perry put in motion major tax hikes generating less revenue than state-ordered reductions in local school property taxes the governor also signed into law. However, it’s overly simplistic to say that Perry simply reduced taxes. He cut some, raised others.

Video blames Bain Capital for demise of KB Toys
","
A 28-minute anti-Mitt Romney video uses clips of adorable singing puppets and a scared child's face to drive home a point: Romney's Bain Capital drove KB Toys into staggering debt and bankruptcy. 
But is that the whole story? 
The video, produced by pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC Winning Our Future, seeks to paint Romney as a ""predatory corporate raider"" who ""looked for businesses he could pick apart."" 
It highlighted four examples, including mall toy store chain KB Toys, from the more than 100 companies that Bain invested in over the years Romney led the private equity firm.

About eight minutes into the documentary-style piece, the video uses an old jingle from KB Toys along with this narration:

""Romney and Bain bought the 80-year-old company in 2000, loaded KB Toys with millions in debt, then used the money to repurchase Bain stock. The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed.""

That the chain failed isn't in dispute: KB Toys went into bankruptcy in 2004 under Bain, later dissolving in bankruptcy court under different owners in 2008. But what drove it out of business?

Romney's retirement 
The first two words in that quote, ""Romney and Bain,"" raise the first question: How was Romney involved with Bain in 2000?

He had retired from the firm in February 1999 to help organize the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.

Charlyn Lusk, who does public relations for Bain, pointed to a fact-check this week by Fortune that said, ""Romney left Bain in 1999 and had no operational role thereafter. It is true that he remained an investor, but so did dozens of university endowments, private foundations and pension systems. None of them played a part in Bain's investment decisions or portfolio company management.""

But a New York Times report from December 2011 explains he had something more than investor status — he got a share of corporate buyout and investment profits ""enjoyed by partners from all Bain deals through February 2009. ... He was also given the right to invest his own money alongside his former partners.""

A Bain partnership bought KB Toys in 2000, putting up $18 million and borrowing the rest, $302 million, the Times reported. Less than a year and a half later, KB Toys borrowed more to pay Bain and its investors — which would have included Romney — an $85 million dividend. (That dividend was part of a $121 million stock redemption, funded in part by $66 million in bank loans, Bloomberg reported based on other news coverage.) Bain partners made a 370 percent return, but left the company heavily in debt.

Did Romney lead the decision to buy KB Toys, and to reap a dividend? That's what the wording ""Romney and Bain bought ..."" suggests. That's highly unlikely, since he no longer led the firm. Still, he would have benefited from any deal that benefited the partners.

'The debt was too staggering'

The video uses an old ad from KB Toys to paint a rosy picture. Puppets sing about a place with all the ""hottest toys.""  (""Hot we got at KB Toys!"") The ad uses a logo with the old ""Kay-Bee"" name, abandoned by the company in 1981. Viewers are left to think that ""staggering debt"" drove a merry, healthy company into ruin.

Toy industry analysts paint a different picture. KB's model worked in the 1980s. But those puppets would have been crying by the late 1990s.

""KB was for many years in a precarious position because of where it was in the industry. It wasn't able to compete on price,"" said Sean McGowan a senior leisure and lifestyle analyst for Needham & Co. ""... If you layer on financial strain, that could push it to the breaking point.""

The financial strain helped lead to the bankruptcy filing.

But even with no debt, it would have been losing money, said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Time to Play magazine.

""Their business model was obsolete,"" he said. ""The world had changed. KB had not changed.""

Small mall toy stores, such as KB's, couldn't carry enough inventory — or stay tidy. But mall rents were high, and leases long, limiting KB's ability to shift to compete with its larger rivals. Meanwhile, Target, Walmart and Toys ""R"" Us could carry far more toys and heavily discount the hottest merchandise.

KB's strategy at the time of the bankruptcy had been selling closeout toys at a discount — read: stuff that was no longer popular — and offering a few hot items at regular prices.

""Knowing all these facts, why is the consumer going to go in there? Is it the higher prices or the old toys?"" Silver said.

KB wasn't the only toy store chain struggling. Time to Play made a list of 100 retailers around in the mid 1980s that no longer exist, Silver said.

What about Bain's role? 

""To me, it's almost irrelevant,"" Silver said. ""You take a business model that doesn't work, it doesn't matter how much money you have, or how much debt you have.""

Closing stores 
The video says, ""By 2004, 365 stores had closed."" 
We asked Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Winning Our Future, for support for the ad's claims. He sent us a single Associated Press article from Jan. 29, 2004.

It reported KB's plans to cut 3,500 jobs and close at least 375 stores after a judge approved the chain's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. 
The article said KB had filed to reorganize in January 2004, blaming ""the Christmas season's sharp price wars and increased competition from mega-retailers like Wal-Mart."" (The story didn't mention the company's debt burden.)

Chris Byrne, a toy industry analyst who wrote an ""obituary"" for KB Toys in 2008, notes that while the company did close 365 stores, it was part of a strategy that included expansion into KB Toy Works and KB Toys Outlet.

What killed the company wasn't so much its debt but poor strategy, he said.

Bain and the new executive team had tried to walk away from KB's closeout-old-toy strategy and compete with Toys ""R"" Us, Walmart and Target by selling new, hot toys at full markup, Byrne said. That resulted in a price war, forcing KB to lower its prices — and eroding margins. So the store tried to carry only a few hot toys, with closeout products in the back of the store.

""The numbers just wouldn't work,"" he said. ""It was volume of toys and price as a function of square feet that, in my mind, really undid KB, not the taking of cash out by Bain. This is not the first time that a corporation has misread the toy industry.""

""If the anti-Mitt Romney people were smarter ... they would be criticizing Bain for rushing into a business that it didn't fully understand, looking for an outcome that probably wasn't likely given the realities of the industry and its context at the time.""

Still, was it a good idea to pull money out of a company struggling to find its place in a tough industry?

Roger Goddu, a former Toys ""R"" Us president who's now in the private equity business, had invested in KB Toys and consulted for two years with new management in 2005.

""In hindsight, it's possible that Bain may have taken a dividend on KB Toys that was too aggressive,"" Goddu said. ""However, the issues at KB Toys were not one-dimensional or purely financial.""

What seemed like a decent idea could have quickly looked foolish, he said.

""In a highly competitive season, which happens in the toy business, the financial health of KB Toys could change quickly, and I suspect that's indeed what happened,"" he said. ""What may have seemed okay could change in a very short period of time, based on other factors influencing KB's operations.""

Another private capital firm, Prentice Capital Management, bought KB Toys out of bankruptcy in 2005, ending Bain's reign. The toy store landed again in bankruptcy court in 2008, its stores gone by 2009.

Our ruling 
The video King of Bain: When Mitt Romney Came to Town, claims that ""Romney and Bain bought the 80-year-old company in 2000, loaded KB Toys with millions in debt, then used the money to repurchase Bain stock. The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed."" The clear implication is that Romney and Bain were responsible for the toy company's demise.

Bain Capital bought KB Toys in 2000, after Romney retired. He wouldn't have been involved in financial decisions, though he would have profited from them. The company did choose to take on debt, buy stock and pay investors a dividend, even as the toy store chain struggled to find its niche in a volatile industry.

But toy industry analysts agree that far more than debt drove KB Toys into bankruptcy court. It was a troubled company before Bain bought it, and Bain wasn't able to fix it. Did more debt hurt? Probably. But to blame Romney and Bain for the chain's downfall is to ignore critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BDBA00>],/factchecks/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/video-blames-bain-capital-demise-kb-toys/

Is Tampa the 'strip club capital of the world'?
","
Fill in the blank: Tampa is known around the world for ______.

Is it professional sports teams? Bern's Steak House? Busch Gardens? Kind of feels like we’re dancing around something.

Wait, that's it -- strip clubs!

Tampa's reputation as a mecca for lusty dance came up in discussion of another vice this week -- gambling. State Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, a Fort Lauderdale Republican, wanted to thwart claims that new destination resort casinos she supports would tarnish Florida’s family-friendly rep.

""People do not go to South Beach to see Mickey Mouse. They just don't,"" she said at the end of debate on her gambling bill Monday. ""They go there for different reasons. We have the strip club capital of the world in Tampa. I hate to say it out loud, but we do. We have not ruined our family-friendly image.""

We've heard the same claim about Tampa for years.

Maybe visitors remember the clubs because a few are on major roads. On Dale Mabry Highway just north of 275, the Mons Venus boasts ""the Most Beautiful Women in the World!"" Across the street, 2001 Odyssey's space ship building hovers over the surroundings.

Rep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, said she doesn't think the title is a fair assessment.

""I think that we are more lenient in some of what we allow,"" she said, ""but I'm not sure we are the capital."" A bit of evidence-based fact-checking seemed in order.

 We started by turning to local officials in Tampa, asking how many strip clubs are in the city. Adult stores and clubs -- or places showing ""specified anatomical areas"" -- must receive special permits for adult use, and pay a business tax, officials said. But the city could not pull a list of clubs of ""special cabarets"" within its limits, citing computer limitations. The city provided a list of businesses that have paid a business tax for ""special cabarets,"" but there were only five businesses listed. That's not a complete picture of the city's strip clubs. Tampa Police didn't have a count either.

We then turned to the business world for an answer, finding Clearwater-based E.D. Publications, a national magazine for the adult entertainment industry. (The ""E.D."" stands for Exotic Dancer.) The group publishes nationwide guides to night clubs, directories of industry vendors and rosters of touring entertainers.

Associate publisher Dave Manack didn't hesitate when asked if Tampa is the strip club capital of the world.

""No,"" he said. ""Not even close. Tampa might not even make the Top 20. For anyone in the industry who knows, it’s really not a top market for strip clubs."" Cities like New York, Las Vegas or Miami would have much more of a claim on the title, he said.

According to the magazine's count, Tampa has 20 night clubs, and the entire Tampa Bay area has 30.

Meanwhile, Miami has 30 in the city and 50 in the Miami/Fort Lauderdale corridor. (City of Miami officials did not return calls.) New York City has 45, not including Long Island or New Jersey. Las Vegas has 40 clubs. (We actually tallied 34 licensed nude and topless clubs in the Las Vegas region from local officials there, so counting clubs is not an exact science.)

Manack ticked off several strikes against Tampa's claim to the title: Tampa doesn't have as many clubs as larger cities, and high-end national chains like Rick's Cabaret and the Spearmint Rhino have taken a pass on Tampa. The city's clubs are spread out, and because it has no tight-knit cluster to form a party circuit, it has trouble marketing itself as a destination for bachelor parties and conventioneers.

Pinellas County shares some of the blame, too, he said. Local rules make it difficult to open high-end clubs near the beaches where dancers can significantly disrobe. ""Literally, you could see more at the beach. It does hurt the clubs there,"" he said.

A spokeswoman with another industry group, the Association of Club Executives, also discounted Tampa's place in the strip club world.

""Manhattan has many more clubs than the Tampa area,"" said spokeswoman Angelina Spencer. ""And if you’re going to talk about the true strip club capital of the world, it would be Las Vegas."" Her association, a political and legal advocacy group for club owners based in Washington, keeps a census that includes 3,829 clubs nationwide, but it will not release numbers by locality.

If Tampa isn't the strip club capital of the world, we wondered if perhaps it might be No. 1 on a per capita basis. That metric would account for Tampa being a smaller city than New York or Miami. But a 2006 economic development study from the Tampa Bay Partnership found the city was merely No. 3 for strip clubs on a per capita basis, ranking behind Las Vegas, and -- even more deflating -- Cincinnati.

Tampa strip club king Joe Redner told us the title was actually bestowed on the city by opponents of strip clubs who were trying to stop clubs from opening. ""It's a misnomer,"" he said. ""That’s what people said when they wanted to get rid of the strip clubs. That's what they labeled us.""

One opponent is David Caton, executive director of the Florida Family Association. He said that when he looked into the issue six or seven years ago, Tampa had more strip clubs than any other city in the country. His count included businesses that show full nudity and nude modeling shops. But that's at odds with what the 2006 study found.

Still, there is a reason Tampa is known nationally for strip clubs, said Manack of E.D. Publications, and that's Joe Redner.

""He is one of the most well-known figures in the history of the adult nightclub industry,"" Manack said. ""He's known as a crusader for personal freedom and freedom of speech, and he’s never been afraid of a fight.""

'King of Bain' video says Boston Herald called Bain profits from KB Toys deal 'disgusting'
","
This is a classic case of attributing a quote to a newspaper that the paper never said.

The 28-minute video ""When Mitt Romney Came to Town"" -- an attack on the Republican presidential candidate’s experiences with the private equity firm Bain Capital -- seeks to paint Romney as a ""predatory corporate raider"" who ""looked for businesses he could pick apart.""

The video, produced by the pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC Winning Our Future, highlighted four examples, including toy store chain KB Toys, from the more than 100 companies that Bain backed over the years Romney led the private equity firm.

About eight minutes into the ""documentary,"" you can hear puppets singing an old jingle (""Hot we got at KB Toys!"") along with this narration:

""Romney and Bain bought the 80-year-old company in 2000, loaded KB Toys with millions in debt, then used the money to repurchase Bain stock. The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed.""

That the chain failed isn't in dispute: KB Toys dissolved in bankruptcy court under different owners in 2008. We’re checking the video’s overall portrayal of the Bain-KB relationship in another item.

Here, we’ll check one specific claim made in the video:

""Mitt Romney and Bain saw a 900 percent return on their investment"" in KB Toys, the video says. ""Romney and Bain’s profits at the expense of 15,000 jobs was described by the Boston Herald as ‘disgusting.’""

In addition, the on-screen visual emphasizes the point, showing the text, ""‘disgusting profits,’ Boston Herald, 11/17/2009.""

That suggests the comment came from a Herald editorial or columnist. So we looked back at the article the video referenced -- a news story headlined, ""KB Toys worker blasts Bain for execs' payout.""

The story is about the campaign of Stephen Pagliuca for the Democratic nomination to fill the U.S. Senate seat made vacant upon the death of Edward Kennedy. Pagliuca is managing director of Bain Capital as well as co-owner of the Boston Celtics. The story quotes a former KB Toys employee attacking Bain for its role in KB Toys’ demise, which the story says resulted in 450 job losses in the Boston area.

Here’s an excerpt:

""‘They were supposed to be coming in to create jobs and help the company grow when they took us over. What happened?'’ asked Mark W. Dean, a 45-year-old Pittsfield resident who has been out of a job since KB Toys went out of business earlier this year. ""It's just another political promise.'

""Pagliuca spokesman Will Keyser said the Celtics co-owner wasn't directly involved in managing the KB Toys takeover, although he did profit from the deal.

""‘He has acknowledged over the course of the campaign that businesses he or his company invested in have failed, but the record of successes he's been involved in far outnumber the failures,’'' said Keyser in a statement. ...

""Dean, who worked at KB Toys for 22 years, is still outraged by the $121 million payout to execs and investors.

""‘That was disgusting. There were a lot of employees who were upset about that,’' Dean said.""

So what we have is a Boston Herald news story quoting an angry former employee -- not an impartial newspaper expressing outrage in its own voice, which is what the voice-over suggests. Nowhere does the ad note that the sentiments were actually expressed by a worker laid off by the company.

Our ruling

The story referenced by the video does contain the ""disgusting"" quote. But in both in the voice-over and the video, the ""King of Bain"" video suggests that the comment was spoken in the editorial voice of the Boston Herald. It wasn't -- it came from a laidoff worker. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC1780>],/factchecks/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/king-bain-video-says-boston-herald-called-bain-pro/

Video says Mitt Romney is planning to quadruple size of his house
","
The 28-minute video ""When Mitt Romney Came to Town"" -- an attack on the Republican presidential candidate’s experiences with the private-equity firm Bain Capital -- claims that Romney is ""tearing down his 3,000-square-foot house to build an 11,000-square-foot house."" 
When the news came out last summer, it became something of a media sensation. Vanity Fair published a list of things that ""could fit inside Mitt Romney’s new house,"" including a Memphis-area Enterprise-Rent-A-Car facility, Jennifer Aniston’s old house and ""the world’s largest whale."" 
But is the tale accurate? 
There’s a bit of disagreement over two issues -- the square footage involved, and whether the project is actually going forward. We’ll tackle those two issues individually. 
The dimensions of the ""tear-down"" project 
The home in question is located in La Jolla, Calif., an affluent oceanfront neighborhood adjoining San Diego, Calif. A recent article by the San Diego Union-Tribune makes the Romneys’ immediate neighborhood sound positively dreamy. ""The area’s winding lanes are lined with Tudor-style mansions, shingled California bungalows and cottages that could have been airlifted from the Cotswolds,"" the article said. (The Union-Tribune noted that Romney trails both President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee in donations from the 92037 ZIP code.) 
Mitt Romney and his wife Ann bought their property, located on what is described as a quiet cul-de-sac, in 2008 for $12 million; two years later, it was assessed at $8.7 million. The Union-Tribune reported that it was built in 1936 and has three bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths. It has a lawn that slopes down to a white sand beach. 
Columbia Journalism Review’s ""The Audit"" blog noted that the vast majority of the property’s value stems from its location, rather than its structure: ""The county assessed the value of Romney’s house at $8.7 million last year,"" The Audit reported. ""Eight million bucks of that value was in the land and just $750,000 was in the 3,000 square-foot house and other improvements."" 
Will Carless, a staff writer with the Voice of San Diego who lives nearby and often surfs in the vicinity, said the expanse of the Romneys’ parcel is notable, with structures placed far enough back not to get hit by even the biggest swells. ""Half his yard is ice plant,"" he said, referring to a non-native species of flora. ""I’ve often looked up and thought it was such big waste of space."" 
Apparently the Romneys did, too. The size of their family was also a factor. A campaign spokesman told the Chicago Tribune that the reason for nearly quadrupling the size was to make room for visits by the couple's five married sons and 16 grandchildren. 
When the Union-Tribune initially reported the proposed renovation on Aug. 21, 2011, it cited a permit application Romney had filed with the City of San Diego to bulldoze the existing, 3,009-square-foot, single-story home and replace it with a new, two-story, 11,062-square-foot structure. 
That’s the source of the information used in the Winning Our Future video. But that description has been contested by Romney himself, in an interview with New Hampshire Union Leader publisher Joseph W. McQuaid on Aug. 29, 2011. 
McQuaid wrote: ""It's not accurate, Romney said, simply. The application he made, two years ago, was to double the living space by turning one story into two. The 'quadrupling'' was a measurement of added nonliving space, including a basement and garage."" 
Granted, even doubling a home’s size is no trivial undertaking. Still, it’s not quadrupling. We wondered if Romney had a point that the description was overblown. So we asked the National Association of Realtors for what the standard practice would be for making such comparisons. 
""There's no national standard for measuring or reporting square footage,"" said Stephanie Singer, a spokeswoman for the real estate trade group. ""Those rules are usually dictated by local zoning ordinances and/or state laws. So determining square footage can vary widely across the country. Some jurisdictions may include rooms like unfinished basements, for example, while others do not."" 
She added that the association’s code of ethics does not directly address the question of disclosures about a home’s square footage. ""The code does stipulate that Realtors shall be honest and truthful in their real estate communications,"" she said. ""In the case of determining square footage, however, Realtors often rely on disclosures and information made by the sellers."" 
Without solid guidance, we think it’s reasonable for the filmmakers to have used the numbers that Romney stipulated on the application itself. That makes this part of the film’s portrayal accurate. 
Is the tear-down going forward? 
The video’s phrasing suggests that the project is proceeding. But that’s not necessarily accurate. 
Dave Schwab, a reporter with the La Jolla Light newspaper, told PolitiFact that he bumped into a T-shirt-and-jean-clad Romney outside his house as Schwab was initially reporting the story of the tear-down last August. Romney was in a rush to leave town, but he told Schwab he would put him in touch with his staff for further information. Schwab recalled the staffer telling him in so many words that Romney is ""running for president, and as soon as that ends, he will revisit the project."" 
Interviews with Schwab and others confirmed that the project has not yet begun. In fact, we have not seen any reports that the project has even received official government approval yet. In a Jan. 2, 2012, article, the Union-Tribune reported that city officials described the plans as being ""on hold."" Other reports suggest that some of the neighbors aren’t wild about a large-scale expansion, though it’s unclear what role, if any, that could play in the approval process. 
One key step in the process involves an environmental review -- and a real estate agent who is representing nearby homes said that’s no piece of cake. 
""That’s nowhere near a rubber stamp of approval,"" said Craig Lotzof of the Lotzof Group. ""Any time you build along the coast -- it doesn’t matter who you are -- you have lots of hoops to go through."" 
So while there’s no sign that the Romneys have backed off their tear-down plan, it also isn’t imminent, and it still faces practical hurdles. So the video’s suggestion that a tear-down is under way or about to start is incorrect. 
Our ruling 
The video used a reasonable figure for dimensions of the ""teardown"" project -- even though the Romney campaign calls it a doubling of living space, the official application uses numbers that would amount to a quadrupling. But the video implied that the project is under way when in fact it’s not imminent. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097101AC0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/video-says-mitt-romney-planning-quadruple-size-his/

Frank Pallone says on Twitter that Republicans have controlled the House for a year, with no new jobs
","
A Democratic congressman from New Jersey took a jab at his Republican colleagues to mark the one-year anniversary of GOP control in the House of Representatives.

In exactly 140 characters, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.) reminded his more than 5,000 Twitter followers last week of what one year of Republican rule has reaped.

""One year today since #GOP took control of the House. One full year of obstruction & no new jobs. #WeCan’tWait. Get back to work no-show GOP!"" Pallone’s Jan. 5 tweet said.

No new jobs, really? Actually, the United States has added more than a million jobs in the last year.

From December 2010 to December 2011, the country gained 1.64 million jobs, according to the most recent federal employment data. And there’s been job creation, month over month, for the past 15 months. We’re not crediting Congressional Republicans with that job growth. As we’ve noted before: there’s a variety of factors that contribute to job creation, and it’s difficult to nail down a specific catalyst.

Still, to say there’s been ""no new jobs"" is clearly wrong.

A written statement from the congressman’s office said, in part, that Pallone ""tweeted a message decrying the consistent Republican inaction in Congress on moving a meaningful agenda to create jobs and address the unemployment crisis that has continued to plague our struggling economy. In the full year since Republicans have taken control of Congress, they have refused to propose any serious jobs plan to get Americans back to work.""

In response to a follow-up question that asked whether Pallone concedes the tweet wasn’t intended to say there’s actually been ""no new jobs,"" the congressman’s spokesman wrote: ""We stand by the statement issued earlier, which clearly states our position.""

""In the full year since Republicans have taken control of Congress, they have refused to propose any serious jobs plan to get Americans back to work,"" the statement said. ""House Republicans have not only failed to make any progress on measures to create jobs, they have voted against Democrats’ job creation proposals 17 times.""

It’s worth noting that PolitiFact National checked a related statement made in Facebook posts that claimed Congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but ""zero on job creation.""

PolitiFact noted that what defines a job creation bill is up for significant debate. Still, they ruled the statement  Pants on Fire largely because the methodology behind the figure also excluded President Barack Obama’s ""American Jobs Act"" as a ""job creation"" bill.

Our ruling

A tweet posted on Pallone’s account on Jan. 5 said it’s ""one year today since #GOP took control of the House"" and ""no new jobs.""

A written statement from Pallone’s office said the tweet decried ""consistent Republican inaction in Congress on moving a meaningful agenda to create jobs."" But ""no new jobs"" isn’t the same as a ""no new jobs agenda"" and the U.S. gained 1.64 million of the former in the last year.

Yes, there’s a limit of 140 characters on Twitter, but there’s still room for accuracy.

We rate this statement False.

Harvard Law professor says early Congress mandated health insurance for seamen and gun ownership for most men
","
One complaint about President Obama’s Affordable Care Act is that it forces uninsured people to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty -- an argument the Supreme Court will consider when it takes up challenges to the health-care law in oral arguments March 27 and 28. If the court upholds the act, critics argue, what's to stop Congress from forcing us to buy, say broccoli.

Harvard Law School professor Einer Elhauge focused on that issue in a Jan. 5, 2012, commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine titled ""The Irrelevance of the Broccoli Argument against the Insurance Mandate.""

Some people, he said, ""argue that the Constitution's framers could not possibly have envisioned a congressional power to force purchases. However, in 1790, the first Congress, which was packed with framers, required all ship owners to provide medical insurance for seamen; in 1798, Congress also required seamen to buy hospital insurance for themselves.

""In 1792, Congress enacted a law mandating that all able-bodied citizens obtain a firearm. This history negates any claim that forcing the purchase of insurance or other products is unprecedented or contrary to any possible intention of the framers.""

We wondered whether those early Congresses -- some of whose members helped draft the Constitution --  did indeed mandate health insurance and gun purchases.

First, we wanted to see whether that first Congress was actually ""packed with framers.""

Fifty-five men are considered the framers. During the first Congress in 1790, only 20 of the 91 senators and representatives were framers. That's not exactly packing them in.

Then we contacted Elhauge about the other parts of his claim.  He referred us to three pieces of legislation.

First was the 1790 law, passed by that first Congress, which applied to any U.S. ship that was at least 150 tons or with a crew of at least 10. It required the master or commander to either have a supply of on-board medicines (with instructions) or provide ""all such advice, medicine, or attendance of physicians, as any of the crew shall stand in need of in case of sickness"" and do it ""without any deduction from the wages of such sick seaman or mariner.""

Sounds like mandatory health care to us.

Then, in 1792, a Congress that included 17 framers passed a law requiring nearly every ""free able-bodied white male citizen"" age 18 to 44, within six months,  ""provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges,"" along with balls and gunpowder. A rifle could be substituted. The purpose was to establish a uniform militia.

Again, that sounds like a mandated purchase to us.

Finally, in 1798, a Congress that included five framers expanded the health coverage mandate, requiring every ship owner or master coming into a port to pay 20 cents per seaman for every month each worker had been employed.

The funds, which could be withheld from the seamen, were used ""to provide for the temporary relief and maintenance of sick or disabled seamen, in the hospitals or other proper institutions now established"" in the port. Leftover funds were used to create hospitals for those mariners.

How did the framers vote on these laws?

There was no roll call for the House and Senate bills requiring health care for seamen. But on the proposal mandating the purchase of musket, firelock or rifle as part of the larger bill to establish a uniform militia, 10 of the 14 framers whose votes were recorded endorsed the measure.

One side note: In November 1792, an attempt was made in the House to reconsider the weapon requirement in the militia bill because some people were complaining that it was too onerous, an argument that echoes complaints from critics of the new health-care law. The proposal was defeated 6 to 50. The vote among framers was 1 to 6.

It should also be noted that the president who signed the first two of these laws was our Founding Father-in-Chief, George Washington.

Elhauge, in an e-mail, stood by his characterization that the first Congress was ""packed"" with framers, saying, ""20 framers sounds pretty packed to me. There were only 55 delegates who attended the Constitutional Convention, so 20 is around 40 percent of all the framers present in that Congress.""

We disagree. The issue is not how many framers went to Congress, but how many members of Congress were framers. And you can't pack a meeting when you only account for 22 percent of the representatives.

More importantly, he said, ""I don’t think anyone objected to any of these laws on constitutional grounds, which presumably someone would have if it was obvious that the original understanding was that such an obligation would be unconstitutional.""

Our ruling

Harvard Law professor Einer Elhauge said that early Congresses, particularly the first Congress, had no qualms about forcing purchases.

Our research confirmed that. Congress required merchant ship owners to purchase medicines or provide health care for their workers. Seamen were later taxed to pay for what might be regarded today as an 18th-century health maintenance organization to provide for hospital care. And most able-bodied men were required to purchase weaponry for their service in the militia.

Although he correctly characterized the laws, to say that the framers of the Constitution ""packed"" that first Congress is too much of a stretch. ""Packed"" means at least a majority; 22 percent is not a majority.

For that reason, we rule his statement Mostly True. 
(An earlier version of this item incorrectly reported that Washington signed all three bills. John Adams, a founding father who was not a framer because he was in Europe when the U.S. Constitution was written, signed the 1798 legislation.)

Super PAC says Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi teamed up to support China's 'one child' policy
","The best offense is a good defense: That seems to be the playbook for the Restore Our Future super PAC.

The game started when Newt Gingrich attacked Mitt Romney for laying off workers while Romney worked at Bain Capital. Then Restore our Future, which is run by Romney supporters, attacked Gingrich for some his previous positions. (Super PACs operate outside of official campaigns and don’t have to follow the same rules.)

""Newt Gingrich’s attacks are called 'foolish,' 'out of bounds,' and 'disgusting.' Newt attacks because he has more baggage than the airlines,"" says the ad, which is running in Florida and South Carolina.

""Newt was fined $300,000 for ethics violations, took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, and co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy.""

""Don’t be fooled by Newt’s desperate attacks,"" the ad concludes.

The ad is right that Gingrich was fined $300,000 for ethics violations. Gingrich also concedes that he advised Freddie Mac. (Bloomberg reported he was paid $1.6 million, but that specific amount rests on unnamed sources.)

Here, we wanted to fact-check whether Gingrich ""co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy.""

For its evidence, the ad points to H.R. 1078, from Feb. 22, 1989. We went to the archives to check on the bill’s details.

The bill in question was called the Global Warming Prevention Act of 1989. It set national goals to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and encouraged international agreements to address global warming. It required the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor global warming and create plans for future action. It supported stricter fuel standards for cars and alternative energy. It also sent money to developing countries to encourage practices that reduce carbon emissions. (See our fact-check of how Gingrich's statements on global warming and cap-and-trade policies have changed over the years.)

The bill had several hearings, but received unfavorable reviews from the George H.W. Bush administration and never became law.

Getting back to the ad’s specific claims, it says that Gingrich co-sponsored the bill with Nancy Pelosi. The bill’s primary sponsor was Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I. It’s true that both Gingrich and Pelosi were co-sponsors. But the bill had 144 co-sponsors, roughly a third of the U.S. House of Representatives. (Gingrich was not speaker at this time; Democrats still held the majority.) Congressional records indicate Pelosi signed onto the bill the day it was introduced, while close to four months passed before Gingrich signed on as a co-sponsor. 

Next, the ad says the bill ""would have given $60 million a year to a UN program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy."" China’s one-child policy generally refers to the government’s efforts to limit population growth to one child per couple. Human rights advocates say the policy has resulted in forced sterilizations and abortions.  

The Restore our Future website says the $60 million went to the United Nations Population Fund and that President Ronald Reagan withheld funds from the program after he determined the program, which supports family planning and contraception, was supporting Chinese actions.

We won’t attempt to relitigate here whether the United Nations Population Fund supported Chinese policy, because we soon found evidence that the bill’s authors did not support those policies.

In the same section that authorizes funding, there’s this stipulation: ""None of the funds authorized by this section may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning.""

Our ruling The ad says that Gingrich ""co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy."" Actually, the bill attempted to address climate change, and a third of House members were co-sponsors. The bill did propose money for the United Nations Population Fund, but it stated specifically that its funding could not be used for ""involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning."" The ad’s claim rests on repeated distortions, so we rate the statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C79C40>],/factchecks/2012/jan/12/restore-our-future/newt-gingrich-nancy-pelosi-china-one-child-policy/

Does Mitt Romney have 15 homes? Woman in Winning Our Future video says he does
","
In the 28-minute video ""When Mitt Romney Came to Town"" -- an attack on the Republican presidential candidate’s experiences with the private-equity firm Bain Capital -- an unidentified former employee of a company bought by Bain recalls the hardship that followed the firm’s acquisition.

""That hurts so bad to leave my home because of one man that's got 15 homes,"" the woman says.

Does Mitt Romney really own 15 homes?

We began by asking Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Winning Our Future, the super PAC behind the ad. Tyler is a former longtime spokesman for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a rival of Romney’s in the GOP presidential primary -- but Winning Our Future is by law unaffiliated with Gingrich’s presidential campaign.

Tyler wrote back to us to say, ""We don’t make any claim about how many homes Mitt Romney owns.""

But at PolitiFact, we do hold politicians -- and super PACs -- accountable for the claims they make to the public. The speaker may have been using a bit of rhetorical excess, but the filmmakers -- in an ad paid for by the Winning Our Future -- chose to air the claim and not dispute it, so we consider it fair game for fact-checking.

We did a nationwide database search of real estate transactions, deeds and tax records. Initially, our search turned up 16 addresses affiliated in recent years with Mitt Romney or his wife, Ann. But further research enabled us to rule out the bulk of these because they either had been sold or because they represented commercial properties rather than residences.

We were left with three properties that appear to be residences currently owned by Mitt Romney or his wife:

• A home in La Jolla, Calif., an affluent ocean front neighborhood adjoining San Diego, Calif. This property, bought by the couple in 2008 for $12 million and assessed at $8.7 million in 2010, has been the subject of news reports that the Romneys plan to tear down the existing house and undertake a significant expansion. We will address that issue in a separate fact check.

• A condominium in Ann Romney’s name in Belmont, Mass., assessed at $773,000.

• A home in Wolfeboro, N.H., on Lake Winnipesaukee, assessed at $4.3 million. Ann Romney is listed as the owner of the 2.3-acre property, purchased for $2.5 million in 1997. A second, 6.3-acre property nearby, also in Ann Romney’s name, appears to be a combination boathouse and stable with living quarters. It is assessed at $2.5 million. News reports indicate that the Romneys upgraded their Wolfeboro property with tennis courts and other amenities.

The Romney campaign did not comment to PolitiFact on the number of houses the family owns.

Our ruling

Winning Our Future released a video in which an interviewee said Mitt Romney owns 15 homes. We find that while the Romney family does own three houses collectively valued at nearly $20 million, but based on the public records we've reviewed they don't own anything close to 15 homes. We rate the statement False. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: The day after this story was posted, a reader pointed us to a Jan. 14, 2012, article in the Toronto Star that noted that the Romney family owns ""a white-sided cottage on a sandy ridge overlooking Lake Huron"" in Grand Bend, Ontario – a property purchased in 1950 by Mitt Romney’s father George that did not come up in our search of United States properties. This does not increase the number of Romney-owned homes close enough to 15 for us to change our rating.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096706900>],/factchecks/2012/jan/12/winning-our-future/does-mitt-romney-have-15-homes-woman-winning-our-f/

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says the state's jobs data is unreliable
","
The November jobs report, released Dec. 15, 2011by the state Department of Workforce Development, brought a mixture of disappointment and surprise.

The disappointment was the news that the state lost 11,700 jobs in November, the worst monthly decline in more than two years. The surprise was how Gov. Scott Walker’s response: He attacked the figures as unreliable.

Of course, this is the same monthly data Walker heralded in the first six months of his administration, when it showed job increases.

In his campaign for governor, Walker’s top promise was that the state would add 250,000 private sector jobs by the end of his four year term. (We track progress each month on the Walk-O-Meter. The December numbers are due to be released January 26, 2012.)

So, has Walker changed his view on the accuracy of the numbers?

Time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter and with it our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change in position is good politics or good policy, but simply whether a political figure has changed his or her position.

The numbers are compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and released by the state agency. They are based on a survey of a sample of state employers and are routinely expressed as estimates. Each month, they are released as a preliminary number that is then ""finalized"" the next month.

The state jobs tally started out in an encouraging fashion for Walker, beginning with the report on January 2011 job growth, issued on March 9, 2011, that showed the state added a total of 11,300 jobs that month.

Walker took credit.

""The number one goal of my Administration is to get government out of the way so that the private sector can create 250,000 jobs by 2015,"" Walker said. ""Adding over 10,000 private sector jobs in January shows that Wisconsin is on the right track toward fulfilling that important goal.""

Manny Perez, then secretary of the Department of Workforce Development, said: ""The numbers further reaffirm the importance of Gov. Walker’s approach to support policies that not only allow the private sector to create jobs in Wisconsin, but also accelerate job growth in our state.""

Perez urged job seekers to polish their resumes so they wouldn’t be left out in the hiring.

""The economy is on the mend,"" he said.

So, the administration clearly viewed the numbers as reliable and meaningful.

Five months of job increases followed, concluding with a report for June, issued July 21, 2011, that showed another sharp increase, this time of 12,900 jobs. It was the largest single month increase in jobs since 2003.

Instead of issuing a news release from the department secretary, Walker came to Milwaukee to highlight the release of the June report. The state was in the midst of unprecedented state Senate recall elections that could have cost Walker’s party control of that chamber.

""To have 9,500 net new jobs in the state at a time when the country saw just 18,000 net new jobs all across the country is incredibly good news, and it's driven by the rebirth of tourism in the state,"" Walker said.

Workforce Development Secretary Scott Baumbach -- Walker’s second appointee to that post -- added that job-seekers and employers were ""reaping the economic benefits of the business-friendly environment that Gov. Walker is advancing.""

At the time the June jobs report was issued, the reports had shown a net increase of 39,300 private-sector jobs.

Then things changed.

The July report said the state lost 12,500 jobs -- wiping out much of the gain reported for the previous month. In the months that followed, the administration reported small monthly job losses.

Then on Dec. 15, 2011, the state report said Wisconsin lost 11,700 jobs in November, the steepest decline in more than two years.

The administration didn’t comment about the factors that contributed to the jobs loss. Instead, for the first time, Walker’s team criticized the quality of the data gathered by the feds.

Workforce development secretary Reggie Newson (Walker’s third appointee to the position) noted that the final October numbers had been revised from a loss of 9,300 jobs to a loss of only 1,400 -- a swing of 7,900. That monthly correction in the data was the largest this year -- an 85 percent change, compared an average correction of about 23 percent for the previous seven months of the year.

We previously rated a statement by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch that the monthly jobs numbers have a ""margin of error of 75%"" and were consistently ""way off"" Half True. Although there was a significant correction to the October data, there has been no change in the way the data is collected. The approach state has not changed since Walker took office.

What’s the bottom line?

Walker took credit for gains in state jobs for six months of 2011, as the monthly reports showed steady progress toward his promise of creating 250,000 jobs. In the second half of the year, the numbers began to decline and the governor’s approach shifted, with Walker in December criticizing the quality of the data.

But nothing had changed in how the data was collected.

Only Walker’s pronouncements on their accuracy. We rate this a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097187600>],/factchecks/2012/jan/12/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-states-jobs-data-u/

Gay marriage supported by majority of Americans and majority of New Jersey residents, assemblyman says
","
Gov. Chris Christie will need some convincing, but Democratic legislators claim they have public opinion on their side as they attempt to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey.

""We also must recognize that society is changing for the better, making (Assembly bill) A-1 timely,"" state Assemblyman Reed Gusciora (D-Mercer) said in a Jan. 9 news release. ""Opinion polls show that the majority of Americans, and the majority of New Jerseyans, favor marriage equality for same sex couples.""

Between four national polls and two Rutgers University polls, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Gusciora has the numbers to back up his argument. But two other national polls have indicated there are slightly more opponents than supporters.

""It’s not a solid majority yet, but many polls are showing a majority,"" said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute. ""(Gusciora is) probably on safe ground with that claim, certainly here in the state of New Jersey.""  

First, let’s talk about the state polls.

In each of two polls conducted last year by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, 52 percent of New Jersey residents said same-sex marriage should be legal in the Garden State. The most recent poll, which was done in October, found that 39 percent oppose legalizing same-sex marriage.

For the most recent poll, the margin of error attributed to those percentages was 4.7 percent.

""I think it is a fair statement,"" said David Redlawsk, a political science professor and director of the Rutgers-Eagleton poll, referring to Gusciora’s claim. ""Nationally, we’re seeing the same general trend.""

Now, let’s turn to how Americans across the nation view same-sex marriage.

Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, pointed to a Gallup poll conducted in May, when 53 percent of respondents said same-sex marriage should be legal. That figure marked a nine percent increase over a 2010 poll asking the same question. The margin of error for the May poll was 4 percent.

We also found three other national polls that demonstrate similar support for same-sex marriage.

Two ABC News/Washington Post polls conducted last year put the level of support at slightly more than 50 percent. A CNN poll done in April also found that 51 percent of respondents support legalizing same-sex marriage. The margins of error for those polls was 3.5 percent.

However, when you factor in the margins of error, a majority of Americans might only support same-sex marriage based on one of those four national polls.

Also, two other national polls conducted last year suggest that opposition to same-sex marriage remains strong.

A Pew Research Center poll done in late February and early March found that 45 percent of respondents support same-sex marriage and 46 percent oppose it. That poll had a margin of error of 3 percent.

In July, a Quinnipiac University poll determined that 48 percent of registered voters would oppose a state law legalizing same-sex marriage and 46 percent would support one. The margin of error was 2 percent.

Still, both of those polls demonstrate that public support for same-sex marriage has increased. Compared to a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in April 2009, the percentage of respondents who support a state law allowing same-sex marriage has increased by 8 percent.

Hester defended Gusciora’s claim in an email: ""Polls have shown support for marriage equality. Assemblyman Gusciora accurately and responsibly cited those polls. His statement was true.""

Our ruling

Gusciora claimed, ""Opinion polls show that the majority of Americans, and the majority of New Jerseyans, favor marriage equality for same sex couples.""

Two state polls and four national polls show that slightly more than 50 percent of respondents support legalizing same-sex marriage. But the margins of error among those national polls could mean greater support than opposition in only one of those polls.

Two other national polls also suggest a closely divided electorate, but still show that public support for same-sex marriage has increased in recent years.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Radar guns and cameras don’t stop accidents, huh?
","Last week in Harrisburg, the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia met with members of the legislature to lobby for what it considers safer streets after the April hit-and-run death of cyclist Jamal Morris. The group wants an extension of the state’s red light camera program, a pilot program for speeding cameras on Roosevelt Boulevard and the use of radar detection by police.    Before the meetings in Harrisburg happened, Penn Live published an editorial authored by Tom McCarey criticizing the Bicycle Coalition’s desire to push for radar use, the red light camera program and the speeding camera program. McCarey is a member of the drivers’ advocacy group the National Motorists Association and lives on the Main Line. He wrote, ""Never mind that no red light camera, no speed camera, nor any radar gun has ever stopped one accident from occurring."" The editorial itself felt a little out of place. A member of one lobbying organization was writing critically about an opposing lobbying organization. But was McCarey’s claim that these types of technology have prevented a single accident from occurring legitimate? The short answer is no. While the exact pros and cons of these technologies are up for debate, multiple studies show they have prevented accidents in numerous cities and certainly at least one accident. McCarey said he got his information from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statistics and did not respond when asked to provide the specific data. The answer to whether such data to backup his claim exists is also no.   ""NHTSA has never made this untrue statement at all,"" said NHTSA spokesman Jose Ucles. ""Neither does it agree with it."" The organization has released a compendium of 13 studies looking at red light cameras and speed cameras, among other things. The studies the NHTSA regarded as the best showed a 20-to-25 percent reduction in injury crashes at sites with speed cameras. For red light camera studies, which the NHTSA did not regard as highly as the speed camera studies, there were reductions in overall crashes from 9-to-18 percent and 21-to-51 percent for injury crashes. Dominique Lord, a professor at Texas A&M, was commissioned by the Chicago Tribune to study the efficacy of red light cameras installed throughout the city. The study found no significant reduction in crashes at intersections where five or fewer crashes had been occurring annually but at intersections with five or more annual crashes there had been a reduction. It found certain types of injury accidents, such as right angle T-bone crashes, had declined while rear-end injury crashes had increased.    ""Has it at least saved one crash, a red light camera?"" Lord said. ""There’s no doubt about that."" Lord added red light cameras should only one tool among many that can be utilized to cut down on accidents. ""Red light cameras and speed cameras change the behavior of people,"" he said. ""By changing the behavior of people you (decrease) risk.""    Our ruling  Tom McCarey wrote in a Penn Live editorial the technologies being pushed for by the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia -- an extension of the state’s red light camera program, a pilot program for speeding cameras on Roosevelt Boulevard and the use of radar detection by police -- would make highways more dangerous and not stop a cyclist from being hit. At one point, he wrote Never mind that no red light camera, no speed camera, nor any radar gun has ever stopped one accident from occurring.""   But multiple studies have shown crashes have been reduced in areas where red light cameras and speed cameras are used.

GOP campaign mail severely distorts complex issue of transgender bathroom access
","Several Republican state Assembly hopefuls are using campaign mail pieces to try and tie Nevada lawmakers to the debate surrounding bathroom access for transgender students. One such ad by Assembly candidate Steve Sanson depicts Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson looming over a bathroom stall, with overlaid text reading: ""Now teenaged boys can shower with your teenaged girls in public school locker rooms."" Another from Assembly hopeful Blaine Jones depicts his primary opponent, Assemblyman Derek Armstrong, peering over a bathroom stall and implying that the Republican supports transgender bathrooms. Given recent headlines over bathroom access for transgender students, we thought it was worth checking into how Nevada deals with the issue. Legislative flashback Nevada lawmakers did tackle a bill in 2015 that would have required all students to use the bathroom that corresponded to their biological sex. After heated debate, Assembly members voted down the proposed bill with five Republicans (including freshman Armstrong, another mailer target) breaking rank and joining Democrats to defeat the measure. But the mailers themselves appear to be referring to another bill, SB504, which established a statewide anti-bullying program and was approved by all but a handful of legislators. The vast majority of that specific bill dealt with setting up a new statewide anti-bullying office and setting stricter requirements for reporting and investigating bullying. Several activists seized upon a 2015 legislative briefing released by the conservative Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom, which interpreted the new law as creating a ""new right"" for transgender students to access the bathrooms and shower rooms of their choice. In an endorsement letter, Assemblyman Ira Hansen said the new law ""mandated every school district in Nevada make all facilities ‘gender neutral.’"" But the law itself isn’t that clear-cut. A tangled legal web A mandate on bathroom access for transgender students is part of an ongoing legal debate that still doesn’t have a clear answer. UNLV law professor Ann McGinley says several federal courts have issued rulings indicating that transgender students fit under Title IX protections for gender equality, but any finality on a federal level will likely come from a future Supreme Court decision. McGinley says the question then falls to the state level, where the law is unclear. There’s nothing in state law that specifically mandates transgender students have the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with, but Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval’s office says the issue is essentially settled through the state’s broadly focused anti-discrimination laws. Lawmakers in 2011 expanded the state’s anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression. Because these ""public accommodation"" laws cover ""place(s) of education,"" presumably school districts can’t segregate transgender students from using the gendered bathroom they identify with without violating state law. ""No change in policy is necessary and the Obama administration has no need to have concerns about Nevada schools,"" Sandoval spokeswoman Mari St. Martin said in an earlier statement. So how does the anti-bullying bill — SB504 — fit into the debate? Nestled in the bill are several new definitions of bullying, including ""blocking access to any property or facility of a school."" The Alliance Defending Freedom brief uses that definition, along with the addition of gender identity or expression into classes protected by the legislation, to argue that it creates a ""new right"" for transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. Sanson, one of the ""insurgent Republicans"" running against Anderson, referred to the ADF brief in several blog posts on his website, which also included letters from Assembly members Hansen and Shelly Shelton. ""President Obama recently federally mandated all locker-rooms and bathrooms be designated ‘gender-neutral’, but it was already Nevada law because of Anderson’s leadership,"" Hansen said in a letter. Anderson called the brief ""irrelevant"" in an interview with PolitiFact. He said the legislation itself was designed to create general anti-bullying guidelines and that the bill’s language was left intentionally vague. ""The goal was to create a vague definition so that school districts could apply their own policies,"" he said. ""To spin it in any other way is frankly disingenuous,"" he added. McGinley says defining the law as creating a ""new right"" is probably too broad, but it’s possible the new anti-bullying legislation creates additional legal standing in the event a school district is challenged in court over their policies around transgender students. That’s similar to how the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union plans to tackle the issue, according to the group’s policy director Holly Welborn. She said the ACLU has received several complaints related to transgender student bathroom access, but any lawsuit brought by the civil liberties group would likely stand on the already-existing public accommodation laws. ""It (SB504) certainly isn’t creating a new right, it’s a right that already exists,"" Welborn said. Different statewide standards Transgender student access to bathrooms and other school facilities is largely dependent on individual policies of school districts. The Obama administration used transgender student policy of the Washoe County School District in Reno as an example of best practices for other school districts to follow. The district approved regulations last year allowing students to ""use facilities that correspond to their gender identity as expressed by the student and asserted at school"" including access to locker rooms. It’s a different case in the rural Elko County, where in 2015 one transgender student’s request to use male-designated school facilities was rejected by the local school board (requiring the student to use unisex bathrooms instead). Elko school district officials told a local newspaper that they interpreted the Obama administration’s letter as a ""political statement"" and would continue to make decisions on transgender student access on a case-by-case basis. But the vast majority of Nevada’s students are in the Clark County School District (in Las Vegas), which has yet to approve district-wide regulations for transgender students. The district circulated an internal draft in 2014 that would have set a more defined policy for transgender student equal access, but it was never made public. Despite a board member’s 2015 request for clarity, the district has yet to approve any policy changes for transgender student access, instead making decisions on a case-by-case basis. District spokeswoman Michelle Booth said efforts to adopt a policy are ongoing. ""The Clark County School District has received the ‘Letter to Colleagues’ from the U.S. Department of Education and is currently studying the details closely to determine what if any changes we will have to make to remain in compliance with federal guidelines,"" she said in an emailed statement. McGinley said the uncertainty on federal and state levels means there’s no clear evidence of a mandate on allowing transgender students the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. ""Each county and school district are making these determinations based on how much risk they’re willing to take,"" she said. Our ruling Several Republican Assembly candidates are claiming that legislators are forcing ""boys to shower with girls."" Putting aside questions about the nature of gender, these ads just aren’t accurate. They refer to a piece of legislation that mostly deals with creating new anti-bullying policies. There is no clearly defined mandate in Nevada state law regarding transgender student access to bathrooms and locker rooms, and school districts around the state have very different standards county-to-county. Given the likelihood of future litigation on both a federal and state level, it’s misleading to connect a vaguely worded anti-bullying bill to the much more complicated area of transgender student rights. We rate these ads False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b783899-a799-4b5e-be8a-eae37ab688f1",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC3300>],/factchecks/2016/jun/13/nevada-assembly-republican-candidates/gop-campaign-mail-severely-distorts-complex-issue-/

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton wants to let 500 percent more Syrians into the U.S.
","The mass shooting inside an Orlando nightclub is even more evidence that the United States needs to restrict the number of foreigners coming into the country, Republican Donald Trump argued in a speech attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton. Refugees are potential terrorists, Trump said, and when it comes to refugees, ""our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions, without a screening plan, including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. Tell me. Tell me, how stupid is that?"" Trump’s claim that there is no screening plan rates False; there is a screening plan. But we also wondered if Clinton wanted to bring in that many more Syrian refugees from Syria, a country devastated by warring factions. When the refugees began making their way to Germany and other European countries, with many men, women and children dying in the process, there was concern that the United States was not helping European countries deal with the influx. During a Sept. 20 appearance on CBS' Face the Nation, Clinton was asked if President Barack Obama's plan to increase the number allowed into the United States to 10,000 was enough. (The United States had accepted about 2,000 in 2015.) ""Look, we’re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more, and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in,"" Clinton said. Clinton said she would be ""looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women."" A jump to 65,000 would be a 550 percent increase. To put this in context, Clinton has also made it clear that, under her administration, the United States wouldn't blindly accept anyone from Syria. The Clinton campaign pointed us to a Dec. 15, 2015, speech she made at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis. ""We also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,"" Clinton said. "" Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it’s a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months."" ""It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones,"" she said. ""So after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing Syria."" Our ruling Trump said Clinton ""plans to massively increase admissions (of Middle East refugees) … including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country."" Clinton has, in fact, said that in response to the refugee crisis she would raise Obama's limit of 10,000 to 65,000. That's 550 percent more, a bit higher than what Trump said. But Clinton has also made it clear that they would have to first be vetted by a screening process, an important detail in the context of Trump's larger point that would-be terrorists have to be kept out of the country.

Hillary Clinton criticizes Fla. gun laws after Orlando mass shooting
","Hillary Clinton and Democrats are talking about measures to restrict purchases of firearms in some instances after Sunday’s deadly attack at an Orlando nightclub. During an interview on CNN’s New Day, Clinton singled out Florida’s law needs to be changed. As of this writing, 49 people have been declared dead in the shooting rampage. Investigators say the attack was carried out by by 29-year-old Omar Mateen, a U.S. born citizen. ""Florida doesn't regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines,"" Clinton said. ""It doesn't require a permit to purchase a gun. It doesn't require any registration, whatsoever."" Clinton made several claims about Florida’s law. We'll go through them one by one. Mateen used a .223-caliber assault rifle described as an AR type rifle and a 9mm semi-automatic pistol in the attacks. Both were purchased legally in recent days.  Gun laws in Florida Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin led us to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence for evidence of this claim, which focuses on providing legal expertise in support of gun laws that reduce the number of gun-related deaths. The website makes the same assertion Clinton made on CNN: Florida doesn’t regulate assault rifles, .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines, nor does it require the registration of firearms. The definition of assault rifle varies, but it most often describes military-like rifles or semi-automatic rifles that may include detachable magazines. (The AR type weapon Mateen used certainly would qualify.) .50-caliber rifles can shoot from long distances with accuracy (they use wider ammunition) and large-capacity ammunition magazines allow the shooter to fire multiple rounds before having to reload. Mateen did not have a .50-caliber rifle. Clinton is correct that Florida places no additional regulations on owning those types of firearms or accessories.  As far as registration, Florida law prohibits keeping a registry of legally bought firearms. ""A list, record, or registry of legally owned firearms or law-abiding firearm owners is not a law enforcement tool and can become an instrument for profiling, harassing, or abusing law-abiding citizens based on their choice to own a firearm and exercise their Second Amendment …"" chapter 790.355 reads. Florida does require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, but those records are sealed from the public. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research said that Clinton’s claim is ""true on all fronts."" Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University agreed that Clinton is correctly reciting specific parts of Florida gun law. But Kleck cautioned about singling out Florida. The state, he said, is ""essentially identical to most other states with regard to these kinds of gun controls."" Kleck said that only seven states including Washington D.C. ban some type of assault weapons, while the other 43 regulate them the same as other types of guns. He also said only two other states and Washington D.C. prohibit .50 caliber firearms and eight states ban large capacity magazines. ""For good or ill, (Florida) is squarely in the American mainstream regarding the gun controls that Clinton mentions,"" Kleck said. ""Consequently one cannot legitimately argue (or hint) that this mass shooting was especially likely to occur in Florida because it lacked these controls."" Our ruling Clinton said that Florida’s gun laws don’t regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines or require a permit or registration to purchase a gun. There’s no denying that Clinton described Florida law correctly. But an expert cautions that Florida law isn’t all that different than many places across the country.

Wrong: Donald Trump says there's 'no system to vet' refugees
","Blaming the Orlando massacre on the country’s ""failed immigration system,"" Donald Trump equated refugee admission to a ""better, bigger, more horrible version of the legendary Trojan horse."" Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, vowed to suspend immigration from ""areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States"" in his speech on terrorism and immigration. ""Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children,"" Trump said June 13. ""The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen."" We examinef the number of refugees Clinton wants to admit in a separate fact-check, but here we’ll look at whether there really is ""no system to vet them."" This is an exaggeration, and one we’ve heard before. While Trump has a point that the system isn’t foolproof, there is a system. It has been in place for over three decades and was retooled after 9/11. The system (which exists) and how it works The vetting begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee, which determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This alone can take four to 10 months. If the UNHCR refers refugees to the United States, they then face scrutiny from federal intelligence and security agencies. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through federal terrorism and criminal databases. Meanwhile, the refugees are interviewed by Department of Homeland Security officials. If approved, they then undergo a medical screening, a match with sponsor agencies, ""cultural orientation"" classes and one final security clearance. Syrian refugees in particular must clear one additional hurdle. Their documents are placed under extra scrutiny and cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. The process typically takes one to two years or longer and happens before a refuge ever steps onto American soil. Ultimately, says the State Department, about half are approved, and there’s no real precedent of a terrorist slipping in through the vetting system. Not a perfect system There’s no question that there are challenges to screening refugees from conflict zones like Syria. Intelligence and national security officials have noted the paucity of data. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October 2015 that the intelligence in Syria is ""not as rich as we would like it to be,"" while FBI Director James Comey said there are ""gaps"" in data availability. The use of fake documents and passports are also causes for concern, according to Jessica Vaughan of the ""low immigration, pro-immigrant"" Center for Immigration Studies. But, again, this is not the same thing as ""no system to vet"" at all. ""No system is foolproof,"" said David Martin, a University of Virginia professor who’s previously held posts at DHS and the State Department. ""If we really wanted a foolproof system, we would shut down immigration entirely."" (This seems to be what Trump is advocating.) According to the State Department, Syrians tend to have more identity documents than other refugee groups around the world, and the reasons they give for missing documents — for example, a bomb dropping on their house — can be verified. And contrary to what Trump suggests, Clinton has spoken about stepping up the rigor of the vetting and proposed specific solutions. ""Congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough possible process,"" she said in a December 2015 statement. Finally, we should note that refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any traveler category to the United States. So it ""makes no operational sense"" for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program, Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University, told us previously. ""Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?"" Speckhard said. Our ruling Trump said there is ""no system to vet"" refugees from the Middle East. While there are concerns about information gaps, a system does exist and has existed since 1980. It involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies as well as the United Nations. Refugee vetting typically takes one to two years and includes numerous rounds of security checks.

Donald Trump correct that U.S. gives 100,000 green cards a year to migrants from Middle East
","In a statement after an attack on an LGBT nightclub in Orlando that killed at least 50 people, Donald Trump warned that such attacks would continue as long as the United States opens its doors to Muslim immigrants. ""We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year,"" Trump said in the June 12, 2016, statement. ""Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States. Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term – and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing."" In this fact-check, we’ll look at Trump’s assertion that ""we admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year."" (We’ll leave it to readers to decide whether that’s too many, too little, or just right.) We will start by noting that ""lifetime migrants"" is not a commonly used term in the immigration-policy world, and the Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. However, after checking with experts, we feel confident that Trump meant to describe people who are given permanent residency. Specifically, he was referring to the number of people each year who receive ""green cards"" -- the documentation for permanent residency in the United States, which enables the bearer to apply to become citizens within three to five years. The Department of Homeland Security tallies these numbers by publishing annual statistics for ""persons obtaining lawful permanent resident status"" by country of birth. (By and large, refugees are included in this total, though they account for just a fraction of all green-card recipients.) The trickiest part of checking Trump’s math has to do with what should be considered ""the Middle East."" Trump is correct if you use a somewhat expansive definition of the ""Middle East."" Here’s a rundown by countries and number of new green cards issued in 2014, the most recent year for which full data is available. We’ve listed them in descending order by number of green cards issued.   Country New green cards in 2014 Iraq 19,153 Pakistan 18,612 Iran 11,615 Egypt 11,477 Afghanistan 10,527 Jordan 5,187 Turkey 3,834 Israel 3,805 Morocco 3,605 Syria 3,540 Yemen 3,492 Lebanon 3,245 Saudi Arabia 1,696 Algeria 1,669 Kuwait 1,057 United Arab Emirates 1,039 Libya 524 Tunisia 429 Qatar 202 Bahrain 122 Oman 90 Total 104,920 That total represents slightly under 10 percent of green card recipients from around the world, which amounted to 1,016,518 in 2014. Some may quibble with the inclusion of certain countries on this list, since they arguably lie outside a strict definition of the Middle East. These include countries that might be considered to be part of central Asia (Afghanistan and Pakistan), countries that might be considered to be in north Africa (Algeria, Libya and Tunisia), and one country that is partially in Europe (Turkey). If you subtract the green cards from each of those countries, the number falls to just under 70,000, which would make Trump’s claim somewhat exaggerated. However, experts we checked with don’t think it’s unreasonable in common conversation to include such countries as Afghanistan, Libya and Pakistan in the Middle East, particularly given how intertwined those countries have become with the United States’ Middle East policy in recent years. Given Trump’s focus on support for Islamic extremism, it’s also worth a reminder that country of origin is not the same thing as religious affiliation. ""The Census Bureau does not gather data by religious affiliation, so it would not be possible to disaggregate minority-religion populations from this region, such as Coptic Christians and Chaldean Christians, that have sought and received refugee status,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute. And many of the immigrants from Israel -- another country included in the chart above -- are Jewish. And a final technical note: While Trump used the word ""admit"" in reference to migrants getting green cards, Mittelstadt noted that slightly more than half of all green cards issued annually are given to people who are already in the United States, but who have a different immigration status. So the connection between obtaining a green card and someone’s entry into the United States can be separated in time. Our ruling Trump said, ""We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year."" A strict definition of the region produces a number closer to 70,000. But adding in other countries that most Americans would consider to be in the Middle East, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey, brings the number to 100,000 or more. It’s also worth remembering that not all immigrants from these countries are Muslim. All in all, the statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43e8d534-e493-4d5e-b38a-f156a7c0fc7a",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A667C0>],/factchecks/2016/jun/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-us-gives-100000-green-cards-y/

Pro-Clinton Super PAC ad says Trump 'mocked' disabled reporter; evidence supports claim

","A super PAC backing Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton has launched a $20 million campaign that accuses her Republican opponent Donald Trump of ""mocking"" a disabled news reporter. The emotionally charged ad focuses on an Ohio couple, Chris and Lauren Glaros, talking about raising their daughter, Grace, who was born with a spinal defect. ""When I saw Donald Trump mock a disabled person, I was just shocked,"" Lauren Glaros says in the ad, produced by Priorities USA Action. Last fall, Trump was broadly criticized for appearing to physically mimic New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24. Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints. The ad shows a photo of the reporter, whose right hand is sharply angled at the wrist. The ad cuts to a video clip of Trump at the rally. ""You gotta see this guy,"" says Trump, wildly flailing his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouts in a weird, agitated voice: ""Ahh, I don’t know what I said! Ahh, I don’t remember!"" ""When I saw Donald Trump mock somebody with a disability, it showed me his soul, it showed me his heart. And I didn’t like what I saw,"" the father, Chris Glaros, adds. The TV ad (which you can watch in full at the bottom of this fact-check) is airing in seven crucial swing states -- Colorado, Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire and Iowa. PolitiFact is fact-checking the obvious question: Did Trump mock the man’s disability? But first, we want to separate Trump’s parody of the reporter from the reality. Kovaleski is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms around. (Watch a video of Kovaleski talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.) Trump tweeted about the ad on Sunday: ""Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!"" The Trump campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. PolitiFact also contacted Kovaleski, who declined comment. Here’s why Trump singled out this reporter. At the time of the November rally, Trump was taking heat for his widely debunked claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as  ""thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. To defend this account, Trump seized on a Sept. 18, 2001, story by Kovaleski -- who then worked for the Washington Post -- and another reporter. Near the bottom of the story, they wrote that ""law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river."" But the reporters couldn’t verify the celebrations actually occurred. ""I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,"" Kovaleski later told the Washington Post Fact Checker. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that ""a number of people"" -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating. This why Trump, believing that Kovaleski was backing off the 2001 story, wailed in his impersonation, ""Ahh, I don’t remember!"" Trump’s behavior sparked public outrage. The New York Times rebuked Trump in a statement: ""We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters."" Colleagues and friends defended Kovaleski. ""@sergenyt is one of the best reporters — and best people — I know. This is despicable,"" ESPN reporter and author Don Van Natta Jr. wrote on Twitter. People who share Kovaleski’s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag ""AMCStrong."" Trump denied making fun off the reporter’s disability. ""I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago,"" he said in a statement at the time. ""I don't buy that. (Trump) clearly was mocking his disability,"" said Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, when we asked her about it. ""That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn't use that voice or wave his arms like that."" Reiskin stressed that she was just giving her view of how Trump acted, because her nonprofit group can't endorse or oppose any candidate. Reiskin said Trump’s rally display ""portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not competent, which is very destructive"" to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added. U.S. Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, recently withdrew his support for Trump after Trump said an Indiana-born federal judge of Mexican descent was incapable of fairly presiding over a class-action lawsuit against Trump and his defunct Trump University. But Kirk also referred to Trump’s comments. Kirk suffered a serious stroke in 2012 and uses a wheelchair after years of rehabilitation. ""Donald Trump’s latest statements, in context with past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that I cannot and will not support my party’s nominee for president,"" Kirk said. During the rally backlash, Trump insisted in a statement he couldn’t have known the man was disabled because ""I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. … Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him."" Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the Washington Post he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition. ""Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,"" Kovaleski told the New York Times. In fact, Kovelski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the ""inaugural voyage"" of the Trump Shuttle airline. ""Flying out of La Guardia, we spent a big chunk of the day flying up and down the east coast with Trump chatting with me and the others on the plane,"" Kovaleski told the Daily News. He added that a furious Trump called the next day and screamed at him"" because Kovaleski had reported that the Trump Shuttle took off late on its debut flight after Trump had run many ads saying it would be the most on-time airline in the industry. The Daily News story looking back at Kovaleski’s history with Trump included an archived image of his bylined Trump Shuttle story (""Wings of Don"") with a photograph of Trump cutting a ceremonial ribbon. In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovelski at the rally, calling him a ""nice reporter."" He also described him as ""the poor guy"" and indicated he knew Kovaleski’s appearance (""you gotta see this guy"") before launching into his imitation. Still, the candidate repeatedly denied knowing the reporter. ""Serge Kovaleski must think a lot of himself if he thinks I remember him from decades ago -- if I ever met him at all, which I doubt. He should stop using his disability to grandstand and get back to reporting for a paper that is rapidly going down the tubes,"" Trump said, getting in a shot at the New York Times, in a statement. Our ruling In an ad from Priorities USA Action, parents of a disabled child said Trump ""mocked"" a disabled reporter at a campaign rally. Trump did mimic the man’s oddly angled right hand while flailing his arms and shouting in a strange voice. Disabled people and advocates said the candidate clearly was mocking him. Trump’s excuses for his comments are at odds with the evidence. Trump said he didn’t remember the man so he couldn’t know he was handicapped. But Kovaleski said he and Trump knew each other well because the reporter regularly covered the New York businessman for years. Archived reports support that. Trump also talked about the reporter with familiarity as a ""nice reporter"" and a ""poor guy"" who ""you gotta see."" Trump’s denials that he did not mock -- or even know -- the disabled reporter don’t add up. We rate the ad’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b6a6f3b2-11b8-443e-a384-f9791cd9b28b ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DB6E00>],/factchecks/2016/jun/13/priorities-usa-action/pro-clinton-super-pac-ad-trump-mocked-disabled-r/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Dave Brat']","
Dave Brat: U.S labor participation rate is lowest since `70s
","Rep. Dave Brat says the U.S. economy is stuck in the doldrums. ""The labor force participation rate - the share of the potential workforce that is actually working or looking for work - currently stands below 63%, the lowest level since the 1970s,"" Brat, R-7th, said in a May 24 Facebook post. No doubt, the economy has had a choppy recovery from the Great Recession. But we wondered if it’s true that the percentage of potential workers who are employed or trying to find a job is at the lowest level in 40 years. Ivan Schwartz, spokesman for Brat’s re-election campaign, backed his statement by pointing to monthly tallies by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. They show that in April, the latest month for which figures were available when Brat made his comment, 62.8 percent of people who were 16 or older either were employed or actively seeking work. We should start by noting that 62.8 percent was not the lowest proportion of people in the labor force during the past several decades. The bottom came in September 2015, when the rate was 62.4 percent. You’d have to go back to October 1977 to find a time when the rate sank to that level. Still, Brat has a point in that the share of potential workers has been hovering near its lowest point in several decades. From the late 1970s up until the Great Recession, the percentage of people in the labor force for the most part was on the upswing. But in 2007, the year the recession started, the proportion of people in the labor force started to fall from 66.3 percent and continued that decline after the official end of the recession in June 2009. The drop continued until the September 2015 low point. Daniel Culbertson, an economist at the Indeed.com hiring website, told us that the economic downturn and simple demographics are the commonly cited cause of the drop in the percentage of people who are in the labor force. ""Those that cite a deteriorating economy believe more workers are becoming discouraged and leaving the labor force altogether due to lack of opportunity, low wages, etc.,"" Culbertson wrote in an email. ""Others opine that the majority of the decline can be explained by aging baby boomers leaving the labor force as they begin to retire en masse. How much of the LFPR (labor force participation rate) decline is attributable to each is a common topic of debate among economists."" Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, attributes at least half of the drop to baby boomer retirements. That would have happened even if the recession never had occurred and the economy kept growing at the pace it had been in 2007, Burtless told us in an interview. Other factors are at play, Burtless said. Younger people who could enter the workforce are staying in college longer, he said. Some of the dropoff, particularly among potential workers ages 25 to 54 not in the labor force, remains a mystery, Burtless said. As we noted above, there’s been a bit of an uptick in the percentage of people who are in the workforce since last September - but not much. It rose from 62.4 percent to 63 percent in March. But then it fell to 62.6 percent in May - a figure that was not available when Brat made his statement. Even so, it’s still up a bit from the September 2015 low point. A final note, our colleagues at PolitiFact National have examined a similar claim that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas has made over the years that the percentage of people working is at its lowest level since the 1970s, a statement Cruz has made to argue that Obama shares blame for the trend. PolitiFact has rated the statement Mostly True, saying the trend is real, but at least some of the drop is due to demographics beyond the president’s control. Brat, in his post, did not assign political blame for the drop. He predicted, however, that the situation will get worse if people  ""buy into solutions being offered by Democrats."" Our ruling Brat said the labor force participation rate ""currently stands below 63%, the lowest level since the 1970s."" His percentage is right, and the congressman is correct that the rate of potential workers in the labor force has been hovering near a four-decade low since the start of 2014. Our one minor quibble is that the actual low point occurred in September 2015, when the labor participation rate fell to 62.4 percent. It’s been slightly higher this year. Still, we rate Brat’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A37ED40>],/factchecks/2016/jun/13/dave-brat/dave-brat-us-labor-participation-rate-lowest-70s/

John McCain ad claims some Arizonans may have no healthcare choice
","Sen. John McCain has picked up his attacks on the Affordable Care Act recently, making the law synonymous with his Democratic rival, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff. A May 17 attack ad from McCain against Kirkpatrick, who’s running for McCain’s Senate seat, is a case in point. In addition to the claim that the healthcare law is her ""proudest"" vote, the ad’s on-screen text states, ""30,000 Arizonans may have no choice"" for healthcare coverage, citing the departure of UnitedHealthCare, the nation’s largest insurer, from the state’s marketplace. ""That’s devastating, especially to rural counties,"" the ad’s narrator points out.   While folks who have United will be insured through Dec. 31, 2016, we wondered whether thousands of Arizonans really won’t have a health care coverage choice come 2017.  (No coverage results in a penalty.) Background United announced in April that it would stop Affordable Care Act coverage in Arizona - and most of the 34 states it has plans in - by year’s end. May 11 was the deadline for health insurers to submit their 2017 Affordable Care Act state coverage plans to the federal government, which runs HealthCare.gov. In eight rural Arizona counties - Cochise, Graham, Greenlee, La Paz, Pinal, Santa Cruz, Yavapai and Yuma - only one health insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, signed up to cover individuals. Right now, only United and Blue Cross offer health insurance plans across all eight counties. How many insured people in these counties stand to be affected in 2017? Those are the people who will only get to choose Blue Cross. People insured may vary McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero pointed us to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data for insured people in those eight counties. According to the data, 30,761 people across all eight counties bought coverage through the exchange as of Feb. 1, 2016. However, Allen Gjersvig, director of Enrollment Services at Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers, a umbrella group for healthcare organizations that help people sign up for coverage, said the numbers do not specifically note how many people have either United or Blue Cross. ""It’s a snapshot, we don’t know what plan they chose,"" Gjersvig said. We asked Blue Cross Blue Shield specifically how many people currently have health insurance plans - and what plans they expect to offer in 2017 - in those eight counties, but they declined to provide those details, citing the ""competitive landscape.""   ""There are counties and consumers that will, as it stands right now, see only one insurance company,"" Gjersvig said. ""Blue Cross has filed rates for all counties in Arizona.""   It’s worth pointing out that health insurance coverage options in rural areas are limited overall. Insurers note that people in rural areas tend to be sicker and rack up more health care costs. But rural areas also have fewer physicians than urban areas. Our ruling McCain’s campaign ad said, ""30,000 Arizonans may have no choice"" for Affordable Care Act coverage. The 30,000 number is just a snapshot of how many people have bought coverage through the exchange in those eight Arizona counties. That could change, plus it's based on months old data. But, the ad’s claim is largely correct. In 2017, Blue Cross Blue Shield stands to be the lone health insurer for Arizonans seeking health insurance in those counties. We rate the ad’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F17A40>],/factchecks/2016/jun/11/john-mccain/mccain-ad-claims-arizonans-affordable-care-act/

Pants On Fire for viral rumor Bernie Sanders won California
","Polls showed Californians ‘Feeling the Bern,’ shortly before the state’s June 7 primary. Bernie Sanders had pulled even or surged slightly ahead of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential race after barnstorming from Chico to Chula Vista. But early results on Election Day showed Clinton crushing Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. That gap closed steadily as officials tallied more votes (to 12.6 points as of midafternoon June 10, 2016), but remained large enough for media outlets and professional pollsters to declare Clinton the winner. Still, there are those who point to millions of uncounted ballots in the state, and say Sanders was robbed. Justice Gazette, a group that describes itself as a counter to traditional media, is one of them. ""Bernie Sanders Wins California Landslide But ⅔ of his Votes Aren’t Counted,"" the Justice Gazette wrote in an eye-popping headline on June 7. The article added: ""In view of the information from polling place workers about Sanders winning by more than a 2 to 1 margin and in view of the removal of 2/3 or more of his votes from the official results, the Justice Gazette declares Bernie Sanders the landslide winner of the 2016 California Primary Election."" The Gazette article has been shared widely on Facebook and shows up prominently on web searches about Bernie Sanders and the California primary. Screen shot of Justice Gazette June 7, 2016 headline and article There’s no doubt Sanders ran a strong race in California. But the Gazette’s claim seemed outlandish and ripe for a fact check. Our research Three days after the election, Clinton had more than 2 million votes to Sanders’ nearly 1.6 million, for a lead of about 450,000 votes, according to the California Secretary of State’s website. If there’s any landslide victory, at this point, it’s by Clinton. Of course, the results are not official, as nearly 2.6 million ballots remained unprocessed as of Thursday, June 9, also according to the California Secretary of State. Most are expected to include votes in the Democratic presidential primary. Reports surfaced on Election Day about broken voting machines, incomplete voter rolls and confusion among unaffiliated voters over how to obtain a Democratic ballot. Many voters received provisional ballots that were not immediately counted. Once they are, pollsters expect the gap to narrow, but not close. Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, told PolitiFact California he does not think Clinton’s lead is in jeopardy. Clinton’s lead ""might go down into the single digits, but it’s still going to be a Clinton win,"" DiCamillo said. The Field Poll surveyed voters who had yet to cast ballots shortly before Election Day and found Sanders had the edge, but only by one percentage point. DiCamillo estimated Sanders would have to win the remaining votes by roughly a 2 to 1 margin to overtake Clinton. ""You’re smoking something if you think that’s going to happen,"" he added. Of the Justice Gazette claim of two-thirds of Sanders’ votes being uncounted, DiCamillo said ""nobody can claim to know that."" Neither during his speech in Santa Monica on election night, nor since, has Sanders protested the California results. A representative for the Sanders campaign said it had no affiliation with the Justice Gazette story. ""No one’s questioning the fundamental integrity of the election,"" Ben Tulchin, Sanders’ national pollster, told PolitiFact California, in an interview on June 10, 2016. Tulchin added that the campaign believes California can do more to make it easier for independents to vote in a Democratic primary. The Sanders pollster said the campaign expects the California ""race to close substantially,"" perhaps ""to low single digits,"" once all the votes are counted. As for overtaking Clinton’s lead, Tulchin said ""there’s a small chance. But it would be highly unlikely.""  A representative for the Gazette could not be reached.  Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks at a rally Tuesday, June 7, 2016, in Santa Monica, Calif. (AP Photo/John Locher) Our ruling After early California primary results showed a big Clinton lead over Sanders, the Justice Gazette posted the headline on June 7: ""Bernie Sanders Wins California But ⅔ of his Votes Aren’t Counted."" Three days later, Clinton continues to lead Sanders by about 450,000. There are more than two million uncounted votes. But based on polling shortly before the race, showing Sanders even or slightly ahead with voters who had yet to cast ballots, professional pollsters and news outlets say Clinton’s lead could shrink somewhat but is not in danger. Sanders would have to win the remaining votes by a huge margin, something no polls showed in advance of Election Day. There is evidence that California’s complicated voting rules led to problems. That may have prevented some Sanders supporters from voting for him and, for that matter, some Clinton supporters from voting for her.

Viral image stretches the truth about college costs before the Vietnam War
","Is free tuition at public colleges and universities a lofty dream or modest proposal? Liberals are Cool, a media organization, posted a meme on their Facebook page June 1. It reads, ""Tuition-free public universities and colleges are just a pipe dream. False. They were both free up until the Vietnam War.""  In February we looked at a similar claim made by Bernie Sanders, who said, ""Making public colleges tuition-free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States."" After talking to experts we concluded that Sanders’ claim was Mostly True because at least nine nations offer free tuition, and some U.S. public colleges and universities offered free tuition. The caveat is that college tuition was up to each school or state to decide, meaning certain U.S. colleges charged tuition as early as the 1800s. This new claim is broader when it comes to free tuition in the United States, so we wanted to take a fresh look. Roger Geiger, a education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II, said the claim is ""completely not true, except for California."" Geiger also took issue with the idea that there were multiple tution-free universities. ""The only state that I am aware of that did not charge ‘tuition’ was California,"" Geiger said. ""In 1960 it charged a basic fee of $60, plus incidental fees — still very cheap. ... Most other state universities charged tuition of roughly $200-300."" At its founding, the University of California offered free tuition to California residents, but charged a fee in 1921. By the 1970s both in-state and out-of-state students began to be charged tuition. William G. Tierney, a professor at the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education, said public colleges used the word fees, not tuition, to describe costs associated with going to school. ""We didn’t call costs ‘tuition’ and instead used the word ‘fees’ to suggest that the cost was free but if you wanted something extra there was a ‘fee,’ "" he said. Geiger said some land-grant universities were tuition free in the 1800s, but that all ended after 1920 because universities needed more revenue due to inflation and the growing number of people attending colleges. John Thelin, professor at the University of Kentucky, and author of A History of American Higher Education published by Johns Hopkins University Press, said that tuition prices in America have never been set on a nationwide basis, so higher education decisions are left up to the states. This means in each state a higher education official works with the state to come up with tuition policies. ""So, there is no statute or mechanism by which the federal government could set tuition nationwide, across state borders,"" he said. There was no consistent pattern that public colleges and universities followed for charging tuition, and some institutions have changed their policy since their founding, Thelin said. For example, based on its charter, Rice University (formerly Rice Institute) was not allowed to charge tuition. Stanford was tuition-free at its founding up until the 1910s and Berea College, to this day, doesn’t charge tuition. Both Rice and Stanford now charge tuition. The meme further suggests some change in policy necessitated or prompted by the Vietnam War. Geiger says that is wrong. He said public funding for higher education remained strong until the 1970s, which was years after the Vietnam War ended. It wasn’t until the 1979-81 recession when tuition began to increase and state appropriations were lowered. Thelin agreed with Geiger’s point that the Vietnam War had no cause-effect impact on tuition costs in America. He said a main influence on rising college costs was ""stagflation""— a period of more than 15 years where inflation rates are higher than 10 percent and national economic productivity is low—in the 1970s. ""Some of this was due to OPEC and the unexpected, huge dollar and percentage increase in oil prices – which was very hard on colleges and other nonprofit organizations,"" Thelin said. Our ruling A widespread Internet post claims that public colleges and universities were tuition-free up until the Vietnam War. This claim takes a potentially factual talking point and stretches it too far. Some public schools had essentially free tuition in the 1960s, but experts say they were largely isolated to California and that it was very much typical for public universities to charge tuition or fees at that point of time. Any claim or suggestion that the Vietnam War had an impact on college costs is not borne out by the facts. We rate this claim as Mostly False.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/77771a4f-9a2a-4440-89f6-58d38ad18cbe",[<zip object at 0x0000028097236E00>],/factchecks/2016/jun/10/viral-image/viral-image-stretches-truth-about-college-tuition/

A thousand child sex-trafficking victims yearly in Ohio? Nope
","Despite all the divisiveness in politics, Republicans and Democrats have joined hands to draft legislation on a few things everyone can agree on, like fighting the opioid epidemic, the Zika virus and child sex trafficking. On the latter topic, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio held a press conference on May 25, 2016, with Republican co-sponsors of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, calling for its full implementation. ""In my home state of Ohio, for example,"" Beatty said, ""each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over 3,000 more are at risk."" Because child-sex-trafficking is an inherently clandestine crime, we were curious about the source of those numbers. The ""1,000 children"" stat appears throughout several Ohio government websites, including the one for the Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force, which Gov. John Kasich first convened in 2012. The home page links to the task force’s most recent report, from 2015, and it does not line up with the annual estimate. The report says ""181 potential victims of trafficking were identified"" statewide in 2014 after almost 100 stings to bust sex traffickers — and this tally is not limited just to children. The task force’s website also runs a banner that encourages anyone with a tip on a suspected human trafficking case to call the National Human Trafficking Hotline Resource Center, which answers calls 24/7. The resource center, which is partly funded by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, keeps state-by-state reports online. According to the statistics for Ohio, between December 2007 and March 2016, there were 753 cases with ""high indicators"" of human trafficking. That’s almost 10 years of data collection that, combined, doesn’t come close to the estimate of 1,000 children annually. What’s going on? The 1,000-victim figure comes from a questionable study commissioned by the Ohio Attorney General’s Office and published in 2010. The members of the study included researchers from the University of Ohio and Toledo University, members of law enforcement, and nonprofit advocates. The commission started with data from an FBI program called ""Operation Innocence Lost,"" which focused on 14 cities with the highest incidences of prostitution, which included Toledo, Ohio. The authorities identified an average of 15 minor victims of sex trafficking in Toledo each year, between 2005 and 2009. The study’s authors took that 15-per-year figure and applied it to all girls ages 12 through 17 in the state of Ohio. That population, 337,961, yields an estimate of 202 girls per year. Then, the commission multiplied 202 by five, because a University of Toledo study claimed that each sex trafficking victim they interviewed knew an average of five more underaged minors ""not known to law enforcement, but who were engaging in the sex trade."" One big problem: The Ohio study did not control for the fact that Toledo’s child sex trafficking rates were the highest in the state, which inflates their estimate even before multiplying it by five. The commission then threw in some boys for good measure, reasoning that being gay, transgender or a runaway are ""risk factors"" for becoming a child sex trafficking victim. Because 3 to 5 percent of the overall US population identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, the committee added 63 males to the estimated number of child victims. The attorney general’s trafficking study concluded that an annual 1,078 minors in Ohio were potential victims. The other number Beatty and other state leaders cite repeatedly is that there are 3,000 children ""at risk"" of being trafficked. For that, the attorney general’s commission relied on a study by University of Pennsylvania researchers Richard J. Estes and Neil Alan Weiner, who came up with 14 factors that purportedly increased the chances of a teen being forced into the sex trade. But the Washington Post and Village Voice are among many sources that have thoroughly debunked the Estes and Weiner study. Estes eventually admitted to reporters, ""Kids who are kidnapped and sold into slavery — that number would be very small. …We’re talking about a few hundred people."" David Finkelhor, a respected voice in his role with the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, has previously criticized the methodology used in the 2010 Ohio study. He told PolitiFact via email, ""Nothing has appeared in the last couple of years to make estimates of the problem any more scientific than they were 10 years ago.""   Through a spokesperson, Beatty agreed that the estimate is bunk. ""Congresswoman Beatty was comfortable using the estimates because they were calculated by the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, in consultation with the University of Toledo, and based on research and observations from experts in the field,"" spokesman Dominic Manecke wrote in an email. ""However, she has no problem conceding that the estimate may need to be updated, because whether it be one person, 100 or 1,000 people, one trafficking victim is one too many."" Elizabeth Ranade Janis, the head of Kasich’s Human Trafficking Task Force, told PolitiFact that the 1,000-child-victim talking point lacks a basis in solid statistics. ""It’s definitely an estimate,"" she said. ""There is no question whether human trafficking is a crime that occurs in our state. ... I would gladly welcome more research to help us better understand the prevalence of the crime and strengthen our efforts to assist survivors."" Celia Williamson, who served as the sub-committee chairperson on the 2010 study commission, stood by their estimate, with a caveat.  ""I think you have to look at 2009 and the data we had at the time,"" Williamson said. ""Toledo was the only city in Ohio with a task force on human trafficking at the time. It was the central place to start. Someone has to pioneer and begin."" Our ruling Beatty said, ""Each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over 3,000 more are at risk."" The underlying study behind this widely distributed state talking point lacks scientific footing. Law enforcement totals of cases involving sex trafficking victims did not approach anywhere close to 1,000 child victims. It’s impossible to quantify how many go undiscovered. But artificially inflating that estimate isn’t necessary. We rate this statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a0e109ab-8e1f-4e19-a85c-d5bdbfbee89f",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DDFDC0>],/factchecks/2016/jun/10/joyce-beatty/thousand-child-sex-trafficking-victims-yearly-ohio/

Sen. Ron Johnson voted for Paul Ryan plans to make Medicare a voucher program, Democratic Party says
","In 2011, after the U.S. House of Representatives approved a federal budget pushed by Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, Democrats repeatedly claimed that Republicans had ""voted to end Medicare."" That became PolitiFact National’s Lie of the Year. Ryan, now the House speaker, has continued to advance Medicare reform proposals. And now the Wisconsin Democratic Party is making an attack -- though with a claim that doesn’t go nearly as far as the lie of the year. In a radio ad released May 4, 2016, the party said GOP U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson ""went after Medicare, voting to turn it into a voucher program."" It’s an attack that is likely to be repeated as Democrat Russ Feingold seeks to take back the Senate seat from Johnson in the November 2016 election. So, did Johnson vote to make Medicare ""a voucher program""? There’s some argument over semantics between voucher and premium supports, a term preferred by Republicans. But the answer is: Pretty much. Paul Ryan budgets To back its claim, the state Democratic party cited Johnson’s votes for Ryan’s budget proposals, which included the Medicare reforms. Those budgets, which did not become law, prompted Democrats to charge that Ryan wanted to turn Medicare into a voucher program. Our colleagues have consistently rated those claims Mostly True. As PolitiFact National has explained: The initial Ryan plan using the term premium supports was released in early 2011. Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. It would have affected people who at the time were under 55. Ryan then updated versions of the plan, including one as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. That newer version would have allowed beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they could use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.  So, the main point is that Medicare would change from paying fees to doctors and hospitals, and instead beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy toward their coverage. That’s a big change. Johnson’s campaign argues that the change wouldn’t be a voucher and emphasizes that what Republicans call premium support payments would be made to insurance companies, not to Medicare beneficiaries themselves. Our colleagues concluded that, although there are technical differences between voucher and premium supports that may matter to health policy professionals, the two definitions have become almost indistinguishable and voucher program is a fair description for what Ryan proposed. Our rating The state Democratic Party says Johnson voted to turn Medicare ""into a voucher program."" To some health policy experts, there are technical differences between voucher and premium supports -- the latter term being preferred by Johnson and other Republicans when it comes to Medicare changes. But under Ryan’s proposals, Medicare would no longer pay fees to health care providers -- instead, Medicare beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy to use toward their health care.

Austin district's claim to highest graduation rate among major Texas cities Mostly False
","An ad posted in Austin’s Erwin Center during June 2016 high school graduation ceremonies made us wonder: ""Austin ISD has the highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas."" That seemingly takes in a lot of school districts. Asked the basis of the message, a spokesman for the Austin school district, Reyne Telles, said by phone that marketing officials focused on 2014 graduation rates for ""signature"" districts in the state’s five most populous cities. For each district, Texas calculates one graduation rate by counting students in keeping with federal law and another rate that comports with state law. Upshot: The Austin district’s 2014 graduation rate — 88.6 percent or 86.3 percent, depending on which result you choose — outpaced comparable rates for the Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth districts, Telles noted. The district emailed us a spreadsheet presenting its figures, which we checked against Texas Education Agency data confirming that among the five districts, Austin had the highest graduation rates--though it was close: The Dallas district had graduation rates of 86.9 or 86.1 percent, respectively, TEA posts indicate. Statewide, the agency in 2015 announced the 2014 state graduation rate was 88.3 percent, a record high. Texas High School Graduation Rates, Selected Districts, 2014 DISTRICT 2014 GRADUATION RATE USING FEDERAL STUDENT EXCLUSIONS 2014 GRADUATION RATE USING STATE STUDENT EXCLUSIONS Austin 86.3 percent 88.6 percent Dallas 86.1 86.9 Fort Worth 81.0 84.1 Houston 78.6 81.8 San Antonio 78.2 80.8 SOURCES: Online searches using website, ""Search Four-Year Graduation and Dropout Data by District, Class of 2014,"" Texas Education Agency (accessed June 6-7, 2016) Other slices of data We recognized other ways to compare the Austin district to other districts in major Texas cities. For instance, TEA classifies Austin and 10 other districts as ""major urban"" districts, meaning each one is located in a county with a population of at least 870,000; its enrollment is the largest in the county or at least 75 percent of the largest district enrollment in the county; and at least 35 percent of enrolled students are economically disadvantaged. The ""major urban"" districts include the districts AISD singled out for its ad plus the Arlington district in Tarrant County, the North East and Northside districts in San Antonio and several districts in El Paso County--El Paso, Socorro and Ysleta. And among these additional districts, per the state, the North East and Northside districts had the highest 2014 graduation rates (93.4 or 94.1 percent depending on the calculation). More than half the North East district lies within San Antonio, the district says, though it takes in smaller cities including Castle Hills. Northside describes itself as located in the northwest quadrant of San Antonio. The Socorro district, with 88.2 to 89.8 percent graduation rates, similarly fared better than the Austin district. The Socorro district says its serves students in East El Paso, the city of Socorro and Horizon City. You could also look at districts based on enrollment, an approach that arguably elevates a suburban Houston district, the 110,000-student Cypress-Fairbanks district, into consideration. Its graduation rates of 91.4 and 92.4 percent, respectively, outpaced the 80,000-student Austin district’s rates. We ran these alternate comparisons past Telles, who said it’s always a challenge to convert educational ""speak"" and/or data into something digestible for the general public. ""We’re dealing with marketers that tell us billboard advertising is kind of complicated when you go more than six words,"" Telles said. Telles said the district could have compared Austin with its fellow ""major urban"" districts. Then again, he said, ""if you say Northside, the average person, I’d venture to say, would not know where that is."" The ad statement, he said, came down to ""consumability."" In a follow-up email, Telles noted that more than half the Austin district’s student population is considered at risk of dropping out — which is also the case in the four districts it chose for the comparison. But that wasn't so, Telles wrote, for the Northside, North East or Socorro districts. In 2014, according to TEA data, 56 percent of Austin students were considered ""at risk."" Half of Socorro students were at risk, the agency says, as were 43 percent of Northside students and 36 percent of North East students. Our ruling The Austin district says it has the ""highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas."" This declaration is rooted in the faulty premise that Texas has only five major cities and only the districts named for those cities are worthy of comparison. Applying those filters gives the statement an element of truth. On the other hand, we identified other districts in the same cities with higher graduation rates than the Austin district. We’re flipping the Truth-O-Meter’s tassel and rating this claim Mostly False.

"['National', 'Congress', 'Foreign Policy', 'Gary Johnson']","
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson mischaracterizes U.S. defense obligations
","Is the United States really obligated to be the world’s bodyguard? Speaking on Meet the Press on June 5, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson said that the United States is already committed — without congressional approval — to protecting the borders of 69 other countries (about one-third of the world). ""We've got treaties with apparently 69 countries where we are obligated to defend their borders. And these were treaties that were executive treaties, not authorized by Congress,"" Johnson said. Johnson’s claim itself isn’t new. He made the claim on CNN’s New Day on May 31 and Donald Trump tweeted the same claim May 29. Trump has also made the United States’ role protecting other countries a talking point this election, leaving open the possibility of disbanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if other countries fail to contribute their fair share. We wanted to look closer into Johnson’s claim about the United States’ current obligations to other nations. The statement warrants examination on multiple grounds: 1. The number of countries involved through formal treaties; 2. Whether Congress had a say in the treaties; 3. Are these provisions actually used? We reached out to the Johnson campaign but did not get a response back. United States treaties A paper published by Tufts University professor Michael Beckley in 2015, The Myth of Entangling Alliances, contains Johnson’s 69-country figure. In his analysis, Beckley counts the Organization of American States, NATO and various other treaties as collective defense arrangements. We found that other sources include fewer countries. The State Department only counts 54. We analyzed all of the treaties Beckley cites and compared it to U.S. Department of State records. The Charter of The Organization of American States created the OAS — an organization that aims for regional solidarity in the Americas — and was approved by the Senate in 1951. The OAS Charter treaty pledges the United States to support 33 countries through collective security provisions in Articles 28 and 29, according to Beckley. Those countries include — Antigua & Barbuda, Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haití, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Perú, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. Beckley’s analysis also includes 28 countries as part of NATO, which was created by the North Atlantic Treaty and approved by the Senate on July 21, 1949. Article V of the NAT provides for collective defense. In that list, Beckley includes — Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, West Germany and Germany. Those two agreements count for 61 of the 69 countries Johnson cited. Both were approved by the Senate, but more on that later. Next, Beckley cites the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty of 1951, which was also approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952. That makes countries 62 and 63. Beckley also includes Japan as country 64 through a bilateral U.S.-Japan treaty (approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952), South Korea (65) through a mutual defense treaty (approved by the Senate on January 26, 1954), and the Philippines (66) through a mutual defense treaty (approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952). He also cites a bilateral defense agreement with Pakistan (67) on March 5, 1959. According to Dennis Kux in his book on U.S.-Pakistan relations, this was an ""executive agreement"" — a different type of treaty not sent to the Senate for approval. Pakistan has since accused the United States of not honoring the agreement, Kux wrote. Israel (68) and Taiwan (69) are also on Beckley’s list. He includes Israel because he claims the United States has a ""de facto"" agreement to defend it (not a formal treaty). The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1979, requires the United States to provide defense assistance to Taiwan. Adding all of these up gets to the 69 figure Johnson used on Meet The Press.  The official Department of State website, however, has a different number of collective defense arrangements — only 54 countries. The State Department excludes West Germany, Pakistan, Israel and Taiwan from Beckley’s list and also adds Thailand due to the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty — which created the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and was approved by the Senate on Feb. 1, 1955. The main difference, however, is that the State Department does not include all the countries in the OAS Charter. Rather, it only includes members of the affiliated Inter-American Treaty of International Assistance (Rio Treaty), a collective defense treaty with fewer members than the OAS Charter. Julian Ku, Maurice A. Deane distinguished professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University, agreed with the State Department’s assessment. Ku did note, however, that these determinations have not been actively discussed since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s. ""The OAS Charter is not what we would call a mutual defense treaty,"" he said. ""It is not a treaty obligation to defend every member of the OAS Charter."" Beckley told PolitiFact he used all the OAS countries primarily for methodological reasons. There’s another wrinkle to this count. Some countries the State Department included as part of the Rio Treaty — Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela — have recently denounced the treaty. Cuba has also announced it will not be rejoining the OAS, making its status within the Rio Treaty unclear. Lastly, SEATO — containing Thailand — disbanded in 1977. Add it all up and what do you get? It’s reasonable to say the United States has obligations to defend anywhere from around 48 countries to close to 70. Did Congress have a say? The second part of Johnson’s claim — that all were ""executive treaties"" without congressional approval — does not stand up to scrutiny. The Senate approved all of the pertinent treaties through its ""Advice and Consent"" procedure under Article II, section 2 of the Constitution (with the exception of the Pakistan 1959 agreement). Michael Ramsey, an international law professor at the University of San Diego, told PolitiFact that Johnson could be considered ""technically correct"" because the House of Representatives does not consider the issue. Nonetheless, Ramsey explained, Johnson’s claim is misleading because nothing ""improper"" was done. ""The Constitution expressly provides that treaties are to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate (and not the House),"" he wrote. ""Thus there is nothing improper occurring here, and it is not the case that these agreements are being done on executive authority alone."" Beckley told PolitiFact that many treaties require action consistent with each nation’s constitution, such that Congress would still have a say before an actual intervention. Relevance Johnson’s phrasing of ""defend their borders"" could be misleading as well, making it seem that the United States has a more general and ongoing policy than it does. Just how strong an ""obligation"" the United States has is also questionable, experts said. The treaties in question only require other member states to get involved if one country is attacked, which is rare. ""Look at those countries. Very few are under threat of attack,"" wrote Douglas Gibler, a professor of political science at the University of Alabama, in an email. In addition, Beckley noted that the treaties do not require the United States to take immediate action and that the treaties often do not specify what such action would look like. The Rio Treaty, for example, provides ""no State shall be required to use armed force without its consent."" ""The OAS Charter doesn’t say the U.S. has to go in guns blazing to defend its allies to the death everytime someone comes under attack,"" Beckley said. ""The language is super vague with a lot of loopholes in it, so when Johnson says that the U.S. has an ironclad obligation to protect the country that’s more than a bit of a stretch."" Ku noted as well that neither the OAS Treaty or the Rio Treaty have been actively invoked since the 1960s. Our ruling Gary Johnson claimed that the United States is obligated to ""defend the borders"" of 69 countries by treaties, and that Congress did not have a say in the matter. Johnson’s reference to ""69 countries"" is in the ballpark. However, he fails to include in his statement the nuance regarding how much action the United States would actually be compelled to take under these treaties, according to experts. Johnson is also wrong to say that Congress had not considered any of these treaties, because the Senate considered all but one pursuant to its constitutional powers. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9fc80cb6-ce8d-4630-93a7-2af99cff41fa",[<zip object at 0x00000280978A7E00>],/factchecks/2016/jun/09/gary-johnson/libertarian-candidate-gary-johnson-mischaracterize/
"['Congress', 'Financial Regulation', 'Florida', 'Tim Canova']","
Tim Canova says he helped draft part of Dodd-Frank
","Tim Canova, who is in a Democratic primary battle with U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, says he pushed to crack down on the financial services industry even before the financial collapse. And, he says he played a role in the 2010 financial reform bill. Canova, a law professor and first-time candidate, said in a June 1 Medium post he ""helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, one of President Obama’s signature accomplishments."" Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., co-author of the reform bill, expressed some skepticism that Canova played a role. ""He does seem to be denigrating the financial reform bill, of which I was a co-sponsor, while simultaneously claiming credit for having written it,"" Frank said at a press conference for Wasserman Schultz in Broward May 31. We decided to fact-check Canova’s role in helping to draft part of Dodd-Frank. Effort to audit the Federal Reserve The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was a sweeping law with multiple components intended to avert another financial meltdown. (Canova has some criticisms of the law which he details in his book, The Bottom-Up Recovery.) The part of the law Canova said he helped draft related to auditing the Federal Reserve, including its emergency lending in the aftermath of the economic collapse.  At the time, Canova was a professor of international economic law at Chapman University in California. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, sought for two decades  to pass a bill to audit the fed. Bipartisan interest in Paul’s pet project grew after the financial collapse. The House Financial Services Committee passed an amendment 43-26 to audit the Fed on Nov. 19, 2009. U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, whipped Democratic votes. The amendment required government audits of the Federal Reserve including how much the central bank lent to banks. Critics felt it could lead the auditors to interfere with monetary policy. ""It was a major legislative achievement, the first time the Federal Reserve was subject to audit, and again over the objections of Barney Frank,"" Canova told PolitiFact Florida. The concern about monetary policy drew objections from Frank, Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd, the Fed and the Obama administration. So the Senate author, Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, scaled back audit powers to exclude monetary policy but include disclosing information about the emergency loans. The limited audit was included in the final Dodd-Frank bill that was signed by Obama in July 2010. Canova’s role was behind the scenes, serving as a resource to at least a couple of House and Senate staffers at the time. Canova said he was contacted by staffers on Capitol Hill after he published articles on the Federal Reserve. (One of his articles, ""Financial Market Failure as a Crisis in the Rule of Law,"" was published in the Harvard Law Policy and Review in 2009.) He was also quoted in many news articles about the financial crisis. One of those staffers was Matt Stoller, a senior policy adviser to Grayson who worked on the amendment. Canova ""was an adviser as we worked on the Federal Reserve emergency lending disclosure provisions of Dodd-Frank,"" Stoller told PolitiFact Florida. (In 2011, Stoller wrote an op-ed about the Federal Reserve and quoted Canova.) Another staffer was Warren Gunnels, an aide to Sanders. Canova also told Rolling Stone that he worked with some of Sanders' staff on the bill. (Gunnels now works on Sanders’ presidential campaign and did not respond to emails from PolitiFact Florida.) Sanders named Canova to a committee to advise him on Federal Reserve reform in 2011. Sanders backs Canova in his congressional race. Canova forwarded to PolitiFact Florida a few emails he exchanged with Stoller and Gunnels in July 2010 shortly before the Senate passed Dodd-Frank. For example, in an email July 13, 2010, Canova wrote to Gunnels: ""I have continued working through the provisions of the Dodd-Frank conference committee bill."" Canova suggested that Sanders insert into the record some clarifying language that the audit would apply to financial assistance from the Federal Reserve starting Dec. 1, 2007, through the enactment of the bill. ""I am happy to claim a small bit of credit for a supporting role in helping the drafters of one of the very best provisions of the act,"" Canova told PolitiFact Florida. In an interview, Frank -- who is backing Wasserman Schultz -- told PolitiFact Florida he had never heard of Canova while working on the bill. As for the audit portion of the law, Frank argued Canova shouldn’t get credit because the final version didn’t include auditing monetary policy. Frank said he opposed that portion because he saw it as ""political interference."" Frank said he didn’t want the members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ""being called before an auditor and asked about votes on interest rates."" Our ruling Canova says he ""helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill."" The Dodd-Frank bill was a sweeping piece of legislation with many components. Canova was involved in one piece of the bill. Canova played a behind-the-scenes role advising a House staff member and a Senate staff member about amendments to allow the government to audit the Federal Reserve. A scaled-back version was included in the final law. Canova didn’t contribute to the drafting of the overall bill, and he wasn't the main driver of the audit portion that stemmed from decades of advocacy by Paul. However, he did play a role.

"['National', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump said, 'Crime is rising.' It's not (and hasn't been for decades)
","After big primaries in California and New Jersey on June 7, Donald Trump -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee -- painted a picture of a nation in crisis. ""Hard to imagine what's happened to our country,"" Trump said. ""America is being taken apart piece by piece … just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder. We're broke. We're broke. (Our debt is) $19 trillion, going quickly to $21 trillion. Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our schools are failing. Crime is rising. People are scared. The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster."" Critics will take issue with some of those assertions, such as the idea that the United States is ""broke"" -- something we’ve rated False previously. But the line from Trump’s remarks that leapt out at us was this one: ""Crime is rising."" Our previous research has shown that’s not so. So we took a closer look. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) We looked at two broad categories of crime -- violent crime and property crime -- that are frequently cited by experts as catch-all categories. Violent crimes include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, while property crimes include burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft. We turned to FBI data. Such data is submitted voluntarily by local law enforcement agencies, and thus is not perfectly comprehensive. But it is one of two data sets that is generally considered the best available for answering this question. First, we looked at the trend for violent crime and found that it has been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. The data below shows violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data is available.  Next, we looked at property crime data. It showed the same pattern:  We also looked at the other widely used data set -- the National Crime Victimization Survey, collected by the Justice Department. Here, the trend looks quite similar:  Finally, we asked two criminologists to make sure we weren’t missing something. As it happens, James Alan Fox, the interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, was watching Trump’s speech and noticed the comment as well. ""He is incorrect,"" Fox said. ""There are some spikes in homicide and shootings in certain cities, yet other cities continue to experience low rates. As a nation, we are far better off than anytime for the past several decades. Crime rates are low, and there is no consistent and reliable indication that things are getting worse."" ""Mr. Trump is wrong if he is talking about overall crime and even violent crime,"" agreed University of Maryland criminologist Raymond Paternoster. Any possible upward swing in the past year or so wouldn’t show up in the data currently available, he said. Our ruling Speaking generally about the state of the country, Trump said, ""Crime is rising."" If you look at overall violent and property crimes -- the only categories that would seem inclusive enough to qualify as ""crime,"" as Trump put it -- he is flat wrong. In fact, crime rates have been falling almost without fail for roughly a quarter-century. We rate his claim Pants on Fire. UPDATE, July 5, 2016: After we published our article, the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, published a blog post critiquing our analysis. The post cited preliminary figures for 2015 that show crime rising.  Our fact-check acknowledged the point made in the post, although this data is preliminary and subject to revision. Two criminologists we checked with before publication warned us that such data may not be indicative of a real trend.  In addition, while the preliminary data shows spikes in crime rates in some cities, Trump’s statement was broad, without qualifiers, and it came amid comments that painted an overarching image of a nation in decline. Trump didn’t say that crime was rising ""recently"" or ""in recent months"" or ""over the past year"" or ""in some places.""  Ultimately, we find that Trump’s sweeping rhetoric about a nation in decline and beset by crime ignores the overall trend of violent and property crime rates over the past 25 years, which is that they have fallen, consistently and significantly. We stand by our rating of Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e5c3910-a384-4b3e-8872-742cd9e7c9d5",[<zip object at 0x000002809783D100>],/factchecks/2016/jun/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-crime-rising-its-not-and-hasnt-b/
