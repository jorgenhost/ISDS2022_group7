Taking a closer look at the auto-theft problem in St. Petersburg
","Whose epidemic is it anyway? The leading candidates in St. Petersburg’s mayoral race are trading blows over the city’s issue with automobile theft ahead of the Aug. 29 primary. Former Mayor Rick Baker told a Tampa Bay Times reporter that auto theft is ""now at epidemic proportions"" under Mayor Rick Kriseman. Kriseman defended himself  on Twitter and Facebook with a graphic showing the problem appeared worse during Baker’s time in office. According to Kriseman’s post, there were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Baker, compared with 1,095 auto thefts in 2016 under Kriseman.  With our colleagues at the Tampa Bay Times investigating the juvenile car-theft problem, we wanted to look at the trend under both mayors. The numbers Kriseman reported from the St. Petersburg Police Department checked out for those years. Baker was mayor from April 2001 to January 2010. Kriseman’s campaign plucked the worst year to make its counterpunch. The year 2006 was the highest point for auto thefts since 2000 — although most other years were higher than any point in Kriseman’s three full years since taking office in 2014. Choosing to compare raw numbers from Baker's 2008 and Kriseman's 2015, though, could leave a different impression, with 1,461 and 1,523 thefts, respectively. What does the bigger story tell you? The rate of car thefts in St. Petersburg remains far higher than the national and state average, shown below, regardless of who was mayor. ""The number of auto-thefts, the number of auto burglaries, it’s something you need to watch and something that’s important, but the impact of the activity is more important than anything else,"" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. And in recent years, the impact of automobile thefts, specifically juvenile auto thefts, has been a priority for the department. The Tampa Bay Times documented the automobile theft issue, finding that children in Pinellas County were arrested more for stealing cars than anywhere else in Florida. Gualtieri said 2015 was ""ground zero"" for the juvenile auto-theft problem and said that’s when the department really started noticing the trend of young kids stealing cars. In early 2016, three teenage girls drove a stolen car into a cemetery pond and drowned. At the time, Gualtieri called the incident ""unacceptable."" ""Solutions need to come deep from within the community,"" Gualtieri said at the time. ""Kids need to know there are consequences. This is a systematic and complex problem."" Automobile thefts became a priority for police in 2015 and 2016 — leading to a year-over-year drop. Law enforcement officials consider juvenile auto thefts a countywide problem; a drop in St. Petersburg doesn’t necessarily mean the problem is over. Detective Paul Etcheson, who’s been with the police department for almost nine years and works in the property crime unit, described automobile theft in St. Petersburg as a ""revolving door."" ""The reason the numbers have fallen in the previous months is because we have juveniles placed in programs, or on 21-day hold or something,"" he said. ""As soon as they get back, they’re right back at it."" As we said, 2006 was a high point for auto theft. We wanted to understand why. Police officer Mark Williams, who has been with the deparment for over a decade, said cars were simply easier to steal in 2005 and 2006 like the Dodge Ram 1500. Older cars could be broken into with a screwdriver or a pair of scissors, he said.  Williams said automakers have done a better job of eliminating access points on cars. For instance, key holes are only on the driver side rather than on all doors.   In response to Kriseman’s image, Baker said, ""I’ve been to 50 neighborhood organizations in the last six months and if Rick Kriseman thinks he doesn’t have an auto theft problem, he needs to get out more."" Kriseman’s campaign emphasized the mayor is still concerned about automobile thefts, and said the image was meant to undermine Baker’s remark that automobile theft is at ""epidemic proportions."" Our ruling Kriseman pushed back against Baker calling the auto-theft problem an ""epidemic"" with a graphic that said there were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Baker and 1,095 auto thefts in 2016. Those numbers are accurate, but more information is needed to understand the full story. Kriseman cherry-picked the year of Baker’s two terms with the highest amount of theft and compared it with his lowest year. To his overall point, the automobile theft per capita in St. Petersburg has been significantly higher than the national and state rates, regardless of who was in office. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8CFC00>],/factchecks/2017/jul/27/rick-kriseman/taking-closer-look-auto-theft-problem-st-petersbur/

In Youngstown, Trump incorrectly says he has achieved historic increase in defense spending
","President Donald Trump ticked off his presidential accomplishments in front of a warm crowd in Youngstown, Ohio, saying he was already keeping his promises to strengthen the military with record defense expenditures. ""We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve,"" Trump said at a July 25, 2017, rally organized by his campaign. This isn’t the first time he’s trumpeted big spending for the military. In an address to Congress in March, Trump said his budget ""calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history,"" which we rated Mostly False. His brag in Youngstown is more overblown, and more inaccurate. The White House did not provide information for this fact-check. The increase in defense spending is not historic. Trump’s proposed base spending cap for 2017-18 defense spending is $603 billion, a 9.4 percent increase. There have been 10 years since 1977 when the base level has gone up by more than that, and in some years, the increase more than doubled Trump’s. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan hiked the spending cap by 24.9 percent and by 20.4 percent the following year. More recently, President George W. Bush bumped spending by 10 percent in 2009. The Center for Strategic and International Studies mapped these changes below.  Base defense budget doesn’t include war-related funding, though. If we were to include that funding, the statistics are less in Trump's favor. Trump’s proposed budget represents a 5.4 percent increase in the total defense budget, but we’ve also had greater increases in the past. President Jimmy Carter increased military spending by 25 percent in 1981 and President Ronald Reagan’s added another 20 percent the next year. President George W. Bush raised the defense budget by 27 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2007 and nearly 12 percent in 2008. This time, Trump wasn’t just saying he proposed one of the largest increases; he said he had already ""achieved"" it. The spending has not yet been approved. To turn his proposal into a reality, Trump will need Congress to appropriate the necessary funding for fiscal year 2018 as well as change the budget caps currently in effect. ""Trump’s defense budget is $54 billion above the budget cap already set in law,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""And to change the budget cap he needs 60 votes in the Senate, so in some ways it’s actually more difficult to change the budget cap than to pass a health care bill."" In Trump’s defense, Harrison said that his proposed defense budget is among the highest in history (though still not the highest) because the proposed increase comes on top of a defense budget that is already high by historical standards. But Trump was talking specifically about an increase. Trump said, ""We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve."" The defense spending increase Trump laid out in his 2018 budget is not an unprecedented change, regardless of whether it includes war-related spending. It’s also not the done deal Trump described. In order to actually increase defense spending, Congress will have to appropriate the funding and raise the budget cap. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC960C0>],/factchecks/2017/jul/27/donald-trump/its-false-trump-achieved-historic-increase-defense/

Duffy on track on claim of 1,000-seat pickup by GOP since Obamacare
","In discussing Republican efforts to implement President Donald Trump’s agenda, U.S.  Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) blamed the U.S. Senate’s filibuster rule for preventing Trump’s agenda from being passed into law. ""Get rid of the filibuster rule’’ Duffy said July 17, 2017 on Fox News Channel’s ""Fox & Friends"" show.  ""(Then) you only need 51 votes."" Then, the congressman went further: ""We’ve won a thousand seats since Obamacare,"" he said. ""The American people want us to accomplish this agenda, and we’re not getting it done because of stupid Senate rules."" Duffy also made the 1,000-seat assertion during an appearance on ""Varney & Co."" the same day on the Fox Business Network. ""We’ve won a historical election,"" Duffy said. ""We have a thousand seats we’ve won since Obamacare."" Has the GOP really picked up 1,000 seats since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010? Digging into the numbers Let’s start at the state level, where most of the positions in question lie. According to Ballotpedia: The Encyclopedia of American Politics, the Republican Party held more seats in 82 of 99 state legislative chambers (82.3 percent) in January 2017 than it did in January 2009. The website says: ""During President Barack Obama's two terms in office, Democrats experienced a net loss of 968 state legislative seats, the largest net loss of state legislative seats in this category since World War II. The second-largest loss occurred following Dwight D. Eisenhower’s two terms in office, when Republicans were handed a net loss of 843 state legislative seats."" An accompanying chart lists the five largest losses in state legislative seats for Democrats during Obama’s two terms: Arkansas state Senate (18 seats), West Virginia state Senate (16 seats lost), Arkansas House of Representatives (46 seats), West Virginia House of Representatives (43 seats) and Oklahoma state Senate (16 seats.)   There were other losses. According to an article on FoxNews.com, ""Democratic U.S. Senate seats fell from 55 to 46. Their share of the House plummeted from 256 seats to 194. …  Democratic governerships also became a rarity during this eight-year period, slipping from 28 to 16."" After the election of Obama, there was much talk of a new era -- that a coalition of young, minority and female voters would usher in gains for the Democrats for decades. That did not happen. ""The defeats have all but wiped out a generation of young Democrats, leaving the party with limited power in statehouses and a thin bench to challenge an ascendant GOP majority eager to undo many of the president’s policies,"" according to a Dec. 24, 2016 Associated Press article. ""After this year’s elections, Democrats hold the governor’s office and both legislative chambers in just five coastal states: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware,"" the article said. ""Republicans have the trifecta in 25, giving them control of a broad swath of the middle of the country."" Duffy’s communications director, Mark Bednar, pointed us to an article in the January/February 2017 edition of Politico magazine titled ""Democrats in the Wilderness,"" which maintains Democrats are facing a crisis in coming years. The article, written by Edward-Isaac Dovere, says the party’s situation is ""the result of years of complacency, ignoring the withering of the grass roots and the state parties, sitting by as Republicans racked up local win after local win."" Matt Bennett, a co-founder and vice president of public affairs of the Third Way, an organization that describes itself as ""a strategy center for progressives,"" confirmed the figure. ""Yes, it’s true at the state legislative level,"" he said. ""Dems have lost about 1,000 seats."" While Duffy did not directly blame Obamacare for the loss of every seat, he presented it as the primary reason for the Republican gains and Democrat declines. But every race is different, and many other factors come into play -- from newly drawn districts to the performance by individual candidates and a host of issues. So, he oversteps a bit in framing it entirely around Obamacare. Our rating Duffy said ""We’ve won a thousand seats since Obamacare."" There are many reasons for the decline of Democrats beyond dissatisfaction with Obamacare, including frustration over Washington gridlock, voters’ fears over budget deficits, national security, immigration, tax reform, the global economy, wages and jobs. Therefore, Obamacare is not the sole reason for the GOP seat gains, but one of many. But the ""thousand seats"" figure Duffy cites is accurate. We rate Duffy’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEC9480>],/factchecks/2017/jul/27/sean-duffy/duffy-track-claim-1000-seat-pickup-gop-obamacare/

Mark Cuban says Twitter 'reaches only 15% of the population'
","Texas businessman and possible 2020 presidential aspirant Mark Cuban, who backed Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, challenged Kellyanne Conaway’s defense of President Donald Trump’s frequent Twitter posts by suggesting most Americans aren’t Twitter-philes. Cuban was reacting to a June 30, 2017, Fox News tweet quoting the White House counselor saying the president conveys his ideas through social media ""because the middle man can't be trusted."" ""This is backwards,"" Cuban tweeted back. ""Twitter reaches only ~ 15pct of population,"" Cuban said, adding: ""For a tweet to reach the general population the MSM (mainstream media) has to report on it."" Reporting matters. But it’s a reach to dismiss Twitter, which says its mission is to ""give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers."" The California-based platform, which permits individuals and groups to post brief messages generally viewable to anyone who cares to peek, became a durable social-media phenomenon after its embrace at Austin’s South by Southwest in 2007. As of July 2017, the president’s @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account had more than 34 million followers. By then, Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, had 92 million followers, a ""followership"" built over many more years in politics. So, do just 15 percent of Americans see Twitter directly? Cuban’s backup Twitter itself says that as of the end of June 2017, it had 328 million monthly active users. The company said that 79 percent of Twitter accounts were based outside the United States. When we asked Cuban the basis of his cited 15 percent figure, he said by email that he saw it in a report in 2016. He said we could confirm the number by talking to any analyst of Twitter’s stock or by engaging the company. A stock analyst Our emails to Twitter media representatives went unanswered, but we connected with Perry Gold, a New York-based stock analyst identified by Twitter Inc. as one of more than 30 analysts of its stock. Gold, of MoffettNathanson LLC, a media and telecommunications research firm, pointed out internal metrics made public by Twitter covering the first quarter of 2017. In the four months, according to the figures, Twitter had 70 million monthly active U.S. users, up 3 million from the last four months of 2016, the company noted in an April 2017 letter to shareholders. Our run at perspective: The U.S. population was 323 million as of July 2016 including nearly 249 million residents age 18 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So you could assert, roughly, that 22 percent of all Americans engaged with Twitter in the first few months of 2017. Removing minors from the population count leaves you with nearly 249 million residents, perhaps opening the way to estimate that up to 28 percent of U.S. adults used Twitter in the year’s first quarter--again, a rough estimate. Gold also pointed out that according to a June 2017 ranking of digital media platforms by Comscore, a cross-platform measurement company, Twitter that month ranked 13th nationally with 110,290,000 unique U.S. visitors/viewers. At No. 1, per Comscore, Google had 241,433,000 unique U.S. visitors/viewers. Another speculative calculation: If you assume the Google count reflects nearly every U.S. user of the Internet, then you could say the count of Twitter’s unique visitors/viewers was about 46 percent of all the U.S. online population for the month. Experts caution We sought independent expert analysis from professors pointed out by Kathleen McElroy of the University of Texas including Dhiraj Murthy, author of a book on Twitter for social communication, who called ""monthly active users,"" the indicator aired by Twitter, ""a very difficult metric with lots of limitations as even bots or quite occasional users can be incorporated into these numbers, depending on how calculations are done."" Most research agrees, Murthy said by email, that most tweets go unread or passed along. Meredith Clark, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of North Texas, and a University of North Carolina ""big data"" colleague, Deen Freelon, each suggested we consider the results of a Pew Research Center survey of 1,520 U.S. adults taken in March-April 2016 finding that while 79 percent of online Americans reported using Facebook, 24 percent reported using Twitter. ""On a total population basis (accounting for Americans who do not use the internet at all),"" Pew wrote, that means 68 percent of U.S. adults are Facebook users and 21 percent use Twitter.        SOURCE: Web post, ""24% of online adults (21% of all Americans) use Twitter,"" Pew Research Center, Nov. 10, 2016 Per Twitter, survey respondents were asked: ""Do you ever use the internet or a mobile app to use Twitter?"" While 24 percent said yes to the query, 75 percent had not ever done so, Pew found. ""Roughly one-quarter of online adults (24%) use Twitter, a proportion that is statistically unchanged from a survey conducted in 2015 (23%). ""Younger Americans are more likely than older Americans to be on Twitter. Some 36% of online adults ages 18-29 are on the social network, more than triple the share among online adults ages 65 and older (just 10% of whom are Twitter users). ""Twitter is also somewhat more popular among the highly educated: 29% of internet users with college degrees use Twitter, compared with 20% of those with high school degrees or less,"" Pew said. Both professors saw potential complications in Cuban’s statement. Clark said by email: ""Cuban's claim rests on the assumption that everyone has an equal probability of seeing any other user's tweets, which we don't, because of Twitter's algorithms and our own decisions on whom to follow, re-tweet, mute, block, etc.,"" Clark wrote. Freelon elaborated: ""Philosophically, your rating of Mr. Cuban's statement may depend on how the term ‘reach’ is defined. Limiting the focus to people who see a tweet directly on Twitter is one approach,"" he wrote, ""but some tweets get seen because they’re mentioned in news coverage or discussed elsewhere online. Freelon said a ""liberal definition of the term ‘reach’ pulls in many more people. Exactly"" how ""many is probably impossible to say with any degree of certainty."" Our ruling Cuban said: ""Twitter reaches only 15 percent of the population."" A 2016 survey and more recent Twitter metrics suggest that around 21 percent of U.S. residents at least peek at tweets. Cuban’s larger point--that most of us are not Twitter-locked--holds up. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

'Thousands' of transgender Americans serve in military, congressman says
","A California congressman fired back at President Donald Trump’s Twitter announcement barring transgender service members, saying the decision will affect thousands of people. Trump announced the decision in a series of tweets on July 26, 2017. ""After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,"" Trump wrote. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., later told CNN anchors John Berman and Poppy Harlow that Trump’s policy will force good people into hiding and prevent them from serving their country. ""You've got thousands of people serving in the military who are transgender and they're doing a fantastic job,"" said Lieu, who holds the rank of colonel in the Air Force Reserves. Lieu repeated the sentiment in a statement he also echoed on his Facebook page and Twitter account. We wondered how many service members identified as transgender, something the U.S. Defense Department didn’t disclose to us. But a couple of estimates show that there are likely thousands of transgender soldiers, sailors and airmen. Trump’s announcement reversed a policy announced under President Barack Obama in June 2016 that ended the service ban on transgender Americans, which had stayed in place even after Congress repealed the so-called Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell law for gays and lesbians in December 2010. Transgender soldiers, airmen and sailors would have faced being medically discharged for disclosing that information, but Obama’s policy allowed those service members to serve openly if they chose. His administration gave the military until July 1, 2017, to fully implement the rule. On June 30, Defense Secretary James Mattis delayed implementation by six months, before Trump appeared to revoke the rule entirely via Twitter. As many as 250 service members have asked to formally change their preferred genders, or have already been approved, the Associated Press has reported. The Defense Department would not elaborate on Trump’s announcement, including how many transgender people served in the military. Reports have said the Pentagon does not keep track of transgender personnel. Instead they sent us to the military’s transgender policy web page, which as of this writing had not yet been updated. A Defense Department spokesman said the policy would be revised ""in the near future,"" with White House input. A Trump spokesman did not answer our attempts to contact him. Lieu spokesman Jack d’Annabale said the congressman got his estimate from a May 2014 brief by researchers at UCLA’s Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy. They used responses to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, sent to respondents by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality. The definition of transgender included ""those whose gender identity or expression differs from those traditionally associated with their assigned sex at birth,"" according to the study. Extrapolating that 0.3 percent of the population identified as transgender, UCLA’s researchers estimated that there were ""approximately 15,500 transgender individuals are serving on active duty or in the Guard or Reserve forces."" It also said that about 134,400 transgender people were veterans or retired. Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2015 used data from the UCLA brief and other sources to determine that 12,800 service member would be eligible for transgender health care. The study suggested of those, 188 would use benefits for transition services, at a cost of $4.2 million to $5.6 million. More recently, the Pentagon commissioned a June 2016 RAND Corporation report studying the effects of integrating transgender service members. (CNN’s Berman actually mentioned this one during Lieu’s interview.) The think tank estimated that there were between 1,320 and 6,630 active duty transgender personnel, and between 830 and 4,160 in the reserves. The midrange estimates were for 2,450 active duty and 1,510 reserve duty service members. As a side note to Trump’s concern over costs: Only a fraction of active duty transgender service members were likely to seek medical treatment, the study said, resulting in a high-end estimate of an $8.4 million increase in health care costs, or 0.13 percent. The RAND study used the National Transgender Discrimination Survey and other surveys, including private insurance data. RAND started with a lower population prevalence than UCLA did — 0.19 percent instead of 0.3 percent — accounting for the lower figure. If we combine the top RAND estimates for active duty and reserves, between 2,150 and 10,790 active duty and reserve service members may identify as transgender. Defense Department projections for the 2017 fiscal year were for 1.28 million active duty personnel and a little more than 800,000 in the reserves. Lieu said, ""You've got thousands of people serving in the military who are transgender and they're doing a fantastic job."" There are no solid numbers from the Defense Department, but two sources have provided recent estimates extrapolated from survey and insurance data. One 2014 UCLA brief estimated as many as 15,500 active duty and reserve service members may identify as transgender. A 2016 RAND Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon suggested between 2,150 and 10,790 active and reserve duty troops. While both estimates said there are likely thousands of transgender people in the military, those are still estimates. Lieu should note that in his talking point.

How many people in the military are transgender?
","An announcement by President Donald Trump on Twitter that the U.S. government ""will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military"" drew an almost immediate denunciation from U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. The Madison-area Democrat called the decision ""outrageous and shameful"" and ""based in discrimination"" in a news release issued July 26, 2017. He concluded by stating: ""With more than 15,000 transgender Americans serving in the military today, President Trump should immediately reverse course on his decision and he should stop using shocking policy shifts on Twitter to distract Americans from his failing health care plan."" Given that the issue of transgender troops may be unfamiliar to many readers, we thought we’d check Pocan’s claim that more than 15,000 are serving in the military. No official data The Pentagon has said it does not know how many transgender people serve in uniform because until 2016, they faced discharge if they revealed their identities. A Pentagon spokesman did not reply when we asked if the the Pentagon has any estimates. The U.S. Census Bureau also does not collect data on sexual orientation or gender identity. (In April 2016, more than 75 members of Congress wrote to the Census Bureau to request the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity as a subject for the bureau’s regular American Community Survey. The bureau concluded, according to a March 2017 memo, that ""there was no federal data need"" to include those.) So, there are no official statistics on the number of transgender people in the military. That leaves us with two prominently cited studies that produced estimates which vary. 2014 study To support Pocan’s statement, his office referred us to a 2014 report by UCLA Law School’s Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy. (The Human Rights Campaign and the National Center for Transgender Equality pointed us to the same study.) That study estimated that 15,500 transgender individuals were serving on active duty or in the Guard or Reserve forces. The study said its primary source was a national survey done by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality, which the researchers said was the largest sample of transgender people in the United States available at the time. That survey was conducted over a six-month period starting in the fall of 2008. ""Data that allow for a direct tabulation of the number of transgender individuals who serve in the U.S. military simply do not exist,"" the researchers wrote. ""The estimates in this research brief rely on a variety of assumptions that could affect their accuracy."" They added, however, that ""the estimates certainly suggest that transgender individuals are part of the active duty U.S. armed forces, perhaps in portions that exceed that of the general population."" 2016 study A 2016 study by the RAND Corp., commissioned by the Pentagon, reported lower figures than the UCLA study. The RAND researchers estimated between 1,320 and 6,630 active duty and between 830 and 4,160 in the reserves. That would be a total of between 2,150 and 10,790 transgender service members, based on figures for people serving in the military in 2014. The study said the estimate was derived from data from multiple surveys. And the reseachers noted: ""It is important to note that there have been no rigorous epidemiological studies of the size"" of the U.S. transgender population, including those who serve in the military. Asked about the difference between the two studies, Pocan’s spokesman told us: ""Whenever we have multiple studies, we try to take the more inclusive one."" Our rating Pocan said: ""More than 15,000 transgender Americans"" are ""serving in the military today."" A UCLA study estimated the figure is 15,500, while a more recent study by the RAND Corp. estimated 2,150 to 10,790. There are no official counts, so Pocan goes too far in flatly stating his figure. But his figure matches one of two prominently cited estimates.

Did Cher move to Canada because of Donald Trump?
","Cher’s prolific use of Twitter to criticize President Donald Trump has prompted an obscure website to claim the singer is moving to Canada because of his policies. ""BREAKING: A Hollywood Star Is Moving To Canada Because Of President Trump,"" said a headline for a story published July 14, 2017 on conservativearmy88.com. ""Many Hollywood celebrities announced that they will move in another country if Donald Trump won the elections. Well, the elections were held 7 months ago and he won, but no celebrity kept the promise,"" the post said. (The presidential election was held more than seven months ago, Nov. 8, 2016). The article speculated on Cher’s relocation, even though the headline presented a more affirmative claim. ""However, singer Cher may be the first to move to Canada because of the President. As Trump announced he wants to change the Obamacare, she took it to Twitter to express her anger,"" the post said. Several celebrities did say they would leave the United States, including to Canada, if Trump was elected. On her part, Cher joked she would move to another planet, Jupiter. In reply to a Twitter user, Cher wrote on June 16, 2015, the day Trump announced his candidacy: ""IF HE WERE TO BE ELECTED,IM MOVING TO JUPITER 😖"" We reached out to the singer via social media for comment but did not get a response. Cher’s website lists a series of upcoming performances in Las Vegas and Washington for the rest of the year. And while her Twitter feed features a series of tweets criticizing Trump and his policies, a search of the word ""Canada"" in her tweets did not yield any message saying she had moved up north. Cher also attended the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21. ""I want to let people know that I'm here for them and I believe in this movement,"" Cher told the Los Angeles Times. It’s also worth noting that conservativearmy88.com’s website does not have any information identifying who runs it, its mission, where it’s based or other information that credible news organizations publish on their website. Its post don’t have author names and are all posted by a site administrator, ""admin."" Conservativearmy88.com’s Facebook page lists a Hotmail email address.

Is Amazon a ‘no-tax monopoly,’ as Donald Trump said?
","President Donald Trump took to Twitter to launch his latest salvo at Amazon, accusing the company of being a monopolistic tax cheat. ""Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?"" Trump tweeted. This is not the first time Trump has feuded with the online retail giant led by Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, which has published a number of news stories that have angered Trump. The president’s description of Amazon struck us as questionable. So we decided to look into it. With more than $136 billion in sales last year, there’s no doubt about Amazon’s status as an online shopping empire. But Amazon is not a monopoly, said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on antitrust law. A monopoly exists when a company so dominates a market that it can reduce output and cause a rise in prices over a substantial period of time. This level of market control is outlawed by antitrust statutes designed to promote competition for the benefit of consumers. ""We measure an antitrust violation by looking at consumer harm -- not harm to competitors,"" Hovenkamp said. ""Most complaints about Amazon come from competitors. By and large, Amazon is pretty good with customers, so you don’t usually hear consumers squawking about this."" Monopoly law typically kicks in when a company controls about 75 percent of a given market, Hovenkamp said. He noted that in 2000, Microsoft was deemed to be a monopoly because of its control of over 90 percent of the market for Windows-based computers. But no U.S. tribunal ― whether federal or state court, or the Federal Trade Commission ― has ever found Amazon to be a monopoly, Hovenkamp said. Trump is wrong to say Amazon is not subject to tax. Like other businesses, Amazon pays taxes on corporate income, property, payroll and unemployment insurance, said Joseph Henchman, the executive vice president of the business-backed Tax Foundation. Amazon has also recently changed its policy on state sales tax, he added. According to regulatory filings, Amazon paid a combined total of $412 million in federal, state, local and foreign taxes last year. In 2015 it paid $273 million in combined taxes, and $177 million the previous year. But Amazon has faced criticism for taking advantage of tax breaks and loopholes. Only 13 percent of Amazon’s profits went to federal, state, local and foreign taxes from 2007 through 2015, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. For the sake of comparison, that’s about half the average amount S&P 500 companies paid over the same period. Amazon’s combined tax burden also falls well below the official U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent. In fact, one study found Amazon paid just a 9.3 percent effective federal income tax between 2008 and 2012. Nonetheless, Trump is wrong to say they’ve avoided tax collectors altogether. At the state level, Amazon, which launched online in 1995, long resisted charging a sales tax. But by 2012, it was collecting and paying sales tax in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Today, the company collects taxes in all states where state sales taxes exist, plus Washington, D.C. (all states except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon collect sales tax). Henchman noted that taxes apply to all of Amazon’s own sales, but not the large percentage of sales by other sellers using the Amazon platform. The digital retail giant’s decision to collect state sales tax is mostly voluntary. That’s because a 1992 Supreme Court ruling effectively restricts states from forcing online retailers to pay state and local sales taxes if the company has no brick-and-mortar property or employees in the state. The court’s ruling left the door open for Congress to override its decision through legislation -- and Amazon has lobbied Congress to do so by passing the Marketplace Fairness Act, which would subject online retailers to state sales tax. ""We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system,"" Amazon wrote in its 2016 regulatory filing. Currently, Amazon does not have physical buildings or employ workers in all the states where it charges taxes, though its footprint has grown in recent years and may grow larger still if its plan to acquire Whole Foods comes to fruition. Trump said Amazon has a ""no-tax monopoly."" Amazon is an industry giant, but it does not exert enough market control to be considered a monopoly, and no U.S. tribunal has ever deemed it as such. While Amazon takes advantage of tax breaks and loopholes, it pays federal corporate tax, and charges sales taxes in 46 U.S. jurisdictions. It also supports federal legislation that would require other online retailers to pay state tax on internet sales. Trump’s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

It's fake news that Obama seized Russian mansions as gifts for Sasha and Malia
","Two Russian diplomats’ mansions in New York and Maryland that were seized in December as punishment for Russia’s meddling in the election made headlines again last week when Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov demanded the properties be returned. ""We think that the diplomatic property must be returned without any conditions and talks,"" Peskov told CNN Monday. The properties have sat empty since the sanctions were imposed, but a fake news story has come up with a creative repurposing for them. A post that appeared on Newsfeedhunter.com on July 12, 2017, said that Obama seized the mansions as gifts for his daughters, Sasha and Malia. ""It looks like Obummer wasn’t actually trying to punish Russia for anything after all (since there’s nothing to punish them FOR) — he was actually just trying to get a couple of free mansions for his brats while kissing up to his ignorant base of drooling libtards,"" the post said. The intelligence community has already confirmed that Russia meddled in the election, but even so, there’s no way Obama could have gifted the mansions to his family. The Russian properties will be held by U.S. government until the issue with Russia is resolved, according to Harley Balzer, a government and international affairs professor at Georgetown University. It would then take years to transfer ownership to anyone. ""Almost 40 years after the United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran (which we have certainly not done with Russia) the Iranian embassy on Massachusetts Avenue has still not been turned over to the Obama girls for parties,"" said Steve Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Captions on photos of the two houses say the girls won’t be getting the mansions because President Donald Trump will return the mansions to the Russian government, but the fate of the properties hasn’t been confirmed yet, hence Peskov’s demand. ""Those properties to which you refer are part of a larger dialogue with the Russian Federation,"" Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. ""There are a whole host of issues we're discussing with the Russian Federation, but my commitment is that we will consult with you on this issue before any final implementation of an agreement that we don't have yet with the Russian Federation,"" Sullivan said.

Half True attack on Scott Walker and if Wisconsin for 3 years straight is last in business starts
","On the day he announced his run for governor of Wisconsin, Democrat and political newcomer Andy Gronik attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. The afternoon drive-time host, John Mercure, asked Gronik on July 11, 2017 how he would pay for his proposal to provide free college to needy students who have good grades, and how much Gronik’s idea would cost. The suburban Milwaukee businessman responded by making statistical claims criticizing Walker’s record on jobs, including this one: ""We are 50th out of 50 states -- so we're dead last in creating new businesses in the state of Wisconsin for three years in a row."" That would be a strong counter to Walker’s frequent boasts about how the state’s unemployment rate has dropped during his time as governor. It’s also a claim Gronik made in two other interviews. Let’s see if he’s right. Counting isn’t necessarily simple It’s worth noting at the top that even a simple count of new businesses isn’t necessarily simple. While running for governor in 2010, Walker promised to create 10,000 new businesses during his first term. Near the end of the term, the number of registered business entities had risen by more than 25,000. But we found the count of registered businesses is a general economic indicator with severe limitations. The count includes not only new ventures that bring new jobs, but thousands of entities with no workers on the payroll at all -- and little if any prospect of hires to come. Those include hundreds of nonprofits such as Scout troops and thousands of limited-liability companies set up by real-estate investors solely to hold ownership of property or properties. As we’ll see, Gronik’s claim also has issues. Gronik’s evidence To back Gronik’s claim, his campaign referred us to a May 2017 news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on the 2017 Kauffman Index of Startup Activity. The index is produced by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, one of the country’s leading entrepreneurship advocacy and research organizations. Wisconsin did, in fact, rank last among the 50 states in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in startup activity, according to the index. But the Kauffman index is not simply a count of new business creations, which is what Gronik’s claim is about -- it is a combination of three measures that Kauffman thinks are important in assessing startup activity. One measure is the number of startup firms less than a year old that employed at least one person for every 1,000 such businesses in the state. The other two measures are the percentage of adults who become entrepreneurs and the percentage of new entrepreneurs who started businesses primarily because they saw a market opportunity, rather than because they were unemployed. Wisconsin ranked last because its overall index for the three measures (-3.65) was the lowest -- significantly below Alabama, the 49th-ranked state, at -2.69. Nevada ranked No. 1, at 3.22. We found two more narrowly tailored federal data sets that help evaluate Gronik’s statement. BLS rankings When we posed Gronik’s statement to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency suggested we look at its data on ""establishment births"" -- the number of new businesses created in a particular year -- as a percentage of all business establishments in each state. Wisconsin does better on this measure, ranking near the middle. The most recent figures show that for the first three quarters of 2016, new establishments accounted for 6.7 percent of all business establishments in Wisconsin, a rank of 29th, according to our calculations. It ranked 34th in 2015 and 32nd in 2014. Census rankings We were also directed to U.S. Census Bureau data on new businesses that had employees. But it is less useful, given that the latest data is for 2014.   For 2014, Wisconsin ranked 44th when considering the percentage of firms in the state that were created during that year. A firm is defined as a business that has one or more establishments. Viewed another way, Wisconsin ranked 46th for the percentage of establishments that were opened in 2014. An establishment is a single location where business is done. (The BLS data is collected from administrative records and cover a wider spectrum of business establishments. The Census data is collected using a survey and covers a more limited set of businesses.) Our rating Gronik said Wisconsin is ""dead last in creating new businesses"" for ""three years in a row."" He’s correct when citing the 2015, 2016 and 2017 rankings from the respected nonprofit Kauffman Index on Startup Activity. But that index, while it takes into account what portion of a state’s businesses were created in a given year, also considers two other variables. So, it supports Gronik’s statement only to a point. Conversely, Wisconsin ranked between 29th and 34th for 2014 through 2016, according to the latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those rankings are based strictly on the percentage of a state’s business establishments that were created in each year.

Yes, Chuck Schumer, oil prices do sometimes fall
","What goes up must come down, the old saying goes. But, according to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., that’s not the case for oil prices. As part of a round of appearances to tout a new Democratic economic-policy agenda, Schumer took a moment on ABC’s This Week to promote his party’s plan to curb mergers that aren’t in the interest of consumers. ""We're going to change the way companies can merge,"" Schumer said. ""We have these huge companies buying up other big companies. It hurts workers and it hurts prices. The old Adam Smith idea of competition, it's gone. So people hate it when their cable bills go up, their airline fees. They know that gas prices are sticky. You know … when the price for oil goes up on the markets, it goes right up, but it never goes down."" However, this broad statement clashes with the long-term data for gasoline and crude oil prices. There are long stretches over the past four decades when inflation-adjusted gasoline prices have gone down. Here’s a chart from the Energy Information Administration, a federal office that tracks energy statistics.  And here’s the inflation-adjusted data for imported crude oil. The pattern is similar.    Clearly, gasoline and crude oil prices aren’t simply on an eternal escalator to infinity, as one might think hearing Schumer. So what’s going on? When we checked with Schumer’s office, they said he was referring to the ""rise like a rocket, fall like a feather"" theory of gas prices. Under this theory, gasoline prices tend to go up quickly if there’s a market shock, then fall more slowly after supply and demand resolve themselves. Schumer sees that pattern as one example of how big companies can sometimes have too much power to control prices, regardless of market forces. But when we ran Schumer’s statement by Severin Borenstein, a University of California-Berkeley economist who wrote a seminal paper on the rocket-feather theory in 1997, he said the senator’s formulation is off-base. He said that while it is true that retail gasoline prices decline more slowly than they rise, the time frame for these changes is fairly short -- two weeks to go up, and six weeks or more to go down. Schumer’s statement suggests an iron rule, not a pattern for short-term changes following a market shock. ""You don't have to be an economist or analyst of oil markets to know that the statement isn't correct,"" Borenstein told PolitiFact. ""Obviously, gasoline prices do go down when oil prices decline. The change in gasoline prices since the 2014 collapse in oil prices made that very clear."" Meanwhile, Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, a private firm, said that Schumer’s targets -- monopoly-minded companies -- aren’t necessarily to blame. He pointed to a study of 420 gas stations in San Diego in 2000 and 2001 that looked at the psychology and behavior of consumers. If a consumer sees a relatively low price, the study found, they won’t bother searching aggressively for a price that’s lower still, even though such bargains may exist around the corner. When such behavior is multiplied across many drivers, gas stations feel less pressure to reduce prices further than they already have, slowing the fall of gas prices. And economist Philip K. Verleger, who runs the firm PKVerleger LLC, said Schumer may also have an outdated view of how the oil markets work. ""There’s a more competitive market today -- the futures market runs everything now,"" he said. ""The futures can predict your local gas prices, and the response is more symmetric (before and after a market shock) than it was."" Schumer said, ""When the price for oil goes up on the markets, it goes right up, but it never goes down."" This comment takes a well-known phenomenon and exaggerates it beyond recognition. While experts agree that prices tend to go up quickly after a market shock but usually come down more slowly once the shock is resolved, this phenomenon only occurs on a short-term basis -- a couple of weeks in most cases. Long-term data show long stretches since the mid 1970s when the inflation-adjusted price of gasoline and crude oil have fallen.

Is Donald Trump right that U.S. just 'had the best jobs report in 16 years'?
","During a speech before tens of thousands of Boy Scouts at the group’s quadrennial Jamboree, President Donald Trump took a moment to tout his economic achievements as president. ""I'll tell you what, we are indeed making America great again,""  Trump said. ""What's going on is incredible. We had the best jobs report in 16 years."" Trump, as a candidate, regularly bashed the low unemployment rates under President Barack Obama as making the national jobs picture look better than it actually was. Now he says the economy is surging, and the numbers show it. Does he have a point now? When we checked with the White House, they referred us to a Bloomberg article headlined, ""Pickup in Confidence Shows Americans Upbeat on Jobs, Economy."" The article notes that ""unemployment (is) near a 16-year low."" Indeed, today’s unemployment rate -- 4.4 percent -- is tied for the lowest in the past 16 years, going back to June 2001. There were four other months prior to Trump’s presidency that matched today’s rate, and it was slightly lower -- 4.3 percent -- a month earlier, during Trump’s own presidency. Here’s a chart. That said, the term ""jobs report"" refers to a monthly news release by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the unemployment rate is only one of two headline numbers in those reports. The other one is the gain or loss in jobs compared to the previous month’s number. That second number, while solid, is not ""the best"" in 16 years. According to the June 2017 report, the economy gained 222,000 jobs. That’s the 52nd-best monthly performance out of the 193 months since June 2001. Here’s a chart: Meanwhile, there are a number of lower-profile statistics in every jobs report. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, noted that one of these measurements -- the ratio of employed people to the population as a whole -- remains stuck well below its pre-Great Recession highs. Here’s a chart:  Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, said the shrinkage in the number of jobs created per month should be taken with a grain of salt, since the country is approaching full employment. Overall, Burtless said, ""employment has kept rising and involuntary unemployment has been falling for about seven years, and that pattern has persisted thus far in the Trump administration."" Finally, it’s worth noting, as we always do, that no president can take full credit for the economy’s achievements (or its shortcomings). Many other factors, including the health of the rest of the world economy and changes in demographics and technology, play a role as well. This is especially true for a president just six months into his tenure, following years of improvement under his predecessor. Trump said that ""we had the best jobs report in 16 years"" in the most recent monthly release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate, one of two key figures in the monthly release, is near its 16-year low. But while the other major statistic in the report -- the job-gains figure -- is hardly unprecedented over the same period, experts say that’s not surprising, given where the country is in the current economic cycle.

In tweet, Donald Trump revives charge of improper ties between Hillary Clinton, acting FBI chief
","In an early morning tweet, President Donald Trump revived an allegation he’d previously used against FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency until the president’s pick for a new director, Christopher Wray, receives Senate confirmation. The tweet said: ""Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!"" Trump’s anger seems to be that his campaign is being investigated for its communications with Russia while Clinton, his former opponent, is no longer in the political spotlight. But his tweet about Andrew McCabe is a significant distortion of the facts. And the implication that McCabe got Clinton off as a political favor doesn’t make much sense when we look at the evidence.   In 2015, Dr. Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, was recruited by Virginia’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, to run for one of the 40 seats in the state’s Republican-controlled Senate. McAuliffe co-chaired Bill Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign and chaired Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2008 run for president. According to the Wall Street Journal, which broke the story, McAuliffe and other Virginia Democrats met with McCabe and her husband, Andrew, on March 7, 2015, to urge her to run as part of an effort to take back the state Senate. At the time, Andrew McCabe was assistant director of the FBI's field office in Washington. He had focused much of his career on the fight against terrorism. The FBI released a statement that Andrew McCabe ""consulted with top FBI headquarters and field office ethics officers for guidance, including briefings on the Hatch Act, to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest, in the event she decided to go forward."" Based on that advice, the FBI said, when Dr. McCabe chose to run, Andrew McCabe and FBI lawyers ""implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign. During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind."" News that Clinton was using a private email account in violation of federal record-keeping requirements, broke March 2, 2015. McCabe announced her candidacy 10 days later on March 12, 2015. That July, the FBI was called in to begin a criminal investigation into the use of Clinton's private server at her home in New York. And that same month, Andrew McCabe was promoted to associate deputy director, the third in command at the FBI. He moved to FBI headquarters in September. Both McAuliffe, through his political action committee, and the state Democratic Party, donated to Dr. McCabe's campaign. In October 2015, McAuliffe's PAC, Common Good VA, gave Dr. McCabe's campaign a total of $450,000. (An additional $17,500 had been given earlier). The Democratic Party of Virginia spent $207,788 around the same time for mailings on her behalf. That would amount to 40 percent of the $1.7 million spent by the campaign. Two other Democrats running for other state Senate seats, Jeremy Pike and Dan Gecker, got larger amounts from McAuliffe's PAC. In November, Dr. McCabe lost her race to incumbent Republican Dick Black. On Feb. 1, 2016, three months after his wife's defeat, Andrew McCabe became the FBI's deputy director. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI said it was the first time McCabe had any oversight role over the Clinton case. ""Months after the completion of (his wife's) campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails,"" according to the FBI statement. Now let’s break down the elements of Trump’s tweet This is overstated. The FBI has confirmed that McCabe had an ""oversight role,"" but it’s a stretch to say he was ""in charge"" of it. Then-FBI Director James Comey, not McCabe, made the decision that the Justice Department would not file charges against Clinton. Comey has repeatedly explained his decision under oath. This is wrong. McCabe never ""got"" the money for his wife. The FBI ethics agreement required McCabe not to participate in fundraising for his wife’s campaign, or support of any kind. She worked independently to secure the funding for her candidacy. It wasn’t quite that much, but it was close. The money from McAuliffe’s PAC and the state party totaled $675,288. This is significantly misleading. While McAuliffe is a longstanding political ally of the Clintons, there has been no evidence that Clinton or her campaign were involved in the contributions or knew they were being made. McAuliffe’s interest in Dr. McCabe’s race is fully explainable by his personal desire to elect more Democratic lawmakers at the state level so that he could enact his legislative agenda -- not because of McCabe’s eventual role in an investigation that he hadn’t yet become involved in. Trump tweeted, ""The person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from (Hillary Clinton) for wife!"" This tweet distorts key elements of the story, severely undercutting its accuracy. A Virginia state candidate married to an FBI official did get donations from a longtime Clinton supporter, McAuliffe, who was also the Democratic governor of Virginia. But the tweet ignores at the spouse played no role in fundraising for his wife’s campaign, and it ignores that that McAuliffe made the donations on his own, for state-level political goals -- not to influence an investigation that Andrew McCabe wasn’t even involved in yet.

Are George W. Bush, Dick Cheney unable to visit Europe due to threat of arrest?
","Former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney have been out of office for more than five years, but that doesn’t mean the rest of the world has forgotten about them. In many countries, policies that Bush and Cheney spearheaded to fight terrorism continue to color views of the former United States leaders -- most notably the opening of the detainee center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the use of waterboarding and other ""enhanced interrogation"" methods that many consider torture. A reader recently sent us a social media meme that captured this sentiment. It shows a photograph of the two men, with the caption, ""When I was growing up, I would never have believed that a former president and vice president of the United States would be unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants."" The idea that Bush and Cheney could be arrested overseas isn’t entirely far-fetched. In 1998, Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London after Spain requested extradition for charges related to the murders of Spanish citizens in Chile during his time in office. In addition, Israeli politicians Tzipi Livni and Dan Meridor canceled trips to the United Kingdom in 2009 and 2010 amid threats of legal action, in Livni’s case for an Israeli strike on Gaza and in Meridor’s case an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship headed to Gaza. (The British government later changed the law, allowing Livni and others to make subsequent visits.) In 2005 Donald Rumsfeld nearly pulled out of a conference in Germany until receiving prosecutors’ assurances that he wouldn’t be arrested, according to the Guardian. Bush attracted significant media attention in 2011 when he canceled a trip to Geneva, Switzerland, to address the United Israel Appeal. A lawyer for the group told a Swiss newspaper that the cancellation stemmed from concerns about protests, not fear of arrest. Given all this, we wondered: Are there really outstanding warrants against Bush and Cheney from a legitimate authority, as the meme suggests? And are the two men in any danger of being arrested if they leave the United States? So we took a closer look. Arrest warrants and the International Criminal Court Interpol, the international police organization, does not list any outstanding arrest warrants for Bush or Cheney in their searchable database. Meanwhile, experts in international law said they were not aware of pending warrants, particularly from the most obvious entity that might issue one -- the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The ICC is a permanent, independent court that investigates and brings to justice individuals who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, according to the Congressional Research Service. Cases may be referred to the ICC either by a member state, the court’s own prosecutor, or the U.N. Security Council. The court only investigates and prosecutes serious crimes by individuals (not by organizations or governments), and then, only when national judicial systems are unwilling or unable to handle them. However, the ICC ""has not issued warrants for any American citizen, let alone for Bush, Cheney, or anyone else,"" said Anthony Clark Arend, Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service. Brett Schaefer, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said that the ICC has undertaken two preliminary examinations involving Iraq and Afghanistan -- an early step in the process. But in neither case does action seem imminent. In the case of Iraq, the prosecutor has said that the ICC lacks jurisdiction for several reasons, including that Iraq is not a party to the statute that established the court, and that the U.N. Security Council has not referred the situation to the ICC. Action on Afghanistan, which is an ICC party, is more plausible, and the preliminary examination first made public in 2007 is ongoing. However, Schaefer said, ""it is uncertain whether the court will actually proceed to a formal case."" But even if the ICC did advance its investigation to a later stage, the most important takeaway is that neither Bush nor Cheney would be personally at risk. While 122 nations have become members, the United States has not -- and that makes a big difference in cases such as this. While the court may prosecute individuals from ICC-state parties, such as the United Kingdom, for alleged crimes even in places like Iraq where it does not have jurisdiction, Schaefer said, the fact that the United States is not a party -- at least for now -- means ""this is not an issue for President Bush or Vice President Cheney."" Obstacles to prosecution It’s conceivable that national courts could take action instead, experts say. But while some non-governmental human-rights groups have pushed for criminal prosecutions, the experts we checked with were not aware of any pending, and public, warrants for Bush or Cheney. An obstacle to a national-court prosecution of Bush or Cheney is that ""most states don't have laws allowing for prosecution based on universal jurisdiction -- the international law principle that allows any state to try certain serious crimes, no matter where committed,"" said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. ""And some that do have cut them back in recent years due to fears of a flood of litigation or foreign-policy concerns."" A state that did seek to prosecute Bush or Cheney would face both the practical difficulty of carrying it out as well as an expected diplomatic backlash from the United States. ""No state has any interest in arresting a former U.S. president or vice president,"" Ratner said. ""Say goodbye to good relations with the U.S.!"" This reality, he said, makes the likelihood of a prosecution of Bush or Cheney ""highly doubtful."" Where Bush and Cheney have traveled outside the United States We couldn’t find any examples of Bush or Cheney visiting Europe, but they have traveled to other countries since they left office. Bush visited Haiti as part of an effort by the charitable foundation he co-founded with former President Bill Clinton after a devastating earthquake in the Caribbean nation. And Bush also joined Clinton at a regional economic summit held in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Cheney, meanwhile, has gone to British Columbia to promote his book, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir. But these trips weren’t without turbulence. Typically, protesters have followed both Bush and Cheney at such events. At his book event, Cheney faced a crowd of 200 people chanting and holding signs that said, ""Cheney War Criminal"" and ""Torturer,"" according to the Canadian television network CBC. The incident was serious enough for police to don riot gear, and it led to one arrest. As for Bush’s trip to the regional summit in Canada, it attracted a similar-sized crowd but was somewhat more peaceful, according to the CBC. Meanwhile, both Bush and Cheney have canceled speaking engagements in Toronto, though their camps did not cite concerns about arrest warrants as the reason. Cheney cited ""personal safety"" concerns, while Bush chalked it up to a ""scheduling change."" Our ruling The meme on social media said that Bush and Cheney are ""unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants."" The claim that there are ""outstanding warrants"" is flat wrong. And while it’s theoretically possible for a national court to issue an arrest warrant against either man, as was done with Pinochet, there is no sign of that happening. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBE70C0>],/factchecks/2014/jul/17/facebook-posts/are-george-w-bush-dick-cheney-unable-visit-europe-/

Rick Santorum: We are accepting more legal immigrants than ever
","The country’s focus is trained on headlines about illegal immigration. But a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum made us wonder about the other side of our immigration policy. What’s the trend for immigrants lawfully living in the United States? Santorum’s claim came up in a heated exchange with Detroit Free Press editorial page editor Stephen Henderson during the July 13, 2014, Meet the Press pundit panel. (We fact-checked another point from Santorum’s talking points, too.) ""First off, we are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history ..."" Santorum said before some crosstalk. ""It's all chain immigration. And it's from the very countries that people have been coming from, because most of the immigration is tied to people who are already here."" So is he right about the United States accepting more legal immigrants than ever? Like other immigration figures, there are a few ways to slice the data. In some ways, he is right. In others, he is not. We tried to ask Santorum which numbers he had in mind, but a spokeswoman for his group, Patriot Voices, could not be reached by email or Twitter. Experts directed us to the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, which publishes annual numbers of people obtaining lawful permanent resident status, or a ""green card,"" dating back to 1820 (see this chart for each year’s tally). Green card recipients exclude people who come to the country for short-term reasons, such as temporary work or studies. By the raw numbers The most obvious way to look at federal data is comparing raw numbers.  The government admitted the highest amount of lawful permanent residents in 1991, at 1.827 million people, followed by 1990, at 1.536 million. Those years are higher than the most recent decade’s annual admissions, which hovered around the 1 million mark. The 2013 total is 990,553, down 4 percent from 2012. Those peak years -- 1990 and 1991 -- are atypical, the result of a swath of people receiving green cards after winding through the process laid out in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, said Sumption, Migration Policy Institute director of international research. (That was the last time Congress enacted sweeping immigration reform, FYI.) The third all-time highest year is 1907, with admissions of 1.285 million people. That tops the 2006 tally of 1.266 million people and any other recent year. Looking at individual years, however, may not be as useful as the slightly broader trend, Sumption said. From 2004 to 2013, average annual admissions were 1.076 million. During the other comparable time period of 1905-1914, before numerical quotes on immigration were in place, the average was 1.012 million people. That’s slightly lower than our most recent decade. But that doesn’t mean Santorum’s claim is in the clear. By percentage of population Perhaps an even better comparison would be legal immigrants admitted over time as a percentage of the American population, other experts told us. In that case, the influx of immigrants was more dramatic at the turn of the century, when the country’s population was much smaller. ""Since the total population was 92 million in 1910, compared with 308 million in 2010, admitting more than 1 million immigrants in a single year (and this wasn't atypical of the decade) was much more significant,"" said Susan Martin, professor and director of Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of International Immigration. Looking at the data in this light allows for analysis of the country’s capacity for bringing in new people without risking competition in the labor market, Sumption said. ""Share of population is a better measure of the lived experience of immigration, the experience on the ground,"" she said. A big driver of the increase in recent years is the category for spouses of U.S. citizens, which isn’t too surprising considering the growing global economy and the fact that many people who come to the country for temporary purposes of work and study marry U.S. citizens, she said. Our ruling Santorum said, ""we are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history"" of the country. Over the last 10 years, in raw numbers, the United States has admitted slightly more immigrants into the country compared to any other 10-year period. But when you factor in the new arrivals as a share of the U.S. population, 1905-14 is the leading time period. And when looking just at raw numbers, the United States admitted more immigrants in 1907, 1990 and 1991.  In fact, the 2013 tally -- 990,553 -- would rank 20th all time. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB17440>],/factchecks/2014/jul/16/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-we-are-accepting-more-legal-immigran/
"['Legal Issues', 'PunditFact', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Rush Limbaugh revisits GOP support for Eric Holder's 2009 nomination
","In a recent edition of his talk radio show, Rush Limbaugh took umbrage at part of an interview that Attorney General Eric Holder gave to ABC News. During the interview with ABC, which aired on July 13, 2014, Holder suggested ""there's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed at me, directed at the president,"" adding ""there's a certain racial component to this for some people. I don't think this thing is a main driver, but for some there's a racial animus."" Limbaugh countered that Republicans gave Obama and Holder a fair shake in 2009, when he was nominated to be attorney general. ""The Republicans bent themselves into as many shapes as they could to agree with this president,"" Limbaugh said. ""They went out of the way to praise Holder's nomination.  I'll never forget that."" Limbaugh went on to add, ""By the way, not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination."" Given that Holder’s tenure has subsequently become a focal point for Republican disapproval of the Obama administration, we wondered, did at least some Republican senators go ""out of the way"" to praise Holder’s nomination in 2009? And when it came time to vote on his nomination for attorney general, did every Republican vote to confirm him? We took a spin through the archives and found Limbaugh is partly correct. (He did not respond to an inquiry.) Did Republicans go out of their way to praise Holder’s nomination? They did -- at least a number of them did -- in public fashion. While Holder received a tough grilling from senators in both parties at his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing -- that’s the panel’s job, after all. Several Republican senators went out of their way to praise him in their introductory comments. And they weren’t just the most moderate members of the GOP caucus. For instance, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said, ""Congratulations, Mr. Holder, on the nomination. You certainly bring excellent background and experience to the job as a federal prosecutor for a number of years and as a federal judge."" Sessions even compared Holder favorably to a Republican attorney general, Alberto Gonzales. ""I think you come to the office with far more experience than Attorney General Gonzales had,"" Sessions said. ""I thought he was a good man, but when you lack experience, sometimes, you can make errors unintentionally. I think former Attorney General Janet Reno was a state prosecutor but was really inexperienced in a lot of the big issues that come before an attorney general."" Then-Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said he had ""a number of questions to ask you, but I want to congratulate you and your family for an extraordinary American journey."" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, cited areas of common ground, including government transparency. ""I don't want to speak for you, Mr. Holder, but I think you agreed that you would work with us to open up the government, to make it more transparent and more accountable,"" Cornyn said. And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, ""I'm almost ready to vote for you right now."" That appears to have been a joke -- the transcript reports that Graham’s comment was followed by laughter -- but other portions of Graham’s opening statement were more serious. ""The president of the United States deserves the ability, within reason, to pick a lawyer in the attorney general that he or she has great confidence in,"" Graham said. ""And the fact that this president has chosen you speaks well for you. And given your resume, even though we have probably a lot of political differences, I could understand why he has great confidence in you."" Beyond the Senate, Holder received notable support from former Republican officials and officeholders. Former Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Bob Barr, R-Ga. -- both of whom were managers of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings in the House -- wrote letters of support for Holder, according to the trade publication Main Justice. So did Manus Cooney, the top aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Republican lawyers Ted Olson, George Terwilliger, Victoria Toensing and Joseph DiGenova. Of course, some of the senators’ comments could be characterized as simple good manners. Still, we do think they support Limbaugh’s assertion that Republicans ""went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination."" Did no Republican senator oppose Holder's nomination? This is where Limbaugh’s claim outstrips the facts. When the Senate voted on Holder’s nomination on Feb. 2, 2009, he was confirmed by a vote of 75-21. Those voting in favor included 19 Republicans: Graham, Hatch and Sessions, plus Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Robert Bennett (Utah), Kit Bond (Mo.), Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), Susan Collins (Maine), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Judd Gregg (N.H.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), Richard Lugar (Ind.), John McCain (Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pa.) and George Voinovich (Ohio). In fact, at the time, some conservative commentators were apoplectic that any Repubicans supported Holder. Michelle Malkin introduced the vote summary on her blog by writing, ""Here are your 19 Bend Over Republicans who voted yes on Holder. Some disappointing names on the list in addition to the usual suspects."" Among Holder’s 21 no votes -- all Republicans -- were two senators who offered praise during the committee hearing, Brownback and Cornyn. The other GOP senators who voted against Holder's nomination were: John Barrasso (Wyo.), Jim Bunning (Ky.), Richard Burr (N.C.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Jim DeMint (S.C.), John Ensign (Nev.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Kay Bailey Hutchison (Texas), James Inhofe (Okla.), Mike Johanns (Neb.), Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Jim Risch (Idaho), Pat Roberts (Kan.), Richard Shelby (Ala.), John Thune (S.D.), David Vitter (La.), and Roger Wicker (Miss.). Holder ended up getting more no votes than some nominees received (such as former Sen. Hillary Clinton for Secretary of State, who was confirmed 94-2) but fewer no votes received by other nominees (for instance, Timothy Geithner for Treasury Secretary, 60-34, and Kathleen Sebelius for Health and Human Services, 65-31). So on Holder’s vote totals, Limbaugh is wrong. However, it’s worth noting that the previous time Holder faced Senate confirmation, he was confirmed without any Republican dissent. When he was nominated for deputy attorney general by Clinton in 1997, Holder won confirmation by a perfect 100-0 vote. However, there is no indication in the transcript of Limbaugh’s show that he was referring to Holder’s 1997 confirmation. The discussion on his show was about how Obama was treated after he took office in 2009. Our ruling Limbaugh said Republicans ""went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination. ... Not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination."" He has a point that several prominent senators and other Republicans spoke highly of Holder as his nomination was being considered, but it’s not true that no GOP senator voted against Holder -- 21 did. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBBFC40>],/factchecks/2014/jul/16/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-revisits-gop-support-eric-holders-20/

Cokie Roberts: Chances of getting murdered in New York are 1 in 25,000; in Honduras it's 1 in 14
","After a bloody Fourth of July weekend in Chicago and a humanitarian crisis ensuing at the borders, the country’s politicos remain divided over how to address violence at home and those escaping violence abroad. There’s no doubt that the 52,000 unaccompanied minors arriving at the U.S border this year are fleeing high crime and high poverty. What to do about them is a different question. For ABC pundit Cokie Roberts, the staggering murder rates of Central America make immigration reform a moral no-brainer. ""I heard a report this week that in New York, your chances of getting murdered are 1 in 25,000,"" said Roberts on This Week on July 13, 2014. ""In Honduras, it’s 1 in 14. You can’t send children back home to that."" A reader asked us about Roberts’ statistic, which we were curious about as well. What we found is an interesting case study of how wrong information gets spread, and how corrections don’t always work. He said, she said Roberts said she heard the statistic on the July 10, 2014, episode of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. On that show, economic analyst Steve Rattner used United Nations data in a discussion about immigration reform with host Joe Scarborough. ""Let me put this in perspective for you,"" Rattner said. ""In Honduras, you had a 1 in 14 chance of being murdered. In the city of New York, you have a 1 in 25,000 chance of being murdered. I can’t even imagine what it’s like to be in a place like that."" When we reached out to Rattner’s researcher, Sundas Hashmi, she said that these rates ""were unfortunately incorrect"" and resulted from a transcription error. Rattner corrected the mistake on his Twitter the same day. But the false fact flew past Roberts, who doesn’t tweet. ""Those of us who refuse to use social media sometimes miss things. But not enough to use social media,"" Roberts wrote us in an email. ""And now I will return to writing about the 1850s, where tweeting only came from birds."" Nonetheless, let’s look at the numbers. The odds are not in Honduras’ favor So to figure out your chances of getting murdered in Honduras or New York City, we first need the murder rates of both places. According to data from the United Nations, Honduras has the world’s highest murder rate: 90.4 murders per 100,000 people. Honduran sources report lower rates of about 75 to 80 homicides per 100,000 people, though criminal justice professor Frank Zimring says the margin of error ""that far into the stratosphere"" makes the difference trivial. Honduras’ deadliest city, San Pedro Sula, is also the world’s deadliest, with 187 murders per 100,000 people, reports Mexican think tank Seguridad Justicia Y Paz. In New York City, the FBI reported 419 homicides in a population of around 8.3 million in 2012. This comes out to a rate of about 5.1 homicides per 100,000 people. The U.S. averaged a rate of 4.7 in the same year. Here’s two charts that underscore the disparity between Honduras and New York:     We then need to put that data into the same context as Roberts’ numbers-- your chances of getting murdered. That requires average lifespan data, which is reported by World Bank (73 years in Honduras and 79 years in the U.S.). With that information, we can calculate your chances of getting murdered in Honduras and New York in one year and in a lifetime. The discrepancy is big, but not as big as Roberts stated: Chances of being murdered Per year Per lifetime What Roberts said Honduras 1 in 1100 1 in 15 1 in 14 U.S. 1 in 21,000 1 in 270 San Pedro Sula 1 in 530 1 in 7 New York 1 in 20,000 1 in 250 1 in 25,000   As you can see from the chart above, the chances of getting murdered in Honduras are 1 in 1100 per year compared to 1 in 20,000 per year in New York. Over a lifetime, the chances of being murdered in Honduras are 1 in 15, compared to 1 in 250 in New York. That makes Honduras more dangerous but not nearly to the levels Roberts described. What Rattner may have done, and what Roberts repeated, was compare figures approaching the chances of being murdered in Honduras in a lifetime (1 in 15) to the chances of being murdered in New York in one year (1 in 20,000). Behind the numbers Even if Roberts (and Rattner) used the statistic correctly, criminologists warned us about using the figures to make comparisons. Crime rates are usually given as the number of crimes committed per 100,000 to account for different population sizes. This makes it easier to compare violence, according to Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab. ""In Chicago, for example, we have the most amount of homicides, but we’re also a large city,"" he said. Averaged out over population size, Detroit, New Orleans and 18 other American cities have higher rates than Chicago’s."" Since the general rates don’t capture the demographic of the victims, the chances of getting murdered will vary greatly. For example, men are more likely to be murdered than women, because homicide victims tend to match the profiles of homicide offenders across the world, Zimring said. According to The Economist, men in Honduras have a 1 in 599 chance of getting murdered every year, or 1 in 9 over a lifetime (assuming a life expectancy of 71 years). Geography, race, and age are also factors. ""The risks are extremely uneven, depending on where you are and who you are,"" Zimring said. ""In Honduras, if you’re a male, (the chances) are pretty good. If you’re a child, that doesn’t tell your chances in the next five years but when you turn 16, life gets pretty tough. So these numbers are simultaneously misleading and accurate."" Zimring also cautions against comparing apples to oranges, particularly since one hot spot for typically drug-related murders in Honduras can skyrocket the entire country’s rate. New York’s rate actually gives a sense of what a safe large American city looks like, said Pollack. According to FBI data, Flint, Mich., has the country’s highest murder rate, 62 murders per 100,000 people, which is closer to Honduras’s murder rate but still pales in comparison to San Pedro Sula’s. So even if you’re comparing the deadliest cities in America to their Honduran equivalents, the Central American ones are much worse. The bottom line, experts and pundits agree, is that Honduras is a much more dangerous place. ""Their murder rates put ours in perspective,"" Pollack said. ""Even with all of those magnifications, you still don’t want to move to Honduras to feel safe,"" Zimring said. The ruling Roberts said, ""In New York, your chances of getting murdered are 1 in 25,000. In Honduras, it’s 1 in 14."" Roberts said she got the statistic from Rattner, who first reported the number on Morning Joe. But Rattner acknowledged that his figures were inaccurate and posted a correction on Twitter after the show. Roberts doesn’t have a Twitter account, and so she repeated Rattner’s wrong figures a few days later on ABC’s This Week.  That’s how the bad statistic got spread, but Roberts and Rattner do have a point. The chances of getting murdered in Honduras are greater than they are in New York or the United States -- just not to the degree that they said. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA0FA80>],/factchecks/2014/jul/16/cokie-roberts/cokie-roberts-chances-getting-murdered-new-york-ar/

Democratic candidate for attorney general would only defend laws he supports, GOP rival says
","""Lawlessness"" was the subject of a June 26, 2014 fund-raising email that Brad Schimel, the lone Republican running for Wisconsin attorney general, sent to his supporters. He attacked President Barack Obama as well as the three Democratic candidates for attorney general, singling out one of them in particular. ""Like President Obama, my Democrat opponents have no respect for the Constitution or rule of law,"" Schimel wrote. ""In fact, one of my opponents went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed."" Schimel's campaign confirmed the reference was to state Rep. Jon Richards, D-Milwaukee. It’s an extreme claim. Has Richards said he would only enforce laws he agrees with? The AG race Richards and two district attorneys -- Susan Happ of Jefferson County and Ismael Ozanne of Dane County -- will compete in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary, with the winner facing Schimel, the Waukesha County district attorney, in the Nov. 4, 2014 general election. Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen is not seeking a third four-year term. All four candidates have stated they wouldn’t defend certain laws, saying they violate the state or U.S. constitution. That could saddle taxpayers with higher costs because private attorneys could be brought in to do that work. The three Democrats said they wouldn't defend or appeal rulings on the state's ban on gay marriage, its voter ID law, or recent abortion regulations. Schimel said he would not defend Wisconsin's domestic partnership law, which gives same-sex couples some of the rights of married couples. Those positions drew criticism from Madison lawyer Lester Pines, who supports Ozanne in the attorney general race. After social conservatives in 2009 sued to block the domestic partnership law, Van Hollen refused to defend it. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle then hired Pines to defend the law. Wisconsin's attorney general has a legal and professional duty to defend every state law unless the only arguments that can be made on its behalf are frivolous, Pines told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a June 14, 2014 article. Disliking a law or even believing a law is unconstitutional, he said, is not enough to abandon the duty to defend it. Schimel's claim Asked to provide evidence for Schimel’s claim, campaign manager Johnny Koremenos argued that Richards has two standards in deciding whether to defend a law, ""the Constitution and the ‘wishes of the people.’"" ""This signals he will disregard the law and replace it with his perception of the ‘wishes of the people,’"" Koremenos said. ""It’s clear he is willing to place his own values and personal beliefs above the Constitution."" Koremenos also cited several news articles. But only two of them, both from February 2014, contain comments from Richards about his personal beliefs. And in neither case does Richards say he would enforce only laws he agrees with. First, an article in the Madison weekly newspaper Isthmus -- about whether efforts to repeal Wisconsin’s ban on gay marriage could benefit Democrats in the fall 2014 elections -- noted that Richards said in a news release he would not defend the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, which voters added to the state constitution in 2006. Richards has said he believes the ban violates the U.S. constitution and that he personally favors allowing same-sex marriage. ""Given Richards’ proactive stance, it's clear he doesn’t see same-sex marriage as a negative on the campaign trail,"" the Isthmus article stated. The article also said Richards’ political director, Andy Suchorski, did not disagree with this assessment, but that Richards’ position is ""not a political thing for him. It’s something he really believes. It’s why we’re pushing it.’"" That might seem like support for Schimel’s claim. But only regarding one law and only if taken out of context. Suchorski told us he had been asked a political question -- whether Richards was talking about gay marriage in the campaign because it was good for Democrats -- and had not been asked any legal questions. And the article itself is framed as a political analysis. Schimel also pointed to the first paragraph of a brief version of an Associated Press news story, which stated Richards had pledged to be ""the people’s attorney general"" if elected, and that he said Richards wouldn’t defend every state law if he thinks it violates the U.S. Constitution or goes against the wishes of the people. So, that’s an indication that Richards might not defend some laws if he thinks they are against the public’s wishes, but not that he would defend only laws he supports. Indeed, the full version of the AP article noted that Richards said he would defend laws with which he disagrees, though he didn’t provide an example during that particular news conference. However, despite Schimel’s claim, Richards has actually stated that he would defend laws he doesn’t support if he believes they are constitutional. Richards campaign spokesman Sachin Chheda pointed to three such occasions: In March 2014, Richards told the Waukesha Freeman newspaper: ""There are going to be times when there are laws that I voted against and personally might not support but I believe are consistent with the state and United States constitution, so, of course, the Department of Justice will defend them in that situation."" In January 2014 on the ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" public affairs TV show, Richards was asked if he would vigorously enforce the state’s voter ID law if it is upheld in court. Richards called the law ""troubling,"" but said:  ""Obviously, If the law is passed, and a court rules that it’s constitutional, we’ll uphold the law, of course. But I do think the law that’s written really needs some scrutiny."" Also in January 2014, Richards was asked by WisPolitics.com if concealed carry ""is the right thing for Wisconsin."" Richards said several aspects of the law were ""problematic"" in terms of public safety, but he added: ""Having said that, I mean, the law is in place and as attorney general I would certainly work to make sure that if people apply for a concealed weapons permit, that it’s handled in a professional manner, quickly and expeditiously, and that we obey the law and we get those permits issued."" Our rating Schimel said Richards ""went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed."" He provides no evidence that Richards made such a statement. On the contrary, Richards has said on multiple occasions he would enforce laws with which he doesn’t agree. We rate Schimel’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE49D00>],/factchecks/2014/jul/16/brad-schimel/democratic-candidate-attorney-general-would-only-d/

Mayor Angel Taveras says high school graduation rates are up in Providence
","A June 25, 2014, campaign commercial for Providence Mayor Angel Taveras’ gubernatorial campaign focuses on the importance of education in improving Rhode Island’s economy. In the first few seconds of the video, Taveras is shown talking to a teacher in a classroom.  ""Getting Rhode Island’s economy to succeed begins here, in our schools,"" a narrator says. ""Angel Taveras understands. He went from Head Start to Harvard. As mayor, he worked to lift up our schools. Graduation rates are up, and Providence won a national award for innovative ideas in early learning.""   We know that schools in Providence and the state’s other urban communities have higher dropout rates than schools in wealthier communities. We wondered whether graduation rates in Providence had actually gone up -- and, if so,  how much Taveras had to do with it. The Taveras campaign directed us to the Providence Public School Department’s report on 2013 Graduation Rates. Based on data from the Rhode Island Department of Education, the report, issued on May 18, 2014,  lists graduation rates for the past five graduating classes.  The rates for graduation in four years are: 2009: 66.5 percent 2010: 68.3 percent 2011: 66.1 percent 2012: 65.5 percent 2013: 71.4 percent As the report notes, the 71.4 percent graduation rate for the class of 2013 ""is the highest rate for the past five years."" (The 2014 rate is not yet available.) And, in 2012-2013, all of the city’s 10 high schools (eight district schools and two public charters) except for Classical and Mount Pleasant experienced a one-year increase. Classical - the largest of the 10 - dipped by 1.1 percent to 96.1 percent. Mount Pleasant’s rate dipped by 1.6 percentage points to 57.4.  Taveras took office in January 2011, halfway through the school year. So during his years in office, through 2013, the four-year graduation rate jumped nearly 6 percentage points. A slam dunk for Taveras, right? Well, there are some caveats. First, Providence’s 2013 graduation rate of 71.4 percent is still lower than the district’s own goal -- 73 percent. And it’s substantially lower than the statewide average of 79.7 percent. And two city high schools -- Central and Mount Pleasant -- continue to lag even further behind.  Mount Pleasant’s rate, as we’ve noted, was only 57.4 percent in 2012-2013. Central’s 2013 rate did jump by more than 7 percentage points from the previous year, but it was still only 63.6 percent. And finally, how much credit can the mayor, who took office in January 2011, take for the graduation rate increases? In Providence, the mayor does have more influence over the school system than mayors or town managers in other communities. The Providence mayor appoints school board members (subject to City Council approval). In most other communities, they are elected. The school committee retains administrators, including the superintendent. Taveras spokeswoman Dawn Bergantino said improved graduation rates ""don’t happen overnight and are due to the hard work of many - teachers, students, community organizations and others - who are committed to the success of Providence’s young people."" She also cited programs put in place under the mayor, for example, expanding participation in the school meals program and negotiating a slightly longer school day in the last teachers’ contract.  We also asked Providence Schools Supt. Susan Lusi, who was appointed by the school board during Taveras’ administration,  for her insight.  Acknowledging the stagnant low rates at Mount Pleasant, and Central’s low (but improving) graduation rates, ""we have work to do in the district,"" she said.  ""But I think we are all happy to see the data moving in the right direction, and it definitely is. There are some things we have done that will take more time to show up in the graduation rates."" That includes the ""Graduate Providence"" campaign that she and Taveras have led, starting in 2012, that involved visits ""to every high school,"" and meetings with parents regarding the state’s graduation requirements.   Guidance counselors, administrators and teachers ""met with every student regarding where they were vis a vis meeting these graduation requirements,"" and schools and families signed off on plans. Numerous academic supports were put in place, as well as work with community partners, she said.  Lusi also noted that dropout rates have been steadily declining. (They dropped from 16.9 percent to 12.2 percent between 2012 and 2013).  TIm Duffy, executive director of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, said, ""I think the numbers bear out that Providence has improved its graduation rate; clearly they are moving in the right direction.""  Duffy noted that the five-year graduation rates and other alternative plans ""have adapted to allow students to go [graduate] at a pace that suits the individual student a little bit more.""   Our ruling A campaign video for Angel Taveras says ""Providence graduation rates are up.""  Indeed, rates have risen nearly 6 percentage points since Taveras took office. Did Taveras have a role in the  increase, as the ad clearly implies? He has taken some steps to boost graduation rates, but he’s been in office only three and a half years -- a caveat not mentioned in the shorthand of a 30-second video.

Pillowtex accusations overstate point
","Jack Kingston and David Perdue must hope voters remain angry about the tepid economy and Congressional  inaction. Perdue has tried to tap into the latter, going after his opponent in the tight GOP runoff race for U.S. Senate as an ineffective Washington insider. Kingston has responded with a populist theme, attacking Perdue’s time as CEO of Pillowtex, a troubled North Carolina textile firm that went under shortly after he left in 2003. ""Perdue mismanaged Pillowtex and nearly 8,000 people got laid off,"" a Kingston ad says, noting Perdue got ""rich"" from the job. With Perdue making much of his business background, his tenure at a firm in the state next door seems prime Truth-O-Meter material. The timeline that details that tenure dates back to 1887, when Cannon Mills began operations in North Carolina that would gradually become the world’s largest producer of textiles such as sheets and towels. In 1997, Dallas-based Pillowtex bought the firm, which had become Fieldcrest Cannon, according to a 2004 University of North Carolina study about the plant closing. At the time, Pillowtex was in a leading market position for five textile categories: bed pillows, down comforters, mattress pads, blankets and throws. Pillowtex could not avoid technology changes that resulted in a loss to domestic textile manufacturing. The UNC study found mismanagement, such as excessive debt, contributed to the company and the  industry. In November 2000, Pillowtex filed for bankruptcy after defaulting on a $650 million bank loan. The firm emerged from bankruptcy in May 2002. Perdue arrived in July on the heels of sneaker success, having revived Reebok’s finances as CEO. Perdue told Pillowtex top leaders his plan was to improve sales through aggressive marketing and moving more work overseas, according to a Charlotte Observer investigation. A similar game plan catapulted his career at Sara Lee, which closed dozens of plants (including four in Georgia) while adding work in Asia. But the company lost $27 million in the seven months after coming out of bankruptcy. Shortly after arriving, Perdue and top managers also found between $40-$50 million in pension liabilities missed in bankruptcy proceedings. In March, 2003, Perdue left Pillowtex to become chief at Dollar General. Pillowtex shut down four months later. About 7,650 people lost their jobs nationwide, including 300 people who had been laid off in the first bankruptcy. ""I wouldn’t call that turning things around the way most Georgians would want this country turned around,"" said Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford. ""If those are the kinds of results an outsider is going to deliver, let’s keep him on the outside."" But is Perdue to blame for the closure? He served as Pillowtex’s third leader in two years, as it was emerging from bankruptcy brought on by overwhelming debt and a changing industry. Perdue told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the missed liabilities killed his plans for a turnaround   – and any need for his leadership. ""I was not given the opportunity to turn it around as I had planned,"" Perdue said. ""There were factors beyond my control."" The experience didn’t hurt Perdue’s career, given his jump to Dollar General. It also didn’t hurt his bottom line: records show he made $1.7 million for his brief leadership stint at Pillowtex at a time when people were losing their jobs. And that is the point Kingston misses in his claim. Pillowtex had laid off hundreds of workers and sought bankruptcy protection before Perdue ever arrived. It was a firm in bad shape that hired a business leaders known for rejuvenating industries – often through job losses. Investors don’t view that strategy as mismanagement, even if populists would object to it. Kingston would have been on firmer ground to make the populist point and let voters decide the merits. But the claim of mismanagement is an overreach. Even the loss of jobs after Perdue left – closer to 7,000 – is overstated from what is sure a massive number. We rate Kingston’s statement as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7BB300>],/factchecks/2014/jul/16/jack-kingston/pillowtex-accusations-overstate-point/

Liberal pundit claims 'teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion'
","On July 3, 2014, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper announced that his state has seen a 40 percent drop in teen birth rates since 2009, when Colorado began a program to provide discounted and free contraceptive devices to women. Pundits immediately compared Colorado’s contraceptive program to Texas’ abstinence-only efforts, including Michael Eric Dyson, filling in for Ed Schultz on the July 9 Ed Show. ""We should all be taking a page from Colorado when it comes to contraception,"" Dyson said. ""The state saved $42.5 million in health care expenditures associated with teen births in 2010 alone. It’s a stark contrast to the results out of Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry has pushed an abstinence-only education program."" Texas, said Dyson, ""has the fifth-highest birth rate among teenagers"" and ""the highest rate of repeat births among teenagers aged 15 to 19. Teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in health care, foster care, and lost tax revenue in 2010 alone."" The discussion around contraceptives often revolves around the rights of the unborn child and the mother, so we were surprised to see such a precise cost attributed to teenage birth. In this fact-check, we’re looking at Dyson’s claim that teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in 2010. The source of the claim While we didn’t hear back from Dyson, the statistic he’s referring to comes from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit that researches and advocates for their eponymous cause. According to the National Campaign, teen childbearing cost U.S. taxpayers $9.4 billion, and $1.1 billion of that -- more than any other state -- comes from teen childbearing in Texas. David Wiley, professor of health education at Texas State University, vouched for the National Campaign’s reliability. ""They are pretty much the gold standard on research. Their methods are good and they don’t do hyperbole."" And even though there’s no perfect way to measure the public cost of teen birth, Denver University professor of sociology Jennifer Reich told us that the National Campaign’s stat is ""substantiated by a sizeable amount of data."" A press officer from the Texas Department of State Health Services also deemed the National Campaign’s figures credible. So on a basic level, Dyson is right to imply that Texas’ relatively high teen childbearing numbers have a substantial fiscal impact. But the National Campaign’s communications director, Jessica Sheets Pika, cautioned that ""Texas’ high cost compared to most states may not be the most meaningful way to measure differences in teen childbearing."" ""Part of this difference is due to Texas’ relatively high teen birth rate. For example, the teen birth rate in Texas was 52.2 births per 1,000 teen girls in 2010, while it was 33.4 in Colorado. However, much of this difference is simply due to the fact that Texas has a much larger population than most states."" It’s also worth noting that Texas’ teenage birth rate has been steadily decreasing, albeit at a slower rate than Colorado’s. Texas’ teenage birth rate for teenagers between 15 and 19 declined by 5 percent from 2011 to 2012, compared to 12 percent in Colorado and 6 percent nationally. Texas’ teenage birth rate remains, though, the fifth-highest in the nation, and three of the experts we contacted suggested that the difficulty of accessing contraceptives in Texas is part of the problem. Drilling down on the $1.1 billion figure Dyson gets the gist of the National Campaign’s research right, but his particular wording misrepresents exactly what goes into their $1.1 billion figure, and where that comes from. The National Campaign gets their public cost estimates by comparing teenage mothers to 20-to-21-year-old mothers on several factors, including the mothers’ and their children’s odds of participating in state and federal welfare programs, the children’s increased chances of incarceration, and the taxable incomes of these women, their children, and their children’s fathers. ""Based on this increased risk for participation among teen mothers and the total number of teen births, we then estimate the additional number of participants in various government programs,"" Pika said. ""Then, based on the cost per participant in each of those programs, we then estimate the total cost of teen childbearing."" The three factors Dyson names -- health care, foster care, and lost tax revenue -- certainly constitute part of the National Campaign’s measurement, but increased risk of incarceration and social welfare programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families are also part of the National Campaign’s full $1.1 billion figure for Texas. Importantly, that cost also isn’t only on the shoulder of Texas taxpayers; the loss in tax revenue and Medicaid costs, for example, are national. The National Campaign’s research more accurately means that Texas teenage births cost taxpayers $1.1 billion (instead of ""teenage births"" costing ""Texas taxpayers,"" as Dyson phrased it). The National Campaign also is careful to emphasize that their estimate is just that. ""It’s useful to keep in mind that this is an estimate,"" said Pika, ""based on the best available research on the consequences of teen childbearing, rather than a dollar-for-dollar accounting of exactly what was spent on teen mothers."" To that end, the National Campaign pegs the Texas figure as ""at least"" $1.1 billion, leaving open the possibility that it could be more. Our ruling In the course of comparing the results of Colorado’s public contraceptives program to Texas’ high teen birth rate and abstinence-only program, Michael Eric Dyson said, ""Teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion in health care, foster care and lost tax revenue in 2010 alone."" Dyson’s stat comes from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, who experts say is a reliable source. But Dyson misrepresents their data in three minor ways: He gives an incomplete list of the components of that cost; he implies that teenage births cost Texas taxpayers $1.1 billion when, in fact, births in Texas cost all taxpayers $1.1 billion; and he doesn’t mention that the National Campaign’s stat is a conservative estimate on an issue that’s difficult to quantify. Dyson gets the gist of the statistic right, though he was inartful in his phrasing.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Federal Budget', 'Legal Issues', 'Luis Gutierrez']","
Luis Gutierrez says U.S. spends more on immigration enforcement than other agencies combined
","Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. -- a leader in the effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform -- says the United States is spending plenty of money on border enforcement. ""We spend $18 billion a year on making sure that the federal government has immigrant enforcement agents,"" Gutierrez said. ""That's more than DEA (the Drug Enforcement Administration) and the ATF (the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) and the FBI and all the other enforcements combined. But we still have a problem, right? So you can keep throwing money and talk about enforcement, enforcement, enforcement, but you've got to put money also into your judicial system, and you've got to put money in a comprehensive program that deals with the issue."" Gutierrez made his comments on the July 13, 2014, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation discussing the surge of unaccompanied minors at the United States-Mexico border. We were surprised to hear him claim that the government spends more money on border and immigration enforcement than it does on all other federal law-enforcement agencies, including the FBI. So we took a closer look. When we asked Gutierrez’s office for a source, they pointed to a January 2013 report by the Migration Policy Institute tiled, ""Immigration Enforcement in the United States: The Rise of a Formidable Machinery."" The report found that spending in three federal-budget line items -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and US-VISIT, an automated tracking system for visitors to the United States -- totaled nearly $18 billion in fiscal year 2012. That was more than the $14.4 billion spent by other law-enforcement agencies that year. Those agencies were the FBI, the DEA, the ATF, the Secret Service and the U.S. Marshals Service. So, according to this report, spending on immigration enforcement did outpace other forms of federal law-enforcement in 2012. But that’s two-year-old data, so we decided to do an update. Here’s the rundown of enacted federal spending levels for fiscal year 2014. Some of these agencies are part of the Justice Department and some are part of the Department of Homeland Security. On the suggestion of experts, we’re using each agency’s appropriated budget -- that is, the part of their budget paid by taxpayers. This method ignores user fees paid by companies and others directly to the government for services. (US-VISIT is now known as the Office of Biometric Identity Management.)   Agency Fiscal year 2014 enacted spending IMMIGRATION-RELATED Customs and Border Protection $10.7 billion Immigration and Customs Enforcement $5.3 billion Office of Biometric Identity Management $227 million Total $16.2 billion NON-IMMIGRATION RELATED FBI $8.2 billion Marshals Service $2.7 billion Drug Enforcement Administration $2 billion Secret Service $1.6 billion Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives $1.2 billion Total $15.7 billion   So using the updated dollar amounts for 2014, Gutierrez is still correct. However, we wondered about whether other agencies should be included. We found one agency to add to the immigration side (Citizenship and Immigration Services at $135 million in appropriated funds) along with two agencies that could be added to the non-immigration side (the Transportation Security Administration at $4.9 billion in appropriated funds and the Coast Guard at $8.3 billion). When we asked the Migration Policy Institute why they hadn’t included the Coast Guard or TSA, spokeswoman Michelle Mittelstadt said that they were not included ""because their missions are not primarily as federal criminal law enforcement agencies."" She added that her group believes Gutierrez’s claim on Face the Nation is accurate. However, Gutierrez didn’t specify criminal law enforcement -- and without that distinction (or perhaps even with it) we don’t see a good reason to exclude TSA and at least a portion of the Coast Guard. Adding TSA alone changes the accuracy of Gutierrez’s claim. Adding in Citizenship and Immigration Services to the immigration side boosts the immigration total to $16.3 billion, while adding TSA to the non-immigration side would make the new total $20.6 billion. Adding the Coast Guard into the equation would likely make Gutierrez’s claim even more wrong, though allocating the Coast Guard’s budget between immigration and non-immigration duties is tricky. By law, the Coast Guard’s mission includes such areas as port, waterway, and coastal security; drug interdiction; migrant interdiction; and ""other law enforcement."" So a portion would likely end up on both the immigration and non-immigration sides of the equation. When we showed our calculations to Gutierrez’s office, Douglas Rivlin, the spokesman, said, ""We were going from the report, which as far as we knew at the time was the best, most authoritative and most recent analysis available to us."" Our ruling Gutierrez said, ""We spend $18 billion a year on making sure that the federal government has immigrant enforcement agents. That's more than D.E.A. and the A.T.F. and the F.B.I. and all the other enforcement (agencies) combined."" He’s correct under an agency classification system developed by the Migration Policy Institute. However, the institute’s calculations exclude the TSA and the Coast Guard. According to the group, these are not criminal-law enforcement agencies, but that seems like a fairly arbitrary distinction to us, and, more importantly, since Gutierrez didn’t make that distinction, we don’t see a good reason to exclude them. Adding in TSA by itself would make Gutierrez wrong. Because different approaches produce different results, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC47300>],/factchecks/2014/jul/15/luis-gutierrez/luis-gutierrez-says-us-spends-more-immigration-bor/
"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Lou Dobbs']","
Lou Dobbs: Obama administration 'manipulated deportation data'
","If you want to make a point about immigration, there’s probably a statistic for you. Immigration numbers are often more complicated than they appear, and the mire induces partisan fights among those who consider President Barack Obama a record-setting ""deporter-in-chief"" and others who say he’s doing a lousy job securing the border and handling the influx of migrant children. An enduring claim about Obama’s deportation numbers from Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs epitomizes this issue. ""They manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration,"" Dobbs said July 1, 2014. ""The Homeland Security secretary had to admit before Congress that was not the case -- that, in fact, they were manipulating the numbers."" Dobbs is not only accusing the government of fudging the numbers to make Obama look tougher, he’s saying a Cabinet-level adviser admitted as much. We found some debate about the deportation numbers, but Dobbs goes too far in calling it a deliberate scheme. We’ll walk you through it. Crash course: Immigration lingo Defining deportations is not as easy as it sounds. In federal government lingo, official judicial or administrative orders to leave the country are called ""removals,"" and they can happen right at the border or anywhere else on American soil. A removal is what most people would consider a deportation. But for people caught illegally crossing the border and simply turned around, there’s another term: ""return."" Unlike removals, a return does not bar someone from legally entering the country someday, though that is hard for most because they do not have a family or employment connection necessary to get in line for citizenship, said David Martin, a University of Virginia School of Law professor. Martin also worked as Immigration and Naturalization Service general counsel in the Clinton administration and as DHS deputy general counsel from 2009-10 under Obama. The Border Patrol primarily handles voluntary returns to Mexico, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, equipped with immigration judges and detention center beds, generally handles removals. Over the past several administrations, the Department of Homeland Security has shifted its immigration focus to undocumented immigrants who commit crimes or are caught at the border. The idea is to get them out, and keep them out. The shift picked up in the George W. Bush administration and intensified under Obama’s watch. Whereas many immigrants previously caught at the border simply were bused back to Mexico, they now are returned with official deportation orders, prosecuted, or moved to different parts of the border so they cannot reconnect with their smuggler, Martin said. In short, these people previously would have been classified as a ""return,"" but the policy has been to put them through removal proceedings. As such, they are classified as a ""removal."" Counting removals Dobbs said the government is twisting its statistics to make it look like it’s deporting more people than Bush. He didn’t return our request for comment, but it’s likely he’s focusing on the policy shift we just described to formally remove people trying to cross the border. What he’s getting at: Obama is boosting his ""removal"" statistics by including people who used to be on the ""return"" list. To check the numbers, we turned to two different sources, though each has its problems. The first comes from Immigration and Customs Enforcement data. The following chart from the Bipartisan Policy Center reflects the trend of more total removals, according to ICE data. Starting in FY 2008, the data is broken down by interior removals and border removals. Breakdowns of removals prior to 2008 are not available. . The chart shows the total number of removals is up, and the share of removals from the border has been increasing since 2008. By 2013, 64 percent of the year’s 369,000 ICE removals were people who crossed the border and put through a formal process before leaving the country, a jump of 28 percentage points from 2008. The number of people deported from within the country fell accordingly, from 64 percent in 2008 to 36 percent in 2013. The second set of data from the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, which measures removals and returns separately for each fiscal year (Oct. 1-Sept. 30). It includes data from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which houses the Border Patrol. The most recent data is through 2012. According to Homeland Security data, removals have indeed climbed over recent years, starting in 2006 and continuing under Obama. But returns, which don’t carry formal consequences, have gone down.  The recession and increased border resources are partially credited for the decline in returns, as is the shift in policy. ""To me, the thing that really stands out with the lower number of returns is fewer number of people are getting apprehended at the border in the first place,"" said Matt Graham, a Bipartisan Policy Center immigration analyst. ""(Obama) has fewer opportunities to return people."" Removals are highest on an annual basis under Obama, says Theresa Brown, Bipartisan Policy Center director of immigration policy. But if you factor in returns, Bush indeed outpaces Obama. ""If you want to say that he’s removed more people than any other administration, then that’s true,"" Brown said. ""If you want to say he hasn’t actually expelled more people than any other president, that might also be true."" People should be more precise so we know exactly what they mean by ""deportation,"" Brown said. ""It’s the difference between getting off with a warning and going to court."" ‘Manipulating deportation data’ So that’s a look at the data -- and why it can be confusing. Now we want to look at Dobbs’ accusation that the Obama administration ""manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration."" This, too, goes back to the policy change of how people crossing the border illegally are handled. Usually pundits and politicians say ICE is the agency inflating its numbers by formally removing people handed over from the Border Patrol. ""These numbers show that the president is hardly the deporter-in-chief as so many of the ethnic advocacy groups have tried to paint him,"" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that opposes Obama’s proposed immigration reforms. Right-leaning news sites and pundits revived these claims after Department of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson appeared before a House subcommittee to answer questions about his budget requests. Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, tried to drill down into the agency’s methodology, and Johnson noted a large chunk of the 368,644 people deported by ICE in 2013 were essentially caught at the border. (Again, we’re talking about how people were previously handled as a ""return"" but are now processed as a ""removal"" with consequences.) Culberson: ""But under the Obama administration, more than half of those removals that were attributed to ICE are actually a result of Border Patrol arrests that wouldn't have been counted in prior administrations."" Johnson: ""Correct."" The ""correct"" was heard around the conservative blogosphere, with some sites taking it as Johnson finally admitting administrative malpractice. Vaughan’s Center for Immigration Studies billed it as ""a truth finally admitted"" that ICE is taking credit for arrests made by Border Patrol agents to beef up its deportation numbers. But is the change in tactics a manipulation of data? Experts we talked to said no. ""Under these previous administrations, they would have been voluntarily returned, not formally removed,"" Brown said. ""Now they are formally removed."" ""Transferring of people from Border Patrol to ICE is not trying to trick the numbers,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, a Cato Institute immigration policy analyst. ""It’s a result of punishing illegal immigrants more heavily than they did before."" Our ruling Dobbs said the federal government ""manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration."" Deportations or ""removals"" under Obama are tracking higher than during the Bush years using the most literal deportation statistics, as well as those solely from ICE. Dobbs’ contention that the Obama administration is inflating its number is an interpretation of a change in federal policy to process and remove people trying to enter the country illegally rather than just turn them around. Whether you agree with the policy, those formal removals are occurring. That strategy is rooted in previous administrations but was accelerated by Obama so that people trying to cross the border illegally face more significant consequences and receive formal deportation orders. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7BA080>],/factchecks/2014/jul/15/lou-dobbs/lou-dobbs-obama-administration-manipulated-deporta/

Perdue's earmark claim overstated
","The accusations are flying fast and furious between U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston and businessman David Perdue as we edge closer to the Republican primary runoff for the U.S. Senate. Both claim to be the conservative candidate in the close, and closely watched, contest that voters will decide on July 22. And for the second time, Perdue is leveling accusations about earmarks, the money lawmakers pull from the federal budget for pet projects in their jurisdictions. ""Jack Kingston spent our tax dollars on thousands of wasteful earmarks,"" Perdue claims in the ad, ""Spender."" PolitiFact Georgia already looked into Perdue’s earlier claims that Kingston requested more earmarks than any other congressman from Georgia and more than all Georgia Republicans combined. With between $211 million and $213 million in earmarks between fiscal years 2008 and 2010, we found that claim Mostly True. But the database from the Center for Responsive Politics of OpenSecrets.org and a separate data set from Taxpayers for Common Sense showed only 145 and 146 earmarks, respectively, in that period. So thousands? ""He has voted for thousands of earmarks, not just his own, wasting tax dollars,"" said Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s chief of staff. ""Take the 2005 transportation bill, which has 6,300 earmarks alone."" The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act authorized spending $286 billion to be doled out over five years. While the majority of the money was funneled to road construction and public transit projects, the bill also contained a record 6,371 earmarks from members of both parties. Kingston was among those who voted in favor of that bill, despite a long-standing push to overhaul the earmark process. Criticism over those projects, and the punch line ""Bridge to Nowhere,"" helped prompt Congress to ban earmarks in 2010. Shortly thereafter, Kingston began saying that lawmakers may have overreacted. In 2010, Kingston told the political website Politico that the definition of earmarks, if not the ban, needed review. ""Let’s look at transportation,"" he said. ""How do you handle that without earmarks, since that’s a heavily earmarked bill?"" Earlier this month, Kingston  defended his earmarks to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as support for military and defense projects in a state with eight military installations. His spokesman, Chris Crawford, called the accusation that Kingston supported thousands of earmarks false on its face – given the hundreds specifically tied to Kingston’s name. He also said it was a ""blatant fabrication"" trying to link Kingston to other lawmakers’ projects. In fact, Kingston may have a point, said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The nonpartisan organization opposes earmarks because the system rewards political power over project merit. But Ellis said Kingston, or any lawmaker of his tenure, would have voted for thousands of earmarks simply by voting to fund the government. In some cases, lawmakers would chop spending, say for the Department of Defense, into dozens of earmarks. In other cases, earmarks were added to programs, driving up the overall cost. But the final vote reflects support for an overall defense budget bill, not the pet projects inside. Even the most die-hard opponent of pork would have cast votes that included money for state or local projects such as paving roads. ""It’s not like he voted for these (earmarks) separately,"" Ellis said. ""They were stuffed into bills."" So, did Kingston vote on thousands of earmarks? In a word, yes. But so does any other lawmaker who votes for major legislation such as transportation funding. Perdue would have been on firmer ground if he had attributed to Kingston the specific earmarks for his district. Were the earmarks wasteful as the statement claims? That’s far trickier to prove. Those votes were taken as part of a central function of Congress, to vote on the budget.   There’s a bit of truth in Perdue’s claim, but just a bit.

Democratic Rep. Donna Edwards says '74% of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act'
","From the day it was passed in 2010 without a single Republican vote, President Barack Obama’s health care law has polarized Americans by party affiliation: Most Democrats support it, most Republicans oppose it. So we were curious when we heard Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., cited strong Republican approval for the law on the July 13, 2014, edition of CNN’s State of the Union. It came during a roundtable discussion of frayed partisan relations in Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner’s effort to sue Obama over his administration’s alleged overreach on implementation of the health care law. Edwards said, ""I don't understand the politics (of the lawsuit), quite frankly. I mean, 74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act. And so they're suing against their own Republicans."" We decided to take a closer look at whether 74 percent of Republicans really ""support the Affordable Care Act."" We started by checking with Edwards’ office. Spokesman Benjamin Gerdes said Edwards was referring to a poll by the Commonwealth Fund, a think tank that supports ""better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency"" in health care, ""particularly for society's most vulnerable."" The poll reached 4,425 adults by telephone between April 9 and June 2, 2014. Pollsters interviewed a sample of adults between 19 and 64 who had selected a private plan or enrolled in Medicaid due to provisions in the Affordable Care Act, or who have had Medicaid for less than 1 year. One of the questions was, ""Overall, how satisfied are you with this new health insurance?"" The poll found that 74 percent of the Republicans who had signed up for health coverage at least in part due to the ACA said they were satisfied -- specifically, 30 percent somewhat satisfied and 44 percent very satisfied. That satisfaction rate was rate slightly lower than it was for Democrats (85 percent) and Independents (82 percent), but still overwhelmingly high. That’s a notable finding, suggesting, essentially, that if you try the ACA, you’ll like the ACA -- even if you’re a Republican. But Edwards didn’t say that 74 percent of Republicans who signed up for coverage as a result of ACA said they were satisfied with the coverage they got. Instead, she said, ""74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act"" -- a much broader assertion, and one that’s undercut by a host of survey data. For instance, here are three recent polls: • Quinnipiac Poll, June 24-30: ""Do you support or oppose the health care law passed by Barack Obama and Congress in 2010?"" Republicans: 9 percent support, 90 percent oppose. • Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, June 12-18: ""As you may know, a health reform bill was signed into law in 2010. Given what you know about the health reform law, do you have a generally favorable or generally unfavorable opinion of it?"" Republicans: 15 percent support, 74 percent oppose. • Gallup, May 21-25.

MSNBC's O'Donnell: Washington has spent over $500 million to reach less than 1% of Cubans
","Over the decades since the Cuban revolution, American feelings toward our closest Communist neighbor have mellowed, if only just a bit. According to a Gallup poll, antipathy toward restoring ties with Cuba has inched down since the 1970s. Other research suggests a generational shift is underway as U.S.-born Cuban Americans come of age and move away from the firm anti-communist line of the Republican Party. MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell took aim at the American broadcasts designed to stir discontent with the Cuban government, Radio Marti and TV Marti. Both seek to offer Cubans an alternative source of news. O’Donnell cast them as a colossal waste of taxpayer money. ""Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population, and as far as we can tell, change their minds about nothing,"" O’Donnell said on July 8, 2014. ""No politician who seriously aspires to the president who will dare to say a word about this wasted $500 million, because when it comes to Cuba policy, the American government is still crazy after all these years."" We can’t know whether these American broadcasts have shaped the opinions of Cubans, but we can look into O’Donnell’s claim about the money and the market penetration. Limited audience data O’Donnell’s colleagues at MSNBC pointed to a 2009 Government Accountability Office report. The GAO works on behalf of Congress to assess whether government programs spend their money wisely and achieve what they were set up to do. The 2009 study focused on TV Marti but at the very top, it spoke to the total spending. ""More than $500 million that has been spent over the years on broadcasting to Cuba,"" the GAO analysts wrote. We found a 2011 GAO report that put total spending at $660 million since the launch of Radio Marti in the mid 1980s. As for the television operation’s audience, the 2009 GAO report said that the best available research shows that ""it is small."" The International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) oversees the Marti project. ""Less than 1 percent of respondents to IBB telephone surveys since 2003 reported that they had watched TV Martí during the past week,"" the report said. ""Notably, results from the 2006 and 2008 telephone surveys show no increase in reported TV Martí viewership following the launch of AeroMarti and DirecTV broadcasting in 2006."" AeroMarti was a $5 million a year effort to broadcast from an airplane. It has since ended. DirecTV made programs available to those Cubans with illegal dish antennas. Measuring audience size in Cuba, for either television or radio, faces a huge hurdle -- tuning in could get you in trouble with the government. The GAO report notes, this makes it difficult to get reliable responses. Daniel Walsh is a communications professor at Appalachian State University who has studied America’s broadcast efforts in Cuba. ""There is no real way to get valid audience numbers for Radio Marti,"" Walsh said. ""I would say that 1 percent may be a bit low but not far off. Some Cubans, including government officials, listen to Radio Marti but don't admit it."" The International Broadcasting Bureau hired a firm to place calls to Cuba, mainly from Costa Rica. But according to the Cuban telecomm company Etesca, there are only about 2 million cell phone lines and about 1.3 million landlines. With a total population of more than 11 million, phone calls are unlikely to reach a representative sample. A 2010 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report summarized recent survey results for the radio service. ""Fewer than 2 percent of respondents in 2003, 2005, and 2006 said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week,"" the report said. ""In 2008, fewer than 1 percent of respondents said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week."" The numbers have not always been so low. Philip Peters served in the State Department during the Reagan and Bush administrations. In congressional testimony in 2002, Peters said he believed in the project’s mission but drew attention to an ""alarming statistic."" ""Radio Marti’s audience share has plummeted to 5 percent in 2001, down from 9 percent in 2000 and 71 percent 10 years ago, according to professional survey research commissioned by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Radio Marti’s oversight body,"" Peters said. According to the GAO, concerns about the validity of these audience measures led the IBB to halt telephone surveys after 2008. The division that runs Radio and TV Marti, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, has interviewed recent arrivals from Cuba. Their results show significantly higher penetration. About 30 percent said they had listened to Radio Marti at some point during their last six months in Cuba. However, about half of those said they stopped because Cuban jamming made it difficult to listen. About 4 percent said they had watched TV Marti. Program administrators cautioned that these results also fail to give an accurate view of market penetration because the total number of people surveyed is small, less than 400, and people who have chosen to leave Cuba do not represent a random sample. Nicholas Cull, a professor at the University of Southern California, has studied the Marti project and believes it lacks an appreciable following in Cuba. ""Everything I've heard suggests it is tiny,"" Cull said. Cuban jamming efforts present a consistent challenge to American government broadcasting. The Cuban government can effectively block reception by broadcasting on the same frequency as the American programs but at a much higher power. The U.S. response has been to shift frequencies up to 10 times a day (with an unknown impact on listenership), and to build a digital distribution strategy that uses cell phone text messaging, DVDs and flash drive technologies. According to the Broadcasting Board of Governors 2013 annual report, text messages and emails ""reach nearly 1 million Cubans each week."" However, a spokesperson said it is unclear how many messages are read. Staff told PunditFact there are more than 660,000 cell phone numbers and more than 360,000 email addresses in their distribution database. They said they harvested this information from the Web and online sources and verified that the numbers and addresses were still active. The texting and email effort began three years ago. According to government data, there are around 1 million cell phones in total in Cuba. The size of the Marti database might represent significant market penetration, although staff said ""the vast majority of the cell phones and emails we have in our distribution lists did not opt-in."" That is, the Cubans did not request the information the Marti service offers. About 45,000 texts go out each month. In the past six months, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting has received 349 texts. Staff said Cuba is able to block sensitive messages based on key words. The International Broadcasting Bureau has developed applications for smart phones for users to share messages, but the Cuban government moved only a few months ago to begin email access over its wireless network. The cost is very high, about $1.20 per megabyte. The average worker makes, officially, about $20 a month. Our ruling O’Donnell said that the United States had spent over $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population. The weight of the GAO findings, the assessment from one of the program’s early supporters, and outside experts largely confirm O’Donnell’s numbers. If anything, the government has spent more than O’Donnell said. He might have overstated how small the audience actually is, but independent government reviewers conclude that the audience is small. The new distribution methods of text and email come with some impressive numbers, but there is no verification that a substantial portion of these messages get through. While the quality of the data can be questioned, the numbers that do exist suggest O’Donnell was largely correct. We rate the claim Mostly True. Update: The Cuban telecomm company Etesca said there are approximately 3.3 million cell phone and land lines in Cuba. This story has been updated to reflect that point.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE3E4C0>],/factchecks/2014/jul/14/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-odonnell-washington-has-spent-over-500-mill/

Sickles says 70 percent of Virginia's Medicaid cost is for seniors in nursing homes
","Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, says increased demand for nursing home care is a major reason why the Virginia’s Medicaid costs have soared. ""We’re living longer than ever and you have to spend down until you get to $2,000 of assets before you qualify for (Medicaid funded) nursing home care in our state,"" Sickles said in a recent floor speech. ""$2,000. That’s where the money goes. That’s where 70 percent of the money goes in our Medicaid program – to help our seniors live with skilled nursing who need it."" Let’s start by noting that Sickles is correct is saying that Virginia’s Medicaid will only pay for nursing home care to elderly and disabled people whose total financial resources don’t exceed $2,000.   What we want to explore in this Truth-O-Meter is Sickle’s claim that 70 percent of the state’s Medicaid money goes to provide elderly care in nursing homes. The statement comes amid a partisan battle over whether expand Medicaid to up to 400,000 additional low-income Virginians. Under Obamacare, the federal government would always pay at least 90 percent of the tab. The GOP-led General Assembly blocked the expansion last month, saying Washington can’t be trusted to pay its promised shares. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, is exploring whether he can broaden the program without legislators’ consent. Sickles told us he can’t recall the exact source of his nursing home claim but, as a long time member of the Health, Welfare and Institutions Committee, he’s often heard that 70 percent of the Medicaid money goes to 30 percent of the recipients. He said he understood that trend was ""largely caused"" by seniors in nursing homes. But Craig Markva, a spokesman for the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs the state’s Medicaid program, gave us a different explanation. He said 70 percent of the money is spent on the medical expenses of all elderly and disabled patients, who comprise 32 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid recipients. Markva sent us Medicaid statistics for the budget year that ended June 30, 2013 -- the latest numbers available. They show that of the slightly more than 1 million Medicaid enrollees in Virginia, only 22,513 -- or 2.2 percent -- were seniors in nursing facilities. Out of a $6.7 billion Medicaid budget that fiscal year, the state spent $648 million to care for seniors in nursing homes. That boils down to 9.7 percent of the money. All told, seniors accounted for about 7 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid recipients during the 2012-13 budget year and received about 17 percent of the funds, or slightly more than $1.1 billion. Our ruling Sickles said that 70 percent of the state’s Medicaid spending goes to seniors in nursing homes. He’s way off; only 9.7 percent of the money goes to that cause. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE34100>],/factchecks/2014/jul/14/mark-sickles/sickles-says-70-percent-virginias-medicaid-cost-se/

Is Fox News banned in Canada?
","Red foxes may roam all over Canada but you won’t catch the conservative news network there, according to an Internet meme circulating since 2011. One version of the meme states that Fox New Channel is ""banned from operating in Canada"" because ""it’s illegal in Canada to lie on airwaves."" A reader sent the message to us and asked us to check it out. A mountie of lies We weren’t able to verify the origins of the meme, though Bill O’Reilly himself said in 2004 that Fox wasn’t allowed in Canada -- not that he agreed with the lying part. The earliest iteration of the full claim we found comes from a Feb. 28, 2011, Huffington Post blog post by liberal radio host and activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ""The (false news) provision has kept Fox News and right wing talk radio out of Canada and helped make Canada a model for liberal democracy and freedom,"" wrote Kennedy. ""As a result of that law, Canadians enjoy high-quality news coverage including the kind of foreign affairs and investigative journalism that flourished in this country before Ronald Reagan abolished the ‘Fairness Doctrine’ in 1987."" What Kennedy is likely referring to are provisions in Canadian broadcast policy, include the Radio Act and other policies, that prohibit ""any false or misleading news."" These provisions against spreading misinformation used to be part of Canada’s criminal code, according to Canadian media lawyer Paul Schabas. They were famously evoked to send Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi publisher Ernst Zündel to trial in the 1980s. After the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the code violated freedom of expression rights and thus was unconstitutional, the false news provisions were just regulations. How does this relate to Fox News? It doesn't. Fox News first bid for broadcast in Canada -- filed by private Canadian operators, along with HBO, ESPN, and other American channels -- was rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the federal body that regulates the airwaves, in 2003. But the regulators were concerned with the effect of foreign competition on Canadian networks, not with Fox News’ truthfulness.   Years earlier in 2000, regulators approved a proposal for Fox News Canada, which was to include content from both countries under media content law. But the channel never got off the ground. According to a commission report, Fox News told the Canadian network Global News Network that it ""did not wish to have its signal interrupted by the insertion of Canadian programming as would be required under the licence for Fox News Canada."" Fox News executive Janet Alshouse said there were no serious discussions with Global nor was there ever a partnership. After the project fizzled out in 2004, the regulators approved Fox for broadcast on Canadian airwaves via satellite in the same year. So right now, Canadians can watch Bill O’Reilly, Megyn Kelly, Fox & Friends and everyone else through several private dish providers. ""I live in Toronto, where Fox is pumped into cable from Buffalo. Canadians also get ABC, NBC, CNN. But you know, we also watch (Canadian channels) CBC, CTV, Global,"" said Schabas. More on the Canadian policy Any network that wants to broadcast in Canada must get approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. And Canadians who take issue with the truthfulness of their programming can file complaints to the commission. If a network amasses enough complaints and is found to have knowingly and deliberately broadcasted false news, its license can be limited or revoked. But that has never happened before, commission spokesperson Eric Rancourt said ""Based on the history of these kind of complaints, it would have be very, very egregious for the commission (to revoke or deny a license). That’s all speculative, since it hasn’t happened before,"" Rancourt said. The commission has only taken serious action a couple of times in its history, and not against Fox News,  but Al Jazeera, according to commission regulator Sheehan Carter. The commission approved the Arabic-language news channel in 2004, with the condition that distributors must edit out abusive content. The condition doesn’t apply to Al Jazeera English. The ruling The meme claims that Fox News is ""banned from operating in Canada"" because it violates a law that ""prevents ‘news’ channels from lying to their viewers."" That’s incorrect. Fox was denied broadcast in 2003, but not because Canadians found it to be untruthful. And Fox News got its approval to broadcast via satellite in 2004 and certainly has a dish presence up north today. This claim rates Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8A2140>],/factchecks/2014/jul/14/facebook-posts/fox-news-banned-canada/

Rep. Steve King says Obama's $3.7 billion immigration plan has no border security measures
","With more than 52,000 undocumented immigrant children from Central America arriving at the southern border of the United States, President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans have sparred over exactly how to proceed. Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion to address the problem, but leading Republicans have expressed skepticism about the budget request and what it would be put toward. How much will be spent taking care of children now on U.S. soil, and how much will go to securing the border from future illegal crossings? On July 10, 2014, Fox news host Bill O’Reilly interviewed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, about Obama’s request. ""I'm not going to vote to approve $3.7 billion for the president to hire more lawyers and to squander in a way that he has designed,"" King said. ""There is nothing in this that actually secures the border. And until we stop the bleeding at the border, Bill, we are not going to solve this problem."" Is King -- one of Congress’ most vocal critics of illegal immigration -- right that there is nothing in Obama’s plan that would help secure the border? We took a closer look. First, some background. The White House’s July 8 supplemental budget request is designed to respond to the current crisis, but it is also supposed to support ""a sustained border security surge through enhanced domestic enforcement."" How does Obama propose to do that? Here’s what the administration says it intends to spend the money on: • $1.8 billion for basic necessities like food and shelter for unaccompanied immigrant children; • $897 million for judicially processing and deporting undocumented families; • $364 million for other administrative processing related to the surge in apprehensions of unaccompanied children and families; • $295 million for the reintegration of migrants to countries in Central America; • $109 million for expanding immigration and customs investigations and enforcement; • $45.4 million for additional immigration judges to increase case processing; • $39 million to increase air surveillance of the Rio Grande region; • $29 million for expanding the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program; • $15 million for direct legal representation services to children in immigration proceedings; • $5 million for public programs and support related to Central American migration issues; • $2.5 million for expansion of the legal orientation program; • $1.1 million for additional immigration litigation attorneys. Separately, the bill includes $615 million for wildfire suppression, which is unrelated to the immigration situation. Looking at this list, King has a point that a lot of the money is going toward lawyers and legal services. Still, it’s not everything. (King’s office did not respond to our requests for comment.) Several experts told PolitiFact that a number of these budgetary line items would qualify as addressing border security. A clear item is the $39 million for aerial surveillance, which is designed to spot people coming across the border. Other items include the boost for the Border Enforcement Security Task Force ($29 million) and investigatory efforts that would investigate smuggling operations ($109 million). Some would also count a portion of a much larger item -- the $897 million for judicially processing and deporting undocumented families. Christopher Wilson, a senior associate of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, said much of this money would go for the detention, prosecution and removal of undocumented families. Even though it’s not happening literally on the border, he said, it’s part of enforcing the border security laws. In addition, some of the $364 million line item for administrative processing would likely be used for overtime and temporary-duty costs for current Border Patrol agents, said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Wilson Center’s Latin America program. So, depending on how you categorize the money, at least $177 million and possibly up to $1 billion could be categorized as funds for securing the border. Even at the high end of the estimate, though, the amount spent on securing the border would amount to less than one-third of the total. The majority would go toward taking care of immigrants who recently arrived at the border, particularly the $1.8 billion allocated to the Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with caring for children who are already here. (And of course the $615 for wildfire suppression is not connected to immigration.) We should note that the administration has indicated that its intent with the supplemental spending request is not to implement a comprehensive immigration overhaul. Rather, the request is intended to alleviate the immediate humanitarian situation. Wilson added that while beefing up surveillance and patrol personnel might curb some illegal immigration, it is not a solution to the immediate problem of children coming from Central American countries, Wilson said. These Central American children actually seek out American officials rather than trying to evade them, so adding more boots on the ground would not turn them away, he said. This is because the current law, passed under former President George W. Bush, allows children from countries that don’t border the United States to stay in the country if they are victims of trafficking. ""The idea that having more border enforcement would be a solution to this crisis is a fallacy,"" Wilson said, ""They’re not trying to sneak past Border Patrol -- they’re turning themselves into Border Patrol."" Our ruling King said there is ""nothing"" in Obama’s $3.7 billion request to address the child immigration situation ""that actually secures the border."" King has a point that a majority of the funding request would cover basic necessities for children crossing the border as well as additional resources for the legal process. But somewhere between $177 million and possibly as much as $1 billion of the total request would be spent on items that can be described as aiding efforts to secure the border. Because this is not a trivial amount, King is wrong to say it’s ""nothing."" On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False. Correction: The White House's supplemental budget request was made July 8. Our report initially gave an earlier date.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB959380>],/factchecks/2014/jul/14/steve-king/rep-steve-king-says-obamas-37-billion-plan-regardi/

John DePetro says all the revenue from governor's beach fee increase went to out-of-state firm
","Rhode Island dramatically hiked its beach fees in 2011. But according to WPRO talk-show host John DePetro, the state didn’t get any of that extra money. DePetro was talking about tourism on his July 7, 2014 show, when he told his audience this: ""I got so much email from people again complaining just how high the beach fees are. And then we learn this year that although the governor doubled the beach fees, where I think it's 28 bucks if you're from out of state and you want to go to a Rhode Island state beach on the weekend. But on top of that, all the money, as we found out, is all going to an out-of-state company. The state isn't even getting the money for that."" When we emailed DePetro, he said his source was a May 19, 2014, story on WPRI.com, ""Out-of-state company scored when R.I. hiked beach fees."" However, the talk show host is misreporting the facts of the story. Here's the nitty gritty: In 2009, the state went out to bid seeking a vendor to collect fees at the beaches. Propark America, a parking management company based in Hartford, Conn., got the five-year contract, which ends this year. Under the deal, Propark paid the state $1,880,857 for the right to collect fees at the seven state-owned beach facilities. If Propark collected more than that sum, it got to keep the rest until its profit hits $502,143. Beyond that point, once $2,383,000 in beach fees had been collected, the state got 80 cents of every dollar and Propark got 20 cents. Then, in 2011, the General Assembly approved Governor Chafee’s plan to raise money by dramatically increasing the beach fees, effective that July 1. Daily weekday rates went from $6 to $10 for residents and from $12 to $20 for non-residents. Weekend and holiday rates doubled, going to $14 for residents and $28 for non-residents. The price of a season passes also doubled. Seniors get a 50-percent discount. The state’s contract with Propark required the state to share 20 percent of the extra revenue. According to figures from Terrence Maguire, the Department of Environmental Management's assistant director for financial and contract management, Propark's revenue from the contract jumped from $581,039 in 2010 (the summer when the old fees were still in effect), to $734,963 in 2011 (when the old fees remained in effect through June 30). Propark's profit increased to $822,595 in 2012 (the first full year of the higher fees). Last year, the company took in $756,228. But the state was the biggest winner. Revenue from the beach fees, which had been $1.6 million before the increase, jumped to $2.2 million during the transition year and rose further to nearly $2.8 million in 2012. It declined to $2.5 million last year. As a side note, the big losers were the host communities of Charlestown, Westerly, Narragansett and South Kingstown, which initially got 27 percent of the money from the sale of daily passes, for a total of $558,000 in 2010. But in 2011, their share dropped to $344,000. The chief reason: the General Assembly cut the towns' share from 27 percent of the daily fees to 16 percent. But back to DePetro's point. Overall, from 2011 through 2013, Propark made an extra $571,000 because of the increase in beach admission fees. But contrary to DePetro’s claim, the state made nearly five times as much -- $2.6 million extra compared with 2010. The money goes to the state's general fund, not to DEM. One final point. DePetro is correct that Propark is an out-of-state company. However all of Propark's workers at Rhode Island beaches are Rhode Island residents, Maguire said. Our ruling John DePetro said emphatically that ALL of the beach parking revenue generated when the governor raised its fees went to a private company outside Rhode Island. First of all, the governor proposed the fee increase but he didn’t do it on his own. It got the approval of the General Assembly as well. Second, all of the new revenue did not and does not go to the private company. When the state raked in that extra money, Propark got 20 percent of the new revenue. The state might have wanted to take all the additional revenue, but its contract with the company collecting the fees required both to share in the extra revenue. The state got 80 percent of that additional money. DePetro cited WPRI as his source. But while they got the essential facts right, he did not. We rate DePetro's scorcher of a claim Pants on Fire!
