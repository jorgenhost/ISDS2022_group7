Photo of flag over White House is from 2019
","President Donald Trump has promoted a ""big protest"" in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, when Congress is scheduled to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.  But an image being spread online is not a sign that the president is calling for a revolution.  ""1776 flag flying over White House!"" reads the headline on a Jan. 4 blog post on the Hal Turner Radio Show website. ""REVOLUTION SIGNAL."" The post goes on to say that ""the 1776 flag is presently flying atop the White House in Washington, DC. It is the signal of REVOLUTION from our President! The time is here. The storm is upon us. Rise-up, America. Rise up against the fraudulent election.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The flag in the photo is washed out, but the blog post seems to be referring to the 13-star flag, the first official U.S. flag to fly after the country’s founding in 1776.  However, the photo isn’t recent. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted it on Instagram on June 1, 2019. We didn’t find any media coverage about the White House flying the 13-star flag around that time, and it was in the news. Nike pulled Fourth of July sneakers featuring the flag over concerns that it was a symbol for racism.  We also found no evidence that such a flag is currently flying over the White House.  But in any case, the image that purportedly shows an older flag that Trump raised to rally an uprising is more than a year old.  We rate this blog post False.

Sen. Ron Johnson changes tune on objecting to Electoral College results
","It’s a new year, and the turmoil surrounding the 2020 presidential election still isn’t over. Congress convenes on Jan. 6, 2021 to count the Electoral College votes that show President-elect Joe Biden defeating President Donald Trump 306 to 232. Vice President Mike Pence, acting as Senate president, will open the sealed certificates from each state, hand them to tellers to read aloud and call for any objections to the results. That’s where Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson plans to come in.   Johnson and 10 other Republican senators and senators-elect issued a statement on Jan. 2, 2021 saying they will object to the votes in ""disputed states"" unless an election audit is completed.  The move came as Trump and his allies have continued to try to cast doubt on the Nov. 3 election despite no evidence of widespread fraud and nearly 60 failed legal attempts to overturn the results. Weeks before that, Johnson was singing a different tune about the Jan. 6 session. So we decided to break out our Flip-O-Meter.  Reminder: We’re not measuring whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We’re just examining whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views. Let’s take a look. A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter asked Johnson on Dec. 15, 2020 whether he planned to object to the Electoral College votes.  ""No, I don’t have any plans,"" Johnson said. ""Something would have to surface that would call into question the legitimacy of the election. Again, so far nothing has … again, plenty of irregularities, things that need to be investigated."" He went on to say he regarded the election as legitimate and accepted Biden as president-elect. The next day, however, he held a Senate hearing to discuss election ""irregularities"" and argued that legitimate questions had been raised about how it was administered in Wisconsin and other states.  Still, Johnson said he didn’t anticipate a level of fraud that would change the election’s outcome. ""Today we will hear testimony on … how fraudulent voting did occur, as it always does,"" he said during the hearing. ""The question that follows is whether the level of fraud would alter the outcome of the election. This year, through dozens of court cases, through the certification process in each state, and by the electoral college vote, the conclusion has collectively been reached that it would not."" Johnson’s more recent comments, however, paint an entirely different picture. In their statement, Johnson and his Republican colleagues claimed that the 2020 election ""featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities."" Johnson added to that in a Jan. 4, 2021 talk radio appearance, saying 50 to 70 million Americans ""have real legitimate suspicions that this election was stolen"" — but offered nothing more than suspicions, which Trump and others helped stoke. That same day, he said on Fox News that affirming the results would turn a blind eye to alleged problems in certain states. Again, he did not offer specifics on new evidence, but rather past allegations that have been litigated in lawsuits and other forums. He also appeared on the conservative Newsmax network and argued for an investigation, saying fraud allegations need to be taken seriously.  ""There's so many irregularities here,"" Johnson said in the interview. Johnson has not said whether he’ll challenge his own state, but the results in Wisconsin have been disputed multiple times after Biden won by a narrow margin similar to the victory Trump secured in 2016.  Spokesmen for Johnson did not respond to PolitiFact Wisconsin’s inquiry about what changed the senator’s mind. But here’s what hasn’t changed: Courts across the country, including the nation’s highest, continue to throw out lawsuits brought by Trump allies alleging the election was rigged. And as of Dec. 23, 2020, only a handful of fraud cases had emerged in battleground states — including one woman charged in suburban Milwaukee.  That’s hardly unprecedented.  Johnson said in mid-December that he had no plans to object to the Electoral College results that Congress will tally on Jan. 6. He spoke of potential ""irregularities"" in certain states but overall considered the election to be legitimate. Weeks later, he joined other Republicans in pledging to object despite no evidence emerging that points to rampant fraud.  We give Johnson a Full Flop.  ",/factchecks/2021/jan/05/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-changes-tune-objecting-electoral-c/

New York isn’t trying to pass bill to put non-mask wearers in detainment camps, force vaccinations
","A dormant, years-old bill in New York that would allow officials to detain contagious patients during a health emergency has reemerged amid the COVID-19 pandemic and has quickly become the subject of rapidly spreading conspiracy theories, some of which claim it’s a scheme by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to throw people in detainment camps. ""New York is trying to pass a bill that would allow them to round up non mask wearers and people who don’t want to take the vaccine into concentration camps,"" one popular post on Facebook reads. ""Then with a court order they can force vaccinate you."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is wrong, and a faulty interpretation of the bill in question, A416.  While the legislation may be applicable in the COVID-19 era, the bill has been dormant since it was drafted and proposed during the 2015 Ebola outbreak, before a vaccine for the disease was approved.  The bill specifies that it applies to infected people and their contacts who refuse to quarantine in a health emergency.  Like other evergreen bills that get introduced year after year with little regard, the legislation has never been heard by committee. It was introduced for the state's 2021-22 legislative session, but it was also introduced in the 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2019-20 sessions and has never had a co-sponsor. Assembly bill 416 was introduced by Assemblyman N. Nick Perry, D- Brooklyn, and is described as: ""An act to amend the public health law, in relation to the removal of cases, contacts and carriers of communicable diseases who are potentially dangerous to the public health."" Frank Shea, Perry’s communications director, said the assemblyman proposed the legislation in 2015 after a nurse who worked closely with Ebola patients in Africa refused to quarantine upon returning to the United States. It was designed to be similar to existing laws that allow for the detainment of mental health patients who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. The bill says that during a health emergency, officials would have the authority to detain in a medical or ""other appropriate facility"" any infected persons and their contacts who are deemed a threat to the public. It also says that, if the detentions last longer than three business days, the state would need a court order. ""The assemblyman thought that we needed a mechanism for the government to say that we can’t have someone with this type of communicable disease who says ‘the hell with the rest of you’ and travels on our trains and buses and goes into our schools,"" Shea said. Its creation had nothing to do with the COVID-19 crisis, he added, and despite being reintroduced, Perry hasn’t pushed the bill or solicited sponsorships. Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin of Suffolk released a statement rebuking the bill on Jan. 3, and initially claimed that it was scheduled ""to be taken up by the New York State Assembly’s Health Committee on Wednesday, January 6, 2021.""  But that isn’t true. The Assembly has no committee hearings on its schedule that day, the first day of session.  On Jan. 3 Politico reported that it received no reply from Zeldin’s office about where he got the information that the Health Committee was taking up the bill. Zeldin’s statement appears to have been amended shortly after to say that the bill will instead be ""referred"" to the committee that day.  Cuomo’s office, meanwhile, says they weren’t aware of the bill until recently. ""No, the governor doesn’t want to open up concentration camps,"" Cuomo’s senior adviser, Rich Azzopardi, told PolitiFact. ""We didn’t even know this bill existed.""  Perry says he’s receiving threats over the bill and wrote in an emailed statement that he’s open to amendments that would address concerns raised by critics. In this statement, he urged a careful reading of the bill. ""There is no intent, no plan, or provisions in my bill to take away, or violate any rights, or liberties that all Americans are entitled to under our Constitution, either state or federal,"" the statement says. ""A proper reading of the bill would find that significant attention was paid to protect individual rights which could be affected by exercising the authority granted in this bill."" Social media posts claim that New York officials are trying to pass a bill that would allow them to round up non-mask wearers and those who don’t want to get vaccinated into ""concentration camps"" to eventually force vaccinations for COVID-19. This is wrong. While the bill, A416, may be applicable in the COVID-19 era, it has sat dormant since it was introduced in 2015 during the Ebola outbreak and has not gained any traction in the New York State Assembly. The legislation specifies that it applies to infected people and their contacts who refuse to quarantine in a health emergency. The bill has no co-sponsors and has never once been heard by committee despite being introduced in the 2015-16, 2017-18, 2019-20 sessions, and the current session.  We rate this False. ",/factchecks/2021/jan/05/facebook-posts/new-york-isnt-trying-pass-bill-put-non-mask-wearer/

No, Wisconsin bill does not decertify and give Trump win here
","The disinformation onslaught of 2020 isn’t exactly reversing course in the new year. The runup to the Jan. 6 finalizing of the Electoral College vote brings us one particularly absurd example from Gateway Pundit, a far-right online publication that routinely publishes stories unburdened by facts or common sense. The headline published late Jan. 4, 2021, said this: ""BREAKING: Wisconsin Legislature Announces Resolution To Be Introduced on Thursday Which Will Likely Decertify State and Award to President Trump."" This article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). The claim isn’t remotely true, and the ill-conceived story itself provides evidence of that. The story begins with a paragraph largely restating the headline, then embeds a tweet making the same outlandish claim. The story then links to and quotes the resolution in question, 2021 Assembly Resolution 3, proposed by state Rep. Scott Allen, R-Waukesha. The Republican-controlled Assembly passed the bill Jan. 4 by a voice vote near the end of inauguration ceremonies, which most Democrats skipped over concerns that COVID-19 precautions were inadequate. But the story ignores that the bill says nothing about decertifying.  Here’s the actual closing of the bill, where the ""Resolved"" sections indicate the action it is seeking: Resolved by the assembly, That: the Wisconsin State Assembly recognizes that the most important function for a government is to conduct fair and honest elections that follow the duly enacted law; and, be it further Resolved, That when there are significant portions of the population that question the integrity of the elections due to the failure of election officials to follow the letter of the law, it is incumbent upon the legislature to address the issues that are in question; and, be it further Resolved, That the members of the Wisconsin State Assembly place the redress to these and other election law violations and failed administrative procedures as its highest priority and shall take up legislation crafted to ensure civil officers follow the laws as written. It doesn’t take a degree in English literature to discern this doesn’t award anything to President Donald Trump. Trump lost Wisconsin to former Vice President Joe Biden by 20,000 votes, as confirmed by a canvas and recount. The bill simply says the Legislature should make it a priority to take up legislation ensuring election officials follow laws as written. The timeline in the Gateway Pundit story is also divorced from reality. The ""Thursday"" cited here would be a day after Congress meets to finalize the election results.  And the deadline for action to alter Wisconsin’s slate of electors has long-since passed. The state’s 10 Biden electors cast their votes on Dec. 14. As expected based on election returns confirmed as fair and legitimate by election and government officials from both parties nationwide, that gave Biden a 306 to 232 victory over Trump, handing him the White House. Gateway Pundit Editor Jim Hoft did not immediately reply to an email seeking evidence of this article’s claim. Allen declined to comment on how the story characterized his resolution, saying the text speaks for itself. Gateway Pundit, a regular purveyor of disinformation, says Wisconsin is introducing a resolution to decertify the state’s election results and award its Electoral College votes to Trump. The article conveniently includes the text of the bill, allowing readers to see for themselves this claim is 100% fabricated. The bill simply says the Legislature would prioritize legislation addressing election laws. It says nothing remotely related to decertification or awarding the state to Trump. And in any case, the state’s electoral votes were already cast for Biden weeks ago. This is disinformation in its most transparent form.

No evidence that 4,925 voters from out-of-state voted in Georgia in the presidential election
","President Donald Trump has claimed that thousands of out-of-state voters improperly cast ballots in Georgia during the 2020 election. ""You had out-of-state voters — they voted in Georgia but they were from out of state — of 4,925,"" Trump said in a Jan. 2 phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Ryan Germany, the general counsel for Raffensperger’s office, pushed back on Trump’s assertion during the call. Germany said that Trump was working from inaccurate information and that the secretary of state’s office had already investigated these claims. ""We’ve been going through each of those. ... Everyone we’ve been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately,"" Germany told Trump.  Trump appears to have gotten his number from an analysis conducted by Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign staffer and election analyst. Braynard claimed that he had located 4,926 people who cast absentee or early ballots in Georgia but were registered to vote in another state.  Braynard arrived at the number by comparing Georgia registration and voting lists with the the U.S. Postal Service change-of-address data.  Braynard’s methods have been strongly criticized by election experts and statisticians. In an analysis of Braynard’s findings, Harvard professor and voting statistics expert Stephen Ansolabehere wrote that ""the report offers no conclusions based on scientifically accepted standards of evidence"" and that parts of the report were ""riddled with errors and biases that render it invalid for purposes of drawing inferences about the quantities at issue."" In a Dec. 18 article, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution interviewed election experts who criticized Braynard’s methods, pointing out that matching voter lists to other databases is likely to produce false matches because of people with identical names or birth dates. In addition, Braynard’s analysis did not account for college students, people with vacation homes, military personnel or people on temporary work assignments, all of whom are eligible to vote in Georgia despite having temporarily left the state.  Braynard himself seemed to backpedal when Georgia State Rep. Bee Nguyen questioned him about his conclusions during a Dec. 10 legislative hearing.  During the hearing, Nguyen said that she had confirmed that many of the purported out-of-state voters on Braynard’s list actually lived in Georgia. Of the first 10 voters on the list, Nguyen was able to establish that eight lived in the state through phone calls and property tax records.  In addition, Nguyen found that Braynard had cited a condominium complex near her home as a postal box ""disguised as a residential address."" She also found that certain names on the list occurred more than once.  In response to Nguyen’s questions, Braynard claimed that he had only listed ""potentially illegal"" voters and that he was not accusing any of the people on his list of breaking the law.  Trump said that ""you had (4,925) out-of-state voters… in Georgia."" He appears to have gotten his number from a list of purported ""out-of-state voters"" created by a former Trump campaign staffer. Braynard’s analysis has been widely criticized by statisticians and election experts. Braynard himself acknowledged that he only listed ""potentially"" illegal voters rather than people proven to have voted illegally.  The Georgia Secretary of State’s office has investigated the claim and found it to be baseless.

Trump rehashes debunked claim about ‘suitcases’ of ballots in Georgia phone call
","In an hour-long phone call pressuring Georgia’s secretary of state to overturn the results of the election, President Donald Trump rehashed the debunked claim that election workers in Atlanta were caught on tape secretly counting ""suitcases"" full of fraudulent ballots behind closed doors. State and county officials have said the surveillance video Trump mentioned shows normal ballot processing. But Trump stood by his inaccurate version of events during the Jan. 2 call, which was first reported by the Washington Post. ""That was the tape that’s been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else,"" Trump said to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, according to the recording.  In Trump’s telling, the Nov. 3 tape showed that after a ""major water main break"" at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena, where Fulton County election workers were counting ballots, ""everybody fled the area."" With Republican election observers gone, the county’s election workers returned, Trump said. They reached under a table and pulled out ""suitcases or trunks"" full of ballots that were hidden there hours earlier, he said, and they secretly tallied ""18,000 ballots, all for (Joe) Biden."" Trump’s story aligns with the false narrative that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his team pushed when they introduced the tape during a Dec. 3 hearing with state legislators. What actually happened, according to Georgia and Fulton County officials, is much different.  Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, has addressed the ""suitcases"" claim in social media postings, TV interviews, and press conferences since Dec. 4, when he tweeted that the video showed ""normal ballot processing."" In a Jan. 4 press conference ahead of Georgia’s runoff Senate election, Sterling spent minutes rebutting Trump’s claim, which he called ""thoroughly debunked."" The sequence of events he described lined up with what PolitiFact and multiple other fact-checkers have reported.  In reality, the ballots seen in the surveillance footage were not in suitcases or trunks. They were in ""normal absentee ballot carriers,"" Sterling said. The ballots were removed from their envelopes while news media personnel and observers were still in the room, and there was no formal announcement for observers to leave. But some observers took off once the election workers responsible for cutting the envelopes open and verifying the ballots inside had finished their job and started packing up for the night. Workers tasked with scanning the ballots got instructions to keep going, and an independent monitor and investigator oversaw the ballot counting as it continued into the night, Sterling said.  In an affidavit, Frances Watson, the Georgia secretary of state’s chief investigator, wrote that the state’s ""investigation and review of the entire security footage revealed that there were no mystery ballots that were brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables."" ""Around 10 p.m., with the room full of people, including official monitors and the media, video shows ballots that had already been opened but not counted placed in the boxes, sealed up, stored under the table,"" Watson wrote. ""When the counting continued into later in the night, those boxes were opened so that the ballots inside could then be counted."" Sterling said he reviewed the full tape with a local reporter. ""The president’s legal team had the entire tape, they watched the entire tape, and then from our point of view, intentionally misled the state Senate, voters and the people of the United States about this,"" Sterling said. There’s no evidence that the ballots counted on election night were ""all for Biden,"" as Trump claimed, and a state monitor disputed that 18,000 votes were tallied during that window. There’s also no connection between the ""suitcase"" allegation and a leak at State Farm Arena on Election Day. State Farm Arena reported that one room being used for ballot counting had been affected by a water leak at approximately 6 a.m., hours before the scene in question took place.  Arena staff repaired the leak, which Sterling attributed to an overflowing urinal, in roughly two hours, according to the arena’s statement. No ballots were damaged, the arena said. The Trump campaign and White House did not immediately respond to our inquiries. Trump claimed a tape shows that after a ""major water main break"" in Georgia, election workers pulled out ballots stored in ""suitcases"" under a table and counted ""18,000 ballots, all for Biden"" with no election observers present. That’s wrong in multiple ways. State and county officials have repeatedly debunked this claim. The video in question does not show any wrongdoing, and there’s no evidence that the ballots shown were fraudulent or ""all for Biden."" The water leak, which was sourced to a urinal, was unrelated.

Congress’s task is simply to count electoral votes Jan. 6
","After a lengthy string of court defeats and a formal Electoral College vote, backers of President Donald Trump have pinned their hopes on the Jan. 6 Congressional review of the vote to overturn the president’s defeat. Election officials, many of them Republicans, and officials from Trump’s U.S. Department of Justice have confirmed there is no proof that voter fraud affected the outcome of the 2020 election. And federal and state courts have dismissed Trump’s claims of voter fraud nearly 60 times. But Trump and many allies have continued to claim without evidence that fraud influenced the election. Though a dozen U.S. senators, including Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson, have pledged to object to the electoral results and seek an audit of the returns, another Wisconsin congressman says that is beyond lawmakers’ power. ""Congress has one job here: to count electoral votes that have in fact been cast by any state, as designated by those authorized to do so under state law,"" U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, said in a Jan. 3, 2020, statement signed by several other members of the House. ""To take action otherwise — that is, to unconstitutionally insert Congress into the center of the presidential election process — would amount to stealing power from the people and the states."" He’s exactly right about Congress’s job. Here’s why. Gallagher and some other Republicans have spoken to clarify the role of Congress after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced plans — joined by Johnson and nine other Republican senators — to object to the certification of the Electoral College results. (Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri has separately promised to object to the results.) A release from the group said they are seeking an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in ""disputed states"" and intend to vote to reject electors from those states until that is complete. They said this is necessary because of ""unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities."" The effort is all but guaranteed to fail given that objections must be backed by the Republican-led Senate and Democrat-led House in order to pass. But Gallagher’s assertion is that the effort is not just hopeless, it’s unconstitutional.  The statement noted no states have overturned their own election results, though Republicans control the Legislature in Wisconsin and other disputed states. ""There is no authority for Congress to make value judgments in the abstract regarding any state’s election laws or the manner in which they have been implemented,"" the statement from Gallagher and the others said. ""The text of the Constitution is clear. States select electors. Congress does not. Accordingly, our path forward is also clear. We must respect the states’ authority here. Though doing so may frustrate our immediate political objectives, we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals. We must count the electoral votes submitted by the states."" The group’s statement also noted that setting a precedent where Congress could overturn the Electoral College would delegitimize the very system Republicans have relied on for their recent success, having won the national popular vote in the presidential race only once in the last 32 years. ""I just don’t think we want to endorse the principle (that) Jan. 6 is a legitimate forum for Congress to overturn the will of the states and the people,"" Gallagher said Jan. 4, 2020 on WTMJ radio. ""If you’ve endorsed that principle, then you’ve already destroyed the idea of American government. Right? At least you’ve destroyed the conservative idea of American government."" The process involved comes from the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, which says electors for each state should deliver their presidential and vice presidential votes to the U.S. government. That happened Dec. 14, with those votes confirming a 306 to 232 victory for former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democrat. Here’s what the happens next, as spelled out in the amendment: ""The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted; -- The person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President."" On Jan. 6, Vice President Mike Pence will open the sealed certificates from each state and hand them to tellers to read aloud. During that process he will call for objections to each state’s votes. The resulting process for those objections comes from the Electoral Count Act of 1887. Objections must be made in writing by at least one member of both the House and Senate. They can be debated for a maximum of two hours before a vote, which requires a majority vote from both houses in order to pass and throw out that state’s votes. Objections can fall in two possible categories: That the vote was not ""regularly given"" by an elector or that the elector was not ""lawfully certified"" according to state statutory procedures, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. But that’s not to say Congress is vested with the power to substitute its preference or judgment for that of the states. In fact, federal law explicitly says the power to appoint electors belongs to the states. It says if electors are appointed by the states at least six days before the electors meet — a criteria met by all the so-called disputed states — those votes ""shall be conclusive and shall govern in the counting of the electoral votes."" Johnson himself acknowledged this in an interview in December with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""The Electoral College met. They voted. That’s our process. That process has played out,"" Johnson said when asked if he accepted Biden as president-elect. On a related note, Federal law delineates the vice president’s role as simply ""to preserve order"" during that proceeding. He has no authority on his own to weigh in on whether those votes are valid, contrary to what many have claimed. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, told the Associated Press there is ""zero chance such a maneuver by Pence or the Republicans will succeed"" if they object or otherwise seek to overturn the results. The expected objections won’t pass (Democrats control the House), and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had urged his party privately in mid-December not to object to the count. Gallagher said, ""Congress has one job here: to count electoral votes that have in fact been cast by any state."" He said this in making the broader point that Congress is not tasked in this case with making ""value judgements"" about the legitimacy of those votes. That is a power left to the states. The role of Congress, as laid out in the Constitution and federal law, is effectively to observe the electors sent in by the states. And that’s how the process has been carried out throughout American history. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2021/jan/04/mike-gallagher/congresss-task-simply-count-electoral-votes/

Donald Trump falsely claims Georgia victory in recorded call
","President Donald Trump sought to change the result of the presidential election in Georgia during a Jan. 2 phone call with Georgia’s secretary of state. As they spoke, Trump repeatedly claimed that he won the contest in the state, despite the final count that delivered victory to President-elect Joe Biden. ""We won very substantially, Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly,"" Trump said at the beginning of the call with Brad Raffensperger, according to an audio recording. Trump echoed his claim several times in the call, at one point saying: ""We won Georgia easily. We won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But if you go by basic, simple numbers, we won it easily, easily."" Raffensperger during the call rejected Trump’s assertions: ""Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong."" Election results in Georgia were counted three times: the initial count, an audit-triggered hand recount, and a formal recount requested by the Trump campaign. Both recounts supported the original outcome: that Biden won in the state. The election results were certified in late November and recertified Dec. 7. It was a close race, but the margin of victory was in the thousands. Nearly 5 million people voted in Georgia. The final result said that Biden beat Trump in Georgia by 11,779 votes. ""I know there are people that are convinced the election was fraught with problems, but the evidence, the actual evidence, the facts tell us a different story,"" Raffensperger said in December when he recertified the results.

We could not find any credible news reports of nurses developing Bell’s Palsy after receiving the vaccine. Misinformation about the condition, which affects about 40,000 Americans every year, has swirled online since a coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech was granted emergency-use authorization on Dec. 11. The confusion stems from a briefing document published by the Food and Drug Administration before the vaccine’s emergency approval. The agency noted that four vaccinated participants in clinical trials for the vaccine, representing 0.02% of the total group, developed Bell’s Palsy. The FDA recommended ""surveillance"" for cases of the condition as larger groups of people receive the vaccine. But the agency said the frequency of Bell’s Palsy among clinical trial participants was ""consistent with the expected background rate in the general population,"" and that ""there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time.""

Fact-checking Sen. Pat Toomey’s comment that Pa. Gov. Tom Wolf is ‘closing down businesses again’
","When President Donald Trump threatened to reject the coronavirus economic relief package passed with wide bipartisan support, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey appeared on Fox News to defend the plan and stress how urgently businesses need relief.  ""In my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again,"" Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said Sunday before Trump relented and signed the measure into law.  We wondered how sweeping the latest round of virus shutdowns is and what types of establishments are affected.  Earlier this month, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf halted indoor dining, closed casinos, gyms, and entertainment venues, and lowered retail occupancy limits statewide for the first time since the spring. The new restrictions came as the state started reporting more than 10,000 new infections per day.  Wolf said he hoped the restrictions would slow the spread of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed just before vaccines become widely available.  ""This is a bridge to a better future in Pennsylvania,"" Wolf said.  Before this latest round of closures, all 67 Pennsylvania counties had been in the ""green"" phase of the Wolf administration’s three-step reopening plan since July 3, even though Trump falsely claimed otherwise on the campaign trail. That allowed many businesses to operate at 75% capacity.  Since the new rules took effect on Dec. 11, the number of new cases reported each day in Pennsylvania fell to as low as 4,621 on Dec. 27, and the seven-day average fell to 7,757.  The restrictions are set to expire on Jan. 4, but Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said the state may extend them if cases climb again in the days ahead. A local ban on indoor dining in Philadelphia will remain in effect until Jan. 15. Soon after Wolf announced this latest round of restrictions, at least a dozen gym and restaurant owners across Pennsylvania publicly vowed to defy them.  Business owners argued they should be allowed to stay open because internal data they collected showed their establishments hadn’t been the source of any community spread. A recent Stanford University study, however, linked restaurants, gyms, and crowded indoor spaces to 80% of infections in 10 U.S. cities in the early months of the pandemic.  ""If I have to prove my point by being taken out in handcuffs, then so be it,"" said Phil Guarno, who owns Fenicci’s Italian restaurant in Hershey, Pa., which has remained open for indoor dining despite the new order. ""It’s gotten to the point where it’s really do or die. It’s time to stand up against this tyranny."" The relief bill includes a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses like Guarno’s, as well as temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefits for the unemployed and $600 direct payments to most Americans. Schools, healthcare providers, and renters facing eviction will also get relief.  Across the country, at least seven other states and the District of Columbia have joined Pennsylvania and imposed restrictions on large numbers of businesses. They include Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Ten states have halted activity at some businesses, and elsewhere, establishments remain largely open even as the pandemic rages on. Toomey said ""in my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again.""  He’s right that Pennsylvania shuttered many businesses earlier this month, and seven other states have imposed similarly sweeping restrictions. We rate Toomey’s statement True. ",/factchecks/2020/dec/30/pat-toomey/fact-checking-sen-pat-toomeys-comment-pa-gov-tom-w/

Trump falsely and prematurely claims 2020 presidential victory
","President Donald Trump prematurely, and falsely, said early Wednesday that he won re-election for president, and called for the counting of ballots in the United States to cease. ""This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country,"" Trump said in remarks from the East Room of the White House. ""We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election."" He said the campaign would go to the Supreme Court, without offering specifics about a theoretical case. ""We want all voting to stop. We don’t want them to find any ballots at 4 o’clock in the morning and add them to the list, okay? It’s a very sad moment. ... And we will win this. And as far as I’m concerned, we already have won it."" Ballots are routinely counted after Election Day for a number of different reasons, in states controlled by both Republicans and Democrats. Despite Trump’s remarks, the counting of legal ballots continues across the country, not just in states that remain too close to call.  Federal law allows states more than a month after the election to finalize results. Electoral votes are not cast until Dec. 14, and Congress officially counts them on Jan. 6. ""There are no official results on Election Night — there never have been,"" said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University constitutional law professor who specializes in elections. ""Election Night tallies are always just preliminary, pending certification of the (checking) of returns under state law, which takes time. Every state has a law on this point."" Having a clear winner by midnight on Election Night historically requires a wide margin of victory. The presidential winner wasn’t known before midnight in 1960, 1968, 1976, 2000, 2004 and 2016, historian Michael Beschloss tweeted. One of the consequences of the flood of mail ballots — a byproduct of the pandemic — is that they take longer to count. Ballots that aren’t filled out in person at a polling place require extra steps to verify a voter’s identity, such as comparing signatures to prevent both voter fraud and double counting.  The increase in mail balloting isn’t the only factor preventing a full accounting of all votes shortly after the polls close. There are at least two categories of ballots that, according to state law, are certain to be counted after Election Night in any election year.  One involves ballots from service members stationed overseas. In that case, many states allow a grace period for ballots mailed back to the mainland. For instance, states like Georgia and Nevada require a postmark, but not receipt, by Nov. 3. Neither state had declared a winner at the time of Trump’s speech. The other involves provisional ballots, which are ballots cast when a voter’s eligibility is in question. If election officials resolve those questions, the ballot is counted, but the checking and counting process takes time. Trump’s path to an Electoral College victory appears to ride on winning a combination of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, five states he carried in 2016. At the time of Trump’s remarks, which began at 2:21 a.m. Eastern Time Wednesday, he led in the raw vote count in each of those five states.  But not all the votes have been counted in those states, and absentee and mail-in ballots from urban areas likely to support Biden are among those yet to be counted.  At the time Trump spoke, significant numbers of ballots remained to be counted in the Democratic strongholds of Pennsylvania such as Philadelphia, the Philadelphia suburbs and Pittsburgh. In Milwaukee and Detroit, a significant portion of votes remained to be counted. Trump’s lead in Georgia — like the three others, a state Trump won in 2016 — had also narrowed with Biden making gains around Atlanta.  Lead switching between the candidates in any given state is not a sign of something amiss. Media organizations, primarily television networks and the Associated Press, have ""decision desks"" that determine when enough results are available to allow them to ""call"" a race. No decision desk recommends a call when the race is close or when just a fraction of the total has been reported.  ""We want to be 99.5% sure before we project a race,"" John Lapinski, director of the NBC News elections unit, told PolitiFact. That’s especially true this year when network number-crunchers are well aware that ballots cast by mail might have very different patterns of results than ballots cast in person.  States that are rated as ""too early to call"" or ""too close to call"" by media organizations can’t be tentatively chalked up as a win for either candidate. And that’s where credible media outlets’ decision desks are currently ranking Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, as well as a few other states, including Georgia. Designating states as too close to call is done specifically to avoid giving a candidate a premature lead in the race.  No mainstream media organization, including conservative-friendly Fox News, or even conservative outlets like Newsmax or OANN, had projected Trump as the electoral college winner at the time of his remarks. Trump said, ""As far as I’m concerned, we already have won"" the 2020 presidential election. At another point, he said, ""frankly, we did win this election."" It is possible that Trump will win re-election. But his White House speech in the early morning hours of Nov. 4 wasn’t a prediction. It was a premature and false declaration based on incomplete information about the vote counts in a number of states. The U.S. election system allows states more than a month to count legally cast ballots. No credible organization had reported that Trump won when he made his speech.  Trump’s statement is wrong and ignores the process by which the United States casts and counts votes.

It would not be permitted if it were within 10 feet of a polling site. There’s no evidence this sign was too close, and journalists on the ground said they saw the same sign at another poll and it was appropriately far enough away. A photographer with the Bucks County Courier Times went to a poll in the same community and sent PolitiFact this photo.  A Democratic sign outside a poll in Warwick, Pa. (Anthony DiMattia/Bucks County Courier Times) The sign bears the headline, ""Bucks County Democratic Official Sample Ballot.""  Sample ballots are a staple of Election Day materials. Typically, they are printed as flyers for voters to take with them as they vote. And both Democrats and Republicans use them. These handouts always highlight the candidates from whichever party printed them. In this instance, the party’s sample ballot is a sign, and it blurs out the Republican candidates, because Democrats don’t want voters to vote for Republicans. Investigative reporter Crissa Shoemaker DeBree with the Courier Times told us Republicans are handing out their version of sample ballots as flyers. Democrats decided not to do that this year, she said, out of concern for COVID-19. So, by itself, the sign in the photo is not unusual. The sign would be illegal if it were too close to the entrance to the poll. Coudrey’s tweet does not prove that it is. The rule in Pennsylvania is that signs must be at least 10 feet from the polling place. A Courier Times reporter said the signs he saw were 30 feet from the entrance. We asked Coudrey if he had been to the poll and had taken the picture. He declined to answer. His website says he moved to Los Angeles when he was 20, and his current business address is there.  A tweet said that there was scamming taking place at a Pennsylvania poll. The evidence was a sign of a sample Democratic ballot. Such sample ballots are commonplace at polls, and Republicans were handing their versions as flyers. Democrats chose to use signs out of concern for COVID-19. The sign followed the election rules and there is no evidence it was within 10 feet of the polls. We rate this claim False. CORRECTION, Nov. 4, 10:40 a.m.: The signs photographed by a local reporter were at a different precinct in the same community in Bucks County. The sign contents were identical.

Unfounded Election Day social media posts warn of ‘mass murder’
","The Election Day warning went viral on all the social media platforms. It was a frightening admonition to ""stay inside on Election Day and a few days after"" because people are planning to ""mass murder"" people of color and those within the LGBTQ community if Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins against President Donald Trump. The posts give an appearance of being well-intentioned, urging people in those groups to stay home and, in some versions, to ""stay safe."" They were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) These broad claims have the characteristics of disinformation intended to spread fear and discourage certain people from going out to vote. So while it may be packaged as a word of caution, experts say some social media users are unknowingly sharing a false message. (Screenshot from Twitter) Federal officials have warned some law enforcement agencies to be aware of legitimate threats of violence related to the election. But these frightening, non-specific social media claims that assert targeted mass murder is brewing seemed aimed to suppress the vote, said Paul Barrett, author of the paper, ""Disinformation and the 2020 Election: How the Social Media Industry Should Prepare."" ""People should not just be suspicious of such posts; they should reject them as obviously false and designed exclusively to frighten social media users and keep them from voting,"" said Barrett, also deputy director of New York University’s Center for Business and Human Rights.  A PolitiFact analysis of the evolution of the message about Trump supporters ""mass murdering"" people suggests it originated on Snapchat and TikTok before moving to Twitter just after midnight on Nov. 2.  The first tweet we could find with an image of that message was published around 12:45 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The account that posted it was created in June and was quote-tweeting another post that included an image of what looked like screenshots of several similar messages on platforms like Snapchat and TikTok. ""If Biden wins the election, there are people out there planning on mass murdering poc and lgbtq+ people,"" says text in the image. ""Please stay inside during the election and a few days after. It’s not just a theory, there are leaked screenshots of group chats, Discord chats and private Facebook groups."" We could find none of that material to support the claim in the post. Subsequent versions of the message claimed without evidence that the Proud Boys, a far-right men’s organization with a history of violent confrontations, was planning to mass murder people if Biden wins the election. Many of the tweets we found repeat the same language offering a trigger warning. Darren Linvill, a disinformation expert and associate professor at Clemson University, told PolitiFact the tweets appear to have originated among teenagers in the Philippines. ""I think this is all teen drama,"" he said. ""We looked at several accounts, and they all seem legitimate. There is a lot of cutting and pasting, and while that is concerning it isn't that uncommon."" From Twitter, the message appears to have jumped to Instagram, where the same screenshot warning was first posted around noon on Nov. 2. Similar posts have received hundreds of thousands of likes and comments, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.  Sarah Oates, professor and senior scholar in journalism at the University of Maryland, specializes in studying Russian disinformation. She said it’s hard to know at this point whether the posts are being spread by people who want to intimidate individuals or whether they’re sincerely worried.  ""There are certainly reasons for people in these groups to feel threatened and they have been the victims of hate speech, attacks, and murder due to their status,"" she said. ""People should look at the material and really consider — by sharing this am I sharing useful information or am I contributing to a campaign of terror against a marginalized group?"" RELATED: What you need to know about Election Day misinformation ""Voter intimidation has partially moved online and especially on Election Day, it is very prudent to be very suspicious about the trustworthiness of any communications suggesting that eligible voters should stay away from the polling stations,"" said Niklas Myhr, a marketing and economics professor at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., who specializes in social media. ""Some of these posts can also be discarded based on simple logic. Why should you not go and vote if these bad things are supposed to happen only after the results have been tallied?"" We reached out on the afternoon of Nov. 3 to the FBI and the Department of Justice about the posts. We didn’t get a reply from the Justice Department and the FBI said it had no comment.  We could find no evidence that Trump supporters or the Proud Boys are planning mass murder if Biden wins the election. A series of social media posts claim that Trump supporters and right-wing groups are ""planning on mass murdering poc and lgbtq+ people"" if Biden wins the election. There is no evidence to support that. The claim appears to be a viral social media rumor, and experts say they show hallmarks of being part of a campaign to suppress the vote. While law enforcement agencies nationwide are bracing for post-election unrest, we could find no credible threats of ""mass murder."" Without additional evidence, the claim is inaccurate.

A nonpartisan reality: National Guard troops deployed to red and blue states on Election Day
","Cities nationwide are bracing for unrest after Election Day, but one popular Instagram post says the potential violence is politically one-sided. ""Right now, across the nation, in DEEP blue (D) cities, National Guard is being activated, and businesses boarded up,"" says text in the image, which was published Nov. 2 by Anthony Cabassa, chairman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly in California.  ""The election has been sold as a Dem win, ALL the polls show ‘Racist Trump’ losing key states. So why are deep RED cities not boarding up? Why is National Guard not being called in, in case Biden wins?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)  The screenshot comes from a post from Cabassa on Parler, a website that has likened itself to a conservative version of Twitter. It’s inaccurate. National Guard troops are being deployed nationwide, including in states that regularly vote for Republicans. Fact-checkers have debunked the claim that the National Guard is only in areas that tend to vote for Democrats.  The Military Times reported Nov. 2 that the National Guard has deployed more than 3,600 troops in 16 states. Among them are several states that are expected to swing in Trump’s favor on Election Night, including Alabama and Tennessee. Those states also have Republican governors, which are generally the ones to decide whether to bring in the National Guard or not. In Texas, National Guard troops could be sent to cities like Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, according to the Military Times.  The Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Fact-checking claim about poll watchers turned away in Philadelphia
","As Pennsylvania voters headed to the polls for their last chance to vote in the 2020 election, posts on social media claimed there was a lack of transparency in the election process. ""A poll watcher in Philly was just wrongfully prevented from entering the polling place,"" Will Chamberlain, editor-in-chief of the conservative magazine Human Events, tweeted Nov. 3. His tweet includes a video that shows two people standing at a doorway and telling a third person that he cannot go in. ""You are not letting me in?"" the man asks the couple. ""No,"" they replied. ""I have a city-wide watcher’s certificate,"" the man starts saying. ""It’s not for this location,"" a woman at the door tells him. The man seeking entry tells the couple that the certificate says it’s ""good in every ward and division in the city."" The 33-second video, which has been viewed more than 2.3 million times, ends with the man remaining outside. Chamberlain’s tweet was retweeted by Mike Roman, director of Election Day operations for President Donald Trump’s campaign. ""DEMOCRAT ELECTION OFFICIALS BANNING TRUMP POLL WATCHERS IN PHILLY. This is happening all over the City. The steal is on!"" Roman tweeted. Kevin Feeley, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia City Commissioners, which is in charge of elections in the city, told PolitiFact that what happened in the video was ""a mistake"" on behalf of the people running the polling site. ""It was a misunderstanding of the law,"" Feeley said. However, the man eventually went to another polling site, where staff who better understood the law let him inside, Feeley said. Feeley said this is what happened: the poll watcher went to a polling site in Philadelphia this morning, but the judge of election (the person who runs that particular polling place) thought that the watcher could not be let into that particular location, because a ward and division number on the watcher’s certificate did not correspond with that site. That used to be an old rule — that a watcher could only be admitted to a specific ward and division. ""That is no longer the law,"" Feeley said. The judge of election was eventually told the watcher could be admitted into that location. ""We corrected the problem with the judge of election, we addressed it,"" Feeley said. Feeley said that the poll watcher left the site shown in the video and went to another site, ""and the judge there correctly understood the law and (the poll watcher) was admitted into that site."" ""We regret that it happened, it was an honest mistake,"" Feeley said. ""It appears to be the only mistake of its kind."" Chamberlain in a follow-up tweet posted a picture that he said showed the poll watcher’s certificate. The picture says that the watcher’s name is ""Gary Feldman,"" representing Trump. The picture of the certificate does not include any other identifying information. PolitiFact was unable to reach Feldman to confirm if he was the person in the video and whether he was able to enter another site as a poll watcher. Tweets claimed that poll watchers in Philadelphia were prevented from entering polling places. A poll watcher was denied access to one polling site in Philadelphia because the person in charge of that particular polling place was not up to date on the law, which allows watchers to enter any site, not just the ward and division site specified on the watcher’s certificate, said Feeley, a spokesperson for Philadelphia City Commissioners. The same poll watcher went to another site and was allowed to go in, according to Feeley. Feeley said that the judge of election who had inaccurate information was updated on the new rules, and that there is ""no evidence that it was a systemic problem.""

No, ballots for Trump weren’t thrown out by a poll worker from Pennsylvania’s Erie County
","Elections officials in Erie County, Pa., have debunked a viral social media claim alleging that a poll worker tossed more than 100 ballots cast for President Donald Trump. The claim originated with an Instagram user who said they were a poll worker and wrote, ""I’ve thrown out over a hundred ballots for Trump already!"" The Instagram story was screenshotted and spread widely on Twitter by Mike Coudrey, a self-described activist and entrepreneur. ""Poll worker in Erie County, PA … admitted on Instagram that he has thrown out over 100 pro-Trump ballots,"" Coudrey wrote in the Nov. 3 tweet, which has since been deleted but was shared widely, including by prominent conservative commentators such as Dinesh D’Souza.

Similar screenshots have also surfaced in widespread posts on Facebook, where they were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The alleged admission of ballot tossing did not actually come from a poll worker, however. ""Erie County has checked into the unfortunate claim being shared across social media by someone saying they are working as part of the Erie County Board of Elections and throwing out ballots,"" Erie County Board of Elections Chair Carl J. Anderson III said in a statement. ""The person making the statements does not work in any way with Erie County or have any part of Erie County’s election process,"" Anderson wrote, ""In fact, the individual is not a registered voter and is not believed to be a resident of Erie County."" A spokesperson for Erie County confirmed to PolitiFact that the statement was in reference to the Instagram story in question. Other reporters and fact-checkers have since noted that the viral Instagram story was a hoax, and that claims about it were inaccurate. Coudrey told PolitiFact in a Twitter message that he had seen that the county issued its official statement saying the Instagram user was not a poll worker. He also noted that the county’s statement said authorities are investigating the incident for potential criminal charges. Overall, the claim that an Erie County poll worker threw out over 100 ballots for Trump is based on an Instagram story from a person unaffiliated with the county. It has since been debunked.

Video misrepresents Biden’s speech in Michigan
","A video posted on TikTok falsely implies that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is plotting election fraud. ""Biden says he doesn’t need voters to get elected,"" said text over a short video of Biden speaking during a campaign stop in Michigan. ""That’s not suspicious….""

But the context of that speech and similar speeches make it clear that Biden is telling people that he needs their support to get him elected — and that they should stay involved should he be elected. Political organizations and press teams for candidates typically send reporters the text of speeches public figures will make in high-profile events. Likewise, Biden’s press team often sends reporters Biden’s ""remarks as prepared for delivery."" The campaign sent such information for an Oct. 31 campaign event Biden had in Detroit. That prepared text shows that Biden was expected to say that day (emphasis ours): ""It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We’re done with the chaos. The tweets. The anger. The hate. The failure. The irresponsibility. We’ve got a lot of work to do. And if I’m elected your president, we’re going to do it. We’re going to act.""

Folks we got a lot of work to do. I don't only need you to get me elected. I need you once I'm elected. Because if i'm elected your president, we're going to get things done.""
