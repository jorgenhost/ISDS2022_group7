Independent activist Linda Curtis says Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison conceded with less than 20 percent of precincts reporting
","Linda Curtis of Bastrop, who’s opposed Republican Gov. Rick Perry for two election seasons, says she saw a sign of GOP bigwigs running scared the night Perry bested U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and upstart Debra Medina for their party’s 2010 gubernatorial nomination.Curtis helms Independent Texans, a group that has a Web site where visitors can “blow up” Perry’s head.In a March 3 Web post headlined “Where Do Indies Go Now That Rick Perry’s Party is Over,” Curtis writes: “Kay’s concession speech came with less than 20 percent of the precincts having been counted.” Curtis saw meaning in the timing of Hutchison’s speech, which was televised statewide from her campaign party in Dallas.“It was clear that regular Republicans, out of weakness in the face of the Medina insurgency, needed to circle the wagons,” Curtis writes. “It was a very fractious (primary campaign) fight. They were risking bedlam breaking out if they didn’t patch things up quickly.”We wondered if Curtis accurately characterized the timing of the concession and if Hutchison and Perry were in cahoots to kiss and make up.Perry's challengers combined for 49 percent of nearly 1.5 million votes cast. Hutchison got 30.3 percent and Medina won 18.6 percent, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s office. Perry drew 51 percent.Curtis told us she suspects the Hutchison and Perry camps had been in touch before the results were known and knew they needed to showcase unity as soon as possible. “This is what I would do if I was just trying to maintain the status quo,” Curtis said. “It’s not a conspiracy; it’s what they do, kind of a natural move.”First, did Curtis get her numbers right?She was close. Hutchison conceded about 9:30 p.m. March 2. At 9:18 p.m., the AP had posted results from the primary based on 1,868 of 8,236 precincts, or nearly 23 percent, reporting.It's not unheard of for candidates to give in before most votes are counted. In November 2006, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Chris Bell conceded before the night was through. However, Bell spoke after the AP had declared Perry the winner, shortly before 9 p.m. This year, the Associated Press declared Perry the victor of the GOP gubernatorial primary at 10:56 p.m., about 90 minutes after Hutchison conceded.Second, was Hutchison's timing part of a joint Hutchison-Perry ""unity"" strategy?Mark Miner, spokesman for Perry's campaign, said there was no coordination between the campaigns on primary night. ""That's just ridiculous,"" Miner said of Curtis's Web post. ""I'm sure she wrote it from a black helicopter."" Hutchison's campaign chairman, Jim Francis of Dallas, likewise disputed Curtis’s take on collaboration between the camps.“To drag it out past 10 o’clock at night was sort of an unfair thing to do to Perry,"" Francis said. ""It was clear what the situation was. Kay wanted to exit in a classy, dignified way. That’s what she decided. There wasn’t any strategy about it.”Besides, even if she'd squeaked into a runoff, Francis said, Hutchison had already decided to concede if she trailed Perry by 20 percentage points or so -- and she did. So how does Curtis rate on the Truth-O-Meter?Hutchison conceded after about 23 percent of precincts had reported -- not less than 20 percent as Curtis said, but close.Neither the Hutchison nor Perry campaign confirmed Curtis's hunch that they strategized to hurry the senator's concession--and there's no independent way to prove or disprove her speculation. Regardless, it isn't part of her statement.We rate Curtis's statement as Mostly True.

"['Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Health Care', 'Texas', 'Cathie Adams']","
Cathie Adams says Bill White supports ""ObamaCare socialized medicine plan"" and cap-and-trade
","We conclude our trifecta of Truth-O-Meter rulings on a February fund-raising letter sent by Texas GOP chair Cathie Adams. She levelled six charges against Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White including these pops: ""He supports the ‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan, as well as ‘Cap and Trade’ legislation that would kill thousands of Texas jobs."" Socialist? Job-killer? We decided to test the politically potent charges. (We deal with the rest of Adams' letter in separate Truth-O-Meter items.) On Adams’ claim that White supports the ""‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan,"" the Republican Party initially referred us to an August article in the El Paso Times. The story makes no reference to ""Obamacare"" or ""socialized medicine."" Instead it quotes White saying he backs President Barack Obama’s goals of allowing people to keep their current doctors and insurance plans and expanding the availability of health coverage while containing costs. The article also quotes White referring to his support for employers, employees and public-private partnerships to enable affordable basic health care. His campaign says White was among advocates who persuaded state lawmakers to permit ""3-share"" partnerships.

White also has called for expanding the enrollment of children in Medicaid, which serves the poor, and the federally supported Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves the working poor.

Surprisingly, considering White was a Senate candidate through much of last year, White's campaign says he has not voiced support for any particular health-care plan before Congress.

For Adams’ statement about White supporting a cap-and-trade approach to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the party pointed us to an article published in December's Texas Monthly magazine. Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available. Companies can then trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they're allowed.

The article doesn't reveal White’s position on the cap-and-trade idea. Rather, it quotes a press release from a Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman speculating about something White's campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, told the Austin American-Statesman in September: That White had advised Obama on energy topics. The GOP spokesman said: ""President Obama has proposed massive tax hikes on Texas energy companies and a cap-and-trade scheme that would raise energy prices on Texas families. Is this the result of the ‘advice’ Mayor White’s spokesperson referred to today? Texas voters deserve to know exactly which aspects of President Obama’s energy scheme White supports.""

Earlier, White told the American-Statesman he didn't consider the cap-and-trade plan narrowly approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in June ""an effective piece of legislation for accomplishing its goals at a reasonable consumer cost... I’ve shared some of those thoughts with senators, of how we could have an energy policy that’s sustainable and also affordable."" Last week, White said he's never endorsed a cap-and-trade proposal, preferring approaches that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by encouraging utilities to use more natural gas and renewable energy. ""The closer somebody comes to that approach, the more I support it,"" White said. White also has called for Texas to follow states including California, New York and Massachusetts in adopting state-level low-emission vehicle standards so that ""we help drive down the cost of more fuel-efficient, lower-emission vehicles for all people in our country. Texas is the biggest state not to have adopted these standards. And I think the auto makers will see the writing on the wall if we do so."" Any politico can appreciate why Republicans want to portray White as favoring ""socialized medicine"" and cap-and-trade legislation critics say would slam the state's economy. But in the absence of confirming facts, these sizzlers read like ridiculous smears. We rate Adams' statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809673A600>],/factchecks/2010/mar/14/cathie-adams/cathie-adams-who-chairs-texas-gop-says-bill-white-/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Cathie Adams']","
GOP Chair Cathie Adams says Bill White gave sanctuary to illegal immigrants as mayor of Houston
","Republicans had former Houston Mayor Bill White in their sights well before he won the Democratic nod for governor this month. In February, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party of Texas, distributed a fund-raising letter calling White an extreme liberal with the kind of record only a Chicago politician — like President Barack Obama — could admire. Her letter levels six charges. For this ruling , we're zeroing in on the one that gave us the biggest workout (and we address her other statements in separate Truth-O-Meter items.) Adams wrote: “Bill White ... offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants."" Who knew? We wanted to learn more. To back up Adams, the Republican Party pointed us to a report updated by the Congressional Research Service in 2006 that lists Houston among 32 localities -- Austin and Katy were the other two in Texas -- with sanctuary policies. White was about midway through his six years as mayor when the report came out. Broadly, the report states, so-called sanctuary cities “have their roots in the 1980s religious sanctuary movement by American churches. These churches provided sanctuary to thousands of unauthorized Central American migrants fleeing civil war in their homelands. Most cities that are considered sanctuary cities have adopted a ‘don’t ask-don’t tell’ policy where they don’t require their employees, including law enforcement officers, to report to federal officials aliens who may be illegally present in the country.” The report continues: “Localities, and in some cases individual police departments, in such areas that are considered ‘sanctuary cities,’ have utilized various mechanisms to ensure that unauthorized aliens who may be present in their jurisdiction illegally are not turned in to federal authorities.” The report doesn't state why each locality made the list. Houston's officialdom, including White and Police Chief Harold Hurtt, disputed the characterization, noting there's no city ordinance designating Houston a sanctuary. A 2007 U.S. Department of Justice report (brought to our attention by White's campaign) said its researchers found only two jurisdictions receiving at least $1 million a year in federal aid to incarcerate ""criminal aliens"" had official sanctuary policies posted online--California's city and county of San Francisco and the state of Oregon. Harris County, home to Houston, was getting more than $2 million in annual aid at the time; presumably, it was included in the DOJ review. In short, Houston has no official sanctuary policy. Still, such a city may have other policies that ""interfere or shield people from detection"" by U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which has done studies on the costs of illegal immigration. In fact, Houston police do not ask people what their immigration status is during routine patrols. ""We have limited resources"" and leave it to the federal government to enforce immigration laws, said HPD Assistant Chief Dan Perales. Houston is in Harris County, whose sheriff, Adrian Garcia, likewise defends the practice of not checking the immigration status of residents who aren't in jail. Garcia said: ""You don’t want to create a chill factor. You don’t want people to spend time wondering whether they're going to be asked about their immigration status versus (officers) getting information on the gang member who just shot somebody."" Other cities do the same. Austin Police Department policy states: ""Officers will not stop persons for the sole purpose of determining immigration status."" However, Harris County is in a federal program called 287(g) that authorizes local law officers to enforce immigration laws. When Houston police arrest people for crimes more serious than Class C misdemeanors, they are turned over to the county, which was an earlier adopter of the Department of Homeland Security's Secure Communities program. That program enables fingerprints of arrested individuals to be checked against federal crime and immigration databases. After the shooting of a Houston police officer by an illegal immigrant in March 2009, White asked the federal government to expedite the city’s entry into the 287(g) program, according to The Houston Chronicle. But White shifted course in October, saying that joining the Secure Communities program instead would entail no special agreement with the Department of Homeland Security nor cost as much, the newspaper reported. The Houston Police Department joined Secure Communities and started using the same databases in mid-December. Perales said they have helped the city identify possible illegal immigrants plus individuals wanted in other states for other reasons. The Houston Police Department joined the Secure Communities program and started using its databases in mid-December. Perales said the data has helped the city identify possible illegal immigrants plus individuals wanted in other states for other reasons. Vaughan said that because the county and city have stepped up efforts to identify illegal immigrants, she no longer views the city as much of a sanctuary. Vaughan said in a blog posted Friday, however, that from early March 2008 to Sept. 30, 2009, the Secure Communities program as employed by Harris County failed to identify nearly half the illegal immigrants snagged via the county's 287(g) participation. ""Why the difference?"" her blog states. ""Secure Communities can only flag those aliens whose (fingerprints) or identifying information is already in immigration databases."" She writes that the results gap ""represents underachievement on a large scale."" None of this proves Adams' claim that White ""offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants."" The Congressional Research Service did list Houston among localities with sanctuary policies. Yet the only overt action on White's watch was the decision, at the end of his six years in office, to join the Secure Communities program -- a federal initiative intended to make it harder, not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain in this country. Whether the White administration's approach helped make illegal immigrants feel at ease in Houston is another question -- and not the one Adams raised. We rate her sanctuary statement as False.

Cathie Adams, chair of Texas GOP, says Bill White spent Houston billions into debt as crime soared and he backed gun control
","
In a February fund-raising letter, the Texas GOP’s chairwoman, Cathie Adams, calls Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White an extreme liberal with the kind of record only a Chicago politician — like President Barack Obama — could admire. Her letter levels six charges against the former Houston mayor, too many for us to cover in a single PolitiFact Texas item so we've split them into three Truth-O-Meter rulings. 
For this one, we'll focus on the opening part of Adams' blast: ""Bill White spent his city billions of dollars into debt (and) saw crime rates soar while be backed gun control."" 
Goodness. That's enough to make one wonder how he thrice won election. 
Is her fusillade on target? 
Through an aide, Adams said she based her characterization of White spending the city of Houston billions of dollars in debt on an October memo distributed by a group whose leaders include Bob Lemer, a retired CPA. The memo states the city is broke as a result of overspending and the national recession, and raises the specter of imminent bankruptcy. 
The city's director of finance and its former director countered in November that the city is not broke and ""there is no potential for bankruptcy."" Assets exceed liabilities by $1.7 billion, they said, and the city's general fund balances increased from $136 million in 2004 to $332 million in 2008. 
But the city’s debt load did increase on White’s watch. According to the city, the outstanding debts for all municipal entities totaled $9.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2003, about when White began his first term. The total exceeded $12.8 billion by Dec. 31, 2009, toward the end of his third term. Over the years, debt went up $2.9 billion, or 29 percent. 
The subset of debt payable from property taxes — as opposed, say, to income from the airport or other city services — increased at a faster clip. That total was $2 billion as of the end of 2003 and reached $3.3 billion at the end of 2009 — a 65 percent increase while White was mayor. These include $625 million in bonds approved by voters in 2006. 
Two can play the debt blame game: White has said the state's debt load went up 100 percent on GOP Gov. Rick Perry's watch. We've rated that statement as True. 
What about crime? 
Earlier, we Texas rated as True a White statement about Houston’s crime rates dropping to the lowest levels in 25 years on his watch. The rate reached a 29-year low in 2008, though there was an uptick in violent crime in 2005, the year Hurricane Katrina sent thousands of people fleeing to the Houston area. 
Houston's total crime rate as calculated by the Texas Department of Public Safety fell through most of White's first five years as mayor; finalized figures for 2009, his last year in the office, aren't yet available. 
Houston had 7,054 criminal offenses per 100,000 residents in 2003, the year before White took office, according to the DPS. The rate increased to 7,186 offenses per 100,000 residents in 2004 before dropping through each of White's next four years as mayor, reaching 6,053 offenses per 100,000 residents in 2008. We also wrote: ""These days, few public officials can legitimately take credit for reducing crime locally"" because crime rates have been trending down all across the country for decades. 
The GOP told us that Adams’ claim of soaring crime rates reflects the Houston Police Department reclassification of several deaths as murders after Houston's KHOU-TV reported that nearly 30 violent deaths in 2005 and 2006 should have been listed as homicides. We found no mention of soaring crime in a Wall Street Journal recap of the series. The series is no longer posted on KHOU-TV's Web site and the station's news department declined to comment on the record. 
Next, the GOP pointed to several news articles in The Houston Chronicle. The most recent, published in August, also does not say crime rates were soaring. But it states that Houston had a higher rate of violent crime than any other Texas city, ranking 8th nationally with 1,105 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, based on the newspaper's analysis of FBI crime data in the 25 most populous U.S. cities. Violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, the newspaper said. 
To make its case for White backing gun control, the Republican Party said White is a member of a national group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which says it advocates stricter enforcement of gun laws to keep criminals from unlawfully acquiring handguns. 
White resigned from the group in late July after being a member since June 1, 2006, the group's spokesman, Jason Post, told us. We asked White why he had remained in the group through the years. White said he agreed with the group's position that authorities need to do better in ""tracking down people who steal guns and sell them to people who cannot legally buy guns."" 
White said he quit after his name was listed among many others in an ad funded by the group's political fund urging the U.S. Senate to vote down an amendment (to a Department of Defense measure) offered by South Dakota Sen. John Thune. The amendment, which did not pass, would require all states to recognize concealed-gun permits issued in other states. 
White said he supported Thune's amendment and doesn't support new restrictions on guns. 
Generally, the National Rifle Association gives White a ""B"" grade, meaning that the individual is a generally ""pro-gun candidate,"" the association says online, but may have opposed some pro-gun reform or supported some restrictive legislation in the past. 
NRA spokeswoman Alexa Fritts told us she wouldn't classify White as anti-gun, especially since he quit the mayors' group, which she called ""unfriendly"" on Second Amendment issues. The NRA and the group have tangled on tighter regulation of gun shows and making information on gun buyers more widely available. 
Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who faces White on the November ballot, has an NRA grade of ""A,"" Fritts said, because ""he has an incredible track record on Second Amendment issues."" 
So how does Adams' salvo shake out? 
She's right that White was mayor while the city's debt increased by billions. 
She misfires with her claim that crime rates soared under White. 
Her description of White favoring gun control is based entirely on his past membership in the mayors' group and is weakened by the NRA's generally favorable view of White. White himself says he favors no fresh gun restrictions. 
We rate Adams' three-part fusillade as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF3780>],/factchecks/2010/mar/14/cathie-adams/cathie-adams-chair-texas-gop-says-bill-white-spent/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Gretchen Carlson']","
Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson says the State Board of Education is considering eliminating Christmas and the Constitution from textbooks
","
After spending most of Wednesday gathering public comment, the Texas State Board of Education began hashing out how history, government and economics are taught in Texas public schools.

The board's efforts to revise social studies curriculum standards had drawn national attention, from the Fox News Channel in particular. On Wednesday morning's broadcast of ""Fox & Friends,"" co-anchor Gretchen Carlson sounded scandalized by what the network dubbed the ""Texas Textbook Wars.""

""Stage set for a bitter debate — the Texas Board of Education begins hearings today on proposed changes to textbooks that could change what students across the country learn,"" she said. ""About history!""

Addressing Jason Moore, a Texas parent who planned to speak at Wednesday's hearing, Carlson said: ""So, one of the proposed changes, Jason, is actually to start history class in the year 1877, which would be a big problem for a lot of people, would it not? And eliminate references to certain holidays, Founding Fathers, the Constitution! I mean, no surprise that Christmas, they want to get rid of that because they've been doing that for the last couple of years, but c'mon, the Constitution?""

Come again — we the people will not study the Constitution in school? Christmas nearly kaput? 
Moore corrected Carlson on one count — he said the board had made clear that it's not considering eliminating references to the Christian holiday. Carlson didn't acknowledge her goof.  
The Texas Education Agency, which oversees primary and secondary education, blasted Fox News for distorting the facts.

""The Fox Network in recent days has repeatedly broadcast highly inaccurate information about the State Board of Education’s efforts to adopt the new social studies curriculum standards,"" the agency said in a press release.

On Thursday, ""Fox & Friends"" co-anchor Steve Doocy backpedaled on his colleague's earlier statement. According to a Fox News transcript, Doocy said on the show: ""I just want to clarify some stuff, a couple of points. First of all, they were upset that what we said that what they are doing down in Texas is they are developing standards for new textbooks. Technically, what they are doing is they are developing curriculum standards that will set what is taught in classes, and then those standards will become part of a framework that textbooks are based on. We were just trying to make it simpler…

""Also,"" Doocy said, ""we talked about a suggestion that was made that history is, American history starts in the year 1877. That was a suggestion, made first of all, in North Carolina, and we thought we were pretty clear that these were just suggestions, and there have been a lot of suggestions, regarding the founding fathers, and some different dates that may or may not be included in the text . . . . We want to make sure you understand, they were just suggestions, and that is our clarification.""

So Fox admits it erred on what the Texas board is debating: curriculum standards, not textbook content.

Now, what about those Christmas and Constitution deletions Carlson bemoaned?

Let's start with the Christmas brouhaha, which broke out last summer. In standards under revision for sixth-grade world culture courses, the board's Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills review committee recommended replacing Christmas and Rosh Hashanah with the Buddhist and Hindu holiday Diwali as examples of significant religious holidays.

Here's the wording of the committee's proposed July revision with deletions in parentheses: ""Culture. The student understands the relationships among religion, philosophy, and culture. The student is expected to a) explain the relationship among religious ideas, philosophical ideas, and cultures; and b) explain the significance of religious holidays and observances such as (Christmas and) Easter, Ramadan, (and) Yom Kippur (and Rosh Hashanah) Diwali in (selected) various contemporary societies.""

Critics immediately called the proposed changes ""the war on Christmas."" When the board met in September, it made clear that those holidays would be put back in — and they were restored in the committee's October revision.

Upshot: The board isn't considering removing Christmas from the list of holiday examples.

What about starting the teaching of American history in 1877, leaving out the drafting of the Constitution in 1787 and decades of events after that?

Doocy said on ""Fox & Friends"" that Carlson was referring to suggestions in North Carolina. He didn't elaborate on why his colleague referred to the Tar Heel State while talking about Texas. We confirmed that while updating its curriculum standards, North Carolina's education board came under fire for a proposed change to spread its teaching of history over several grades so that high school juniors would only study U.S. history post-Reconstruction, after 1877. Currently in that state, U.S history after 1789 is taught in high school.

Texas has long spread its teaching of history over several grades. The Texas Education Agency said: ""Texas has and always will teach U.S. History from the beginning until present day. U.S. History through Reconstruction is taught in eighth grade... U.S. history since 1877 is taught in 11th grade.""

We found eight references to the Constitution in the proposed revisions to the high school standard, and more than 20 in both the draft middle school and elementary school standards. 

Nothing is final yet — the board is expected to give final approval to the standards in May. 
So let's review. 
First, the board is hammering out changes to state curriculum standards, not textbooks. Second, the board is not considering removing Christmas from a list of various religious holidays. And third, the board has never considered removing the Constitution from history textbooks or the state's curriculum.

The ""Fox & Friends"" anchor made things simple and irresponsibly far-fetched and wrong. We rate Carlson's ridiculous statement as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C40A580>],/factchecks/2010/mar/12/gretchen-carlson/gretchen-carlson-says-state-board-education-consid/

Rubio says Obama administration spent more on Cash for Clunkers than space program
","NASA's budget has been a hot topic among Florida politicians since the Obama administration's recent announcement that it plans to kill the NASA Constellation program, which sought to put astronauts back on the moon.Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio jumped on the bandwagon and spoke against Obama's plan during a meeting of the Brevard County Republican Club in February, according to an article in Florida Today on Feb. 8, 2010:The article said that Rubio ""criticized the Obama administration for discontinuing manned space flight in favor of more innovative technological advances, ignoring that Obama also proposed an increase in NASA's budget over the next several years."" Rubio was quoted saying, ""They spent more money on the Cash for Clunkers program than the space program."" That article and another one in Politico that used the same quote, had some context before Rubio's quote about the proposed cuts in the Constellation program. The Florida Today article mentioned Obama's plan to discontinue manned space flight. Politico quoted Rubio's primary opponent, Gov. Charlie Crist, stating: ""Unless we continue the Constellation Program that allows America to be a leader in space innovation and provides jobs for many Floridians on the Space Coast, this discussion will leave many of the same problems unresolved."" Both articles also noted that overall, Obama proposed an increase in NASA funding.When we asked Rubio's campaign about the quote, spokesman Alberto Martinez told us that Rubio was referring to the Constellation program -- not NASA's overall budget.""Marco has used that line several times, and what he is specifically referring to is President Obama's decision to scrap the Constellation Program,"" Martinez wrote to us in an e-mail.Before we wade into the question of whether Rubio's context was clear, here's how the numbers compare:* Cash for Clunkers was a $3 billion program, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.* NASA's overall budget this year is $18.7 billion, proposed to rise to $19 billion next year. * NASA's Exploration program, which includes the Constellation initiative, was about $3.8 billion this year. The cost would be $2.5 billion to phase out the Constellation program over two years and then it would drop to zero.So Rubio would be right if the comparison is Constellation ($3 billion for Cash for Clunkers versus $2.5 billion to phase the Constellation effort), but he'd be wrong if it's the NASA space program overall (the $3 billion for Clunkers versus roughly $19 billion for NASA). Now, to the question of Rubio's context. Martinez told us he was referring specifically to Constellation. ""The point Marco was making is that this president has shown he is willing to spend more money in programs like 'Cash for Clunkers' than he is willing to spend on pursuing the next phase of a planned manned-space flight program. Marco made his remarks before an audience on the Space Coast which is informed about this issue. They know the only manned space flight program was the Constellation Program."" That made us wonder what the audience thought, so we called two Republicans who attended the meeting and asked them what they believed he was referring to. But neither specifically recalled the statement.So to recap: Rubio would be correct if indeed he was suggesting that the U.S. spent more on Cash for Clunkers -- $3 billion -- than the Obama administration would spend on Constellation. But by referring to it as the ""space program,"" his comment was so vague that it sounds more like he's referring to the entire NASA budget. And the Florida Today article helps to back that up by noting that he ignored the fact that Obama was proposing an increase in NASA's overall spending.The Rubio campaign says his context was clear to the audience, but we think his wording most likely is interpreted to mean the entire NASA budget. So we find the claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A2940>],/factchecks/2010/mar/12/marco-rubio/rubio-criticizes-space-budget/

Rubio attacks Crist for taxpayer-funded 'junket' to Europe
","Gov. Charlie Crist is attempting to cast Marco Rubio as earmark-hungry and a lavish spender, dubbing him ""Porkus Rubio.""The Rubio campaign responds with a claim that Crist is no ""Frugal"" Charlie himself. Rubio's evidence: a 12-day trade mission Crist took to London, Paris, St. Petersburg, Russia, and Madrid in the summer of 2008. The tab for taxpayers: more than $430,000.""Crist’s 2008 European junket ... came complete with a two-dozen person entourage, an official photographer to chronicle the governor at 'work,' a $2,100 a night luxury suite in London, $1,300 in room service and mini bar charges for Crist alone, and first class airfare at $8,000 per ticket,"" the Rubio campaign declared in a March 4, 2010, press release titled "" 'Frugal' Charlie Crist's $430K European Junket on Taxpayers' Dime.""""Charlie Crist might be frugal when it comes to his own money, but he loves spending taxpayer money on a failed stimulus, on $2 billion worth of tax hikes, and on a luxurious lifestyle for himself and his buddies,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said in the release. ""Floridians are not going to take lectures on frugality from a guy who embraced the largest spending bill in American history, stays in $2,000 a night luxury hotel suites where he racks up $1,300 in mini-bar charges, and doesn't pay for a dime of it himself.""We've already dealt with Crist's position on the federal stimulus (he supported it), as well as the claim about $2 billion in tax hikes and fees (they passed the Legislature in 2009). In this item, we'll explore Rubio's claims about Crist's trip to Europe.The Europe trip was billed as a way to expand trading relationships with key economic partners around the globe. It was arranged by Enterprise Florida, a public/private agency created to drum up support for Florida's businesses and attract new investment into the state.Florida's delegation totaled more than 90 people, including Crist and his then-fiancee Carole Rome. Taxpayers picked up the bill for more than two dozen state employees, including a photographer and nine bodyguards. A group of 65 business executives also came along, paying their own way. The business executives also pitched in to cover Crist's expenses. The 12-day itinerary included meaty events, such as meetings with business executives at Lockheed Martin and Nothrop Grumman and a speaking engagement at a climate change forum, but also sightseeing and photo-ops. The governor posed for pictures with Prince Charles and visited soldiers' graves in Normandy, France.Crist, who was then being discussed as a possible running mate for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, also conducted several interviews with the European press.To best examine the specifics of Rubio's claim, we turned to our colleagues at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Megan O'Matz was the first reporter to detail the cost of the Europe trip in a December 2008 article. Her work was the basis for Rubio's claim, and led to coverage of the trip across the state.O'Matz provided PolitiFact Florida with a previously unpublished Enterprise Florida document detailing Crist's expenses. The document shows that Crist had hotel rooms for a total of 11 nights (Enterprise Florida booked a suite for Crist the night before the delegation arrived in Europe so Crist could enter the hotel upon arriving from the overnight flight).The charges for Crist's accommodations break down this way: That's a total of $17,638.43 for 11 nights, or about $1,600 a night (short of what Rubio claims). The London hotel was the most expensive, at about $2,180 a night, according to the report.Crist's suite in Paris overlooked the Tuileries garden and came with a view of the Eiffel Tower. The Westin Palace in Madrid, where Crist spent two nights, was commissioned by Spain's King Alfonso XIII in 1912.The other part of Rubio's claim related to mini-bar charges. The Enterprise Florida document details those as well. Kind of.Crist amassed a total of $1,356.29 in ""food and beverage"" charges for the trip. But that's not limited to mini-bar charges. Stuart Doyle, a spokesperson for Enterprise Florida, said the food and beverage charges account for food and drinks provided for business meetings held in the governor's room. They weren't just mini-bar charges. And they weren't only for Crist -- they covered anyone who came to his rooms for meetings. It's important to note that all of the specific charges we just discussed were paid with private dollars, not tax dollars. But taxpayers still ended up on the hook for more than $430,000 to cover the expenses of Crist's government entourage, significantly more than originally estimated. The news prompted a rash of angry newspaper editorials and a call from the Florida Democratic Party for Crist to reimburse the state.Crist defended the trip.""I think it's important to promote free trade,"" Crist said. ""You want to have it be as economical as you can, and when you consider that it should produce hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in Florida, I think it's important to do.""Crist officials also noted that former Gov. Jeb Bush used tax dollars to cover his costs on similar trade missions.Let's look at the Rubio campaign quote again.Crist ""stays in $2,000 a night luxury hotel suites where he racks up $1,300 in mini-bar charges, and doesn’t pay for a dime of it himself.""We can break the statement down into three pieces.The hotel. While in London in 2008, Crist spent four nights in a hotel suite that cost more than $2,000 a night. The rest of the trip, he stayed in rooms, that while still pricey, cost about half as much. For the entire trip, the average was $1,600.The mini-bar. By using that term, Rubio suggests that Crist alone went on a costly binge using the fridge in his suite. But that's quite misleading. Yes, Crist's food and beverage charges for the trip totaled $1,356.29. But it wasn't just the mini-bar and the charges weren't just for Crist.Who paid? Crist didn't pay for the trip out of his own pocket. But taxpayers didn't pay, either. Private business executives picked up Crist's bill.This is a case where Rubio is mixing and matching facts in order to paint Crist in the worst possible light. The campaign rightly details in its release that taxpayers didn't pay for Crist's overseas travel, but then in a quote and headline suggests that taxpayers may have footed the bill. (The campaign featured a headline from the Orlando Sentinel that read: ""Crist enjoyed pricey perks on business trip to Europe thanks to taxpayers""). The claim about the hotel, while accurate, focuses on one leg of the Europe trip and not the trip overall.And while the campaign broadly describes the $1,300 in food and beverage charges in the press release, Rubio then truncates the wording in the quote to connote a different and worse meaning. It also suggests Crist ran up the $1,300 bill alone, which is not true. Rubio may be successful in making his broader point -- that Crist's trip to Europe was hardly frugal -- but he could have accomplished that by sticking closer to the facts. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C10600>],/factchecks/2010/mar/12/marco-rubio/rubio-attacks-crist-taxpayer-funded-junket-europe/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Jim DeMint']","
Sen. Jim DeMint says Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks
","No sooner had Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations panel, announced a plan to ban earmarks to for-profit companies than Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., sent out a blast of one-upmanship via Twitter. ""House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks,"" DeMint wrote. ""That's a fig leaf, not real reform."" While Congress has steadily moved toward tighter earmark restrictions over the last several years, the issue has taken on renewed steam in light of the massive budget deficit and several high-profile ethics investigations. On Feb. 26, the House ethics committee absolved seven members of the defense spending panel accused of awarding earmarks to companies whose executives and lobbyists donated to their campaigns. Although they were cleared, the ethics committee said it was evident there was at least a perception among corporate donors that political donations have an impact on a legislator's decision to author an earmark for that company. It was just that kind of conflict that Rep. Obey said he was trying to eliminate when on March 10, 2010, he initiated a ban on budget earmarks to private, for-profit companies. The move -- one of several earmark reforms Obey instituted for the House -- was hailed by several government watchdog groups as a meaningful step for earmark reform. ""For-profit company earmarks are ground zero for pay-to-play,"" said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. But what about DeMint's Twitter claim that Obey's ""partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks."" By Obey's calculation (or more accurately, the research of his House Appropriation Committee staff) the ban on earmarks to for-profit companies would have eliminated about 1,000 earmarks this year, which came to a total of about $1.7 billion. Taxpayers for Common Sense, which looked not only at the roughly 9,000 disclosed earmarks this fiscal year but also pored through the budget and came up with several hundred more projects it deemed to be earmarks, put the total number of earmarks at 9,499, totaling $15.9 billion. That puts the number of earmarks not going to for-profits awfully close to DeMint's 90 percent. Democrats don't really take issue with that statistic. It's what citing that figure implies, as well as the follow-up comment that Obey's ban of earmarks to for-profits is ""a fig leaf, not real reform."" ''The political reality right now is that the public has lost some confidence in this institution, and one of the reasons is the past abuses of the earmark process,'' Obey told the New York Times. Earmarks for profit-making companies are ''the most vulnerable place'' for abuse in the system, he said. ""It's a step forward,"" Ellis said. ""It's not the answer, the be-all-end-all. But I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. It's  real. We've been making progress on earmarks for several years now. And I'm fine with that. I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good."" The day after Obey announced the changes, House Republicans went one step further, saying their members would renounce all earmarks for the rest of the year. In the Senate, however, banning any earmarks has much less traction. Senate Appropriations panel chair Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, Obey's Senate counterpart and a staunch defender of earmarks, called Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits ""quizzical."" ""Many, if not most, for-profit and nonprofit entities lobby for themselves or employ lobbyists,"" Inouye told AP. ""That is how most of them make the Congress aware of their products and services. It is no secret that many of these individuals make political contributions. All lobbyists file disclosure reports. These contributions are all fully disclosed and available for all to see on the Internet."" Inouye told the New York Times that the partial ban amounted to Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch, that current earmark restrictions were already working and that ''it does not make sense to discriminate against for-profit organizations'' by banning earmarks to them. A difference in earmark policy between the two chambers would certainly make for some interesting drama when the House and Senate begin to reconcile spending bills later this year. But DeMint, a self-described ""recovering earmarker,"" would like to nip this issue in the bud now. DeMint vowed to force a Senate vote on a proposal he introduced earlier this year -- along with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and 15 Republican co-sponsors -- that would put a one-year moratorium on all earmarks. In the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, DeMint floated a similar moratorium proposal. The bill was co-sponsored by then-presidential front-runners John McCain as well as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but it failed by a vote of 71-29. ""The Senate will have the opportunity this week to stand with Americans and put a stop to this wasteful spending,"" DeMint said. ""Our nation is drowning in debt that will be paid by our children and we’ll never stop Washington’s spending addiction unless members of both parties take bold action. We need to focus on balancing the budget, not pork barrel spending that has wasted money on bridges to nowhere, teapot museums and monuments to politicians."" Obey told the New York Times that banning all earmarks would make Congress ''a rubber stamp'' of the executive branch. ''Where I come from, the Congress has a perfect right, in fact an obligation, to participate in the budget process, but we've got to try to do it in a way that protects the integrity of the system,'' he said. ''This strikes a reasonable balance.'' Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said a one-year moratorium is great, ""but to what end?"" A moratorium puts off the issue for a year, he said, but Congress still needs a long-term fix to its spending protocol. Some of the projects financed by earmarks are worthy of federal dollars, Ellis said. The problem, he said, is that earmarks are based more on the political muscle of their sponsors than project merit. We think DeMint is a little too dismissive when he calls Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits a ""fig leaf."" As the recent ethics report found, private companies certainly believe their contributions win them earmarks. And it's naive to think they don't. So at the very least, Obey's plan addresses some of the worst abuses of the earmark process head-on. But the fact we're checking here is whether eliminating those for-profit earmarks would leave 90 percent of earmarks untouched. It would. There are differences of opinion on both sides of the aisle about whether that's necessarily a bad thing. But DeMint's math is accurate. And we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2BCC00>],/factchecks/2010/mar/12/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-obeys-partial-earmark-ban-woul/
"['National', 'Health Care', ""America's Health Insurance Plans""]","
Health insurers get a small percentage of overall health care spending
","As the battle over health care reform approaches a climax, America's Health Insurance Plans -- the trade group for the private health insurance industry -- began airing a new ad highlighting statistics on what actually goes into the nation's health care spending.Here's the full text of AHIP's ad:""What's inside the health care cost pie? Some in Washington say it's all health insurance. But health care insurance is one of the smallest slices. Health insurance companies' costs are only 4 percent of all health care spending. Doctors, hospitals, medicines and tests are the biggest slices, and a government report says their rising prices are the primary driver of higher health care costs. If Washington wants to make health care more affordable, they need to look at the whole health care pie, not just a slice.""This ad touches on a bunch of controversial and complex issues in just 30 seconds. But for our fact-check, we'll focus on a narrow question: Is AHIP correct when it says that ""health insurance companies' costs amount to only 4 percent of all health care spending""?We looked at data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Every year, CMS's Office of the Actuary produces statistics on ""national health expenditures"" and the items that make up those purchases. That's the source that AHIP cited in the ad, and one that's considered credible by independent experts.The full breakdown for 2008 is posted on the CMS Web site. We'll recap the data here.In 2008, total national health expenditures in the United States -- the combination of money spent by consumers out of pocket, by private insurers and by local, state and federal governments -- exceeded $2.3 trillion. Of that, $92 billion went for the cost of private health insurance. ""Cost"" in this case refers to overhead and profits -- not to any of the dollars that are funneled through insurers' accounts on behalf of their patients. It also excludes any overhead by government-run insurers such as CMS itself, which signs the checks for Medicare and Medicaid.If you divide private insurance costs by total expenditures, it works out to 3.9 percent -- almost exactly what AHIP said. For comparison's sake, hospitals accounted for 30.7 percent of spending, professional services (including doctors, nurses, dentists and other clinical services) accounted for 31.3 percent, and retail sales of drugs and other medical products accounted for 12.8 percent.To see whether the figures for 2009 changed the equation much, we checked in with John A. Poisal, deputy director of national health statistics in the CMS actuary's office. He said the updated but not-yet-posted numbers were nearly $2.5 trillion in total expenditures and $90.2 billion in insurance costs. That works out to 3.6 percent. Rounded up, that's once again as AHIP portrayed it.Next, we scrutinized the total health expenditure figure. In addition to including such factors as doctors, hospitals and medicines, this amount includes dollars spent on nursing homes and home health care; governmental public health activities; medical research; and medical-related construction projects. Since these items are somewhat extraneous to the costs that AHIP is discussing in its ad, we decided to run the numbers without these factors included.For 2008, insurance costs divided by health expenditures other than those removed above amounted to 4.8 percent. Even when rounded up, 5 percent is close to the 4 percent AHIP cited, and it's a percentage far below what hospitals, doctors and pharmaceuticals claimed.For 2009, the numbers are much the same, working out to 4.5 percent.We weighed whether it made any sense to divide private insurance costs by total private health insurance expenditures -- a number that excludes all expenses paid by the government, by consumers out of their own pockets, and by other private sources, such as foundations. When you make that calculation, the answer is 11.7 percent for 2008 and 11.1 percent in 2009 -- almost three times as high as AHIP's cited rate.Ultimately, though, we concluded that AHIP's numbers more accurately reflect the question it poses. When you're asking what health expenditures could conceivably be trimmed for cost-control purposes, there's no reason to exempt Medicare, Medicaid and other non-private expenditures from consideration. Even if it's correct, not everyone in the health policy arena believes that AHIP's calculation is relevant. Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said ""what we should be looking at is the insurer return to capital. ... They make a lot of money relative to what they invest, and they do almost nothing for that money to hold down the growth in health care spending.""Meanwhile, some critics suggest that when AHIP points the finger at doctors and hospitals for health care cost inflation, it ignores its own role. Insurers, after all, sign the checks and could presumably use greater leverage to keep costs down. However, our conclusion here doesn't argue one way or another on the question of whether private health insurance could be run more efficiently, whether private insurers should take on a bigger or a smaller role in the health care system, or whether more money should be spent for, say, doctors instead of insurance costs. We are merely checking whether AHIP provided accurate figures to answer the question it raised. And as far as we can tell, the group did. So we rate the claim in AHIP's ad True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973B8A40>],/factchecks/2010/mar/12/americas-health-insurance-plans/health-insurers-get-small-percentage-overall-healt/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Dianne Feinstein']","
Feinstein says U.S. is only nation to rely heavily on for-profit insurers for basic health care
","In February, amid the heated debate over health care reform, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation to bar insurance companies from implementing ""unfair"" hikes in health plan premiums. In a March 8, 2010, New York Times story, Feinstein explained why she cares so much about the issue.

""We are the only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care,"" Feinstein said. ""I believe, fundamentally, that all medical insurance should be not-for-profit.""

We thought it would be worthwhile checking if Feinstein was right that no other nation ""relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care.""

As it turns out, some other countries do have private, for-profit insurance companies operating in their health care sector, and there are some indications that this sector is growing. But the business, legal and regulatory environment in which they operate is quite different than it is in the United States.

A good example is the Netherlands. Dutch plans may be either non-profit or for-profit, as in the U.S. But children are fully covered using public funds, and premiums for adults are set at 50 percent of the expected costs, with the remainder paid through a national ""risk equalization fund"" -- essentially funds collected from the public at large.

As a result, health insurers in the Netherlands aren't really able to compete for adult customers on price. By law, insurers must accept and renew all applicants, and a basic package of services must be offered.

By contrast, U.S. insurers are free (for now, at least) to reject applicants on the individual market if they have pre-existing conditions, and insurers offer a panoply of plans with different premium levels and benefit packages.

So, in the Netherlands, even the for-profit insurers don't typically make much of a profit on their basic health care lines. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, any profit that insurers make on basic services must be plowed back into reducing premiums.

So why even call these companies for-profit? In many of the European countries with a for-profit health insurance sector, the companies make their profits not on basic health care -- the kind that Feinstein specifically referred to -- but by up-selling their health care customers on supplemental health coverage, such as dental care, eyeglasses, cosmetic surgery or more luxurious hospital rooms, or other product lines altogether, such as life or homeowner's insurance.

""There's no developed country where insurers can make a profit on basic coverage,"" said T.R. Reid, the author of The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care. ""Their mission is to pay for health care, not to pay investors.""

Maggie Mahar, a fellow who specializes in international health care policy at the Century Foundation, agrees. ""I usually say that the U.S. is the only country in the developed world that has chosen to turn health care into largely unregulated, for-profit enterprise,"" she said.

Technically, for-profit companies do provide basic medical care in countries such as the Netherlands, and there's enough of it going on to say that such countries ""rely"" on those insurers to serve that need. But the profit these companies make -- or at least the vast majority of it -- is made from lines of business other than basic health care.

Because there is no official definition of ""basic health care"" in the U.S. system, it is hard to calculate exactly how much profit American insurers are making off basic services. But whatever it is, most experts expect that it is higher than the margins being made on basic health care by for-profit insurers in other countries. We believe that Feinstein is right that the U.S. for-profit insurance industry's role in basic health care is fundamentally different than what goes on in other countries, and that this outweighs her technical error in saying that no other country relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care. So we rate Feinstein's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978B4380>],/factchecks/2010/mar/11/dianne-feinstein/feinstein-says-us-only-nation-rely-heavily-profit-/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Americans United for Change']","
Americans United for Change says health insurance premiums for individuals and small businesses will increase up to 39 percent without health care reform
","
Seeking support for health care reform, the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change launched a phone campaign March 3 urging Americans to stand up to health insurance companies.

The Washington-based group was formed in 2005 to challenge President George W. Bush’s efforts to privatize Social Security and has since broadened its scope to build public and congressional support for a variety of policy initiatives, including health care.

Austin American-Statesman reporter Mary Ann Roser, who analyzed the call on her health blog, was one of 3.5 million voters nationwide who heard the recorded message: ""I am calling from Americans United for Change. You’ve seen the news. Individuals and small businesses will be hit by increases in health insurance premiums as high as 39 percent. Insurance companies deny our claims, drop us when we’re sick and pay their CEOs huge bonuses. Now they want a 39 percent increase . . . Enough of this greed. It’s time to stand up to health insurance companies. Pass health care reform. Call Congress at 202-225-3121.""

We looked at whether premiums are increasing nearly 40 percent for individuals and small businesses — and whether the robocall's ominous warning is warranted.

The group's communications director, Jeremy Funk, pointed us to a report by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services admonishing Anthem Blue Cross, the California affiliate of insurer WellPoint Inc, for plans to raise its premiums. Earlier, Anthem notified about 800,000 customers who buy individual insurance policies that their premiums would go up as much as 39 percent on March 1.

At the request of the California Department of Insurance, WellPoint postponed the premium hikes until May 1 to allow the department additional time for review. WellPoint said: ""Our decision to agree to postpone the rate adjustment does not change the underlying issue. All health plans are in the same situation in trying to deal with the steadily increasing medical costs in the delivery system, which are not sustainable.""

The HHS report cites companies that requested permission to raise health insurance premiums in five states last year, proposing increases of 16 percent to 56 percent.

They didn't necessarily succeed. Anthem of Maine requested an 18.5 percent increase; that state allowed 10.9 percent. In Michigan, Blue Cross Blue Shield raised rates 22 percent after requesting premium increases of 56 percent for some policyholders. And this year, insurers in Massachusetts asked for premium hikes of 8 to 32 percent.

Most states regulate what companies charge their residents for health insurance. But in Texas, the majority of life, accident and health insurance rate hikes are never filed with the Texas Department of Insurance, according to the Texas Sunset Commission. Except for Medicare supplemental insurance, no prior state approval is needed to increase health insurance premiums.

However, health insurers are required to file rate increases that affect people who buy their own health insurance — about 4 percent of all Texans — but the filing is mostly for informational, not regulatory purposes. Most everyone else is either uninsured or covered by Medicaid, Medicare or employer-provided health insurance, none of which the state regulates.

State law holds that insurance rates in Texas must be just, fair, reasonable, adequate, not confiscatory, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory. The department can contest rates for individual plans that don't comply, according to John Greeley, a public information officer at the department. So far it hasn't.

So how do Texas rates stack up for individuals and small businesses, per the focus of Americans for United Change's claim?

Katrina Daniel, senior associate commissioner at the state insurance department, said Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas filed 60 rate increases for individual policyholders from January to October 2009 ranging from 3 percent to 25 percent. UniCare filed increases up to 11 percent.

Since the state doesn't regulate employer-sponsored insurance, we went looking for some specific examples. Tom Banning, CEO of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, said Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas raised premiums 21 percent to provide coverage for the organization's 12-member staff. And Lydia Hegl, vice president at insurance brokerage firm Texas Benefit Solutions, said she's seen premium hikes from 10 to 30 percent for small groups, meaning companies with less than 50 employees.

On the Texas Association of Health Underwriters Cafe, an e-mail forum that ""allows agents, brokers and carrier to discuss topics ranging from, ""How do I...?"", to legislative issues that affect the future of health care,"" we found people discussing premium increases from 15 to 58 percent.

Michael Lee, an agent at MLee Insurance, writes: ""Every (customer) renewal I have had this year through April are running 30 percent to 40 percent. Even groups that are young healthy males. Am I just getting this preferred treatment or is anyone else seeing this?""

From that testimony, it looks like at least some Texans will be paying higher premiums, comparable to the 39 percent increase cited by Americans for United Change.

But what about the implicit message of the organization's robocall: That the health care changes sought by President Obama will prevent such rate hikes?

On Nov. 30, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress that analyzes legislation, estimated that under the Senate's version of the health reform plan, most people's premiums will stay the same or decrease slightly by 2016 — especially for the 46 percent of Texans who are insured through their work. Most people who buy their own insurance would be eligible for federal subsidies that would make their premiums drop by more than half. A smaller percentage of the self-insured would see their rates increase 10 to 13 percent, but they would be getting better coverage.

And Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy, said: ""In President Obama’s recent health care proposal, he notably improves on the affordability of the Senate health care bill, both in terms of premiums and out-of-pocket costs.""

The Urban Institute, another nonpartisan research group, projects that if federal reform efforts fail, individual and family out-of-pocket costs could go up nationwide by more than 35 percent through 2019. In Texas, the institute says, individual and family spending would increase even more — about 58 percent in a best-case scenario, and 80 percent worst-case.

Summing up: Unless the state of California deems Anthem's rate hikes unjustified, thousands of individual policyholders will face premium increases as high as 39 percent. Folks in other states — including Texas — also are experiencing hikes in the double-digits.

Meantime, the CBO projects that most Americans' premiums would decrease under the Senate's health care plan. A tiny minority of individuals who buy their own insurance would pay 10 to 13 percent more, while receiving better coverage.

Of course, all these numbers are just projections and the outcome of the debate over health care reform is uncertain. But given what's known at this point, United Americans for Change's robocall message rings Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2A4780>],/factchecks/2010/mar/11/americans-united-change/americans-united-change-says-health-insurance-prem/

Obama's pay increase for the military based on formula
","Here at PolitiFact, we're huge fans of social media. So when readers requested we check a claim that had gone viral over Facebook, we jumped at the chance.Here's what they sent us:""Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011. This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973! Nice to know that during a time of rampant inflation, while war is fought in 2 theatres, our men and women in uniform get A LOWER PAY INCREASE THAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS!!! Please repost if you support our troops""This is a first for us; the claim is part status update, part chain e-mail. To check this claim, it's important to understand how the government typically treats military pay raises. By law, the administration is required to propose pay increases that match increases in the Employment Cost Index, a quarterly economic report that details changes in the costs of labor for businesses. Military pay is tied to this measure to ensure that pay keeps up with salaries in the private sector. Now, while the administration is required to match the ECI, the law does give the president some discretion. In national emergencies or ""serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare"" the president can propose an alternative pay adjustment up or down. In fact, the last president to use this authority was Bill Clinton, who actually proposed no pay increase for the military in 1994, according to Colonel Michael Hayden, deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. But Congress ultimately approved a 2.2 percent increase.Obama recently released his budget for 2011, and it included a 1.4 percent pay raise for military personnel, which, again, is in line with the ECI. Clearly, that's lower than the 2.9 percent increase Obama requested last year. But that's because wages and salaries in the private sector only increased 1.4 percent during 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the data. It's the smallest percentage change since the BLS started collecting such data in 1975. So, it's true that Obama has proposed a 1.4 percent pay increase for the military in 2011. By law, it's what he was required to propose. In fact, because the pay raises come out of the Department of Defense budget, it has asked Congress not to exceed the 1.4 percent pay raise, because the department needs those funds for other programs, including $50 billion to fully fund the Defense Health Program and sustain benefits for about 9.5 million beneficiaries, $2.2 billion for the care of wounded soldiers, and a $500 million increase in funding for family support programs, according to the Department of Defense.But the smallest since 1973, as the Facebook message suggests? It seems that number came from news reports that, if approved, the pay increase would be the smallest since the military became an all-volunteer force in 1973 and military pay rates were overhauled to match private sector pay for civilian workers with similar skills, education and experience. So, setting 1973 as the benchmark sets up a reasonable comparison. But Hayden also sent us the a copy of page 51 of the Fifth Edition of the the Military Compensation Background Papers, which includes data going as far back as 1945. According to that document, military personnel got no pay increase in 1962, making Obama's proposal the smallest since then. The last part of the claim -- that the military pay increase is lower than what welfare recipients are getting this year -- was nearly impossible to sort out. That's because the term ""welfare"" refers to an array of programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, the Child Nutrition Program and food stamps. Many of these programs are administered by the states. For example, with TANF the federal government gives block grants to states, which use these funds to operate low-income benefits. That funding has not increased since 1996, according to Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.It's worth noting that the food stamp program got a funding boost in the stimulus bill; the legislation allocated $295 million to states to administer the program and a $19.9 billion temporary benefits increase for recipients. But Congress doesn't approve an annual ""pay increase"" for welfare recipients as it does for the military. So, there's really no comparison.So, this viral Facebook update is correct that Obama proposed a 1.4 percent pay increase for military personnel in 2011. Depending on the time frame, it's the smallest since 1973 or 1962. But there are some big inaccuracies about this claim as well. First and foremost, there's really no such thing as a pay increase for welfare recipients, so it's impossible to compare military pay to support for low-income communities. Furthermore, the claim leaves out important details about why Obama chose a 1.4 percent pay increase; in short, he's required to by law. And while Congress can approve a larger number -- and under extenuating circumstances, the president can propose an alternative pay raise -- the administration is discouraging Congress from doing so in order to keep other military programs, such as health care, well funded.

Rubio says GOP credit card paid with 'my money'
","The story about Marco Rubio's Republican Party of Florida American Express card has devolved into a game of soundbite one-upsmanship.

Questions about whether Rubio charged personal expenses on the GOP's corporate card have produced dueling remarks from the campaigns of Rubio and his primary opponent, Gov. Charlie Crist. Many have centered on whether party money was used for repairs to Rubio's family minivan and the $133.75 Rubio charged on the GOP credit card at a Miami barber shop.

We decided it was time to put some of the claims to our Truth-O-Meter.

Rubio appeared March 4, 2010 on Fox News with Neil Cavuto to talk about the U.S. Senate primary. Of course, his credit card bills came up.

Cavuto told Rubio that Crist has suggested that the charges indicate Rubio isn't the fiscal conservative he has claimed to be. Rubio, in response, brushed the tactic off as a silly act of desperation. Cavuto pressed further.

""Well, I guess, others were saying, they're not so silly when you champion a cause that you're going to cut abusive and wasteful spending when they say that you charged grocery bills or repairs of your family minivan, purchases at a wine store, you know where this is going?"" Cavuto asked Rubio.

""Yes, but here's what they don't tell you, it's my money,"" Rubio said. ""It's a card that was secured under my credit and I made payments out of my own pockets directly to American Express. It's ridiculous. It's not true and it is being put in the worst possible way to divert attention from the central issues of this campaign.""

The issue here is whether Rubio is correct to assert to a national audience that charges on the GOP card were his money.

The answer is, it's complicated.

What we know

Rubio was among a group of at least a half-dozen Florida lawmakers given GOP credit cards in recent years, allowing them to use party money for certain expenses. The card was intended for party business, ""primarily those associated with fundraising, candidate recruitment and other activities related to electing Republicans,"" according to party spokeswoman Katie Betta.

Using the card for personal expenses was not explicitly prohibited, but personal expenses ""were expected to be paid through a reimbursement, or in some cases directly to American Express,"" Betta said. There was no written policy on the use of the cards, Betta said.

Rubio, who had the card while he was a member of the state House leadership, used the GOP American Express to pay for both personal and party-related matters. A majority of the party-business charges are related to travel -- airfare, hotel, rental cars. Some other ""party"" charges, according to a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times analysis, include:
  Rubio and his campaign say all of the purchases paid for by the party were approved business expenses. Rubio, who also could bill the state for some travel expenses, explained his policy for dealing with the charges in a written response to the Herald and Times, the newspapers that broke the original story.

""When it came to incurring expenses, I erred on the side of caution and maintained two operating principles: If it was debatable as to whether the expense was state or Party related, I tried to err on the side of saving taxpayer money by charging that expense to the Party,"" Rubio wrote. ""If it was a question between Party expenses or personal expenses, I would err on the side of protecting Party money by paying personally for those charges.

""Whenever I incurred a personal expense, I paid American Express directly,"" Rubio added. ""I was as diligent as possible to ensure the Party did not pay for items that were unrelated to Party business."" Rubio says he sent about $16,000 to American Express to cover personal expenses, but those payments were not made monthly. Rubio made no payments during one six-month stretch in 2007. The Herald/Times story also detailed purchases that the newspapers could not determine whether they were political or personal. Rubio, in many cases, was unable to provide clarification.

The party, for instance, paid a $1,000 charge at Braman Honda in Miami for repairs to Rubio's family minivan in January 2008. Rubio told the newspapers that the minivan was damaged by parking attendants at a political function and that the party agreed to cover half of his insurance deductible. The party also paid more than $2,000 for him to rent a car in Miami for five weeks while the minivan was being fixed.

Campaign spokesman Alex Burgos said that Rubio sent ""a $500 direct payment to American Express to cover half of the $1,000 car repair.""

""The fact is the $16,000 in personal expenditures were paid for by Marco Rubio's money,"" Burgos said. ""The $109,000 paid for by the party was for party business."" But not everything adds up. Rubio identified to the Herald and Times at least $1,265 in personal expenses billed to the card between March and November 2008: $1,024 in charges from a Tallahassee property management company, and $241 for a flight to Las Vegas after a relative's death.

During that eight-month period, however, Rubio repaid only $982 toward the credit card, records show. Rubio's campaign would not provide a list of all the personal expenses he repaid. Rubio's campaign said he attempted to pay his personal expenses as soon as possible, but sometimes had trouble getting statements to examine from Republican Party officials. Corporate card skinny

A key element to deciding whether it was Rubio's money, as he claims, is to know how the American Express corporate card works.

Molly Faust, a spokeswoman for American Express, declined to discuss the Republican Party of Florida account, or Rubio specifically. But she did discuss the American Express program generally.

Here are some key details: Let's repeat that: ""As long as the employee has adhered to maintaining their account and their responsibilities to the company, they are not liable,"" Faust said.

While Faust is talking in general, that's a key distinction in addressing Rubio's claim because there was no real policy regarding the use of the cards.

Under that rule, Rubio would not have been liable for any charges -- personal or business. So when Rubio says he paid back about $16,000 in personal charges, it's unclear if he had to, or if he would be penalized if he did not.

His money may have never been at stake.

Separating party from personal

Another key to this discussion is trying to separate personal from party expenses.

Take for instance the $78.10 Rubio charged at a Miami convenience store about a mile from his home. The charges were to Farm Stores, small drive-through convenience stores that sell things such as milk, beer, soda and potato chips. When asked about the charges, along with others by the Herald/Times, Rubio didn't specifically explain what he purchased at the convenience store. (Campaign spokesman Albert Martinez told PolitiFact Florida the charges were for office snacks).

Whatever it was, the GOP paid for it. Not Rubio.

The state party's quarterly financial report lists payments to American Express in its ""expense"" report. The party itemizes those charges -- though not by cardholder -- in a separate filed called ""Other Distributions.""

If charges aren't listed there, Rubio and the RPOF say, it means he paid for it himself.

That means Rubio paid for the now infamous visit to a barber shop called Churchill's on Nov. 18, 2006, for which Rubio charged $133.75. The charge -- Rubio says it was for a $20 haircut and items for a silent auction -- was not on party statements that we could find.

But those statements can be difficult to interpret, because the party grouped some expenses together, rather than itemized them.

Our ruling

To recap, Rubio said the charges were made with ""my money.""

There is some evidence on both sides.

On one hand, Rubio is able to document that he made payments to American Express for some items that he declared to be personal. That supports his contention that it was his money.

But the fact that there were purchases that appear to be personal, and were paid for by the Republican Party, undercuts his claim.

And although the card was under his name, American Express says that in general -- as long as a cardholder isn't violating the rules set out by the company -- it is the company (in this case the party) that is liable for the charges. And the cardholder (in this case Rubio) won't have his credit rating affected if the bill is not paid on time.

So there's little evidence that it was ""his money,"" but more that it was really the party's. We rate his claim Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C44140>],/factchecks/2010/mar/11/marco-rubio/rubio-gop-credit-card-my-money/

A trick of perspective in NASA photos of the moon and Earth do not prove that space is fake
","With the release of new colorful bowling-alley-carpetesque photos from the James Webb Space Telescope, it is official. Space is cool again.  But for some people, such out-of-this-world images serve as evidence that, as one Instagram post claimed, ""SPACE IS FAKE.""  That July 20, 2022, post relied on old NASA images to suggest that the varying sizes of the moon and Earth in relation to each other prove space is a myth.  ""Show me the angular size of something that gets smaller the CLOSER you get to it … "" read the caption, implying that because Earth appears smaller than the moon in the second photo, it must be inauthentic.  
(Screenshot from Instagram) The post, which comes from an account that has shared a number of false claims suggesting the earth is flat, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s why the post is wrong. The top photo was captured by a camera aboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite that orbits about 1 million miles from Earth. NASA released the image in 2015 and included it as part of an animation that stitched together several still photos showing the far side of the moon as it crossed in front of Earth.   The second photo dates back to July 20, 1969, when three American astronauts on the Apollo 11 mission landed on the moon. That image was indeed, as the post says, taken about 760,000 miles closer to Earth than was the 2015 image from the DSCOVR satellite.  Although the two photos are not digitally altered, they do not prove that outer space is fake. The size discrepancy of the Earth in the two photos is a trick of perspective that can easily be replicated with any camera and any two different-sized objects.  Using knickknacks from around PolitiFact’s newsroom, we illustrated why the Earth looks big in one photo and small in the other.  Our two objects?  A vintage PolitiFact mug (Earth) and a lego Marge Simpson (the moon). 
(On the left is a side-by-side object comparison of Marge and the mug. The image on the right shows the distance between the objects for our photos.)  After placing our objects about a foot apart, we took two pictures — one from far away, and one up close. 
(On the left is Marge and the mug captured from several feet away. On the right are the same objects, but the photo was taken from a distance closer to the mug and to Marge.) From far away, the mug looks small, and Marge looks smaller. As the camera gets closer in the second image, right next to Marge, she looks much larger than the mug, but still, the mug is larger than in the first photo because the camera is closer to it. But if you zoom in on the objects in the far-away photo, as was likely done with the 2015 NASA image of Earth, the mug appears quite large. It looks much larger than the second image, which was taken from a distance that is much closer to the mug (and also Marge). 
(On the left is the far-away image zoomed in on the objects. On the right is the same image we shared above.)  So how does an object appear smaller the closer you get to it? This is how. It is a trick of the camera, not evidence that outer space is fake. There are many more reasons we know outer space is not fake. Official space exploration began in 1961 when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. Since then, more than 600 people have followed in his gravity-free footsteps. Several rovers have been sent to explore the surface of the moon and Mars bringing back rock specimens to distribute to researchers around the globe. Want to see for yourself? Check out a live feed from the International Space Station.  Humans have been studying the night sky and the universe beyond since the dawn of mankind, and evidence of space began long before space travel.  In the seventh century B.C., ancient Babylonians were tracking and predicting the movement of planets and constellations. Ancient Greeks used geometry to measure the earth’s circumference and the distance to the moon and to understand orbits. Now we have governmental agencies, astrophysicists, and astronomers dedicated to the study of space. The statement that this image shows ""space is fake"" is inaccurate and ridiculous. That’s our definition for Pants on Fire!

Warnock, Cortez Masto voted for COVID-19 relief bill, but not for leisure projects it helped fund
","Two new Democratic senators who are locked in tight re-election campaigns ""squandered"" hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief money, according to a group tied to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. The targets are Raphael Warnock, who won a special election in Georgia in 2021, and Catherine Cortez Masto, a first-term senator from Nevada.  Separate TV ads from the One Nation group claim that Warnock and Masto ""voted to allow hundreds of millions of dollars of COVID relief funds to be squandered on a luxury resort in Florida, a New Jersey soccer stadium"" and ""a ski area in Iowa."" As the narrator speaks, dollar figures are shown on the screen for each project: $140 million, $15 million and $2 million, respectively. As the figures are shown, words on the screen refer to ""Warnock’s spending bill"" and ""Cortez Masto’s spending bill.""  To back its statement, One Nation pointed us to analyses by the Brookings Institution think tank and a statement from Senate Democrats. Spokespeople for the senators pointed out that leisure projects were not in the legislation.  Both senators voted for a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, which passed 50-49 along party lines. President Joe Biden signed it into law in March 2021.  The bill did not itemize the three expenditures highlighted in the ad; rather, it included $350 billion that could be spent by state and local governments, which is how each of these three projects were funded. The three projects could be called ""leisure,"" but local officials said they were intended to revive tourism once the pandemic was over.  The ads target Nov. 8 races that campaign watchers rate as toss-ups. Their outcomes could decide which party controls the Senate, which is split 50-50. The Republican challengers, Herschel Walker in Georgia and Adam Laxalt in Nevada, are endorsed by former President Donald Trump.  One Nation is a nonprofit that shares resources with the Senate Leadership Fund, McConnell’s super PAC. One Nation is a so-called dark-money group, which is not required to disclose its donors even if it spends to influence elections. One Nation spent $125 million in the 2020 election cycle, according to the nonprofit OpenSecrets. That included spending on ads and contributing $85 million to McConnell’s super PAC. The ads cite a March news article by TheAssociated Press that said the three leisure projects were among scores of projects that state and local governments funded with the coronavirus relief money ""despite having little to do with combating the pandemic."" The money came from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which included $350 billion in funds to help state and local governments. The projects represented a fraction of the $350 billion, but the cash ""was desperately needed to save jobs, help those in distress, open schools and increase vaccinations,"" the article said.  Here are details of the projects cited in the ad: Broward County, Florida, $140 million: The money went to build a county-owned hotel with views of the Atlantic Ocean and an 11,000-square-foot spa. Construction began in March.  The county’s administrator defended the expenditure as meeting one of the bill’s guidelines, providing aid for ""a planned expansion or upgrade of tourism, travel and hospitality facilities delayed due to the pandemic."" New Jersey, $15 million for soccer: The money made upgrades to sweeten the state’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup.  A spokesperson for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, defended the spending to NJ.com, saying the World Cup ""would bring millions of dollars to New Jersey’s tourism and hospitality industries, two sectors that have faced significant impacts from the pandemic."" Murphy announced in June that New Jersey and New York City had been selected as one of the World Cup host sites. Pottawattamie County, Iowa, $2 million ski area: The county used the funds to buy a privately owned ski area. The county board of supervisors made the purchase because COVID-19 hurt tourism, and the county had plans for further development of the recreation area. All five supervisors are Republicans, the American Independent noted. The largest expenditure cited by The Associated Press was $400 million to build new prisons in Alabama. Alabama Republicans argued that the expenditure addressed a public safety need and is allowed under a provision to replace lost revenue and shore up state services. Alabama prisons are widely considered dilapidated and unsafe. Legislation for that spending was signed in October by Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican. Lawsuits, including one filed in July, are attempting to block the spending.  Spending on the leisure projects was made possible by relatively loose rules in how state and local governments could spend the $350 billion. Senate Democrats promoted the eligible uses as ""broader"" than those for a similar fund contained in the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, a coronavirus relief bill signed by Trump in March 2020. Treasury Department rules said the $350 billion was for state and local governments ""to respond to the COVID-19 emergency and bring back jobs."" Among the permitted uses of the funds: ""replace lost public sector revenue, using this funding to provide government services up to the amount of revenue lost due to the pandemic"" and ""helping households, small businesses, impacted industries, nonprofits, and the public sector recover from economic impacts"" of the pandemic. Brookings said the money was ""encumbered with minimal restrictions — a big departure from the norm of federal grants,"" and represented ""a bright green light for creative problem-solving by states and localities."" Brookings is tracking how cities and counties with populations of at least 250,000 are spending their share of the $350 billion. As of July 12, $25 billion had been budgeted, with the largest shares for government operations (42.5%), public health (13.7%) and infrastructure (11.7%), according to the tracker. One Nation PAC claimed that Warnock and Cortez Masto ""voted to allow hundreds of millions of dollars of COVID relief funds to be squandered"" on leisure projects.  Both senators voted for the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill that gave $350 billion to state and local governments, but did not earmark the $350 billion for particular projects. One state and two counties approved spending the funds for hotel, soccer and ski projects as part of efforts to revive tourism. We rate the claim Half True.

The Permian Basin is America’s largest oil basin, but alone couldn’t fuel the US for 200 years
","Does America possess enough oil in 86,000 square miles to fuel the nation for two centuries? Sounds like a pipe(line) dream, but according to a viral image on Facebook, a ""small area"" in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico ""has enough oil to fuel America for the next 200 years.""  The post is correct that the shaded area of the map, known as the Permian Basin, has large quantities of oil and natural gas. But current estimates don’t add up to a 200-year supply, and dynamic economic and geological factors make long-term predictions nearly impossible.   (Screenshot of image shared on Facebook) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

With oil prices peaking at $130 a barrel in March 2022, and Americans having recently paid over $5 per gallon at the pump, America’s energy resources have been a focus for politicians and citizens alike. The Permian Basin, which produces over 5 million barrels of oil a day, according to the U.S. Energy Administration, seems like a promising supply.  The wealth of America’s most productive and largest oil basin lies in deep layers of shale deposits that have become accessible in the last two decades with the rise in horizontal fracking. Fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, involves drilling deep into the earth, first vertically and then horizontally, along layers of oil-rich rock. Pressurized water and chemicals are then pumped deep into the well, creating fractures through which oil and gas can escape.   The Permian, which is broken into regions, is routinely assessed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The USGS measures ""technically recoverable"" resources — ""oil and/or gas (that) can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices,"" regardless of economic or accessibility factors.   In 2018, the survey estimated there were 46.3 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable continuous oil in the Permian’s Delaware Basin; the estimate, at the time, doubled proven reserves. Estimates from the Midland Basin and Spraberry Formation add another 24.2 billion barrels to the region’s reserves, and a 2007 assessment identified 747 million barrels that could be recovered with conventional drilling.  This abundance of natural resources rivals the famed oil fields of the Middle East, according to Bloomberg News.  But experts warn that assessing the natural resources beneath our feet is not simple. ""A resource assessment like those from USGS is not an estimate of how much oil will ultimately be produced. It is an estimate of what is technically recoverable, and it has a wide range of uncertainty around it,"" said Kenneth Medlock, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University.  Additionally, assessments are constantly being updated and revised. ""The underground is as living as the human eye. It's a very organic space,"" said Deborah Gordon, who leads the Oil and Gas Solutions Initiative at the Rocky Mountain Institute. Estimates are not definitives or absolutes, but rather a snapshot of the current moment. ""It's almost like having a doctor say, ‘I'm healthy today, but that doesn't mean I'm healthy tomorrow.’"" And just because oil is technically recoverable does not mean it will be recovered. What matters more, experts say, is whether the oil is economically recoverable — meaning that the price of oil would render that extraction profitable.  ""Never is all of the oil extracted from any basin because economically, it is not feasible,"" Medlock said. ""That is why wells are plugged – they get too costly to continue producing."" Constantly shifting economic factors — including the cost of production, price of oil and technological developments — dictate how much oil is produced, Gordon said, not the sheer availability of resources: ""The big question is, what's the future price of oil and gas?"" And, she said, will it allow the Permian’s carbon bounty to remain economically recoverable?  Even if we were to factor out the complexity of fluctuating estimates, changing economic conditions and advancing technology, the numbers still don’t add up to what is claimed in this Facebook post.  According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. consumed 7.22 billion barrels of petroleum in 2021. Continuing at that rate of consumption, the estimated 71 billion barrels would last only 10 years. A 200-year supply would require closer to 1.45 trillion barrels — far beyond current estimates for the region.  ""It is highly unlikely that the Permian Basin will be able to provide all of America’s oil at any point in time,"" said Medlock. ""But it is true that the Permian Basin will be an important source of oil for the U.S. and the world market balance for the foreseeable future ... 200 years? That is anybody’s guess."" An image on Facebook claimed that a ""small area"" in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico ""has enough oil to fuel America for the next 200 years.""  The Permian Basin is indeed a large and valuable source of domestic oil and natural gas. But based on the latest geological assessments and U.S. energy consumption, estimated oil in the Permian would not last Americans 200 years.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C158080>],/factchecks/2022/jul/28/viral-image/permian-basin-americas-largest-oil-basin-alone-cou/

No, 90% of plankton in the Atlantic Ocean did not die off
","Sea life has been struggling for years because of pollution, overfishing and climate change. A now deleted Instagram post claimed the world’s oceans are in even more trouble.   The July 21 Instagram post featured an image of the ocean with superimposed text that read ""Breaking: Plankton in the Atlantic Ocean is 90% gone."" ""In what could be the most disturbing news in ocean conservation, if not human, history — data reveals worse than expected state of plankton (the foundation of life on earth) with a 90% drop in the Atlantic, driving another nail in the coffin of our dying ocean,"" the text continued. The Instagram post cited a study released by the Global Oceanic Environmental Survey Foundation, or the Goes Foundation, a Scotland research group that  measures plankton levels in the Atlantic Ocean. Howard Dryden, a marine biologist and the study’s lead author, was quoted in the Instagram post’s caption saying the Atlantic Ocean was ""pretty much dead."" Similar posts have popped up elsewhere on social media. Scientists have since questioned the study’s validity and the Goes Foundation’s data gathering methods. Dryden has said news outlets and social media have misinterpreted the study.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Plankton come in two groups: phytoplankton and zooplankton. Phytoplankton are plantlike organisms often found near the water's surface. They can absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Zooplankton are animals that include creatures as small as krill and as large as a jellyfish. They stay in deeper waters during the daylight to avoid predators and rise up to the surface at night to feed on phytoplankton.  The Instagram post took its information and Dryden’s quote from a story about the foundation’s study in a story published July 17 by The Sunday Post, a Scottish newspaper. The Post's story originally had the headline of ""Our empty oceans: Scots team’s research finds Atlantic plankton all but wiped out in catastrophic loss of life,"" and said the study found a majority of Atlantic Ocean plankton had disappeared over two years because of pollution from toxic chemicals and microplastics. However, the article did not say that the study collected samples from a limited part of the Atlantic Ocean at 15 degrees north latitude, and that the foundation’s findings have not been peer-reviewed. Dryden told PolitiFact there was a ""breakdown in communication with The Sunday Post,"" and that the newspaper has since updated its story clarifying the scope of the foundation’s study. ""What should have been said was that there has been a 90% decline in the equatorial Atlantic, not the whole Atlantic,"" Dryden said. ""This is still a major finding, because it could mark the beginning of the spread further afield."" The Goes Foundation described its plankton and pollution survey as an ""ongoing Citizen Science project"" involving 13 sailing vessels, one manned by researchers for the foundation and 12 others crewed by sailors given monitoring equipment. The crews used custom paper filters to collect water samples. Scientists would later analyze the filters to see whether plankton were in the water. The crews involved in the survey found only a minuscule amount of plankton. Dryden said the foundation's findings ""should be verified by a second independent study,"" and that the organization is working on getting its findings peer-reviewed, although that could take two years.  He said the organization felt it had to make the information public as soon as possible because ""it is so important for the survival of the oceans and climate change."" Oceanographers and marine biologists contacted by PolitiFact disagree with the study’s methods and findings, saying they have not observed a 90% drop in plankton around the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, or anywhere else. Mark Ohman, a biological oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said the study ""does not even begin to meet the standards of peer-reviewed science."" He said the study’s sampling method was ""not an appropriate way to take quantitative plankton samples"" and led to unreliable results because: The study didn’t specify when and where the samples were taken in the Atlantic, which would affect how much plankton was in the water, Ohman said. And the study failed to highlight plankton’s importance in ocean food webs and in regulating the Earth’s climate and oxygenating the atmosphere, he said. ""This study makes no contribution to understanding of any of those key processes, is rife with distortion and misunderstanding, and completely lacks credibility,"" Ohman said. There have also been no widespread changes to the plankton levels in the Atlantic Ocean, said David Johns, head of the Continuous Plankton Record Survey, which was established in 1931 to measure and monitor the ecological health of marine plankton. ""We have analyzed over a quarter-million samples from over 70 years of sampling, and have categorically not seen the declines reported by Dryden, and do not agree with his results,"" Johns said. Ohman said there has been no drop in overall zooplankton populations in the northeast Pacific Ocean, and a rise in phytoplankton. The Continuous Plankton Record Survey works with a large network of scientists around the world. None of the scientists has reported seeing the same declines mentioned in the Goes Foundation survey. There have been some plankton population declines that can be attributed to climate change, but not water pollution as mentioned in the survey, Johns said. ""A reduction as mentioned in Dryden’s report would not only be catastrophic, but also immediately obvious,"" Johns said. ""No plankton, no food for higher trophic levels such as fish, whales, filter-feeding shark and seabirds."" An Instagram post claimed 90% of plankton in the Atlantic Ocean had vanished. The post based its information on a study by the Global Oceanic Environmental Survey Foundation that claimed water samples it took in a part of the Atlantic Ocean showed the dramatic reduction. The organization said its findings could not be applied to the entire ocean, only the specific area from which the samples were taken. However, marine biologists and oceanographers have several issues with the organization’s sampling method and findings and say they have not seen a dramatic drop in the plankton population. In some cases, these experts say, plankton have been increasing. If such a dramatic drop in plankton occurred, it would have a disastrous impact on marine life that would have already been observable.   We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FF96EF00>],/factchecks/2022/jul/27/instagram-posts/no-90-plankton-atlantic-ocean-did-not-die/

No, Jane Goodall’s population comments didn’t spark pandemic
","Did conservationist and primatologist Jane Goodall, a longtime advocate for chimpanzees and the planet, plant the seed that convinced world leaders to unleash the COVID-19 pandemic? That’s what one social media user alleged in a video posted on Instagram, two years after Goodall, a United Nations peace messenger, discussed unchecked population growth’s effects on the environment at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2020. Goodall said many of today’s environmental problems wouldn’t exist if the globe had the population it had 500 years ago.  ""They’re not even hiding it any more,"" reads a caption on a July 24 Instagram post. ""Just wait til you find out how many world leaders are a part of the wef…"" ""Wef"" is short for World Economic Forum. The poster expands on his claim in the video, in which he plays a clip of Goodall’s remarks, then cuts in to ask: ""What was the population in the year 1500? About 500 million. What on earth could take place that would cause a planet with 9 billion people on it to be reduced by 95% to 500 million? Hmmm…I wonder if a virus could do that?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Goodall did make the human population growth comments seen in the video, but she has been making the same arguments for years. And there’s no evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic was intentionally started by world leaders, especially not because of her January 2020 comments, in an effort to lower the population. COVID-19 was already circulating in China a month earlier. Goodall was speaking about human population growth as it relates to sustainability and protecting the Brazilian rainforest, and thus, the environment, in a panel discussion at the forum. Her point, essentially, was that there are more people than the world has resources for, particularly in developing nations. She also said education and family planning are important to check population growth and protect the environment. Speaking at a panel discussion called ""Securing a Sustainable Future for the Amazon,"" Goodall discussed her Trillion Trees Project, part of her effort to protect and restore forests to help the climate. She mentioned four things activists and governments need to focus on to help: poverty, eating less meat, political corruption and human population growth. You can see the full context of her statements in the video above, but she finished with: ""Finally, we cannot hide away from human population growth, because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems. All these things we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago."" Earlier in the discussion, Goodall spoke of visiting Tanzania and helping to start a scholarship program to keep girls in school after puberty. ""It’s been shown all around the world as women’s education improves, family size drops, and it was the growing human population that was the worst problem destroying the forests in this area,"" said Goodall, who also described starting workshops on family planning. At no point did Goodall advocate for lowering the population.  Goodall has spoken about unchecked population growth and its effect on the environment as far back as 2003 and again in 2007. She made the same points in a video address to a Population Matters conference in 2019. ""I would encourage every single conservation organization, every single government organization to consider the absurdity of unlimited economic development on a planet of finite natural resources,"" she said then. ""Already in some areas, we are using up these precious natural resources faster than Mother Nature can restore them. We can’t go on like this. We can’t push human population growth under the carpet. We must find ways to address it."" COVID-19’s origin is not yet certain, but there’s no evidence that the virus, which has killed nearly 6.4 million people worldwide, including more than 1 million in the United States, was intentionally released to lower the world’s population.  PolitiFact has debunked the notion that the pandemic was somehow planned many times since it began. You can find all our coronavirus-related fact checks here. Although a possible lab leak wasn’t ruled out in a preliminary report in June by a team of scientists investigating the pandemic’s origins for the World Health Organization, two studies published this week in the journal Science say the virus likely jumped from animals to humans in a live market in Wuhan, China. The pandemic has affected population growth, according to the 2022 United Nations World Populations Prospects Report released in July.  ""The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all components of population change, including fertility, mortality and migration,"" said the report, which notes that the average life expectancy fell from 72.8 years in 2019 to 71 years in 2021, mostly because of COVID-19. Despite deaths from the virus, the world’s population is still growing — it’s expected to hit 8 billion people by November and peak at 10.4 billion in the 2080s — although the growth rate is the lowest it’s been since the 1950s, the report said.  It’s clear the pandemic had nothing to do with Goodall’s comments at the 2020 World Economic Forum, as the virus was circulating in China in December 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An Instagram post alleges that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned because Goodall spoke about unchecked human population growth’s effect on the environment at a World Economic Forum meeting in January 2020. But the virus had been circulating in China a month before Goodall made her remarks, and she has made similar comments over at least the past two decades. Despite the pandemic’s toll, the world’s population is growing and is projected to continue to do so. There’s no evidence the pandemic was planned.

Different weather maps don’t prove climate change isn’t real
","The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that climate change is real and that it’s most likely caused by humans.  But many social media users are trying to convince others that the media is exaggerating climate change’s effects, with weather forecasts now showing normal summer temperatures in scary red colors to deceive viewers. A July 22 Facebook post showing two maps reads ""Proof that climate change is real. See how the map is getting more red???"" The maps appear as screenshots from two weather forecasts from Germany. The top image is from 2017 and shows temperatures on a green background. The bottom image is from 2022. It shows slightly lower temperatures on a map that is red, orange and yellow. The post, which we found being shared in other social media posts, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is misleading, said Sabine Renken, a spokesperson for ​​Hessischer Rundfunk, a German public broadcasting corporation that leads the ARD Weather Competence Center. The center produces weather forecasts used in shows across ARD, an association of the nation’s regional public broadcasters. The images, although from the same TV program, were designed to show two different things. The 2017 image with its green coloring shows expected high temperatures for the next day. It’s a screen grab from a June 21, 2017, weather report on a daily news magazine broadcast called ""Tagesthemen,"" which translates to ""Daily Topics."" The green map was not designed to reveal anything about the temperatures, Renken told us. In the full video of that weather report, forecaster Claudia Kleinert points to additional graphics that show showers and thunderstorms, wind direction and the forecast for the next few days, with temperatures cooling, over the same green background. The 2022 image with the red background similarly shows the next day's highs —  this time on a color-coded heat map that was designed specifically to show a change in temperatures across the day. It appeared in a June 20, 2022, weather report from ""Tagesthemen."" Video shows that just before she showed the red map, she pointed to cooler early morning temperatures in green. The red, orange and yellow heat map was part of a change in graphic format implemented in 2020, according to a spokesperson for the broadcaster that produced the weather segment. ""Until 2020, there were no uniform weather forecasts in the ARD,"" Renken said. She said the weather reports were supplied by different editorial offices and companies and looked different in different broadcasts. Hessischer Rundfunk took over production of the weather forecasts in January 2020, Renken said, and the design and presentation were adapted for the broadcasts then. Renken disputed the notion that the two different maps show a conspiracy by weather forecasters to push a climate change agenda.  ""The two graphics differ in design and presentation. Until the end of 2019, the temperature maps supplied in the ""Tagesthemen"" only represented the temperature in numbers — the green background had no relation to the temperature,"" Renken said. In fact, in 2017, a weather report on a separate public broadcasting news program called ""Tagesschau,"" a daily newscast that appears on the same channel and uses the same set as ""Tagesthemen,"" showed the same style of map as those shared in this post, with a green background to show lower temperatures early in the morning, and then transitioned to red to show the weather warming during the day. Many weather forecasts traditionally use colors to differentiate between cold, moderate and hot temperatures.  A look at the national forecast on July 25 from The Weather Channel, which is based in the U.S., shows the color red being used to show warm temperatures, with pink used for extreme heat and yellow and orange for milder temperatures.  Weather Central uses a similar color scheme, as does the National Weather Service, though red there is reserved for temperatures exceeding 100 degrees. WGN-TV, a Chicago station, uses a similar method to differentiate temperatures. Renken pointed us to a 2019 article from an ARD fact-checker that debunked a similar claim about maps from 2009 and 2019 that alleged that ""Tagesschau"" was manipulating them to exaggerate the effects of climate change. A Facebook post claims that green and red colors showing temperatures in two different weather maps five years apart in Germany show the media is manipulating the maps to push a climate change agenda by adding red to make it seem hotter. But the maps in the post show two different things — one, from 2017, shows a general weather forecast on a green background; one, from 2022, shows only temperatures on a red background. The earlier green background had nothing to do with the temperatures, while the red background in 2022 did. We rate this claim False.

GOP Senate hopeful JD Vance paid political adviser to run nonprofit that did little to fight opioids
","In an Ohio race that could decide which party controls the U.S. Senate, Republican J.D. Vance’s Democratic opponent is accusing him of using money from a nonprofit for his own political benefit. U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan’s campaign made the attack in a 30-second ad:  ""When J.D. Vance moved back to Ohio, he told us his new nonprofit would help fix our state’s opioid crisis, but he failed to fund a single addiction program,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""So, what did Vance do with the money? He funneled tens of thousands to his top political adviser and paid tens of thousands for political polling. An independent expert called the nonprofit a charade. Vance did nothing to help Ohio, but did everything to help his political career.""  The ad’s claim about how the funds were used is largely on target.  In 2017, the year the nonprofit was most active, it spent nearly half of the money it took in to pay its executive director, who was — and remains — a Vance political adviser, and to pay for a survey.  The survey was done while Vance was considering a run for the U.S. Senate, though it’s not clear the survey was undertaken for Vance’s political benefit. He and Ryan are now facing off in a race rated as ""likely"" Republican and ""solid"" Republican. Vance, a venture capitalist, gained national attention after his 2016 memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,"" became a bestseller. The book examines the struggles of America’s white working class through Vance’s childhood in southern Ohio. Vance’s nonprofit, Our Ohio Renewal, described itself as ""dedicated to promoting the ideas and addressing the problems identified in"" ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" including fighting opioid abuse.  Political consultant Jai Chabria was the nonprofit’s executive director while he advised Vance on whether to run for the Senate in the 2018 election, which Vance opted against. Chabria is the chief strategist on Vance’s 2022 campaign. Here are key events that happened around the time the nonprofit was launched and as Vance weighed a run for Senate in 2018: In December 2016, Vance said he would be moving back to Ohio from California to start a nonprofit that would work on a few issues, including opioid addiction. He was more specific in a March 2017 column in The New York Times, writing that the organization would ""combat Ohio’s opioid epidemic.""  Our Ohio Renewal was formally created as a nonprofit in 2016, but according to its 2017 annual report, it didn’t launch publicly until spring 2017. Chabria, a former senior adviser to Republican John Kasich when Kasich was Ohio’s governor, was made the organization’s executive director.  Also in 2016 and 2017, Vance was considering a run in the 2018 election for the Ohio U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Sherrod Brown; Chabria was one of Vance’s key political advisers. Chabria told The Columbus Dispatch, for example, that Vance had attended a dozen Lincoln Day dinners, a major Republican Party event, across Ohio. In September 2017, in reporting that Vance had decided not to run, The Atlantic said he had commissioned a poll testing his viability in the Republican primaries for governor and Senate, and that Chabria was convinced Vance had a future in politics.  Our Ohio Renewal filed a tax return only in 2017; it reported to the IRS that its receipts were less than $50,000 in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020, meaning it did not need to file a tax return. The 2017 return said the nonprofit was ""dedicated to promoting the ideas and addressing the problems identified in ‘Hillbilly Elegy,’"" including fighting opiate abuse. We also found a July 2017 snapshot of OurOhioRenewal.com, a site that is no longer active, which said one of the organization’s three initiatives was to ""lead on solutions to opioid abuse.""  In 2017, Our Ohio Renewal took in $221,135 in nonitemized contributions and grants and spent $50,078 on program services, including $45,000 for a survey on the ""social, cultural and general welfare needs of Ohio citizens.""  The return said the organization also paid $63,425 to Chabria. Chabria would not say when the nonprofit’s survey was executed or whether it was the same polling undertaken in regard to Vance’s potential run for office. Ryan’s ad alludes to an article by Insider in August 2021, nearly two months after Vance announced his 2022 Senate run for the seat Republican Rob Portman is vacating. A Ryan campaign news release about the ad also cited the article, in which Insider reported on the federal tax filings.  The article said a spokeswoman for Ohio's largest anti-opioid coalition hadn't heard of Vance's organization. It also quoted nonprofit expert Doug White, who reviewed the nonprofit’s tax filings, as saying, ""This is a charade. It's a superficial way for him to say he's helping Ohio. None of that is actually happening, from what I can tell."" Ryan’s campaign pointed us to the nonprofit’s tax return and to news articles about Chabria and Vance. The nonprofit said in its two-page 2017 annual report that its activities included researching kinship guardians and recommending how to support them in Ohio. In November 2017, Vance, identified as Our Ohio Renewal’s honorary chairman, wrote an opinion article for Cleveland.com that advocated for state legislation to support so-called kinship guardians — family members who help care for children when their parents, because of opioid addictions or other problems, can’t. The annual report said Our Ohio Renewal also authored a ""working paper outlining state responses to the opioid crisis."" Ryan said that instead of fighting opioid addiction, a nonprofit founded by J.D. Vance paid his ""top political adviser"" and funded polling. Vance’s nonprofit, which was founded partly to fight opioid abuse, paid Chabria $63,425 in 2017 to be its executive director. Chabria was a key political adviser to Vance and remains on Vance’s 2022 Senate campaign.  The nonprofit also spent $45,000 for a survey of the ""social, cultural and general welfare needs of Ohio citizens."" We could not find evidence documenting the survey’s exact questions. We rate Ryan’s claim about Vance Mostly True.

No, the White House didn’t change the definition of “recession”
","Ahead of a key economic data announcement on July 28, critics of President Joe Biden have taken to social media to lay the groundwork for declaring the economy in recession, and laying the blame on the president. They have noted that if the federal government announces that gross domestic product shrank in the second quarter, it would represent the second consecutive quarter that GDP decreased. This is commonly cited as a sign of a recession being underway. One Instagram post from July 25 accused the White House of changing the rules of the game to deny the looming reality of an official recession. The post’s narrator said, ""The White House is now trying to protect Joe Biden by changing the definition of the word recession."" The narrator went on to read a portion of a White House webpage (also reproduced in the video’s backdrop) that said, ""What is a recession? While some maintain that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession, that is neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle."" Then, the narrator asks Apple’s Siri to define ""recession."" Siri responds with a definition, apparently plucked from an online dictionary: ""A period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The two-quarter threshold mentioned in the video didn’t come from nowhere; it gained a foothold over many years because of its simplicity for the public, news outlets and politicians. It has a good historical track record of lining up with recessions, and it has the advantage of being calculated in real time, rather than months after the fact.  Meanwhile, experts agree that the U.S. economy faces some important headwinds, recession or not. Despite low unemployment and healthy consumer spending, Americans feel uneasy about the economy when they see daily their costs rising and their 401(k) valuations sinking. And reasonable people can disagree about whether, or how much, Biden’s policies are to blame. However, the two-quarter threshold cited in the Instagram post has never been official. It’s more like a rough guide — one piece of a complicated puzzle. The Instagram post is misleading in several ways, but especially in accusing the White House of ""changing the definition of the word recession."" For starters, the definition read by Siri — which holds no official stature other than providing an answer chosen by artificial intelligence — includes an important word that the narrator glosses over, namely ""generally."" In other words, the one-sentence definition Siri provided is not a closed answer. It’s a general guidance that includes exceptions. Siri could have easily picked another source of information: the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, which is the official arbiter of when U.S. recessions begin and end. It’s also the entity cited throughout the White House’s blog post. On the committee’s website — last updated a year ago, well before the current debate — the committee describes the factors it uses to determine the start of a recession, namely ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months."" Every recession requires ""depth, diffusion, and duration"" of economic hurt. Beyond the change in GDP, the committee says it weighs personal income, payrolls, personal expenditures, manufacturing and trade sales and industrial production. The committee website also addresses the shortcomings of the two-quarters threshold head-on.  The committee notes that it has sometimes classified periods as recessions even if they did not involve two consecutive quarters of negative growth, such as the 2001 dot-com bubble recession. Also, the 2020 pandemic recession lasted just two months — not enough to produce a full quarter’s worth of data, much less two. The White House blog post in question — which said the two-quarter metric is not the ""official definition"" and that the official ruling is made based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to change in GDP — is in accord with what the NBER has long said. And it’s not a sudden change. Meanwhile, in interviews with PolitiFact, a dozen economists cautioned against overreliance on the two-quarter rule, particularly in the current moment.  For instance, all economic data gets revised in subsequent months, as more information is collected. This can turn an initial negative number into a positive one, or a positive number into a negative one.  GDP fell in the first quarter by 1.6%, but economists say this may have been misleadingly negative, because of how inventories and trade data are factored in. A separate statistic — gross domestic income, or GDI — rose at a 1.8% annual pace over the same quarter. The NBER committee uses both GDP and GDI in its recession-dating debates. Also, data beyond GDP looks strong, including the unemployment rate and payroll employment. And the pandemic has been such an upheaval that there’s no reason to believe that a rigid standard like the two-quarter rule is still valid, said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University. Instagram posts said, ""The White House is now trying to protect Joe Biden by changing the definition of the word recession."" It’s certainly to the White House’s political advantage to get ahead of potentially bad economic news, and there are plenty of indications that the U.S. economy faces significant challenges, including the possibility of an eventual recession. But the White House blog post cited is not only accurate about the official definition, but evidence shows it’s not a definition the White House suddenly cooked up as cover. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C15A080>],/factchecks/2022/jul/27/instagram-posts/no-white-house-didnt-change-definition-recession/

Marco Rubio's ad twists Val Demings' words on police reform
","An ad from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign takes his opponent in Florida's U.S. Senate race, Democratic Rep. Val Demings, out of context — undermining her background in law enforcement.  The 30-second ad published on YouTube July 19 features several uniformed law enforcement personnel bashing Demings' voting record in Congress and calling her a ""radical rubber stamp."" ""Demings votes with Pelosi 100% of the time,"" one officer said, invoking data from ProPublica that showed Demings and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed on 100% of votes in the 116th Congress, which ended Jan. 3, 2021.  ""She called abolishing the police 'thoughtful,'"" another said, motioning air quotes. The campaign ad included a footnote citing a June 8, 2020, CBS interview.  That day — about two weeks after footage showed George Floyd, a Black man, being killed by a white Minneapolis police officer — Tony Dokoupil of CBS This Morning quizzed Demings on her views on law enforcement reform.  He zeroed in on a proposal in Minneapolis to ""dismantle and rebuild"" the city's police department. ""Is that a strategy you could agree with?"" Dokoupil asked Demings.  Demings, Orlando's former police chief, said, ""I do believe that everyone has a right to look at any proposal that is put forth because there desperately needs to be change. I also believe the council is being very thoughtful in terms of looking at all of the services that police provide.""  She also said she believed the city's council would devise a plan ""to keep Minneapolis safe but also bring the community and the police together in a much-needed and long overdue way.""  Demings did not express support for ""abolishing the police,"" as Rubio's ad suggested. Throughout her campaign, Demings rebutted suggestions that she supports defunding the police. In a Sept. 22, 2020, interview with NPR, for example, Demings said she would do everything she could to ensure law enforcement agencies were not defunded.  ""What I know from my on-the-ground experience is that all communities want to be safe,"" Demings said. ""If resources are taken away from police departments, the most vulnerable communities would be disproportionately impacted yet again."" Demings went further in a June 12 ad that highlighted her nearly three decades in law enforcement. ""In the Senate, I'll protect Florida from bad ideas. Defunding the police: That's just crazy."" A Rubio campaign ad said Demings ""called abolishing the police 'thoughtful.'"" PolitiFact found that the ad misrepresented what Demings said when asked about a proposal in Minneapolis to dismantle the police.

No, watching 30 minutes of Netflix does not release the same amount of CO2 as driving four miles
","Don’t touch that dial — or rather, don’t exit that tab of Netflix — if you’re worried that streaming services are as bad for the environment as a short drive. A popular screenshot of a tweet claims, ""Your Netflix binge-watching is making climate change worse, say experts. The emissions generated by watching 30 minutes of Netflix is the same as driving almost 4 miles.""  The tweet from @BigThink crossed over to Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We wondered whether the comparison between driving a specific distance and watching Netflix for a specific amount of time checks out.  Broadly speaking, watching streaming services does impact climate change through energy use, data transfer, and the production of devices such as TVs and computers. But the comparison presented doesn’t add up. We found the claim on Facebook, Twitter and meme pages. Often, a screenshot of the original tweet is shown with a response from the Twitter account @lexcanroar.  The @bigthink tweet was originally meant to promote this article on bigthink.com, but the tweet has been deleted. The article now includes a correction dated Jan. 24, 2020. The correction says the article originally ""relied on data produced by the The Shift Project,"" which is a French think tank advocating a shift to a post-carbon economy. The article, which is about the carbon impact of streaming services, no longer contains any comparison between driving and Netflix. According to its website, the specific claim about the half-hour of viewing came from an oral interview, quotes from which were published in AFP, a French cooperative news agency. The original statement on AFP was: ""Watching a half-hour show would lead to emissions of 1.6 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent, said Maxime Efoui-Hess of French think tank the Shift Project. That's equivalent to driving 3.9 miles (6.28 kilometers)."" The claim warped to include Netflix as it gained media traction. In response, the International Energy Agency published a fact-check in February 2020 by digital/energy analyst George Kamiya. Finding the exact comparison between driving and Netflix is difficult, as all kinds of data fluctuate. As Kamiya wrote, watching on different devices and driving different cars affects the comparison. Even the year makes a difference, because energy efficiency for data transfer is growing rapidly, as is the efficiency of cars and the availability of electric cars. Driving at different speeds or using energy from different countries can influence these numbers, too. That said, Kamiya came up with an estimate based on averages in 2019. He wrote that streaming a 30-minute show on Netflix in 2019 released around 18 grams of emissions.  According to a report published by the Environmental Protection Agency in March 2018, the average American passenger car emits 404 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. That means 4 miles of driving emits about 1,616 grams of CO2, which is about 90 times Kamiya’s estimate of the emissions of a 30-minute Netflix show. If you do a little more math, you’ll find that the estimated emissions of a 4-mile drive is around the same as 45 hours of video streaming in the U.S.  Kamiya described streaming as ""a fairly low-emitting activity."" The Shift Project responded to Kamiya’s fact-check with this document in June 2020, stating that Kamiya was correct about the Netflix claim being wrong, and that some of the data in one of its earlier reports had been flawed. (Kamiya also challenged the results of the Shift Project’s newer report in a November 2020 update to his IEA article.)  The claim in the Facebook post said, ""The emissions generated by watching 30 minutes of Netflix is the same as driving almost 4 miles.""  The claim is attributed to The Shift Project, which describes it as an ""error"" that ""appeared during an interview."" Carbon emissions are complicated to gauge across different people who use different devices, drive different cars, get energy from different sources, and so on. However, an estimate from the International Energy Agency estimated that when this claim was made in 2019, 4 miles of driving  had more similar carbon emissions to streaming 45 hours of Netflix. We rate this comparison False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097067280>],/factchecks/2022/jul/26/facebook-posts/no-watching-30-minutes-netflix-does-not-release-sa/

State GOP only let less than 2% of Democratic bills have public hearings, Dem says
","As Wisconsin barrels toward the August primaries and the fall election, state Democrats are pointing out an imbalance in Madison. In the Legislature, Republicans have had control of both chambers since the 2010 election — and could expand their advantage this fall due to even more favorable maps.   But that’s not the imbalance state Rep. Francesca Hong, D-Madison, had in mind when she  tweeted this on May 18, 2022: ""In the Wisconsin State Assembly this session, more than 75% of GOP bills received a public hearing. Meanwhile, the GOP allowed less than 2% of Democratic bills to have a hearing.""  Is she right? Hong’s staff said the claim, and others she made in the series of tweets, came from two memos issued by the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau that looked at statistics on bills given hearings in the state Assembly. Jillian Slaight, managing legislative analyst for the Legislative Reference Bureau, told us similar memos have not been compiled for the state Senate.  The memos, issued May 9, 2022, track data from 2009 to 2022. In the 2021-22 legislative session, Republicans gave 76.5% of their party’s bills public hearings. Meanwhile, just 1.9% of bills authored by Democrats received public hearings.  So, Hong cited the numbers correctly in her tweet.   If the gap seems especially imbalanced, that’s because it’s a far cry from just over a decade ago. Democrats last controlled the Assembly in the 2009-10 session. In that session, 80.1% of Democratic-sponsored bills received public hearings, but 39% percent of Republican bills also had hearings.  Control of the Assembly flipped in 2010, and with the election of Gov. Scott Walker, the GOP had full control of state government — so there was little functional need for bipartisanship to move matters forward. In the years that followed, the percentage of bills authored by Democrats that received public hearings cratered.  In the 2011-12 and 2013-14 sessions, for instance, about 15% of Democratic-authored bills received a hearing. As noted, it was less than 2% in the current session. To give a sense of scale on the number of bills handled by the Legislature, the volume of bills introduced in a given session, by both chambers, from 2009 to 2020 ranged from 1,325 to 1,970, according to the most recent Wisconsin Blue Book,  Hong claimed that in the current legislative session ""more than 75% of GOP bills received a public hearing. Meanwhile, the GOP allowed less than 2% of Democratic bills to have a hearing."" Statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau show she is correct, with a steep decline occurring since Republicans took over after the 2010 election. In the previous session, when Democrats had control, some 39% of Republican-sponsored bills got a hearing. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970482C0>],/factchecks/2022/jul/26/francesca-hong/state-gop-only-let-less-2-democratic-bills/

No, Nancy Pelosi is not being impeached
","A sensationalized Facebook video claims the U.S. Supreme Court is impeaching House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., — even though the court lacks that authority. The 10-minute video was shared July 20 and is titled ""Supreme Court FINALLY signs VERDICT to IMPEACH Speaker Pelosi as Hunter’s Laptop IMPLICATES her."" The video features a collection of clips from politicians including Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. First of all, the video’s title is inaccurate. The Supreme Court doesn’t have the power to impeach a federal official; only members of Congress have that ability, as laid out in the U.S. Constitution.  The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The House of Representatives has the ""sole power of impeachment,"" and the Senate has ""sole power to try all impeachments,"" according to the Constitution. This means representatives can bring forward charges of impeachment against an official, and it’s up to a vote of senators whether to convict the official or acquit them of charges. The only role the Supreme Court has in an impeachment proceeding is when a chief justice presides over the impeachment of a president. At no point in the video did any of the politicians talk about Pelosi being impeached. Instead, they criticized Pelosi for decisions they disagreed with or talked about things unrelated to the Democratic leader. The video’s first clip is a speech Cruz gave July 29, 2021, in which he said Pelosi was ""drunk on power"" after a mask mandate was reinstated for House members following a rise in COVID-19 cases. The second clip shows Boebert during a House session on July 27, 2021, talking about how amendments she proposed for a spending package were rejected without debate, claiming Pelosi had silenced her constituents and the American people. The third clip features McCarthy criticizing Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on March 18, 2022; the fourth clip is a speech made by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on March 28, 2022, calling for an investigation into President Joe Biden’s family. Tying to the video’s headline, McCarthy and Grassley refer to Hunter Biden’s laptop, which originated from a 2020 story published by the New York Post that claims a laptop belonging to the president’s son was purportedly left at a repair shop in Delaware. There’s no reported connection to Pelosi and the laptop. A Facebook video claims the U.S. Supreme Court is impeaching House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The Supreme Court does not have the power to impeach federal officials; only the House has the ability. The video features several unrelated clips of politicians and provides no evidence to back up its claim.

Fact-checking the ‘hollow earth’ conspiracy theory
","Giant animals. Beautiful forests. Extraterrestrial technologies. That is all inside our planet, according to an Instagram post that claims the Earth is hollow and has a civilization living inside. Scientists once took claims like this seriously, according to ""Hollow Earth,"" a book by David Standish. English astronomer Edmond Halley proposed to the Royal Society of London in the 1690s that the Earth consisted of nested, spherical shells that spun in different directions and surrounded a central core. Halley thought the space between shells may have had luminous atmospheres that might have supported life. American officer John Cleves Symmes expanded Halley’s theory in the 1810s by claiming that those spheres could be accessed through holes in both poles. Even though advancing science has debunked those ideas, they survive online. One recent Instagram post claimed that there is ""an enormous void"" with a ""stunning magnetic anomaly"" or a ""massive gravity anomaly"" beneath Antarctica’s ice. A ""different world"" or a ""mythic land"" exists in that space, where giant animals roam in green forests surrounded by ""extraterrestrial technologies."" Elsewhere, believers propose that aliens, Vikings, ancient civilizations, and Nazis escaping Allied forces all live in this place. They also claim that Adam and Eve from the Bible were banished from the inside of the Earth to the outside, and the Lost Tribes of Israel migrated from the outside to the inside. The Instagram post also claimed, echoing Symmes, that the Earth’s interior could be reached through polar holes and that elites are trying to hide those entrances by manipulating polar satellite images and banning travel to Antarctica. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Since Halley and Symmes, scientists have amassed evidence proving the Earth isn’t hollow. Andrew Campbell, a professor of geophysics at the University of Chicago, said the most straightforward explanation is that Earth’s density is greater than that of the rocky layer comprising its crust.  Earth has a density of 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter on average (counting all the mass of the planet) while rocks in the crust have a density of 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter on average, Campbell said. If our planet were hollow, its density would be lower, not greater, than the density of its crust. Scientists cannot visit the Earth’s interior, but have other means for gauging its composition, Campbell said. For example, they can analyze the waves produced by earthquakes that run through the Earth’s interior, slowing and changing paths as they encounter the boundaries of its internal layers. The Instagram post indicates that satellite images always come with the poles removed, blurred or covered. One picture included in the post, produced by NASA’s ICESat satellite, shows all of Antarctica except the South Pole.  The post claims that this is part of a plot to keep underworld entrances hidden. But NASA scientist Thorsten Markus explained that satellites often skip parts of the Earth’s surface because of how they spin around the world. ICESat satellites, for example, do not cover the poles.  ""We pick the inclination based on our science requirements"" and ""the poles themselves are not that interesting so we skip them,"" said Markus. Finally, there are multiple examples of satellite images that show the North and South poles in great detail. And although American explorers traveling to Antarctica need to notify the State Department about their plans, they can still access the South Pole (and the North Pole) independently or on cruises, airplanes and balloons managed by travel companies. Pressure and heat inside the Earth make human visits impossible.  ""Life is possible to very limited depths in the crust, but not deeper than that,"" Campbell said. ""In Earth’s mantle and core, the pressures and temperatures are so great that the chemistry of life is not possible — carbon-rich organic molecules will react to form diamond and other materials."" Campbell believes this impossibility of access makes the depths of the Earth so fascinating to people. ""The interior of the planet is inaccessible to human visitation, and probably always will be,"" he says, ""so people conjure fantasies about what lies there."" An Instagram post claims that there is ""an enormous void"" below Antarctica, that a ""different world"" exists there, and that it can be accessed through a hole in Antarctica. The post also claims that elites are conspiring to keep that a secret. Scientists are sure that the Earth is not hollow, partly because it’s much denser than the rocks found on the surface. Elites are not hiding the poles from the public — they can be seen in satellite images and visited by tourists. And life is impossible deep inside the Earth.

"['North Carolina', 'Qasim Rashid']","
Did the North Carolina GOP reintroduce abortion bill defining life at conception?
","Liberal activists are sounding the alarm about a North Carolina bill that seeks to outlaw abortion and punish those involved in the procedure. ""North Carolina GOP is reintroducing a bill that says life begins at conception and anyone who destroys that fertilized egg is guilty of first-degree murder,"" Qasim Rashid, a human rights attorney, said in a July 18 Twitter post. Rashid is a former congressional candidate and has more than 344,000 followers on Twitter. The tweet, which has been deleted, linked to the website of Demand Justice, a progressive group advocating for the expansion of the U.S. Supreme Court. Santiago Mayer, the founder and executive director of Voters of Tommorrow, tweeted something similar July 18, ""Republicans in North Carolina just introduced a bill that’d make abortion punishable with death."" Particularly for people concerned about abortion rights, the news is alarming. But the tweets are misleading and omit a significant fact: This proposed legislation is more than a year old and died in committee. We found no evidence that it has been reintroduced — the legislature is adjourned — nor did we find any evidence that it’s supported by Republican leaders in the legislature. Rashid didn’t respond to messages seeking comment about the claims in his Twitter post. The tweets appear to be a reference to a bill known as H158 that’s been filed in North Carolina’s state legislature.  The bill seeks to define life as starting at fertilization — the earliest point in the pregnancy process — and could allow law enforcement to charge people with murder if they’re involved in an abortion. The bill also says people have the right to use deadly force to defend the life of another person, and that the state has an interest to ""punish those who take the lives of persons, born or unborn, who have not committed any crime punishable by death."" So, to some degree, the tweets convey some of the bill’s intent. However, Rashid inaccurately described who filed the bill. It wasn’t filed by the ""North Carolina GOP,"" and it wasn’t even supported by a majority of Republicans.  Although the North Carolina Republican Party’s platform says life should be protected ""from conception until death"" and that the party opposes the destruction of embryos, party spokesman Jeff Moore said the organization ""doesn’t craft legislation"" and had no involvement in the bill.  ""This appears to be purely political gaslighting,"" Moore said of the tweet’s claim. The bill was filed by two Republicans, one of whom is Rep. Larry Pittman — a retiring lawmaker who made national news in 2017 when he compared Abraham Lincoln to Adolf Hitler. In a letter filed with the bill, Pittman claims that ""it is hoped that if abortion is made illegal, as it always should have been, more people will be more responsible in their sexual habits before producing a new human life unintentionally."" Responding to analysis that his bill featured no proposal for implementing its goals, Pittman wrote that ""abortion, being an act of murder, should be treated the same as any other instance of murder under existing law."" With Roe v. Wade overturned and multiple states moving to limit abortion, the claim that the bill is being ""reintroduced"" is perhaps the most misleading part of the tweet.  The bill was filed Feb. 24, 2021. It bounced around three House committees without a vote and the most recent committee referral was that August. The bill is effectively dead because it made no progress in either chamber and doesn’t meet qualifications for reconsideration that were outlined in the legislature’s adjournment resolution passed July 1, according to Stephen Wiley, caucus director for the North Carolina House Republicans. By the time Mayer and Rashid tweeted, state lawmakers had gone home because the main legislative session was over.  ""There are hundreds of bills introduced every biennium that never receive so much as a committee vote, and this is one of them,"" Wiley said. ""Now, with legislators done with [the] short session, out-of-state online activists are bringing this bill up in an obvious attempt to build their fundraising lists."" Republican legislative leaders — House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate Leader Phil Berger — both said last month that they won’t take up abortion bills until next year, when they hope to have a supermajority in both chambers. In a recent interview with WRAL News, Berger said he believes abortion laws should include an exception for rape and incest and that there ""likely should be a period of the postconception the mother should have some autonomy in terms of what takes place.""  The tweets also ignore an important fact about what would happen if the bill were somehow approved by the legislature. H158 calls for a constitutional amendment. Proposed constitutional amendments pass only if they receive 60% of the vote in both the House and Senate.Then all proposed amendments to the North Carolina Constitution must be approved by voters through a statewide referendum. The bill would direct the state Board of Elections to place it on the ballot in this year’s November elections. And it’s not a slam dunk at the polls.  A recent WRAL poll conducted before Roe v. Wade was overturned found that most North Carolinians want state abortion laws to stay the same or become less restrictive. Given the procedural and political obstacles, it’s virtually impossible for this bill to pass this year and become law. After PolitiFact North Carolina contacted Voters of Tomorrow, Mayer deleted a tweet attached to the original claim that sought donations to his group.  In an email statement provided to PolitiFact through Voters of Tomorrow, Mayer said: ""While this bill was introduced earlier than I realized, our focus should be on how this bill would put people at risk of being murdered by the state for exercising control over their own bodies."" Mayer also tweeted an acknowledgement that the bill ""has been stuck in committee for a bit."" Rashid said ""North Carolina GOP is reintroducing a bill that says life begins at conception and anyone who destroys that fertilized egg is guilty of first degree murder."" The claim captures some of the bill’s intentions, but falsely says it was ""reintroduced"" by the ""North Carolina GOP"" and ignores key details about the bill’s status and potential for becoming law.

Ad targeting Manchin, AARP misses on Medicare drug price negotiations
","A snappy political advertisement from the conservative advocacy group American Commitment bluntly charges Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., with supporting a legislative plan that would drain ""billions in funds"" from Medicare. Specifically, the ad claims that Manchin and AARP, the well-known advocacy group for people 50 and older, ""support government price-setting schemes that’ll give liberal politicians billions in funds meant for Medicare to spend on unrelated government programs or pad big insurers’ profits."" Here, ""price-setting"" is a reference to a policy proposal that its backers say would give Medicare the ability to rein in the prices it pays for some prescription drugs so they are more in line with prices in other industrialized countries. American Commitment didn’t respond directly to KHN’s request for comment, but its president, Phil Kerpen, took to Twitter to react to our email inquiry. Kerpen tweeted on July 14 that ""CBO shows Manchin/Schumer drug price controls raid Medicare for $287 billion, most of which is expected to be sent to insurance companies as supersized Obamacare subsidies."" This is a reference to the Congressional Budget Office’s July 6 cost estimate of the prescription drug policies in an economic package — a type of legislation known as a reconciliation bill — that Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., hope to bring to the floor in the coming weeks. The CBO found those policies would save $287.6 billion over 10 years as a result of Medicare’s reduced spending on drugs. More on this later. Both Manchin and AARP dismissed the ad’s message. ""This ad funded by Big Pharma is blatantly lying about Sen. Manchin’s record,"" said Sam Runyon, Manchin’s communications director. ""West Virginia seniors know Sen. Manchin has worked tirelessly to protect Medicare and reduce prescription drug costs."" American Commitment received $505,000 from PhRMA, the drug industry’s trade group, in the 2020 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. In the days after the ad began airing, Manchin announced he would support only a slimmed-down version of the reconciliation bill, although his support for Medicare drug-price negotiations has remained steady. Bill Sweeney, AARP’s senior vice president of government affairs, said the ad is representative of ""the false attacks"" that opponents of the proposal are using. ""So I don’t think anything can be further (from) the truth,"" he said, referring to the ad’s assertion that the Medicare program will be cut to pay for something else. This ad is marked by charged language and opinions, and it raises the question of whether giving Medicare the power to regulate drug prices would be the price-setting scheme that American Commitment makes it out to be. The ad claims that Manchin and AARP ""support government price-setting schemes."" And it’s true that Manchin and AARP continue to favor Medicare drug-price negotiations. So what does that mean? Medicare is currently prohibited from bargaining directly with pharmaceutical companies over how much it pays for certain prescription medications, so that power would be new. Supporters of the proposal say doing so would lead to significant savings for Medicare because it pays much higher prices than the rest of the world. Critics of the proposal, such as Kerpen, call the practice ""price setting."" The reconciliation bill’s Medicare drug provisions would allow the program to negotiate drug prices for a limited set of drugs — 10 initially and another 10 in later years — and would cap drug price inflation. The legislation would also set a $2,000 limit on annual out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Companies that opt out will face an excise tax on the previous year’s profits. Joseph Antos, a senior fellow and health care scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said an argument can be made that even though the drugmakers and the government would hold discussions about setting lower prices for certain drugs, the program would compel drugmakers to comply or face tax penalties. ""The manufacturers will have no leverage at all — this is a law that gives (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) the authority to set the price,"" Antos said. ""There will be discussions, and, of course, it’s polite to call it negotiation,"" he added, but ultimately the government will make the decision. Historically, both Republicans and Democrats, as well as the advocacy groups aligned with them, have framed a reduction in Medicare spending as a cut to the program when trying to gain traction with voters. In this case, though, the drug pricing experts we consulted unanimously agreed that, from a budgetary standpoint, the almost $288 billion estimate from the CBO represents savings for Medicare, rather than funds that would be taken away from the program, as the ad alleges. ""What’s happening here isn’t an elimination of a Medicare service or benefit — we’re talking about paying lower prices for the very same drugs we pay the highest prices in the world for now,"" said Rachel Sachs, a law professor and drug pricing expert at Washington University in St. Louis. ""So, I’d say that’s fairly misleading,"" Sachs said. Indeed, if Medicare pays less for drugs, that could have a beneficial trickle-down effect, said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow with the University of Southern California-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. That’s because, under this scenario, Medicare premiums and cost sharing would also be reduced, saving beneficiaries money. The actual savings would probably vary, though. Another common argument from the pharmaceutical industry is that if its revenue drops, fewer drugs could be developed in the future. The CBO estimated that the drug-price negotiation provision would hinder about 15 new drug approvals over 30 years. Under current law, about 1,300 drugs would typically be approved during that same period, according to the CBO. ""There’s a lot of disagreement about how large those effects will be and whether we are talking about high- or low-value drugs,"" Fiedler wrote in an email referring to the reduced number of drug approvals. ""There is a potential trade-off here between lower costs for beneficiaries and fewer new drugs down the road, albeit nothing resembling a clear-cut case that Medicare beneficiaries will be worse off overall."" It’s also important to remember that these drug price negotiations would target only a small subset of drugs — 20, at most — although the legislation does target the most expensive single-source drugs, which could include some cancer drugs, blood thinners, and rheumatoid arthritis medication. Still, drug companies would be free to profit from the sale of their other drugs. So, overall, the experts said the ad’s contention that drug price negotiations would negatively affect seniors is inaccurate. The ad also alleges that the billions of Medicare dollars saved would be spent by liberal politicians on ""unrelated government programs"" or to ""pad big insurers’ profits."" Senate Democrats have said that the nearly $288 billion in estimated savings to Medicare would be used to offset the cost of other programs. There’s no question that the $288 billion in savings would give ""Congress the ability to spend on something else in the same bill,"" Antos said. ""But, again, this is not a revelation — this is how all legislation works. The ad makes it sound as if it’s out of the ordinary, but it’s actually completely usual."" The Democrats’ earlier plan for the reconciliation bill included provisions related to climate change, energy, and tax policy. However, momentum is now behind the approach supported by Manchin, which includes only a two-year extension of the enhanced premium subsidies for consumers who buy insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The American Rescue Plan Act, which became law in March 2021, first increased those subsidies and made qualifying for assistance easier, but that help runs out at the end of this year. If the subsidies expire, millions of people will have to start paying much higher insurance premiums or could lose their coverage. This point brings us to the ad’s claim about padding insurers’ profits — which Kerpen linked to extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies. That’s not true, according to the experts. ""Insurers might capture a little bit, since they would earn their ordinary profit margins on new enrollment,"" Fiedler said. But ""those effects will be small relative to the amounts of money involved."" The Affordable Care Act also includes a provision that stops insurers from profiting too much from marketplace plan premiums, said Linda Blumberg, a fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. And increases in enrollment would also come with a boost in medical claims. Both Blumberg and Fiedler said framing the proposal to extend the subsidies as padding insurers’ profits is misleading. American Commitment’s ad claims that Manchin and AARP support ""price-setting schemes"" that will divert funds meant for Medicare to ""spend on unrelated government programs or pad big insurers’ profits."" As noted  by the experts we consulted, the ad is not accurate. The Medicare drug pricing plan results in savings, not the diversion of funds from the Medicare program. The ad also distorts the fact that those funds would be used to support other initiatives — in this case, the Affordable Care Act subsidies. It’s not an underhanded conspiracy but a regular part of the reconciliation process. Additionally, if the plan comes to fruition and ACA subsidies are extended, insurance companies are unlikely to reap big profits.
