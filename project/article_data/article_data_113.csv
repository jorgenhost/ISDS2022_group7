Indiana governor right to gloat about union jobs success
","If you watched more than an inning of the 2017 World Series, you probably saw an unusual ad from the re-election campaign of Gov. Bruce Rauner. Titled ""Thanks, Mike!,"" the 30-second spot features the governors of Missouri, Wisconsin and Indiana extolling the economic success of their states and ""thanking"" Rauner’s arch political rival, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, for thwarting Rauner’s reform agenda during the Republican’s first term. Rauner doesn’t appear in the ad. Instead, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, all Republicans, look into the camera and boast of their states’ economic gains, which they attribute to policies enacted by Madigan (""raising Illinois’ taxes,"" says Walker) or prevented by him (""blocking Rauner’s reforms,"" says Greitens). The most specific claim comes from Holcomb of Indiana: ""We’re growing union jobs faster than Illinois."" Given Indiana’s status as a ""right-to-work"" state that bans compulsory union membership and Illinois’ status as one of the most union-friendly states in the nation, Holcomb’s statement invites a closer look. The Rauner campaign said Holcomb’s claim is based on a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report from January 2017 on union employment and membership. The report shows that from 2015 to 2016 -- the first two years Rauner was in office -- workers represented by unions in Indiana grew from 319,000 to 335,000, an increase of 5 percent. During that same time, workers represented by unions in Illinois fell by 4 percent, from 892,000 to 856,000. The difference between the two states is all the more striking when considered against Illinois’ longstanding reputation as a union stronghold. The report notes that Illinois is among a handful of states that account for most of the union membership in the nation: Over half of the 14.6 million union members in the U.S. lived in just 7 states (California, 2.6 million; New York, 1.9 million; Illinois, 0.8 million; Pennsylvania, 0.7 million; and Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio, 0.6 million each), though these states accounted for only about one-third of wage and salary employment nationally. Illinois’ 2015-16 union numbers are no statistical fluke. Even before the Great Recession, Illinois had been losing union jobs at a faster clip than its neighbor to the east. From 2006-07, the number of workers represented by unions in Illinois fell from 979,000 to 884,000, a decrease of nearly 10 percent. Indiana’s union job losses in that period were less than 1 percent -- from 334,000 to 333,000. Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., who tracks Midwest job trends, says the pattern bucks conventional wisdom. ""In 2006-07, in the wake of the very difficult manufacturing employment period, Illinois and Indiana shed both public and private union jobs,"" Hicks said in an email. ""But Indiana was holding on better, when it should not have because we are a more manufacturing intensive state (and private sector unions are more tied to manufacturing)."" Greater Chicago’s large and diverse economy should have provided a buffer for the state’s overall jobs picture, but that hasn’t happened, Hicks said. ""In the most recent data, Indiana is well outperforming Illinois in both private and public sector union job growth. Given the very large agglomeration economy that is Chicago, this should not be the case,"" Hicks said. Unemployment figures over the past decade also attest to Illinois’ job struggles relative to Indiana. While both hit peak unemployment in January 2010 -- Illinois at 11.2 percent, Indiana at 10.9 percent -- Indiana’s post-recession recovery has been significantly stronger. Indiana ended 2016 with 4 percent unemployment while Illinois was at 5.7 percent. The most recent figures, from September, have Indiana at 3.8 percent and Illinois at 5 percent. This leads to the big question about the ad: Does the speaker of the Illinois House -- who also happens to be chairman of the Democratic Party of Illinois -- deserve the thanks of Govs. Greitens, Walker and Holcomb? Have policies driven by a Democrat-led General Assembly caused Illinois’ economic woes? Hicks is neither dismissive nor completely accepting of the governors’ claims. ""While I am not ready to say with scientific certainty that the budget and pension crises facing Illinois are the sole reason for lagging job growth,"" Hicks said, ""the uncertainty about future tax rates and the risk of interrupted public services must surely be playing a role in Illinois’ poorer than expected economic performance in the post-recessionary period."" Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said Indiana is ""growing union jobs faster than Illinois."" The latest report on union membership and representation from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics backs Holcomb’s claim, with Illinois losing 5 percent of its union jobs between 2015 and 2016 and Indiana gaining 4 percent. It’s a trend that predates the Great Recession and, in the bigger jobs picture, is backed by a decade’s worth of unemployment figures in the two states.

Seb Gorka misquotes Jake Tapper's comment about 'Allahu Akbar'
","In an interview on Fox News, former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka mischaracterized a statement CNN’s Jake Tapper made about the Arabic exclamation ""Allahu Akbar"" during coverage of a terrorist attack in New York. Gorka appeared on Sean Hannity’s Nov. 1 show to discuss the Oct. 31 attack, when 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov allegedly drove a truck into a crowd of bicyclists and pedestrians in Manhattan. Eight people were killed and another 12 were injured. Saipov is believed to have been influenced by the terrorist group known as ISIS, or the Islamic State. Eyewitnesses said they saw Saipov shouting ""Allahu Akbar,"" a common Muslim phrase that affirms faith. Hannity and Gorka, along with former Milwaukee County, Wis., sheriff David Clarke, were discussing Tapper’s coverage the day of the attack. ""I’m still trying to struggle with what kind of mind goes on live television as seven bodies are on the streets of Manhattan, and a child, and talks about the ‘beautiful phrase’ Allahu Akbar,"" Gorka said. ""Where does that motivation come from for Jake Tapper?"" But that’s not what Tapper said. During The Lead on Oct. 31, CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz told Tapper about witnesses hearing Saipov shout the phrase.   ""The Arabic chant Allahu Akbar, ‘God is great,’ sometimes said under the most beautiful of circumstances, and too often we hear it being said in moments like this,"" Tapper said as an explanation. Tapper clearly is saying that ""Allahu Akbar"" is often said during joyous occasions, not implying that a terrorist’s use of the phrase is somehow a good thing. Fox News’ Jason Chaffetz pointed out Tapper said ""how beautiful the phrase ‘Allahu Akbar’ can be,"" but later walked back his comments. Conservative website DailyCaller.com also criticized Tapper, then updated their story. The CNN anchor refuted Fox News’ coverage of his coverage on Twitter on Nov 1. ""Fox News is lying. I said it can be said at beautiful moments (wedding, birth) and too often at times like this (horrific terrorist attack),"" he wrote in a thread about a tweet to the Chaffetz clip that Fox News later deleted. ""‘Allahu Akbar’ is a prayer; if we don’t understand how radical Islamic terrorists justify their evil using religion, West cannot defeat it."" Fox News is lying. I said it can be said at beautiful moments (wedding, birth) and too often at times like this (horrific terrorist attack). https://t.co/rQx3r0za6I Tapper responded to Gorka by tweeting, ""And, no surprise, @SebGorka lies as well, claiming i said Allahu Akbar was a ""beautiful phrase."" Never said it, Sebastian. Blatant lie."" And, no surprise, @SebGorka lies as well, claiming i said Allahu Akbar was a ""beautiful phrase."" Never said it, Sebastian. Blatant lie. https://t.co/Q183XgwXOC Tapper had no further comment to add when we reached out to him. Gorka did not respond to our attempts to contact him. The Council on American-Islamic Relations pointed us to a Nov. 1 opinion piece on CNN.com explaining the phrase. Imam Omar Suleiman, the founder and president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, wrote that ""the words ‘Allahu Akbar’ simply mean ‘God is greater.’ It is a powerful declaration used by Muslims on many occasions and in many prayers. It is a celebration of life, the first words fathers whisper in the ears of their newborns."" ""They are used to indicate gratitude when God bestows something upon you that you would have been incapable of attaining were it not for divine benevolence. It is a prayerful phrase that reminds us that, no matter what our concerns may be, God is greater than them."" Suleiman also pointed out that U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had said on Fox News in 2013 that while ""Allahu Akbar"" has been appropriated by radical Islamists as a battlecry, the words themselves aren’t to be feared. ""McCain said the phrase is no more troubling than a Christian saying ‘Thank God,’ "" Suleiman noted. Gorka claimed Tapper said Allahu Akbar was a ""beautiful phrase."" What Tapper actually said was that the phrase is used ""under the most beautiful of circumstances"" by Muslims, and not just by radicals committing terrorist acts.

Diversity visa applicants are vetted, despite contrary claim from White House press secretary
","White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that immigrants coming to the United States through the diversity visa program are not vetted before their arrival. Her remarks came a day after a terrorist attack in New York City left eight people dead and about a dozen injured. President Donald Trump said the suspect came to the country via the diversity visa program, which allows up to 50,000 people a year from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Program participants are selected through a random, computer-generated lottery. ""One of the best things that we have in this country is the fact that everybody wants to be here, and to give that away randomly, to have no vetting system, to have no way to determine who comes, why they are here and if they want to contribute to society is a problem,"" Sanders said in a Nov. 1 press briefing. Sanders said that ""to try to argue that this is a system that thoroughly vets people shows a total lack of understanding"" of the process. There have been concerns expressed over the years whether the government’s system of vetting is enough. Yet despite Sanders’ suggestion of no vetting, we found that diversity visa applicants must undergo background checks, security screenings and interviews before coming to the United States. The State Department administers the diversity immigrant visa program, created through a bill signed into law by former President George H. W. Bush in November 1990. An annual random lottery system, which began in 1995, selects applicants from countries that had low levels of immigration in the previous five years. Millions of people apply each year, but only up to 50,000 are granted visas annually. Entries chosen in the lottery do not automatically get a visa, they only become eligible to apply and must meet ""simple but strict eligibility requirements,"" according to the State Department. Information reviewed includes passport, police and medical records, photographs, English translations of documents, and education or work experience credentials. The diversity visa program isn’t known to be a common U.S. entry tool for terrorists, but there’s been at least one other terrorism-related arrest of someone who came through the program. Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, an Uzbekistan citizen entered on a green card through the diversity lottery, according to the libertarian Cato Institute. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to the terrorist organization ISIS. (He had talked of carrying out violence, though no attack actually occurred.) He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Oct. 27. Earlier, in 2004, Anne Patterson, then the State Department’s Deputy Inspector General, raised concerns about people from countries deemed state sponsors of terrorism. Such individuals couldn’t receive tourist visas, for example, yet they were still eligible for the visa diversity lottery. In congressional testimony, she noted the many ways that diversity visa applicants are screened. ""Consular officers interview all diversity visa winners and check police and medical records once applicants begin the actual visa application process,"" Patterson said. Opponents of the program point to difficulties in performing reviews in many of the countries that qualify for the lottery, noted a 2011 Congressional Research Service report. A 2007 U.S. Government Accountability Office study said it ""found no documented evidence"" that diversity visa immigrants from state sponsors of terrorism or other countries posed terrorist or any other threat. But it said that some consular officers in Turkey, where some applications from Iranians were adjudicated, reported it ""was somewhat difficult to verify Iranian identity documents."" The vast majority of Iranian applicants were subject to security advisory opinions (requiring additional in-depth review by multiple federal agencies), but the regional security officer in Ankara ""considered it possible for Iranian intelligence officers to pose as (diversity visa) applicants and not be detected by the post’s security screening if their identity was not already known to U.S. intelligence,"" because the United States does not have a diplomatic presence in Iran, the study said. Even though there are concerns about the program, vetting does exist. ""It’s not like you win the lottery and walk into the United States. You are subject to the same vetting procedures,"" said Anna O. Law, Herbert Kurz chair of Constitutional Rights at CUNY Brooklyn College, who spoke with us for a previous story on the visa program. Sanders said diversity visa immigrants are not vetted. There are concerns about potential vulnerabilities related to the admission of diversity visa immigrants, and there are difficulties in verifying documents of individuals from certain countries. But vetting mechanisms exist, including additional in-depth review of applicants who need additional scrutiny. Not all who are awarded the lottery end up getting a visa, but individuals who do make it to the visa application process must undergo background checks and security screenings.

Mayor says Raleigh spending more on housing than Dix Park
","Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane’s opponent says the City Council isn’t doing enough to sustain and build affordable housing. Her opponent is Charles Francis, a Democrat who called for a runoff election after mayoral candidates failed to get the 50 percent of the vote required to secure a win. McFarlane, who’s unaffiliated, got 48 percent of the vote on Oct. 10. Francis got 36 percent and Republican Paul Fitts got 12 percent. In a televised debate on Oct. 20, Francis suggested the city shouldn’t focus all of its energy on Dix Park when more basic needs go unaddressed. Dix Park is a 308-acre property just south of downtown Raleigh that the city bought from the state in 2014 for $52 million. McFarlane defended the city’s work on Dix Park, as well as the council’s investment in housing – an area where Francis has said Raleigh should be doing more. ""We are spending more on affordable housing than we're spending on Dix Park right now,"" she said. The claim is suspect not only because the city bought Dix Park in 2014 but because Dix Park and affordable housing have shared an identical funding source since summer 2016. The City Council last year raised the property tax rate by two cents – one cent to generate money for affordable housing and the other cent to pay off Dix Park debt. Each cent generated about $5.7 million for its respective purpose in fiscal year 2016-17, which ended this June. The city expects to raise about $6 million for each cause this fiscal year, which ends next June. So, with that said, why did McFarlane claim that the city is paying more for affordable housing than Dix Park? Let’s judge McFarlane on this fiscal year, since she referenced current spending. Paying for Dix Park The city bought the Dix property with the intention of transforming it into a ""destination"" park that downtown residents or workers can walk to and other Wake County residents would want to drive to. The city hopes to inspire locals to participate in the planning process and there have been several events at the property. Francis has criticized McFarlane and other city leaders, saying they seem more enthusiastic about developing Dix Park than fixing roads or putting air conditioning in city gyms. Kate Pearce, the city’s point person for Dix Park, says the city budgeted $300,000 and $307,000, respectively, for ongoing maintenance at the park each of the past two years. Those figures include mowing, landscaping, clean-up and salaries of park staff members, she said. The planning process and most of the programs held on the Dix property to this point have been paid for by Raleigh’s nonprofit partner, the Dix Park Conservancy. The conservancy signed a deal with the city last year promising to pay at least $2 million of the planning effort and may commit up to an additional $1 million for planning-related activities, she said. So let’s recap: This fiscal year, the city expects to spend about $6 million on Dix-related debt and an additional $307,000 for Dix Park maintenance – combining for a total of $6.3 million in spending. What is affordable housing?  First, an explanation: ""affordable housing"" is a blanket term that can refer to anything from living spaces owned or subsidized by the city, county or federal government to homes owned by the private sector for which low-income residents can pay on their own. Wake County uses the term to describe housing that can be bought or rented by people earning less than 60 percent of Wake's annual median income, $78,800, which comes out to $47,280 a year. Roughly 126,000 Wake residents earn less than that, county statistics show. McFarlane referenced city spending on affordable housing. But even that can be complicated to track. Not only does Raleigh spend money it generates on its own, it’s also tasked with spending money it gets from the federal government. City spending Larry Jarvis, director of Raleigh’s housing and neighborhoods department, says it’s hard to compare year-by-year affordable housing spending. For instance, a voter-approved bond referendum in 2011 set aside $16 million for affordable housing with some of the funds subject to annual expenditure and the rest committed to large affordable housing projects that sometimes take three years to actually complete. ""For large tax credit projects like Washington Terrace, local funds are committed or encumbered when the projects are awarded tax credits by the (North Carolina Housing Finance Agency) and then ‘spent’ during construction,"" Jarvis wrote in an email. ""All of the funds have been encumbered for specific affordable housing projects and the funds will be spent as construction progresses."" In fiscal year 2017-18, the city budgeted $7.24 million on affordable housing units or housing-related spending, said Tonya Walton, a senior budget and management analyst for the city. The city will spend another $6 million in federal funds on affordable housing and other community development activities, Jarvis added. Our ruling McFarlane said the city is ""spending more on affordable housing than we're spending on Dix Park right now."" The city’s $52 million purchase of the Dix property was certainly a big one. But the city’s is paying for it incrementally and McFarlane is right that the city this year is spending more on affordable housing – $7.24 million – than it is on Dix Park – $6.3 million.

Florida agency oversells Gov. Rick Scott's role in reducing number of uninsured children
","The vast disruption of Hurricane Irma meant many families risked losing their children’s health insurance coverage due to missed payments. As the board for the state’s children’s health insurance program prepared to meet about this issue, the Agency for Health Care Administration defended Gov. Rick Scott’s record on insuring children. The agency sent out a news release with comment from Secretary Justin Senior before the meeting of Florida Healthy Kids, which operates the KidCare insurance program that provides coverage for children ages 5 through 18. Members discussed the possibility of asking the federal government for a waiver to assist families financially burdened by Hurricane Irma but ended up postponing a decision. Through the agency, the Scott administration said it would work to ensure no children lose their insurance coverage as a result of the hurricane, touting its history of getting kids insured. ""Under Gov. Scott’s leadership, Florida has had much success in lowering the rate of uninsured children,"" the Oct. 25 news release said. We wondered if it was fair for the administration to give Scott credit for decreases in the rate of uninsured children, given his general record against public health care expansion. The agency cited a September 2017 Georgetown Health Policy Institute Center for Children and Families study about children’s health coverage in Florida. According to the report, the uninsured rate has been dropping since before Scott took office in 2011. Florida cut the rate of uninsured children by more than half since 2009. The rate dropped from 14.8 percent in 2009 to 6.2 percent in 2016. That’s a reduction from 601,000 uninsured children to 257,000. There are four sources of public coverage in Florida: the largest is Medicaid (2.2 million), followed by the Children's Health Insurance Program (almost 196,000), CHIP-funded Medicaid (about 145,000) and the federal heath care exchange (about 121,000). The report says Florida’s progress is ""largely a result of public coverage eligibility expansions and improvements for children through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program that began decades ago."" In addition, the report also gives credit to the Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama. Its implementation ""solidified the gains"" and ""accelerated the positive trend for children."" Scott was a persistent critic of Obamacare and flip-flopped on whether to expand the state’s Medicaid eligibility pool under the federal law. Scott’s most recent position in 2015 suggested the state Legislature should not expand Medicaid, saying it would be ""hard to understand how the state could take on even more federal programs."" Mallory McManus, a spokeswoman for the health care agency, said ""the ACA actually did not alter or expand coverages for children."" She noted that Florida, under Scott, reduced its children’s uninsurance rate faster than every other state but one — faster than roughly 30 expansion states. McManus pointed to two strategies to reduce uninsurance taken by the Scott administration: improving the economy and reducing unemployment; and getting kids enrolled in Medicaid who are already eligible for the program — before they get sick or go to the emergency room. But health care experts — including the author of the report the agency cited — all said the federal law likely lowered the rate of uninsured children in Florida. While Medicaid and CHIP eligibility were not technically expanded for children under the ACA, health policy experts said they expected that children would gain coverage due to the new marketplaces, outreach efforts, and the expansion of coverage to parents. ""I think the Affordable Care Act has much more to do with decreasing Florida’s uninsured rate than any actions that have come out of the Legislature and governor’s office,"" said Anne Swerlick, a health policy expert at the Florida Policy Institute, a nonprofit that examines how policy affects the economy. (Swerlick said the the Florida Legislature did implement a provision allowing lawfully residing immigrant children to enroll in Medicaid and CHIP without waiting five years, which the Georgetown study includes.) Joan Alker, who co-authored the Georgetown study, said the ACA has clearly contributed to a sharp decline in the percent of uninsured children in Florida and nationwide.  (Chart via Georgtown study) In 2013, the year before the the federal health care law was implemented, Florida’s uninsured rate for children was 11.1 percent, and by 2016 it had fallen considerable to 6.2 percent, she said. ""The fact that the recent decline in the uninsured rate for Florida children began abruptly in 2014 and coincided with a decline in the uninsured rate among children nationwide is consistent with that view,"" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program. One way the health care law might have helped, which Alker and Fiedler both mentioned, was the ""welcome mat"" effect. ""In general, the outreach efforts and new coverage opportunities of the ACA created a ‘welcome mat’ for children who were already eligible for Medicaid and CHIP but not enrolled,"" Alker said. The ACA also increased the availability of subsidized coverage on the federal health insurance exchange, Fiedler said. He said that children with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid or CHIP are eligible for subsidized coverage through the federal marketplace. As the Georgetown report states, Florida kids are only eligible for Medicaid or CHIP if family income is below 215 percent of the federal poverty level. By contrast, subsidized Marketplace coverage is available to families with incomes as high as 400 percent of the federal poverty level, Fiedler said. And had Florida decided to expand Medicaid under the ACA, experts said that the expansion would likely improve the state’s child uninsured rate because research has shown that when parents are covered more children get covered. For example, the Urban Institute found larger increases in children getting insurance in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, which was also documented in a study that found that Medicaid expansion to parents had a measurable ""welcome mat"" effect on their kids. The state health care agency said, ""Under Gov. Scott’s leadership, Florida has had much success in lowering the rate of uninsured children."" The rate of uninsured children has declined dramatically since 2011. But the decline really was in the works since before Scott’s term, in 2009. Also, this claim leaves out important context in the report as to why there’s been a decline. The report credits the decline to decades of improvements for children in Medicaid and CHIP that have been in the works long before Scott took office. The report also said that the ACA solidified the state’s gain, which Scott opposed. This statement is partially accurate, but gives too much credit to Scott.

The headline added a hallmark of fake news sites looking to engage an audience, asking readers, ""Do you support this?"" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. The same subject came up on other websites, as well. The NewsOfTrump.com post didn’t mention the charges in the headline, but specified in the text that she violated House rules by arranging a 2008 ""meeting between the Treasury Department and representatives of OneUnited bank — where her husband was a notable shareholder."" The post criticized Waters for being corrupt and said OneUnited directly benefitted from her actions. ""As a member of the House Financial Committee, she was able to directly contact then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to speak with him about meeting with minority-owned banks,"" the post read. ""Through her efforts, OneUnited bank was able to obtain $12 million in federal bailout funding to help cover expected losses from the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."" These posts describe real events, when the House ethics committee charged Waters with breaking three rules by allegedly trying to assist OneUnited, in which her husband did hold a sizeable share of stock. But the flap over the OneUnited meeting happened in 2010. Reports surfaced in 2009 that Waters had allegedly helped OneUnited CEO Kevin Cohee secure a meeting to ask for $50 million in bailout funds to recover from the Great Recession, triggering a House ethics investigation. (The bank did get $12 million.) In August 2010, the panel recommended three charges against Waters for violating ethics rules that essentially are supposed to keep members of Congress from making the House look bad. Her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, also was charged. But the posts implied or outright said that Waters is currently facing charges, making it seem as if the House had only now acted on the 2008 meeting. They also don’t mention that the ethics charges against Waters were dropped in 2012. In contentious action between Republican and Democratic members of the committee, a lawyer hired specifically to review the case found that Waters believed she had been acting in the interest of all minority-owned banks, not just OneUnited. She had called for a meeting to help those banks, and ended her involvement when she learned OneUnited was part of the group. Moore was given a letter of reproval for the incident, for not stopping Waters’ involvement once it was clear OneUnited was one of the banks asking for help. Waters is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, which no doubt was what has earned her the attention of fake news purveyors, who typically zero in on political flashpoints. She recently earned criticism for saying she wanted to ""take Trump out"" and called him ""the most dishonorable and despicable human being to ever serve in the office of the president.""

Does California spend ‘nearly 5 times as much’ to build a mile of road as rest of nation?
","It’s not cheap to build anything in California. Land and labor is expensive and the state has some of the strictest environmental permitting rules anywhere. Those factors all drive up the cost of building homes, stores and even roads. Republican candidate for governor John Cox has pledged that, if elected, he’ll hack through California’s thicket of regulations, in an effort to reduce expenses. Specifically, Cox wants to reform the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, an agency he has described as overstaffed and wasteful. Recently, he claimed Caltrans spends an exorbitant amount to build and maintain each mile of roadway compared with other states. ""It costs nearly five times as much in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation,"" Cox said in an interview published on the Political Vanguard website on Oct. 19, 2017. Cox made a similar claim in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed on Oct. 18, 2017: ""California spends 4.7 times the national average for every mile of roadway we build and maintain, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute."" CEI is a libertarian think tank which sourced the statistic to the Reason Foundation, another free market think tank. Following both statements, Cox went on to advocate for greater reliance on private construction to reduce expenses. There’s a debate about why it’s so expensive to build roads in California. But we’re not fact-checking that debate. Instead, we’re zeroing in on Cox’s specific claims that California's road spending is ""nearly five times"" per mile compared with other states. Background on John Cox On his campaign website, Cox describes himself as a ""Jack Kemp-style Republican who grew up on Chicago’s south-side."" Today, he’s a San Diego businessman who ""founded an organization that repairs the homes of low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities."" His priorities, as listed on his website, include lowering California’s taxes and fighting the influence of special interests. Cox is the chairman of Give Voters a Voice, an effort to repeal California’s recent gas tax increase, which was signed into law this year to raise money for road repairs. The increase includes a 12-cent per gallon gasoline tax increase, which went into effect this week. Our research We asked Cox’s campaign for evidence supporting his claims. It pointed to recent reports by the Reason Foundation, which studies transportation spending. In 2013, the foundation published its ""20th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems."" That report shows California spent nearly $680,000 per mile in 2009 on roadways. That was 4.7 times as much as the national average of approximately $144,000 per mile spent in other states. That matches Cox’s claim of ""nearly five times"" as much. But our research shows, and Cox’s campaign has acknowledged, the information from 2009 is outdated. An updated 2016 Reason Foundation study shows California spent about $420,000 per mile in 2013 compared with the national average spending of about $160,000 per mile in the same year. That data places California’s spending at about 2.5 times the national average, far less than Cox’s claims. We asked Cox’s staff about the discrepancy. David Kersten, a policy analyst with the campaign, said the candidate didn’t have the most up-to-date figures. ""When he wrote that (San Francisco Chronicle) op-ed, he didn’t have that new number,"" Kersten told us in an interview. ""Everybody was using the older report."" Matt Shupe, Cox’s campaign spokesman, said he and Kersten would update Cox on the new figure and use it in future statements. High admin costs Cox’s staff noted that one category of California’s road spending, administrative costs, totals nearly five times as much the national average, even in the 2016 report. We checked and the report does show that, though Cox’s staffers acknowledged that’s not the same statement the candidate made in the op-ed or in his Political Vanguard interview and at the center of this fact check. Caltrans, the agency targeted by Cox, disagrees with the methodology of the Reason Foundation studies. A Caltrans spokesman said much of the studies’ roadway data is from local streets and roads not built or maintained by the state. The spokesman also noted that California’s state roadways are larger and more congested than in other states, making them more expensive to build and maintain. Representatives for the Reason Foundation did not respond to our interview requests. Our ruling Republican candidate for governor John Cox recently claimed it costs ""nearly five times as much"" in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation. A study using 2009 data shows California spent 4.7 times as much per mile as the national average on roads. Updated data from 2013 shows the state’s spending still far above the national average at about 2.5 times the cost per mile, but far lower than Cox’s figure. Cox’s campaign staff told us the candidate relied on outdated information and would be updating this figure in future statements. While the candidate’s larger point about higher road spending in California appears to be correct, his specific claim about it being ""nearly five times"" as much per mile is outdated and wrong.

Is diversity visa program a 'Schumer beauty,' as Donald Trump says?
","The morning after a vehicular terrorist attack in New York City killed at least eight people and injured a dozen others, President Donald Trump blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose constituents were among the casualties. Trump on Nov. 1 tweeted, ""The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based."" The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ""Diversity Visa Lottery Program,"" a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based. Hours later at a news conference, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Trump’s tweet was ""not helpful"" and ""wasn’t even accurate as far as I’m concerned, about the bipartisan law that was passed."" What do the facts really show? It was misleading of Trump to fully place the lottery program on Schumer’s shoulders. He did sponsor immigration legislation that contained the lottery system. But Trump's tweet ignores the support the measure earned from Republicans as well as Schumer’s more recent actions to rescind the lottery. Trump said the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, entered the United States from Uzbekistan under the diversity visa program. The roots of the diversity visa program stem from consequences of a landmark overhaul in 1965 that led to large numbers of immigrants from Asia and Latin America. It moved from a country-by-country quota system to neutral country-of-origin selection criteria for green cards. By the late 1970s and 1980s, a large group of Irish nationals, primarily on the eastern seaboard, had arrived on temporary visas and overstayed, remaining illegally in the country. Irish-American and Italian-American members of Congress joined forces to pass the Immigration Act of 1990, creating a system that would effectively help distant Irish and Italian relatives of those immigrants come to the United States and live permanently and legally. ""This lottery was created for Irish and Italians by Irish and Italian Americans, but after a while the beneficiaries lost interest in it,"" said Anna O. Law, Herbert Kurz Chair of Constitutional Rights at CUNY Brooklyn College. ""The countries that are very enthusiastic about the program are in Africa."" An annual random lottery system began selecting applicants in 1995 from countries that had low immigration levels in the previous five years, with a cap of 55,000 immigrant visas a year to recipients who meet education or work requirements.  The cap is now 50,000, after Congress decided to allocate 5,000 of the 55,000 annual visas to people eligible for the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act program. Trump wants to eliminate the diversity visa program and shift to a merit-based immigration system. Schumer was involved in the program’s creation. But there’s more to the legislative story. Enacting a diversity lottery had a long and winding road in Congress. It was driven by Democrats but earned Republican votes from many recognizable names today. The White House pointed us to a bill -- H.R. 4165 -- that was introduced on March 1, 1990, when Schumer was serving in the House. Schumer was the lead sponsor of the bill, which had many provisions, including language on diversity visas. That bill received hearings in the House but was eventually rolled into another bill, H.R. 4300. The Democratic-controlled House passed the bill on Oct. 3, 1990, by a margin of 231-192. By party, Democrats supported it 186-65, while Republicans went 47-127. Schumer voted yes -- along with four other Republicans still serving in the House. The four were Dana Rohrabacher of California, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Chris Smith of New Jersey and Don Young of Alaska. Another yes vote came from future Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a frequent Trump ally. Meanwhile, the Senate pursued a companion bill -- S. 358 -- that included the diversity lottery provision, sponsored by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. On Oct. 26, 1990, the Democratic-controlled Senate approved a conference report -- a version of the bill to be taken up in both chambers with identical language -- by an 89-8 margin. Republicans who supported the measure included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who was then a first-termer, and current Republican Sens. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Orrin Hatch of Utah, John McCain of Arizona, and Richard Shelby of Alabama (who was then a Democrat). In addition, Trump’s director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, voted for the conference report. The House approved the conference report the following day, by a 264-118 margin. This time, a majority of House Republicans voted for the measure, 93-64. The Republican yes votes included Rohrabacher and Ros-Lehtinen, along with two other GOP lawmakers still serving, Joe Barton of Texas and Fred Upton of Michigan. The House passage sent the measure to the desk of President George H.W. Bush. On Nov. 29, 1990, Bush signed it, saying he was ""pleased"" to do so. ""This act recognizes the fundamental importance and historic contributions of immigrants to our country,"" Bush said upon signing the bill. ""Most members of Congress wanted mainly to increase the number of European immigrants, whom they felt were underrepresented in modern U.S. immigration,"" said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""As it turned out, the overwhelming majority of diversity visas have gone to Europeans and Africans in roughly equal numbers, far more than to immigrants from any other continents."" Whatever responsibility you attribute the program's existence to Schumer, Trump’s tweet ignores his more recent efforts to eliminate the program. During the 2013 effort to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul, Schumer was one of the bipartisan ""gang of eight"" that negotiated a bill that, among other things, would have eliminated the diversity lottery. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who also belonged to the ""gang of eight,"" replied to Trump’s tweet by offering his support for Schumer. ""Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms. I know, I was there,"" Flake tweeted. Actually, the Gang of 8, including @SenSchumer, did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms. I know, I was there https://t.co/QQFJzPyRzC That bill passed the Senate, 68-32, but it died when members who support low levels of immigration, predominantly Republicans, prevented any action in the GOP-controlled House. Trump said the diversity visa lottery program is ""a Chuck Schumer beauty."" Schumer did introduce legislation, 27 years ago, that included initial language establishing the diversity visa lottery. However, Schumer was hardly the only politician with a role in its passage. The bill was signed by a Republican president, and the final version of the legislation received majority Republican support in both chambers of Congress, In fact, McConnell and several other Republicans still in office voted for the bill. Moreover, Trump’s tweet ignores that Schumer, just four years ago, worked to pass a bill that would have ended the lottery, but it died due to Republican opposition in the House.

Did activists representing majority of Republican voters call for changes in Texas House leadership?
","Before Texas House Speaker Joe Straus revealed he won’t seek re-election in 2018, a group declared that activists accounting for more than half the state’s Republican electorate had called for House leaders to skedaddle. The New Leadership PAC introduced itself in an October 2017 press release stating: ""NLP is the culmination of discussions among a growing movement of organizations, leaders and voters across the state. Evidence of the need for NLP is illustrated by the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 (and growing) of Republican party county chapters that together represent over 50 percent of Texas Republican voters."" Voters might question whether party honchos automatically represent their wishes. Still, we wondered if resolutions demanding changes won widespread adoption as described. The PAC's release didn’t single out House leaders by name. But the PAC’s treasurer, Don Dyer of Austin, responded to our request for factual backup by emailing an undated document listing 56 of the state’s 254 counties under the headline, ""Texas County GOP’s Voting to Oust Straus,"" the San Antonio Republican in his record-tying fifth two-year stint as speaker. House members fill the gavel-wielding leadership post from among themselves at the start of each regular legislative session. We unsuccessfully sought more information from Dyer, who told us whoever composed the list didn’t want to be identified. Dyer also didn’t provide copies of the referenced resolutions or the details of each proclaimed action. Independent verification We started our independent look into this claim by asking the Republican Party of Texas about such actions by local parties. By email, spokesman Jamie Bennett replied that county parties ""act autonomously and are not required to submit resolutions to the state party. Therefore, I do have any list of all relevant resolutions. The best way to get that info would be to contact county chairs individually."" We didn’t have the resources to check all the counties listed by Dyer. But our reporting--based on interviews of local party officials plus news stories and web posts by county parties and Empower Texans, a group long intent on banishing Straus for his resistance to its agenda--showed that anti-Straus resolutions were approved by executive committees of Republican parties in 19 counties including the eight counties accounting for the greatest numerical turnouts in the state’s latest GOP primary, in March 2016: Harris, Tarrant, Dallas, Bexar, Collin, Denton, Montgomery and Travis counties. Also, you can make a case that the 19 parties represent more than half the state’s Republicans. That is, state-posted election returns show the 1,498,383 people who voted for president in those counties comprised 53 percent of the 2,836,488 Texans who voted for president in the party's statewide primary. About 1.4 million Texans voted in the Texas Democratic presidential primary. County-by-county confirmations We turned next to confirming individual adoptions of anti-Straus resolutions. In July 2017, Bexar County Republicans led the way by adopting a resolution by 36-28 calling for ""a change in leadership in the Texas House speakership."" That happened, in Straus's home county, just before lawmakers began a special session on 20 topics designated by Gov. Greg Abbott including Abbott’s desire, successfully resisted by Straus, for a public-school bathroom law targeting transgender people. Like others, the Bexar County resolution says the House’s leadership should change due to Straus’s failure to support the party’s platform. The latest platform, adopted by Texas GOP activists in 2016, spells out positions that nominees are expected to champion--among them, an end to the direct election of U.S. senators; abolition of about 10 federal agencies; passage of federal legislation remanding all authority over abortion to individual states--and, at the state level, ""enactment of legislation addressing individuals’ use of bathrooms, showers and locker rooms that correspond with their biologically determined sex."" In a phone message, Ruth Pharis of the Comal County Republican Party confirmed that its executive committee on July 20, 2017 approved a resolution supporting a change in the House speaker. Hood County Republicans similarly acted before the special session, according to a memo from Jim Logan, the county party’s chairman. ""Even though many pieces of legislation have been put forward that are in line with the Republican Party of Texas platform,"" the resolution says, ""Speaker Straus has failed to get them through the Texas House... We have no confidence going forward that he will adequately support the direction outlined by the platform and new leadership needs to be installed to effectively represent the will of the Republican Party of Texas voters and their platform."" GOP leaders in Smith County likewise approved a resolution, though the Tyler Morning Telegraph quoted Brent Thompson, the county party’s chair, calling the move ""symbolic"" and saying the resolution ""isn’t going to accomplish anything more than show Speaker Straus where we stand."" An August 2017 Empower Texans web post says Liberty County Republicans that month approved a ""no confidence"" resolution calling for Straus to be censured by the state party’s executive committee for ""his dismal failure to support"" the party’s ""core principles."" The resolution also contains passages suggesting Straus bends to Democratic wishes. Straus, unsaid, gained momentum as an aspirant for House speaker in 2009 thanks to backing from House Democrats and a few Republican House members. On Aug. 7, 2017, Collin County Republicans voted 40-13 for a resolution in favor of House Republicans alone choosing the House speaker at the start of the 2019 regular session, Neal Katz, the county party’s executive director, told us by phone. On Aug. 17, 2017, the executive committee of the Denton County Republican Party approved a ""no confidence"" resolution demanding that ""our elected officials in the Texas House withdraw support"" from Straus. ""We believe that it is time for new leadership in the House in order to effectively represent the will of Texas voters,"" the resolution says. Montgomery County Republican Party leaders acted similarly by a 33-11 vote, according to an account in the Golden Hammer, a local publication. Wally Wilkerson, the county party’s chairman, told us by phone the vote took place with most of the local party’s 90 executive committee members not present. Wilkerson, who’s chaired the local party since 1964, credited conservative activists. ""Core elements of both parties have to have a bogeyman,"" Wilkerson said. Separately, Galveston County Republican Party leaders voted 14-2 to adopt a no-confidence resolution about Straus, Empower Texans reported while party leaders in Tom Green County adopted a resolution telling the county’s House member to ""work to install"" a speaker who’ll advance party platform directives, Jeff Betty, the county party’s chairman, told us by email. Also in August 2017, Republican precinct chairs in Hidalgo County voted in a straw poll by 20-0, with seven abstentions, to condemn Straus, according to a Rio Grande Guardian news story, though no resolution was taken up. The story quoted Jim Barnes, a tea-party activist, calling Straus an ""embedded Democrat."" Kaufman County Republicans approved a resolution calling for Straus to be removed as speaker for not heeding core platform principles, that party’s chairman, Jimmy Weaver, confirmed by phone. In a phone message, Marty Rhymes of the Gregg County Republican Party said its leaders approved an anti-Straus resolution. ""We’re definitely excited he’s not going to run"" again, Rhymes said. Also that month, Dallas County Republicans approved a resolution expressing ""no confidence"" in Straus, Ashley Moretti, the county party’s executive director, confirmed by email. On Sept. 25, 2017, the executive committee of the Harris County Republican Party approved--without a voiced dissent, party spokesman Vlad Davidiuk told us by phone--a resolution charging Straus with constantly obstructing the party’s platform, ""resulting in a vast and deep disappointment among conservative grassroots voters."" Also noted in the resolution: Straus referring in June 2017 to Abbott’s special-session topics as ""horse manure."" Straus, the resolution says, ""has consistently killed conservative legislation, advanced liberal bills and remains beholden to special interests. It is a demonstrable fact that Texas House Republicans will pass conservative bills if those bills ever get a ‘floor’ vote. The Speaker has consistently packed his committee chair assignments with Democrats and liberal Republicans in an effort to deliberately stall and kill conservative legislation,"" the resolution says. Separately, Tarrant County Republicans adopted a call to choose a different speaker ""that will be fair and apply the rules equitably to all members of the House on all bills,"" the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Also that month, Randall County Republican Party precinct leaders voted to tell local House members to vote against Straus for speaker, the Amarillo Globe News reported. And by a show of hands, precinct chairs for the Travis County Republican Party approved a resolution Sept. 12, 2017 calling for a change in the House speaker due to Straus’s ""non-support"" of the party platform, the county party says on its website. The resolution said Straus had ""consistently denied the House the opportunity to act decisively upon conservative policies supported by Texas voters."" On Sept. 18, 2017, party leaders in Guadalupe County endorsed a resolution recommending that Straus be censured by the state party’s executive committee ""for his dismal failure to support"" the platform’s ""core principles,"" Karen Hale of the county party told us by email. In Williamson County, in contrast, party leaders rejected an anti-Straus resolution by 31-14, the party’s chairman, Bill Fairbrother, advised by phone. Fairbrother recalled debate about whether the move would hurt the county among lawmakers. Fairbrother said of Straus, ""There’s a lot of respect for him here."" We queried Jason Embry, a Straus spokesman, about the PAC's claim. Embry replied with an email expressing Straus’s gratitude for support from ""mainstream Republicans."" The email didn’t touch on resolutions adopted by leaders of county parties. Our ruling The PAC said county parties representing more than half the state’s Republican voters approved resolutions demanding changes in House leadership. The group fell short of proving its claim. But we identified 19 counties, arguably accounting for more than half the voters in the state’s 2016 Republican presidential primary, where local party leaders approved calls this year for Speaker Straus to go.

Koch-backed group is Half True in claiming Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes
","It seems Charles and David Koch, the conservative billionaire industrialists, want to make U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin the $5 trillion woman. At least, that’s the aim of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the political and policy network that’s tied to the two brothers. On Oct. 26, 2017, a year out from the 2018 election, Freedom Partners attacked Baldwin with two TV ads. Using both a narrator and words on the screen, the two ads make this claim about the Wisconsin Democrat: ""Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes."" The claim gives no context, leaving it to the viewer to wonder whether her vote was for a one-year $5 trillion tax hike. So, let’s investigate. The group Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, also known simply as Freedom Partners, is a group based outside of Washington, D.C.. It says it will spend $1.6 million on the two TV ads, as well as digital versions. Baldwin is up for re-election to a second term in the November 2018 election. So far, two Republicans -- political newcomer Kevin Nicholson and Leah Vukmir, a state senator -- have launched campaigns to be the GOP nominee. In the 2016 Wisconsin Senate race, an affiliated group, Freedom Partners Action Fund, said it spent $2 million on a TV ad attacking Democrat Russ Feingold over veterans care. Feingold lost to incumbent Republican Ron Johnson, who won a second term. Now to the new ads. Baldwin’s vote The ads include a footnote making it clear that the $5 trillion claim is based on Baldwin’s vote, in April 2011, for a fiscal 2012 federal budget proposed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. At the time, Baldwin was representing the Madison area in the House and was a vice-chair of the caucus. The caucus says it ""seeks to give voice to the needs and aspirations of all Americans and to build a more just and humane society."" The caucus’ proposed budget was an alternative to federal budgets proposed by President Barack Obama and House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the current House speaker. It was introduced as an amendment to Ryan’s budget and failed in the House, 347-77. The caucus’ budget called for $3.9 trillion in actual tax increases over the next decade, such as raising income tax rates on millionaires and raising rates on the estate tax. However, it could also be argued that other measures in the budget, such as allowing tax cuts adopted under President George W. Bush to expire, also were tax increases. The budget also outlined $1.7 trillion in spending cuts, largely from defense, as well as $1.7 trillion in ""public investments"" in areas such as education, transportation and infrastructure. An important point here: As we have stated in past fact checks, voting for something as massive as a federal budget and its countless provisions doesn’t mean a lawmaker supports every provision. Lawmakers who voted for the caucus budget might have been motivated, for example, by its defense cuts or new spending, rather than any or all of the tax increases. At the same time, the amount of revenue to be collected in taxes is a major feature of any budget, as it helps set spending parameters. The ads The ads include a footnote that cites a PolitiFact Wisconsin fact check. It rated a different claim -- that Baldwin voted for a budget that included ""trillions more"" in spending than the Obama budget. That fact check said that, according to experts, the caucus budget would have raised taxes by some $5 trillion more than Obama’s budget. We have since clarified that reference to make it consistent with an earlier fact check. In that earlier item, experts had told us that total tax collections in the caucus budget would be $5 trillion higher than in the Obama budget. Tax collections can rise for any number of reasons -- from tax increases, yes, but also factors such as growth in the economy. Our rating Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce says: ""Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes."" Baldwin voted for a 2012 federal budget that would have raised taxes by $3.9 trillion over 10 years, but it also would have made $1.7 trillion in spending cuts and spent $1.7 trillion in areas such as infrastructure. Voting for the budget didn’t mean that Baldwin necessarily supported all of the tax increases. There were estimates that total tax collections -- another possible measure of ""higher taxes,"" as stated in the ad -- under budget Baldwin voted for would have been $5 trillion higher than under the budget proposed by the Obama administration. But the ad didn’t make clear that that amount was over a 10-year span, not a sudden increase. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2017/nov/01/freedom-partners/koch-backed-group-half-true-claiming-tammy-baldwin/

No data to support claim that HIV/AIDS has spiked due to fentanyl and heroin use
","Democratic Sen. Edward J. Markey said that the Trump administration’s plan to use funds from HIV and AIDS programs to fight the opioid addiction crisis is unsound. Specifically, the Massachusetts senator said that increased opioid abuse has led to an increase in HIV and AIDS. The administration’s Oct. 26 declaration of the opioid epidemic as a national public health emergency allows flexibility in the use of resources in HIV and AIDS programs to allow people eligible for those programs to get substance abuse treatment. ""The administration’s proposal to reallocate funding from HIV/AIDS programs to the opioid crisis is robbing Peter to pay Paul, especially as HIV and AIDS rates spike due to increased heroin and fentanyl use,"" Markey said in an Oct. 26 statement. We wanted to know if increased use of heroin and fentanyl have led to increased rates of HIV and AIDS. We found some truth to Markey’s claim but not enough national data to fully back it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us it does not have data specific to heroin and fentanyl, and estimates that HIV and AIDs diagnoses have declined in recent years among people who inject drugs. Still, there are risks associated with opioid injections and HIV transmissions, as was the case in an Indiana county. More than 64,000 people died in 2016 from drug overdoses, the majority linked to opioids, which include the synthetic opioid fentanyl and the illicit drug heroin, according to the CDC. Increased availability, a relatively low price and the high purity of heroin in the United States are driving increased use of heroin, the CDC said. Fentanyl use, including illicitly-made fentanyl, has also increased in recent years. People who inject drugs are at risk for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through used needles and syringes. Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is most commonly acquired or transmitted through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. If not treated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The CDC’s HIV Surveillance Report, 2015, noted that HIV and AIDS diagnoses tied to injection drug use declined from 2010 to 2015. The report did not specify diagnoses by types of drugs injected. From 2008 to 2014, estimated annual HIV infections among people who inject drugs declined 56 percent (from 3,900 to 1,700), according to February 2017 data from the CDC. That report did not include AIDS data. Experts we reached said they were not aware of reports showing a national spike in HIV and AIDS among injection drug users, but noted that data collection and reporting tends to lag. ""It is very possible that increased HIV transmission due to fentanyl and/or heroin use is occurring"" but have not yet been identified through HIV testing and screening or have not yet been reported to CDC, said Brandon Marshall, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. When we contacted Markey’s office, they highlighted reports about HIV spikes in Scott County. Scott County historically had fewer than five cases of HIV infection reported annually, CDC reported. By April 21, 2015, Indiana officials had diagnosed HIV in 135 people in a small community within Scott County. Most of them reported injection drug use with oxymorphone as their drug of choice, said CDC’s May 2015 report, adding that some reported injecting heroin. Since early 2015, at least 191 people had tested positive for HIV in Scott County, the Indiana State Department of Health said in April 2016.

Radio host Joyce Kaufman claims candidate Obama said he'd tote a gun
","All that talk about complicated matters such as Social Security and deficits and tax brackets can get a little wonky in the midst of campaigns and the post-election season. So it's not that unusual for a candidate, a politician -- or a talk show host -- to hammer home a point with a touch of violent rhetoric.

And when a political figure mixes talk about elections or policy with words about war, battles or weapons, it certainly draws attention -- and sometimes controversy. We'll walk you through such a controversy that involves three political figures -- a Democratic president, a conservative South Florida talk show host, and a fiery talking newly elected Republican congressman -- and a slew of words that relate to violence (bullets, guns, knives). And we'll mix in a popular movie.

Joyce Kaufman, a South Florida conservative radio talk show host on WFTL-850 AM, garnered national attention after newly elected U.S. Rep. Allen West hired her as his chief of staff a week after the Nov. 2, 2010, election. West is the Republican who ousted U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, the two-term Democrat who represents Congressional District 22, which spans parts of coastal and suburban Broward and Palm Beach counties.

On Nov. 9, the day after West announced he had hired Kaufman, MSNBC liberal commentator Rachel Maddow's 9 p.m. show had a piece that included a clip of Kaufman at a July 3, 2010, rally in Broward County in which she said:

""I don’t care how this gets painted by the mainstream media, I don’t care if this shows up on YouTube, because I am convinced that the most important thing the Founding Fathers did to ensure me my First Amendment rights was they gave me a Second Amendment. And if ballots don’t work, bullets will."" The Second Amendment, remember, is the right to keep and bear arms.

Early in the morning Nov. 10, someone sent an e-mail to Kaufman that stated: ""I'm planning something big around the government building here in Broward County, maybe a post office, maybe even a school. ..."" The threat led to a lockdown of Broward schools Nov. 10 and an FBI investigation that remains open.

By Nov. 11, Kaufman announced that she was stepping down from her chief of staff post because she didn't want to tarnish West. She took to the airwaves to discuss her decision, her vows to take out other Democrats in Congress, and to bash the media. On her radio show Nov. 12, Kaufman suggested she isn't the only political player to use rhetoric that some could interpret as inciting violence. ""Nobody has played clips over and over again on the FOX (News network), which is supposed to be fair and balanced, of President (Barack) Obama said, 'If they bring a knife to the fight, we'll bring a gun,' "" Kaufman said. ""I've never heard that clip played. We all know it was said. Did the cow play that? No. Of course not. Because we knew what he meant. These are metaphors, these are ways of stating in large terms simple facts. President Obama was saying if they try to fight us and pick at us with amendments we will come at them with legislation. And that's what he did. I knew that’s what he meant.""

For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to check Kaufman's claim that Obama said ""If they bring a knife to the fight, we'll bring a gun."" We'll also explain the cow reference.

A simple Google search of the words ""Barack Obama"", ""knife"" and ""gun"" turned up several hits. A June 14, 2008, article from Politico stated that Republicans were pouncing on this comment from Obama reported by the press pool:

"" 'If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun,' Obama said in Philadelphia last night. 'Because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl. I’ve seen Eagles fans.' "" We found the same quote June 14, 2008, in the Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire blog.

Obama was quoting from the 1987 movie The Untouchables about gangster Al Capone (played by Robert De Niro) and the efforts of government agent Eliot Ness (played by Kevin Costner) to bring down Capone during Prohibition in Chicago. The trailer on YouTube contains the quote that Obama borrowed -- muttered by actor Sean Connery playing cop Jimmy Malone -- in a sinister voice: ""You want to get Capone? Here is how you get him. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That is the Chicago way.""

We also found a June 23, 2008, article in the Chicago Tribune, which stated that Obama meant the line delivered at the Philadelphia fundraiser as a joke.

We obtained Kaufman's quotes about Obama by listening to her noon-3 p.m. Nov. 12 show. Typically PolitiFact Florida provides links to a transcript of the show itself so that readers can see or hear the quotes directly from the source. But Steve Lapa, the station's vice president and general manager, said that WFTL does not provide a transcript or archive her show.

In a telephone interview Nov. 15, we read Kaufman's quotes back to her to verify that we're quoting her accurately.

""I don't know,'' she said. ""I'm taking your word for it. It sounds plausible.""

But Kaufman had a couple of tweaks: She said she thought Obama made the remarks during his 2008 campaign -- which he did.

""I'm not so sure he was talking about legislation and amendments in straight-forward terms,'' she said. ""He was talking about the arena of ideas.""

Kaufman said her point was that Obama was using a metaphor, and the media treated his statement about a gun differently than her remark about bullets.

""Nobody thought he was going to bring a gun,'' she said. ""My goal certainly wasn't to incite violence. .... I was encouraging people to go out and use their vote.""

Here is a longer video of Kaufman's now-famous ballots and bullets speech on the Post on Politics, a blog of the Palm Beach Post.

OK, now about that cow reference. Speaking of the Obama quote, Kaufman said: ""Did the cow play that? No. Of course not.""

Kaufman told us that her reference to ""the cow"" was about Maddow -- the MSNBC commentator who played the clip of Kaufman.

""I endearingly call her Rachel Mad-cow,"" Kaufman said.

For this Truth-O-Meter, our goal was to evaluate whether Obama said ""if they bring a knife to the fight we'll bring a gun,"" as Kaufman claimed. We found several news articles quoting Obama as saying exactly that and he's never denied it (though the Chicago Tribune said it was meant as a joke). We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/17/joyce-kaufman/radio-host-joyce-kaufman-said-obama-tote-gun/
"['Deficit', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Gov. Rick Perry says the national debt is increasing by more than $4 billion each day
","
In his book Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, Gov. Rick Perry calls the federal debt ""too overwhelming to comprehend."" 
""The national debt is already more than $13.4 trillion,"" he writes. ""For perspective, that is over $43,000 per man, woman and child in America. Worse yet, the debt is growing by more than $4 billion a day."" 
Or more than $2.7 million a minute and more than $46,000 per second. 
Yikes. Is Perry's call right? 
A footnote in Perry's book cites a Bloomberg news article that says ""the budget deficit will be $1.5 trillion next year... higher than previous Obama administration forecasts because of a recession that was deeper and longer than expected, White House budget chief Peter Orszag said."" (The book incorrectly says the article was written Aug. 25, 2010; it was last updated online Aug. 25, 2009.) 
The public debt is the sum of each year's spending deficits. Most years we spend more than we take in, and we have to make up that gap by borrowing. Clinton announced a surplus in September 1998 — the first U.S. budget surplus in 29 years. Federal budgets were balanced in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000, and 2001 was the last year we had a surplus. 
That wasn't the expectation of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which issued this cheerful report in 2002: ""The outlook for the federal budget over the next decade continues to be bright. Assuming that current tax and spending policies are maintained, the Congressional Budget Office projects that mounting federal revenues will continue to outstrip spending and produce growing budget surpluses for the next 10 years."" At the time, the CBO estimated $5.6 trillion in surpluses by 2011. 
But we digress — back to the grimmer future. Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier also pointed us to the CBO's March 2010 analysis of President Barack Obama's budget proposals for fiscal year 2011. ""The CBO projected the same (debt) figure around the time the book was being compiled,"" she said. 
The CBO found that if Obama's proposals — including the health care overhaul — were enacted, the federal government's deficits would total $1.5 trillion in fiscal year 2010 (which ended Sept. 30) and $1.3 trillion in 2011. 
Divide the CBO's projected addition of $1.5 trillion in debt in 2010 by the 365 days in a year, and you have about $4.1 billion in debt each day. And the $1.3 trillion in 2011? About $3.6 billion each day. 
What does that tell us? 
Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility, agreed that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around trillions of dollars of public debt. Also, Gordon cautioned against interpreting the per-day spending rate as as a reflection on Washington policy makers as opposed to the health of the economy. 
""We always like to measure debt as a percent of the economy, because as the economy grows, the key question is whether the debt is growing more slowly or more quickly,"" he said. That is, surging debt is worse if the economy is sagging. 
According to the CBO analysis noted by Perry's spokeswoman, the projected 2010 and 2011 deficits were expected to amount to 10.3 and 8.9 percent of the gross domestic product, respectively. ""By comparison,"" the report says, ""the deficit in 2009 totaled 9.9 percent of the GDP."" 
The U.S. Treasury tracks a daily history of total public debt — to the penny. On Nov. 9, total public debt outstanding was $13,727,147,399,038.59 — about $13.7 trillion, according to the Treasury. That's up from $13,725,166,759,183.46 on Nov. 8, a difference of about $2 billion. And that's up $1.8 billion from Nov. 5. 
Finally, we chased more recent data since the CBO estimates that Perry cites were from March. 
In August, the CBO projected the 2011 deficit would be about $1.1 trillion — assuming tax cuts signed into law by then-President George W. Bush in 2001 expire at the end of the year. And on Oct. 7, the CBO estimated that the federal budget deficit was ""slightly less than $1.3 trillion fiscal year 2010, down from slightly more than $1.4 trillion in 2009."" That's a debt increase of about $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion per day, respectively. ""Outlays were lower and revenues were higher than previously expected,"" the CBO's analysis says. 
Upshot: We think it's reasonable to pause where Perry's research team landed in March. At that time, the CBO estimated the government would record $1.5 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2010, which breaks down to about $4.1 billion per day, though (as we note) those figures have since ratcheted down a bit. 
We're persuaded too that a case could be made for paying closer attention to the shifting ratio of the debt to the GDP. Regardless, Perry's calculation was on target. We rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/17/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-national-debt-increasing-more-/
"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
Bob McDonnell says Virginia has gained 60,000 jobs since he became governor
","
It’s all about jobs, Gov. Bob McDonnell says.

During an Election Day interview, MSNBC  host Joe Scarborough hailed McDonnell as the ""Elvis"" of the job creation message that moved voters this fall. ""You started this in 2009 before anyone got this,"" Scarborough told the governor, referring to McDonnell’s pledge to create jobs during his successful campaign last year.

McDonnell replied that since taking office in January, ""we’ve been able to create about 60,000 net new jobs"" in Virginia.

We had two questions about McDonnell’s statement: Is his number right; and how much credit does the governor deserve for any upswing in Virginia employment since he took office?

We first checked the claim of ""about 60,000 net new jobs."" Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, said the number came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Our next call went to the office of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who heads McDonnell’s jobs team. Randy Marcus, Bolling’s chief of staff, compiles the job-creation figures for the administration. Marcus said he takes the most current BLS monthly figure for non-farm jobs in Virginia. Then he subtracts the number of non-farm jobs in Virginia in February, McDonnell’s first full month in office. The remainder is what the administration considers to be Virginia’s net job gain under McDonnell. It includes full and part-time jobs in the public and private sectors.

We ran the computation, based on the latest BLS numbers that had been posted more than a week before McDonnell’s appearance on MSNBC. Here’s our result:

Virginia Workers, Sept. 2010        3,637,200
Virginia Workers, Feb. 2010         3,581,800
Net job gain under McDonnell            55,400

The governor’s claim of creating about 60,000 new jobs was a tad inflated, but certainly in the ballpark.

In July, McDonnell claimed 71,500 new Virginia jobs had been created since he took office. We checked those numbers and found them dead on. Much of the job loss since then was caused by the layoff of federal census workers and the slowing of construction.

McDonnell also said on MSNBC that only Texas has gained more jobs than Virginia since February. He’s right, according to BLS statistics. Texas has added 128,800 jobs since February.

Virginia has experienced a 1.55 percent increase in jobs since February. That ranks sixth. The District of Columbia leads everyone with 2.38 percent growth.

Now, let’s look at McDonnell’s statement ""we’ve"" created about 60,000 jobs. It suggests the new slots are the result of his administration’s actions.

""It’s not unique to the Governor, but it bothers me how all politicians take credit for creating jobs,"" said John Knapp, senior economist for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at The University of Virginia. ""Barack Obama is not president of the economy and Bob McDonnell is not governor of the economy. Of course, what they do can have a marginal affect on things, but there are many other elements involved in creating jobs.""

Knapp added that state policies affect job creation development over the long run. ""But as year or two out, new state policies are not going to have a major impact on the economy.""

During recent decades, an array of prominent publications have consistently rated Virginia in the top handful of business-friendly states, noting the Commonwealth’s low tax rates,  and laws barring compulsory union membership.

Johnson said it is not McDonnell’s intention to claim credit for all new jobs under his watch. ""It’s a cumulative effort,"" she said. ""It’s the private sector that creates jobs; government can merely help set a conducive climate.""

Johnson said that when McDonnell said ""we’ve"" created about 60,000 net new jobs, ""he was referring to Virginia.""

It’s noteworthy that this February -- the month McDonnell uses as the starting benchmark for his administration’s job efforts -- Virginia’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, the highest in 28 years. The unemployment rate in September dipped to 6.8 percent, ranking Virginia as the eighth lowest state.

The national unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in February and 9.6 percent in September.

The vast majority of new Virginia jobs since February fell into one of three broad categories: leisure and hospitality; professional and business services; or trade, transportation and utilities.

McDonnell, a Republican, has been praised by legislators from both political parties for aggressively recruiting new businesses.  Over the first nine months of his administration -- starting in February, as the governor prefers -- the state has announced 186 business development deals promising 12,249 new jobs, according to statistics kept by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.

In comparison, the state announced  213 development deals promising 11,656 new jobs during the final nine months of Gov. Tim Kaine’s term, ending in January.

It’s impossible to know how many how many of the jobs promised in state economic development announcements actually translate into employment gains recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many of the jobs are speculative and depend on construction and expansion of plants before people are hired.

So let’s review.

It’s clear the governor wants credit for the new jobs created in Virginia since February. But many factors beyond a governor’s purview influence employment figures and Virginia has benefited a strong business climate for decades. Some of the jobs filled since McDonnell took office were no doubt spawned by economic developments deals announced Kaine. It’s impossible to assign full credit to anyone.

Regardless of credit, have ""about 60,000 net new jobs"" been created in Virginia since February? It depends how you measure ""about."" The correct number at  the time was 55,400. The governor was a little bit off, but he wasn’t blowing smoke.

For that reason, we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/17/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-has-gained-60000-jobs-/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Marvin Pratt']","
Marvin Pratt, former acting mayor of Milwaukee, says black male unemployment tops 50 percent
","
Unemployment in Wisconsin is stubbornly high, but the state overall has not fared as badly as some other states.

The most recent federal figures, from September 2010, put Wisconsin’s unemployment at 7.8 percent -- below the national rate of 9.6 percent and double-digit rates such as Michigan’s 13 percent and Nevada’s 14.4 percent.

But rates can vary widely from place to place and group to group.

In an election-night TV interview, Marvin Pratt, the first African-American to serve as acting mayor of Milwaukee, focused in on black males in the city.

Pratt supported Republican Scott Walker in the 2010 race for Wisconsin governor and was asked at Walker’s victory party why he had not backed Democrat Tom Barrett, who defeated him in the 2004 mayoral election.

""Fifty-two percent black male unemployment,"" Pratt said in the interview with WISN-TV, adding that other reasons included Milwaukee’s high poverty rate and Walker’s pledge to create 250,000 jobs in his first term as governor.

Pratt wasn’t the first to make such a claim.

Less than two weeks earlier, Milwaukee radio host Eric Von said on TV at the 4th Street Forum that the rate was ""50 percent or better."" And the headline on an Oct. 25, 2010, Milwaukee Business Journal article(later reprinted by BlackAmericans.com and BlackVoices.com) read, ""Report: 53% of black males unemployed.""

The number is startling. At 53 percent, the unemployment rate for black males in the city would be nearly seven times that of the state overall.

Asked about the statement, Pratt told PolitiFact Wisconsin a person he trusts told him shortly before the TV interview that the black male unemployment rate in Milwaukee was 52 percent. He then checked with that person and told us the figure -- actually 53 percent -- came from a report by University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee urban studies professor Marc Levine.

Indeed, Von’s statement and the Business Journal article also trace back to the same October 2010 report by Levine, who is a senior fellow at UWM’s Center for Economic Development.

But the official unemployment rate in 2009 for black males in metro Milwaukee, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 33.3 percent.

So, what’s going on here?

The difference is what is measured by the federal government’s official unemployment rate and what Levine terms the ""jobless rate."" 
Federal approach

The federal government defines the unemployed as people over age 16 who do not have a job but are available for work and have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks. That is, people out of work and looking for a job.

The unemployment rate is not calculated by using the number of people who file claims for unemployment insurance benefits, but is based on responses to the government’s monthly surveys of some 110,000 people across the country.

In the Milwaukee metropolitan area, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, the overall unemployment rate for 2009 was measured as 9.4 percent. When broken down, the rate for black males -- 33.3 percent -- exceeded the rate of 7.9 percent for white males and 11.2 percent for Hispanic males. 
Levine's approach

Levine’s approach counts people who are out of work and looking for a job -- and nearly everyone else.

He looks at everyone between the ages of 16 and 64, including those who choose not to work, such as homemakers and early retirees, and those who cannot work, such as those behind bars or with disabilities. It also includes those in high school or college -- even those going back to school for more education to get a better job.

Levine’s report focuses strictly on male ""joblessness."" His approach puts the metro Milwaukee ""jobless"" rate for white males at 22.3 percent and 32 percent for Hispanic males. Like African-American males, those come in higher than the official numbers.

Levine argues that the same approach is used by scholars such as Harvard University’s William Julius Wilson. He says it is better because the official rate understates the number of people not working -- the federal measure does not include the long-term unemployed who have stopped looking for jobs.

But Levine’s approach, which he began using in 1990, overstates the number. Indeed, with his approach the rate could never reach zero -- a point he concedes in the report.

Levine’s approach has been controversial even within UWM.

In December 2009, UWM’s Employment and Training Institute criticized the 2009 version of Levine’s joblessness report for what it said was his ""misuse of the ‘jobless’ statistic as a proxy for unemployment.""  

According to the institute, Levine’s report counted 88 percent of 16- to 19-year-old metro Milwaukee black males as jobless, even though most of them were enrolled in school.

In response, Levine issued a 14-page rejoinder in which he quoted the sections of his studies that explain the differences between his jobless rate and the unemployment rate.

What do others say? 
Yet that is what has happened, repeatedly, with those citing Levine’s report.

The result is a distorted view of a serious problem -- one being tackled most recently by the African-American Male Unemployment Task Force, created in 2010 by the Milwaukee Common Council.

Let’s bring our work to an end.

In his effort to catalog Milwaukee’s woes, former Acting Mayor Marvin Pratt said the city’s unemployment rate among black males tops 50 percent. Pratt said he was relating the finding of a recent UWM study. But that study uses a broader ""joblessness"" measure than the conventional unemployment rate, and looks at the full metropolitan area, not just the city. As such, Pratt falls into a trap others have before him -- stating one measure as another.

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Republican state senators']","
Georgia Senate leaders claim ""power sharing"" with lieutenant governor
","
There was a time when the future looked very bright for Republican Casey Cagle, Georgia's lieutenant governor. He was young and riding the rising tide of a Republican takeover of what had once been a state dominated by Democrats.

The governor's office seemed well within his reach. All he had to do was put a couple of terms as the state Senate's leader behind him, line up the campaign donors and then start measuring the curtains in the chief executive's suite.

But these days, the doe-eyed Cagle looks more like a deer in the headlights, thanks to a rebellious group of his fellow Republican senators who have staged a lightning-quick palace coup, striking hard and fast at the man who was to have been their leader.

The Nov. 2 election returns had barely been counted when the Republican caucus met in Macon in a closed-door session at Mercer University. With a voice vote, Republicans removed Cagle’s power to appoint Senate committee chairmen, which is the key to real influence in the upper chamber. They also stripped Cagle of the ability to decide the makeup of Senate committees. The lieutenant governor will be allowed to direct legislation to particular committees, but he can do that only under the supervision of the Senate membership.

Cagle does still preside over the Senate, and he has the bully pulpit of the upper chamber at his disposal. And he can -- apparently -- still appoint senators to important conference committees to iron out House-Senate differences in legislation. However, that power also could come under attack when senators meet next month in Athens in a pre-session gathering.

One newspaper columnist noted after the Nov. 5 Macon meeting that Cagle had been relegated to little more than a hall monitor.

GOP leaders, however, painted a different picture.

""This is simply a new power-sharing agreement that we’ve come to,"" Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers, R-Woodstock, told reporters. That sentiment was echoed by other GOP leaders.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered who's correct. Does Cagle retain important Senate powers? Or has he been reduced to figurehead?

First, a little background about all the intraparty back-stabbing.

During the last legislative session, Cagle inserted his Senate allies into the middle of a Republican brawl over Gov. Sonny Perdue's proposal to levy a tax on hospitals and other health facilities. Cagle backed the idea, but some key committee chairmen in the Senate vigorously opposed it. They claimed Cagle never consulted them before pledging their support. Cagle retaliated, stripping the chairmanships of Sens. Judson Hill, R-Marietta, and Preston Smith, R-Rome, two of four Republicans who voted against Perdue's proposal. Sen. Mitch Seabaugh, of Sharpsburg, resigned his position as party whip.

That set the stage for a very uncivil war if Cagle won re-election. Which he did, easily, against Democrat Carol Porter. Ironically, Cagle campaigned against Porter by warning Georgia voters that Senate Republicans would immediately strip her of her Senate powers if she won.

Emory University political scientist Merle Black said Cagle now finds himself in the same situation faced by former Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, who was stripped of his power by the new GOP majority in 2003.

""They've turned him into a nominal lieutenant governor -- lieutenant governor in name only,"" Black said. ""I think they've really limited his career opportunities.""

Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said the GOP Senate leaders have essentially ""marginalized"" the lieutenant governor.

""There is no doubt his power has been diminished by this,"" Swint said. ""He's not powerless, but his power has certainly been diminished.""

Cagle spokesman Ben Fry had this to say about all the shenanigans: ""While some may be playing political games, the lieutenant governor remains committed to delivering results, which is exactly what the voters just overwhelmingly elected him to do. He is not going to let procedural hurdles get in the way of his passion for creating jobs and making the difficult decisions necessary to balance the budget and move our state forward.""

But the facts are clear. Power in the Senate has shifted, and shifted dramatically.

The real clout in the Senate now will be wielded by an eight-member committee. That body is composed of President Pro Tem Tommie Williams, five GOP caucus officers and two Senate appointees by Cagle. Cagle was expressly prohibited from membership on the committee.

This is ""power sharing"" all right. In the aftermath of the Macon coup, the GOP Senate leadership now has all the power. And it doesn't plan to share it with Cagle.

We find the GOP claim about power sharing with the lieutenant governor not only not accurate. It's ridiculous. Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/nov/17/republican-state-senators/georgia-senate-leaders-claim-power-sharing-lieuten/
"['Rhode Island', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Chain email']","
Chain e-mail claims bill requires EPA permission for homeowners to sell their property
","""If you own a home, you must read this!"" says the e-mail making the rounds in Rhode Island mailboxes.

The message says ""It will come as a huge shock to you if you aren't informed as to what Obama is up to"" and warns that if legislation designated as HR-2454 is approved by Congress, ""a year from now, you won't be able to sell your house. Yes, you read it right.""

The reason, according to the e-mail, is that homes, including mobile homes, will be required to meet new federal energy standards before being sold. ""In effect, this bill prevents you from selling your home without the permission of the EPA administrator.""

Is there really a plan to require homeowners to get permission from Washington before they can sell their property?

It turns out, the authors of this warning aren't reading it right when they discuss the actual legislation, better known as the anti-pollution ""cap-and-trade"" bill that is controversial for other reasons.

Here's what PolitiFact found when it looked into the homeowner issue a year ago:

There's lots of language in the bill regarding building efficiency.

Section 201, for instance, requires building energy codes for new homes to be 30 percent more efficient than current standards when the bill goes into law and 50 percent more efficient by 2016. State and local governments will be responsible for enforcing the new codes, but will receive government allowances to cover the cost of developing and adopting the improvements.

And Section 202 of the bill would establish a program that would allow states to help homeowners finance energy-efficient home retrofits; the more energy a retrofit saves, the more money the homeowner would get from the government to subsidize the work.

Finally, Section 204 would require the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a model program that individual states could voluntarily adopt to label new buildings for their energy performance. This ""license,"" as the chain e-mail calls it, is only applicable to new construction and would be completely voluntary.

In fact, that's a point the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the panel that has jurisdiction over the cap-and-trade bill, makes over and over in its summary of the legislation: ""Nothing would require a homeowner to audit or retrofit their home to ensure that it meets building code requirements,"" the document says.

Lane Burt, a building efficiency expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supports the legislation, has blogged about the issue. He says the e-mail is false.

""The anti-efficiency crowd have alleged that the [cap-and-trade] bill is going to require Americans trying to sell their homes to undergo some sort of energy inspection or meet some sort of green requirements -- 'or else,' "" he wrote of the supposed requirement in the bill.

""Of course, when I have heard and read this claim there isn't a provision cited, and for good reason -- it doesn't exist!"" he said.

William Fay, executive director of the Building Energy Efficient Codes Network -- a coalition including The Alliance to Save Energy, Duke Energy Corp. and the National Association of State Energy Officials among other organizations -- called the e-mail an ""urban myth.""

""The bill certainly does not require a retrofit, or an energy label for an existing home,"" Fay said. ""It does not make them a condition of sale.""

This fact-check is clear-cut. There's nothing in the bill that would require homeowners to retrofit their homes to meet new efficiency standards or get a government ""license"" before putting their home on the market. Homeowners who do want to retrofit their homes can do so voluntarily and with the help of government funding.

Nonetheless, this e-mail keeps making the rounds, even though it has been debunked by PolitiFact, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org.

There's plenty of debate about the overall bill, which was passed by the House in 2009 on a largely partisan vote and is stalled in the Senate.

But there's no debate among the fact checkers, and we invite readers to check one of these sites before blindly forwarding such messages to others. This e-mail warrants a Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2010/nov/17/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-bill-requires-epa-permission-h/

Paul Krugman said Obama's deficit co-chairs had no ideas for controlling health care costs
","The co-chairs of President Barack Obama's deficit commission released their ideas for getting control of the federal deficit last week. Economist  and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is not a fan.

""I think the most important thing to understand is that the commission did not do its job. It has a bunch of ideas for reducing the deficit, some good, some really bad, some of them not ideas about reducing the deficit at all,"" Krugman said on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour. ""But it's easy to come up with ideas. I can come up with ideas for reducing the deficit while patting my tummy and rubbing my head, you know?""

The key to reducing the deficit, Krugman said, is reducing the future growth of health care costs.

""The way you have to do that is by deciding what you're going to be willing to pay for,"" Krugman said. ""They completely wimped out on that. They simply assumed they were going to reduce the rate of health care cost growth. And they said, how are we going to do that? By monitoring and taking additional measures as necessary. So the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket. What on earth is that doing in there?""

Here, we'll fact-check Krugman's statement that the report was ""completely empty"" on reining in the future growth of health care costs. We'll check his statement about large tax cuts for the top bracket in a separate report.

First, a bit of (recent) history on the commission: President Barack Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in February, 2010, asking it to identify ""policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run."" Obama asked the commission to propose ideas designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. He appointed six members, including bipartisan co-chairs, and asked congressional leaders from both parties -- Democrats Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and Republicans Mitch McConnell and John Boehner -- to appoint three each, for a total of 18 members.

The proposal released Nov. 10 was not the final report, which requires approval from 14 of 18 members and has a deadline of Dec. 1. Rather, the proposal summarized the ideas of the two co-chairs: Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. We're not sure why the two took the step of releasing their proposals ahead of the deadline; some news reports speculate it was an attempt to prod other members to keep negotiating before the December deadline. If the members are not able to come to an agreement, it's possible that no report will be issued.

We previously reviewed the co-chairs' proposal for our factsheet on reducing the deficit, but now we wanted to look in detail at what it said about health spending.

Krugman is right that the report released last week reads like ""a bunch of ideas."" It reminded us more of a PowerPoint presentation than a policy brief.  But it does address Medicare spending and other improvements to the health care system on pages 31 to 36. (The full report is 50 pages; view it here.)

Some of its suggestions for Medicare are vague, such as its solution for addressing future shortfalls for payments to doctors and hospitals. Right now, Congress funds payments every year in a move that's come to be known as the ""doc fix."" The co-chairs' proposal suggests paying for that ""by asking doctors and other health providers, lawyers, and individuals to take responsibility for slowing health care cost growth."" It then suggests, ""Pay doctors and other providers less, improve efficiency, and reward quality by speeding up payment reforms and increasing drug rebates,"" as well as, ""Pay lawyers less and reduce the cost of defensive medicine by adopting comprehensive tort reform."" The report also suggests the government ""expand cost-sharing in Medicare to promote informed consumer health choices and spending."" That means asking seniors to pay more for their health care benefits.

But the proposal also includes budget estimates for various health care-related cost savings in 2015 and for the years 2012 through 2020, on pages 33 and 35.

More specifically, the report recommends strengthening the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, a new board created under the 2010 health care law. The board is intended to make evidence-based recommendations on reducing costs and improving the quality of care in Medicare. In practice, the board will likely issue rules on which procedures it will pay for and which it won't, and these rules will apply across the board. (The board will not get involved in decisions on individual patients based on their worth to society -- the old ""death panels"" lie.)  The board's recommendations will take effect unless Congress overrules them.

The co-chairs' proposal suggested several ways that the board could be strengthened, such as applying its recommendations to all health care providers without some of the exceptions allowed under the health care law. It suggested that the board make recommendations on benefit design and cost-sharing, which the health care law does not allow. Finally, the co-chairs suggested that the board's proposals apply not only to Medicare but also to private health insurance plans sold in government-sponsored exchanges.

On This Week, Ruth Marcus, a Washington Post columnist, challenged Krugman's claim and specifically mentioned the IPAB.

""They did talk about strengthening that commission, the famous IPAB, and giving it more power to go after more aspects of the health care system, because it's now rather constrained,"" Marcus said.

""They made no headlines with that,"" Krugman responded. ""And some friends of mine are calling this the commission to put caps on lots of stuff. It's a lot of numerical caps without any explanation of how they're going to happen.""

We e-mailed Krugman after the show to ask him about his comments. He said his reading of the report, particularly page 31, struck him as ""a model of vagueness."" But, he added, ""I was somewhat unfair in not giving credit for the endorsement of the IPAB.""

In ruling on Krugman's statement, he said the deficit proposal was ""completely empty"" on reining in the future growth of health care costs. Krugman has a point that the co-chairs' proposal is vague. But the proposal does have several specific ideas on how to strengthen the IPAB. It has other recommendations on health care spending as well, and it includes dollar estimates for how much its ideas would reduce spending. It does recognize that health care spending must be controlled, and it's not completely empty of ideas. We rate Krugman's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/nov/16/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-obamas-deficit-co-chairs-had-no-/

Marco Rubio wasn't always against earmarks, Florida Democrat claims
","
A top Florida Democrat claims that the state's Republican U.S. Sen.-elect Marco Rubio is changing stories on budget earmarks.

Rubio has become one of the leading advocates of a proposal from Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., to seek a nonbinding ban on budget earmarks among Republicans in the chamber. ""I think earmarks are bad for our country,"" Rubio said in an interview before Election Day.

But Rubio didn't always think that way, says former Barack Obama Florida director Steven Schale.

""I don't remember Rubio disagreeing with earmarks in the Florida Legislature,"" Schale posted on Twitter on Nov. 15, 2010, in reply to a story about Rubio supporting an earmark ban. In a separate post, Schale offered his evidence. ""Re: (Marco) Rubio's support of earmark ban: In 2002 alone (a bad budget year in Florida), he requested 37 earmarks worth $43 million.""

In this case, we wanted to check Schale's math.

Rubio served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2000-2008, the last two years as House speaker. During his U.S. Senate campaign, Rubio was criticized by independent candidate Gov. Charlie Crist for requesting millions of dollars in pork projects, which Crist said he had to veto. We've rated two specific claims when it comes to Rubio and earmarks before -- we called a claim that he supported $800,000 to replace the turf at a field where he played flag football Half True and a claim that he tried to insert $1.5 milllion into the budget for a rowing institute Pants on Fire!

Florida's version of the earmark was something called a Community Budget Issue Request -- a budget request legislators made for local projects. Legislators had to file their request ahead of the budget planning process and attach their name to every request.  The Legislature stopped the practice in 2009, the year after Rubio left office.

In 2002, Rubio's third year, the Florida House requested $1.5 billion in Community Budget Issue Requests, according to data kept by the state. To put that in perspective, the state budget that Gov. Jeb Bush signed that year totaled $50 billion, and legislators had been warned of a tight budget. (They actually were summoned back to Tallahassee to slash $1 billion from the budget in December 2001 to keep the state from going in the red.) 
Rubio's member budget requests for 2002 remain archived on a state website, which confirms Schale's statement.

Rubio requested funding for 37 projects totalling $43,697,787. Here's the complete list.

• $7.67 million, requested by Jackson Health System, to provide inpatient and outpatient health care services to people with HIV/AIDS, including medications, psycho-social counseling, education and case management.

• $750,000, requested by RFB&D of Miami for the Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic Florida Unit, to meet the educational needs of Florida's print-disabled children and adults through taped and digital audio books. 
• $750,000, requested by the Department of Environmental Resource Management for the Miami-Dade County DERM, for the stormwater planning component for the C-4 Basin in north central Miami-Dade County. 
• $684,690, requested by Public Health Trust for Jackson Health System,  for a medical foster care program for 88 children in state custody as an alternative to reducing institutional placements of children with chronic illnesses.

• $269,000, requested by the city of Coral Gables, for intersection improvements along U.S. 1. 
• $200,000, requested by the Children's Psychiatric Center of Miami, for an in-school program that provides therapeutic and behavioral support to the alternative education classrooms. 
• $200,000, requested by First Quality Home Care Inc. of Miami, for homebound insulin-dependent diabetics who are unable to self-administer their insulin due to a secondary diagnosis such as blindness. 
• $200,000, requested by the Achievement & Rehabilitation Centers, Inc., for ARC Broward Inc., to provide intensive specialized behavorial intervention in home and community-based settings; and specialized homebound speech, occupational and family therapies for children with severe autism and related disorders aged 3-18. 
• $175,000, requested by Curtiss Mansion Inc., to design the renovation of the historically important home of famed naval aviator and inventor Glen Curtiss. 
• $112,500, requested by the city of South Miami, for improvements to Dante Fascell Park, including drainage in parking lots and tennis courts, ADA-accessible playground equipment and picnic tables, resurfacing tennis and hardball courts, and replacing or repairing individual stations along the exercise path in the park. 
• $100,000, requested by Allapattah Wynwood Community and Development Center in Miami, for construction of a new child care facility in Miami's Allapattah Wynwood community to introduce early childhood intervention programs that serve 100 children from low/moderate income families.

• $25,000, requested by the city of West Miami, to provide resources to the city's police department to improve homeland security. 
(We made a link to Rubio's requests, which you can see here).

It turns out Rubio requested more money in Community Budget Issue Requests than all but four members of the 120-member Florida House (Democrat Gary Siplin $65.1 million; Republican Mike Bennett $74.8 million; Republican Bev Kilmer $120.4 million; and Democrat Curtis Richardson $130.1 million).

In 2001, Rubio actually requested even more money -- $101.2 million for 72 projects -- but Rubio did not make another Community Budget Issue Request after 2002, according to the state database. Not one in six years.

But those aren't the years Schale referenced. Schale said Rubio requested 37 earmarks in 2002 worth $43 million -- which he says is at odds with Rubio's current support for an earmark ban. Schale has his math right, according to figures kept by the state. Rubio that year ranked fifth in requests for money among Florida House members.

"['Elections', 'History', 'Florida', 'Mike Haridopolos']","
Senate President Mike Haridopolos says 2010 was the first time since mid '80s a party gained multiple seats in a general election
","
Election Day 2010 dealt a severe blow to Democrats statewide, with several congressional and state legislative seats crossing over to the Republican column.

Just two years after Florida voters helped deliver the presidency to Barack Obama, Florida Republicans savored the mid-term election results that ushered conservative Marco Rubio into the U.S. Senate, business mogul Rick Scott into the governor’s office, and seven additional Republicans into the state Legislature.

""This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s, making this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years,"" said incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos in a post-election interview on Nov. 2, 2010.  ""This increase will allow our Republican-led Legislature to tackle tough issues facing our state in the upcoming 2011 legislative session -- from balancing our state's budget to reforming Medicaid and cutting wasteful government spending, all with our conservative principles in mind.""

We decided to take a closer look at Haridopolos’ claim. First, was this the first time since 1984 that a party had picked up multiple seats during a regular election? Second, is this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years?

Picking up seats

This election season, the GOP picked up five state House seats formerly held by Democrats and two state Senate seats. In addition, Republican Jeff Atwater defeated Democrat Loranne Ausley for the state’s chief financial officer post. The cabinet position was vacated by Democrat Alex Sink in her failed bid for governor.

On the federal level, state Republicans picked up four congressional seats once held by Democrats. These seats included Allen West’s victory over Rep. Ron Klein for a district spanning Broward and Palm Beach counties; Steve Southerland’s win over Blue Dog Democrat Rep. Allen Boyd of North Florida; firebrand Rep. Alan Grayson’s defeat by Republican stalwart Daniel Webster in Orlando; and GOP state Rep. Sandy Adams’ win over Democratic incumbent Suzanne Kosmas in Brevard County. 
But with Republicans gaining in the state at all levels over the past two decades, surely the party has picked up ""multiple seats"" before now, right? 
Haridopolos communications director David Bishop clarified that the incoming Senate president was referring to the state Senate only when he said, ""This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s."" 
Bishop contends Haridopolos' statement is correct dating back to 1988, and he sent us a list that we verified is accurate. Special elections to fill vacancies, and senators switching parties have helped give Republicans an edge in certain non-general election years. But when it comes to regular elections, Republicans in the Senate have either picked up only one seat at a time or remained the same starting with the 1988 general election. 
For example, after the 1990 general election, there were 17 Republicans in the Senate, and two years later there were 20. At a glance, it appears that Republicans picked up three seats during the 1992 election, but a closer look reveals that a special election and a party switch helped bridge some of that gap. In June 1991, Republican Locke Burt of Ormond Beach narrowly defeated a Democratic challenger during a special election, bringing the GOP tally up to 18. That number went up to 19 in April 1992 when former Sen. Vince Bruner of Fort Walton Beach switched to the GOP.  When the 1992 general election came in November, Republicans were able to pick up an additional seat. 
In other examples from non-general election years, Senate Republicans made gains in February 1995 when W.D. Childers of Pensacola switched to the GOP, and in March 1998 when former Rep. John Laurent of Bartow won a special election to fill a seat vacated by Democratic Sen. Rick Dantzler of Winter Haven who resigned to focus on an unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign. 
So Haridopolos is correct in saying that this is the first time the party has picked up multiple Senate seats during a regular election season, but he was off a bit in saying since the mid 1980s, because it last happened in 1988. 
Largest majority?

As for the second part of Haridopolos’ statement, that ""this is the largest majority any party has seen in 25 years,"" with the count now stacked at 81-39 in the House and 28-12 in the Senate it’s hard to argue otherwise.

The last time either party saw a larger majority was between 1982 and 1984, when the Democrats held control of the House with an 84-36 majority, and 32-8 in the Senate. That was the start of Bob Graham’s second term as governor and it would also be the last time Democrats would post such high numbers. Each subsequent election, Republicans made small gains that chiseled away at the Democrats' once-strong block.

Democrats remained in control of both the House and Senate up until the 1992 elections, covering the first two years of Lawton Chiles’ first term as governor. While Democrats were able to keep control of the House in 1992, the Senate was deadlocked with a 20-20 split. Then when the 1994 midterm elections rolled around, Republicans continued to make inroads and held control of the Senate with a 21-19 majority.

It was during the 1996 elections, when President Bill Clinton carried Florida in his re-election bid,  that Republicans finally sealed their lock on both chambers with a 61-59 majority in the House, and a 23-17 majority in the Senate. Ever since that decisive 1996 election, Republicans have remained in control of both chambers in the Legislature.

In fact, while Republicans were able to gain seven seats in both chambers of the Legislature combined during the 2010 elections, it was between the 1994 and 1996 elections that they gained the most seats in the past 25 years, with a total of 11 seats.

So back to the question at hand. How accurate was Haridopolos in stating, ""This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s, making this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years?"" His comment wasn't clear that he was referring only to the state Senate with ""multiple seats,"" and he could have been slightly more accurate by specifying since the late 1980s. Haridopolos was correct, though, in saying that this is the largest majority in the past quarter-century. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/16/mike-haridopolos/incoming-senate-president-mike-haridopolos-says-fi/
"['Stimulus', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says Obama, Pelosi, Reid passed $1.2 trillion stimulus bill
","
In the wake of midterm elections, former U.S. Sen. George Allen is urging the new Congress to stop funding the stimulus bill.

Under a set of legislative priorities posted on his website, Allen says: ""The new Congress must repeal and cutoff any additional money borrowed and set aside for Obama, Reid and Pelosi's $1.2 trillion stimulus spending bill.""

The $1.2 trillion price tag was a new to us, so we checked it out.

Allen’s executive assistant Tim Nussbaum said the source is CNN Money.com’s Bailout Tracker, which focuses on government programs designed to jump start the economy.

Among  the various categories in the Bailout Tracker is one called ""Federal Stimulus Programs."" Within that category are six programs which collectively represent $1.2 trillion in spending.

Those programs include the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, unemployment benefit extension, student loan guarantees, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, an advanced technology vehicles manufacturing program and the Cash for Clunkers program.

And that takes us to the heart of the first major problem with Allen’s claim.

He refers to one stimulus spending bill and then attempts to validate the $1.2 trillion number by pointing to the combined funding for six separate programs.

Here’s the second big problem: the six programs that collectively represent the $1.2 trillion weren’t all approved under the Obama administration.

The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, for example, which represents $168 billion of the $1.2 trillion total was passed under President George W. Bush. So was the $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program.

Now, if we are to assume that Allen is referring in his claim to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also called the Stimulus, the total provided was $787.2 billion including tax relief and stimulus funds.

That’s a long way from $1.2 trillion.

Recent estimates put the 2009 Stimulus total a bit higher. The Congressional Budget Office in August put the total cost for the stimulus -- from February 2009 through 2019 -- at $814 billion.

Still not close.

So, looking back, this is an open and shut case.

Allen is clearly distorting the facts by using the $1.2 trillion total for six individual programs, not all of which were approved under the Obama administration, and applying it to a single bill.

In reality, the 2009 Stimulus bill Allen alludes to represents a total cost of about $814 billion. That’s almost $400 billion shy of the $1.2 trillion figure he cites.    

And just to put that number in perspective, $400 billion is what shoppers spent at Wal-Mart in 2009. It roughly equals the total 13-year expenses of  Virginia’s state government between 1999 and 2012.

Allen is not only exaggerating the spending total by President Obama and the Democratic leaders of Congress, he is doing it by including billions of dollars passed under a Republican president. That’s just not false, it’s ridiculous. So we have to set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire.

Milwaukee Ald. Jim Bohl says sewer backups caused most of the damage in July floods, and federal flood insurance doesn’t cover it
","
Three months after Milwaukee’s watery nightmare, federal officials have paid out a whopping $45 million to 31,000 people with damaged residences. A presidential disaster declaration opened the money spigot. 
But while the floodwaters have long ago receded, controversy hasn’t.

Milwaukee Alderman Jim Bohl and two colleagues, Willie Wade and Jim Witkowiak, are airing a new complaint. In a Nov. 3, 2010 news release, they punched the gift horse -- FEMA -- in the mouth for pushing federal flood insurance they say is a bad deal for most of their constituents.

""Plain and simple, flood insurance does not cover damage caused by sewer discharge backups in basements, and by far that is exactly what caused the vast majority of damage to homes and buildings in Milwaukee in July,"" Bohl said in the release. ""The fear I have is that many people will buy flood insurance that is of no use to them. I think this is selling false hope, and I think it is just wrong.""

Strong words.

Is Bohl right that the ""vast majority of damage to homes and buildings"" was due sewer backups, not surface water? And that the federal insurance program is no help?

First let’s clarify: That $45 million in disaster claims already paid out by the Federal Emergency Management Agency is separate from payments made by FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program. The insurance comes in handy when floods don’t rise to the level of a presidential disaster declaration.

More than 1,400 people in Milwaukee County have federal flood insurance, including some who don’t live anywhere near a river or creek. In the last three decades those Milwaukee County residents paid premiums totaling $990,000 and filed claims totaling $14.4 million, FEMA says.

What were those claims for?

Well, none were for sewer backups, something FEMA officials acknowledge are not covered under the insurance program.

Water entering your house from sewer pipes is not ""flooding"" under the official federal insurance definition, which starts (we’re not making this up) with: ""A flood is an excess of water on land that is normally dry.""

Even if torrential rains cause water to infiltrate sewer pipes that back up  into basements, that doesn’t count as flooding. So Bohl is right on that point.

FEMA likes to stress that policies can cost as little as $119 a year, but if you ask they readily acknowledge premiums average $570 a year nationwide. They say the insurance fills in an important gap -- basic private homeowner’s insurance policies exclude flood coverage. They recommend that you use a federal website to decide if the insurance is right.

The aldermen say, ""buyer beware.""

But what about the July flooding, which dumped eight inches of rain on parts of Milwaukee. Did most of the damage come from sewer backups?

Bohl, who represents a far northwest side district, provided PolitiFact Wisconsin with a log of 1,200 calls from his constituents to the city’s Department of Public Works complaining of what the city calls ""backwater."" In Wade’s north side district -- the hardest hit in the city -- 1,950 people reported ""backwater"" problems.

To Bohl and Wade, the term ""backwater"" means water coming up from sewer pipes into a basement.

DPW confirmed the number of calls, but disagrees with that interpretation. ""Backwater"" is just water in the basement -- from any source, including surface flooding through window wells or a basement foundation, said City Engineer Jeffrey Polenske.

City public works officials do not track where the waters came from, so there is no city-wide accounting, Polenske said.

So we are left with anecdotal evidence -- reports by homeowners who are on the scene of the mess, though many may not have seen exactly where water entered.

Bohl, Wade and Alderman Jim Witkowiak’s aide, Michael McGuire, say sewer backups were easily the most frequent complaint at neighborhood meetings they hosted after the floods. DPW’s chief sewer design manager, Tim Thur, called it a ""majority"" of such complaints based on his department’s visits to those meetings.

FEMA has offered no official tally of basement flooding causes.

Other communities tracked their flood damage more closely and some reported a different view than that of the three aldermen. The differences reflect geography, condition of infrastructure, as well as differences in interpretation of what happened in July.

Both Shorewood and Whitefish Bay said half of flood victims reported rainwater flooding as opposed to sewage flooding.

In many cases that meant water invaded through window wells, foundation cracks or doorways, said Whitefish Bay assistant village manager Matt Schuenke. One-fifth or one-fourth blamed sewage, and the rest said it was a mixture.

""Overland flooding was a significant factor,"" Schuenke said.

In suburban Wauwatosa, sewage pipe backups into the basement were far more common than overland flooding, said City Engineer Bill Wehrley. But overland or surface water flooding contributes to the overload of the sanitary sewer system.

If rain water pours in through a basement window and floods a basement, that water drains back into the sanitary sewer system, overloads it and sends the resulting mix of clear water and sewage up into people’s basements, he said.

""You have to look at both,"" Wehrley said.

The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District has no data on basement flooding causes, but spokesman Bill Graffin said the main culprit behind basement backups and sewer overflows is excess water getting into sanitary sewer pipes.

Let’s get out of the pool, and rule on this.

Bohl makes two related claims. Nobody has a clear answer on whether sewer backups into basements caused the ""vast majority"" of the damage. The evidence is anecdotal  and contradictory, which makes Bohl’s generalization more than a little problematic. It is true that damage from sewer backups is not covered under the federal flood insurance. So Bohl’s not all wet, but he went a bit overboard.

Republican state Rep. Bill Batchelder knocks Dems for canceling more than half the House's sessions
","
Democrats’ two-year control of the Ohio House of Representatives came to an abrupt end with the Nov. 2 election. Republicans dominated, winning the governor’s office, all other statewide executive offices and control of the House. 
What impact the Republican takeover of the House will have on the average Ohioan is unknown, but one thing seems clear: House members, coming off an election year with an extended summer break, will be called to work more often under the new leadership. 
Republican state Rep. Bill Batchelder, who will take over as Ohio House speaker in January, was outspoken during the campaign about the House's productivity under Democratic leadership. He pointed to the high number of legislative sessions House Speaker Armond Budish canceled. 
""We haven’t had control of the House for the last two years and it’s been malfunctioning,"" Batchelder, of Medina, told the Brunswick Sun News in mid-October. ""We had 109 sessions scheduled and held 49."" 
Given his critique of Budish, it will be worth checking how often Batchelder, once he becomes House speaker, cancels scheduled House sessions. But PolitiFact Ohio thought we first should make sure Batchelder’s figures for the last two years are accurate. 
If he is correct, the number of House sessions convened in 2009 and 2010 will be the lowest two-year total in recent years. The House had 78 sessions in 2005-06 and 71 sessions in 2007-08, according to the House clerk’s office. 
The House speaker publishes a schedule of planned sessions every six months. The speaker, under the rules of the House, also has the authority to cancel or add session dates as necessary. 
Budish, a Democrat from Beachwood, became House speaker at the beginning of 2009, after the Democrats took control of the Ohio House in the 2008 election. 
In 2009, Budish scheduled 74 session days and cancelled 43 times, leaving 31 days the House actually held session, according to figures provided by Batchelder and confirmed by Budish’s office. 
Batchelder and Budish also agree on figures for this year. Through Nov. 5, Budish had scheduled 35 session days and actually held session 17 times, according to their offices. 
The sum of those figures aligns closely with Batchelder’s statement to the newspaper. The number of scheduled session days is a match at 109. He is off by one on the number of actual sessions held. He said 49 but his office now agrees that 48 sessions were held in the last two years. Batchelder was counting a day the legislature met – but did not hold session – on the day of the governor’s State of the State address. 
While Budish’s office agrees with Batchelder’s numbers, it has a different interpretation of their meaning. 
Budish spokesman Keary McCarthy said the number of canceled sessions is not an indication that the House has malfunctioned in the past two years. He mentioned passage of a two-year state budget and work on legislation to help create jobs. 
McCarthy can disagree with Batchelder’s attack on the House’s productivity under Budish’s leadership, but he can’t really quibble with the number of canceled sessions Batchelder claimed. He was off by one in his total of actual sessions, but that miscalculation was insignificant. 
We rate Batchelder's claim as True.

Jeb Bush says Rick Scott won Florida Hispanic vote, bucking national trend
","
On a swing through Florida to promote his presidential memoir, Decision Points, George W. Bush was joined by his brother Jeb to talk about the Bush family name, the 2010 midterm elections and the upcoming 2012 presidential election.

Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, reiterated that he would not run for president in 2012 -- despite pleas from his brother -- and that he wasn't interested in becoming the chairman of the Republican National Committee, either. ""I'm Switzerland as it relates to national Republican politics,"" Bush told CNN's Candy Crowley in an interview that aired Nov. 14, 2010.

Yet Jeb -- who is 57, and seven years younger than the former president -- still was quick to talk politics when the issue turned to the results of the 2010 midterm elections. The topic -- why Latino or Hispanic voters voted 2-to-1 for Democrats over Republicans, according to Crowley.

""That's some problemo,"" George W. Bush started, when hearing Crowley's figure (Another transcript recorded Bush as saying, ""Es un problema""). After some back and forth, Jeb provided a bit of nuance to the debate over whether Republicans can attract Hispanic voters by talking about the race for governor in Florida.

""Rick Scott got a majority of the Hispanic vote in Florida. We elected two Hispanic governors, Susana Martinez and Brian Sandoval (Martinez was elected governor in New Mexico and Sandoval in Nevada.) There were congressmen and women elected of Hispanic origin,"" said Jeb, who speaks Spanish fluently and whose wife is Mexican. ""I think the problem is not just a West Coast problem but it is a big-time California problem. And I think a part of it relates to tone.

""If you're watching TV, and someone is kind of legitimately angry that we can't control our border, and sending signals that it's them and us, and, by the way, you're not 'us,' you're 'them,' it doesn't matter what else, people turn out. If they (don't) feel like they're welcome, they're not going to listen to the message.

""Hispanics want the border controlled,"" Jeb added. ""A great nation has to control its border for national security purposes, for all sorts of purposes. And no one has -- I don't know anybody that says, 'Yes, let's just open up our border to create chaos.' So once the border is controlled and people view it that way and there's a perception, it's benchmarked and people say, 'Yes,' then I think you're going to find that there is ground to change our immigration policy to help us grow faster as a nation and to welcome people that work hard and play by the rules to create prosperity for us.""

If Hispanic voters overwhelmingly supported Democrats nationwide, we wondered if Jeb was right that the script was flipped in Florida, where Republican Rick Scott narrowly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in the race for governor.

There's no official certified count of who Hispanic or Latino voters supported in any given election, so Jeb and others rely on exit polling data. The data is just like it sounds -- researchers interview people after leaving the polling place and try, using a sample of the electorate, to replicate the voter turnout by gender, race, age and other characteristics. Exit polling measures how people voted but also tries to figure out why. Like any other poll, exit polling has a margin of error.

This year's national and Florida exit polling was conducted by Edison Media Research for the National Election Pool. Researchers interviewed 3,185 voters in Florida at 45 polling places on election day and also included a telephone poll of absentee and early voters.

The bottom-line numbers back the Bush brothers up. Democrats had a nearly 2-to-1 advantage -- 64 percent to 34 percent -- over Republicans in U.S. House races among Latino or Hispanic voters, according to the data. Yet the same exit polling data said Scott defeated Sink in Florida among Hispanic voters 50 percent to 48 percent. You can see the 50-48 split in this Miami Herald report or in this report crated by the the Pew Hispanic Center, which studied the Hispanic 2010 vote. The Sink-Scott race itself was extraordinarily close, so Hispanic voters were about as divided as everybody else.

But if you're from Florida, and you're a Bush, you should know to be at least a little leery of exit polling (See, 2000).

Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research, told PolitiFact Florida that the Scott/Sink split of the Hispanic vote has a 7 percentage point margin of error. Statistically, that means it is entirely possible Sink won the Hispanic vote. Or Scott. Or that it was a razor-thin margin.

The large margin of error is because while researchers interviewed more than 3,000 voters, they only spoke with 332 people who identified themselves as Hispanic. In its methods statement accompanying the results, Edison Media Research specifically said that ""characteristics for minority racial groups will have larger sampling errors.""

""The exit polls are always taken like gospel, but they are a survey,"" Lenski said.

In this case, the percentages could swing on just a handful of votes. By our calculation, if four voters said they voted for Sink and not Scott, Sink would have won the Hispanic vote, according to exit polling.

For the record, Lenski attributes Scott's performance among Hispanic voters in large part to the Cuban vote. Lenski said Scott carried Cuban voters 68-32 percent, while Sink won the non-Cuban Hispanic vote 65-33. Those numbers also have large margins of error. But the gap is easily outside those margins.

Which brings us back to Jeb Bush, who said Rick Scott won a majority of the Hispanic vote in his close victory for governor. Bush was trying to make the point that some Republicans were successful in attracting Hispanic voters. And on that broader point he's right. Scott far outperformed most Republicans across the country when it comes to Hispanic or Latino voters.

But it's a stretch to say he definitively won the majority of Hispanic voters. Exit polling shows that Scott carried the Hispanic vote 50-48, but the poll itself comes with a 7 percentage point margin of error, which means it's impossible to make a broad declaration of victory for either candidate. The margin of error too often gets lost in translation or political headlines. But not for us.

Kent Conrad says federal spending's share of GDP is at 60-year peak, tax revenues at 60-year low
","
With the rise of the fiscally conservative tea party and the recent release of a draft report by the presidentially appointed National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the nation's fiscal challenges have rocketed up the list of urgent agenda items in Washington. 
We'll take a look at two comments on federal spending made on the Nov. 14, 2010, Sunday talk shows -- one by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and the other by Sen.-elect Rand Paul, R-Ky. We'll address Conrad's here.

In an interview on ABC's This Week With Christiane Amanpour, Conrad -- who chairs the Senate Budget Committee and serves on the presidentially appointed panel -- said, ""If you look at our spending, it's the highest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, revenue is the lowest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, so we're going to have to work both sides of the equation.""

Let's take a look at Conrad's numbers.

As we did with Paul's item, we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole.

In 2009, the last full year available, federal spending accounted for 24.7 percent of GDP. That's higher than it's been in any year since 1949 -- 60 years prior. You have to go back to 1946 to find a higher percentage -- 24.8 -- and that was a year in which the nation was winding down high rates of spending for World War II. (From 1943 to 1945, the height of the war, federal spending ranged from 41 percent to 43 percent of GDP.)

Clearly, recessions have an impact on how high this percentage gets. The only other years since 1946 in which federal spending exceeded 23 percent of GDP came in 1982 and 1983, with 23.1 percent and 23.5 percent, respectively. That was during and immediately after the 1981-82 recession -- the last one that rivaled today's in severity. Economic downturns tend to affect this statistic because they slow GDP growth and increase the demand for government services. Even without special stimulus measures, spending goes up for mandatory items such as food stamps.

Either way, Conrad is correct on spending. What about tax revenue as a percentage of GDP?

In 2009, tax receipts accounted for 14.8 percent of GDP. According to the table, tax receipts as a share of GDP were always higher all the way back through 1950, when they accounted for 14.4 percent of GDP. That would be 59 years -- not quite 60, but very, very close.

The recession factors into the tax revenue statistic as well. Both the 2008 stimulus package under President George W. Bush and the 2009 stimulus under President Barack Obama included tax breaks as a major component.

Because the statistics show a number so close to 60 years -- and because Conrad was speaking during a television interview rather than a prepared speech or written statement -- we'll give him some leeway and rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/15/kent-conrad/kent-conrad-says-federal-spendings-share-gdp-60-ye/

Rand Paul says federal spending has risen to 25 percent of GDP

We'll take a look at two comments on federal spending made on the Nov. 14, 2010, Sunday talk shows -- one by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and the other by Sen.-elect Rand Paul, R-Ky. We'll address Paul's here. 
On CBS' Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer asked Paul whether he would favor eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, as the commission suggested. 
""No, once again, I'm on the other side,"" Paul said. ""I want to be on the side of reducing spending. So I think really the compromise is where you find the reductions in spending. But I don't think the compromise is in raising taxes. I mean, you have to put things in perspective. We now consume at the federal level 25 percent of the gross domestic product. Historically we were at 20 percent. So we've taken 5 percent away from the private sector. And the private sector is the engine that creates all these jobs. I want to send that 5 percent back to the private sector."" 
We'll focus on whether Paul's numbers are correct. 
As we did with Conrad's comment, we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole. 
The most recent full-year figure is for 2009, and it shows that federal spending accounted for 24.7 percent of gross domestic product that year, or 25 percent when rounded up. So Paul is correct. 
The second statistic -- the historical level of spending as a percentage of GDP -- is slightly more complicated, but here too Paul is basically correct. Over the past 40 years, spending has averaged 20.7 percent of GDP, though it has varied a bit over the years. In both the 1970s and the decade beginning in 2000, it was almost exactly 20 percent. In the 1990s, it was slightly higher, while in the 1980s it exceeded 22 percent. 
In fact, the only other years since 1950 in which federal spending exceeded 23 percent of GDP came in 1982 and 1983, with 23.1 percent and 23.5 percent, respectively. That was during and immediately after the last recession that rivaled the current one in severity, the 1981-82 recession. Economic downturns tend to affect this statistic because they slow GDP and increase the demand for government services. Even without special stimulus measures, spending goes up for mandatory items such as food stamps. 
So in 1983, under a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, the government spent just 1.2 percentage points less than the current level, which suggests that the recession shouldn't be ignored as a major reason why spending is so high. 
Still, Paul's larger point is valid. Federal spending is now approximately 25 percent of GDP, and that level is roughly 5 percentage points higher than the historical pattern. So we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-federal-spending-has-risen-25-perce/

Sierra Club says killing high-speed rail project will cost almost 10,000 permanent jobs in Wisconsin
","
The debate over the proposed high-speed rail line from Milwaukee to Madison percolated during the campaign for governor. It flared up on the eve of the election, and has raged since Republican Scott Walker was elected Nov. 2, 2010.

Walker wants the project stopped, even if it means rejecting $810 million in already-approved federal money. After state officials signed contracts in a pre-election push to ensure the project moves forward, outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle has backed off -- but argues ending the project will cost taxpayers $100 million.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker, has said the city  will consider legal options if the train is killed. 
Virtually everyone has entered the fight, often wielding statistics to argue their point. That includes the Sierra Club’s Wisconsin chapter.

Weapon of choice: Jobs.

In a news release and a petition, the Sierra Club argues if the state turns down money for high speed rail, it will ""kill nearly 10,000 permanent Wisconsin jobs.""

If PolitiFact had sound effects, we’d add a loud whistle here.

As in, that’s a lot of jobs.

And as in, let’s have a timeout and get to the bottom of this.

Many different job-related statistics have been bandied about in the debate.

The state Department of Transportation estimates there are the 13,719 jobs involved in construction, engineering, design and train manufacturing tied to the project.

On the campaign trail, Walker argued the project would create only 55 permanent jobs, declaring in an open letter to President Barack Obama on his notrain.com web site: ""That’s $14.5 million per job, not including any hidden costs!""

There, Walker is talking about jobs on the train line itself -- conductors, engineers, ticket-takers and the like. In making the claim, he is purposely choosing the smallest possible number to make his point.

But what of the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs claimed by the Sierra Club and others, some of whom are now citing the Sierra Club as the source of the number? These are jobs not tied directly to the project and as such are hardest to measure hardest to quantify.

Yet the group offers a very specific number: 9,572.

The number comes from a 2006 economicanalysis prepared for Amtrak and nine states, including Wisconsin, a group called the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. The study, prepared by Transportation & Economics Management Systems, became part of the state’s application for the train funding.

The study says: ""The development of the system integrates so many communities, and provides such a wide reaching impact that it will generate on its own a 0.1 percent growth to the region’s economy.""

The sweeping conclusion:

""It will support existing manufacturing and service industries and will foster the growth of new small businesses across the Midwest because of the improved access between communities. It will encourage large businesses to distribute their operations more widely across the Midwest and reap the benefit of providing more efficient ‘back shop’ operations in the highly accessible smaller communities.""

OK, but how do you quantify all that?

If you dig into the study, you find it is based on numerous assumptions and applies multipliers and other formulas to come up with a bottom line: Expanded train service would create 58,000 jobs in the nine states, boost property values by $5 billion and increase urban household income by $1 billion.

Let’s look at some of the factors and underlying assumptions, with an eye toward how the Sierra Club and others are using them when they claim 10,000 permanent jobs are at stake with the Milwaukee to Madison line.

Size of the system

The numbers are based on the prospect of a fully-built system throughout the Midwest. That is, it’s not just high-speed rail from Milwaukee to Madison, but Chicago all the way to Minneapolis. And Chicago to St. Louis. And ultimately connections to Omaha, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland and more.

It even includes a spur to Green Bay, with proposed stations in Menomonee Falls, Fond du Lac, Neenah and Appleton. That piece alone accounts for 3,200 jobs in the study, some of which overlap with the Milwaukee jobs.

But the federal funds allocated so far only cover some pieces of the plan.

And there is no certainty the full system will ever be built -- in Ohio, Governor-elect John Kasich has vowed to block the Cleveland to Cincinnati to Columbus piece.

So, even if Walker were to have a change of heart, the system may be smaller and have fewer connections, which could mean its jobs impact is smaller as well.

Jobs gained, jobs lost

The study suggests that new jobs and opportunities will develop around the new route, as more people take advantage of the high-speed connections. However, as people board the train they are taken off the highways and don’t as often take to the skies.

But the study counts only the new jobs, not any lost ones.

""How many airline pilots or contractors renovating terminals will not be needed?""  said Steven E. Polzin, of the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, an expert on rail proposals, whose group has been criticized for favoring cars and roads.  ""How many auto workers, gas station attendants, road contractors, etc.""

So, part of the equation is missing.

Stations as economic hubs

The study assumes that stations will become economic hubs, prompting other businesses to create jobs nearby. But the stations envisioned are no sure thing.

For instance, the initial Madison station was to be near the airport -- not ideal for someone headed to the Capitol. Now it’ll be in the city center, but going into the city slows down a traveler from Milwaukee to Minneapolis.  

Leaders of some cities, including Brookfield and Wauwatosa, have said they don’t even want a proposed station.

So, more uncertainty.

Other travel options

If the price of gas remains relatively low, there will be less incentive for travelers to get out of their cars and board the train. Indeed, cars may be able to make the trip faster -- assuming there’s no traffic congestion. Initial train speeds are planned to be 79 miles an hour, not including stops; the train would run at higher speeds later.

Whats more, Mitchell International Airport is enjoying an air carrier -- and airfare -- war, which has helped it attract more passengers than ever. There is no telling how long that will last, but low air fares could have an impact on who grabs the train.

Polzin, who reviewed the study at the request of PolitiFact Wisconsin, said it appeared to be professionally done, using methods that are generally accepted.

He noted that such studies are usually done to build support for a project ""and look exclusively at the benefits of the specific option, not the comparative benefits of other options or directing those resources to others purposes.""

Indeed, the state Department of Transportation has not highlighted the 10,000 permanent jobs figure, focusing instead on construction-related jobs for the Milwaukee-to-Madison line.

""That’s work that we did ourselves,"" said Cari Anne Renlund, executive assistant for the state DOT. ""We need to talk about what we know is real.""

We’ll leave Projection Land and return to reality as well.

The Sierra Club’s Wisconsin chapter and others say killing the high-speed train will kill jobs, specifically 9,572 permanent ones. Their number is taken from a professional analysis, but that analysis is based on a host of assumptions -- including that an entire Midwest network is built -- many of which could change. And while the Sierra Club suggests the jobs are an immediate loss, the report itself puts them years into the future.

The Truth-O-Meter isn’t a crystal ball. But it’s got a present-day rating that fits this claim: Barely True.

Sen. John Cornyn says that Fort Hood is the largest military installation in the world
","
Honoring those who died a year ago during a mass shooting at Fort Hood, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn expressed condolences for 13 who were killed on the military base near Killeen and their surviving families and friends. 
""As the largest military installation in the free world, Fort Hood has long been a source of pride for Texans and all Americans,"" Cornyn said in a Nov. 4 statement. 
Media accounts often put Fort Hood and ""largest"" in the same sentence. But we wondered if they — and Cornyn — have that right. 
Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie sent us a November 2009 Reuters news story that says as much: ""Occupying 339 square miles (878 square km) in Central Texas and home to more than 65,000 soldiers, civilian personnel and family members, Fort Hood ranks as the world's largest military installation. It is the largest single employer in Texas and the only military post in the United States capable of supporting two full armored divisions — 1st Calvary Division and the 4th Infantry Division."" 
A quick Google search for ""Fort Hood"" and ""largest military installation"" turns up varying descriptions from other news organizations. ABC News dubbed it the largest military facility in the world, the Telegraph called it the largest U.S. military base in the world, and the Austin American-Statesman has referred to it as both the nation's largest military installation and one of the world's largest military installations. 
The Army's Fort Hood website says that ""like the state of Texas, Fort Hood is big and boasts of being the largest active-duty armored post in the United States Armed Services."" According to a fact sheet issued Aug. 19, 2009 by the Fort Hood Public Affairs Office: ""Fort Hood is the largest single site employer in Texas, directly inserting nearly $3 billion annually into the Texas economy."" And ""the largest combat aviation training area in the free world, comprised of 15,900 square miles, begins on Fort Hood and continues west from Bell and Coryell counties to Runnels and Tom Green counties."" 
Fort Hood spokeswoman Nancy Bourget told us that Fort Hood is the world's largest military post in the world at 214,895 acres. Approximately 52,000 soldiers are at Fort Hood, she said, but she said she didn't know whether that's the most soldiers stationed at a military installation in ""the free world."" Also, that number fluctuates: According to the August 2009 fact sheet, Fort Hood had 45,414 enlisted personnel and 8,909 civilian employees. 
Next, we contacted Wendy Synder, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Department of Defense, who advised caution when talking about the largest military installation in the world.

""There are different installations that support various services, based on their mission and the number of people there,"" she said. ""Are you looking at largest in terms of acreage, people assigned?"" Snyder pointed us to a 2009 department report that sizes up military installations by different criteria. The Naval Station in Pearl Harbor would cost the most to replace. The Nellis Air Force Range in Nevada has the most acreage. Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada has the most buildings. ""But if you look at the size of the buildings, Fort Bragg (in North Carolina) has the largest square footage,"" said Snyder. 
We also called John Pike, director at GlobalSecurity.org, a nonpartisan Virginia-based company that specializes in information about defense and the military. His yardstick: The number of service members assigned to each installation. Pike pointed to California's Fort Irwin as an example of why you shouldn't gauge the size of an installation by acreage: it spans 642,000 acres, but functions primarily as a training ground for soldiers from elsewhere, he said. ""They've only got a few thousand people stationed there, but the facility is gigantic because the brigades have to go and play army,"" he said. 
So we wondered which installation has the largest military population. 
Air Force spokesman Dan Elkins told us that Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio is the largest with 8,479 enlisted personnel and officers, followed by Ramstein Air Base in Germany (7,673) and Langley Air Force Base in Virginia (7,314). 
Lt. Gregory Wolf told us that Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and Camp Pendleton in California have the most Marine Corps personnel, with approximately 40,000-45,000 Marines and sailors stationed at each. 
A Navy lieutenant didn't respond to our query of the largest Naval station in the world as we were finishing this story, but according to GlobalSecurity.org Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia is the largest military station in the world ""based on supported military population."" The 2009 Department of Defense report shows that as of September 2008, Norfolk had 39,636 miltary personnel, though the report cautions that its personnel data ""may not reflect the actual population at a particular site."" 
Lt. Col. Alayne Conway, a spokeswoman with the Army, told us that Fort Bragg and Fort Hood are the Army's largest installations, but that their numbers fluctuate, meaning that one day Bragg could have more personnel than Hood, and another day, Hood more than Bragg. The Defense Department report shows that as of September 2008, Fort Bragg had 50,178 military personnel versus Fort Hood's 52,301. 
Tom McCollum, another spokesman at Fort Bragg, told us that the current population at Fort Bragg is about 55,000 soldiers. Count in civilian employees and families and the installation's population kicks up to about 99,000, he said. 
So, what about Fort Hood's bragging rights? 
In terms of its total acreage, Fort Hood isn't the largest military installation in the world. By a more meaningful gauge — the size of the military population stationed there — Fort Hood is currently second only to Fort Bragg. However, the exact number of soldiers at both posts is always fluctuating, and at times Fort Hood is the largest. 
We rate Cornyn's statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/15/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-fort-hood-largest-military-in/
