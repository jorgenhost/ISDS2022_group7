Facebook post exaggerates seasonal flu deaths for last year
","With a climbing death toll from COVID-19 grabbing daily headlines, some social media users have noted that the seasonal flu kills tens of thousands per year, too. But an April 18 Facebook post exaggerates seasonal flu fatalities:  ""Flu killed 80k people in the U.S. last year. None of you were afraid because the media didn’t tell you to be!""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post appears to rely on a number used as a preliminary estimate for the 2017-18 flu season. The final figure for that year was lower than 80,000. And while the number of people who died from flu during the 2018-19 season is still preliminary, it is estimated to be less than half of what the Facebook post claims as well. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a mathematical model to retroactively estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States each year. The CDC first looks at in-hospital deaths and then uses death certificate data since not all flu deaths are in the hospital. That 80,000 figure stems from a preliminary estimate provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September 2018. At that time, the CDC said early estimates indicated that ""more than 80,000 people died from flu last season"" — a reference to the 2017-18 flu season. The CDC later updated its estimate for 2017-18 to about 61,000 (though the CDC notes that the true range could be as low as 46,404 and as high as 94,987). The estimate for flu deaths for the following year, 2018-19, is 34,157 deaths, but that number is preliminary and will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available, a CDC spokesman told PolitiFact. The Atlantic explained that seasonal flu deaths are hard to tally.  ""Flu deaths are estimated through a model that looks at hospitalizations and death certificates, and accounts for the possibility that many deaths are due to flu but aren’t coded as such,"" The Atlantic wrote. ""If flu deaths were counted like COVID-19 deaths, the number would be substantially lower. This doesn’t mean we’re overestimating the flu. It does mean we are probably underestimating COVID-19."" RELATED: Too soon to compare number of COVID deaths to past outbreaks A Facebook post said that ""flu killed 80k people in the U.S. last year.""  Flu deaths are hard to tally. But we know that in September 2018, the CDC announced a preliminary estimate that flu deaths totaled 80,000. Later, the CDC updated its estimate to a lower number: 61,099 deaths. The Facebook post said ""last year"" which we think would refer to the 2018-19 season. The CDC’s preliminary estimate is about 34,157 deaths.

Tom McClintock Claimed ‘The Flu Killed 80,000 Americans Last Year.’ Here’s Why That’s Misleading.
","Republican Congressman Tom McClintock has expressed a lot of skepticism over the threat of COVID-19. He’s also described stay-at-home orders intended to slow the novel coronavirus as ""profoundly un-American."" ""The more data we receive, the more questions come up over this policy, including how severe is this disease actually?"" McClintock, who represents a large swath of rural California east of Sacramento, said on CapRadio’s Insight program on April 29. ""Does it justify destroying the jobs of millions of Californians? How many poverty-related deaths have we set into motion by plunging Californians into unemployment?"" McClintock then claimed: ""The flu killed 80,000 Americans last year according to the CDC.""  Similar statements about the flu are circulating on social media, in apparent efforts to downplay or question the threat of COVID-19.  There’s a lot that’s still unknown about the coronavirus, and plenty of time to judge whether California’s actions helped or not. But the data on how many Americans died from the flu is pretty clear.  We decided to take a look and fact check McClintock’s claim.  Our research A spokesperson for McClintock initially pointed to a September 2018 Associated Press article headlined ""CDC: 80,000 people died of flu last winter in U.S., highest death toll in 40 years."" The article cited Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as the source of the information. It described the disease’s death toll as the highest in at least four decades. That total referred to the 2017-18 influenza season, which was two years ago. Notably, the CDC revised it down to 61,000 deaths, though many news articles still have the now out-dated 80,000 figure in their headlines. The CDC explained on its website the lower number is ""based on more recently available information,"" and said there’s ""a trade-off between timeliness and accuracy,"" when it publishes its initial estimates.  Last year, the CDC tallied 34,000 deaths during the 2018-19 influenza season, nowhere near McClintock’s figure.  McClintock's spokesperson said the congressman, at the time he made his statement, had not noticed the date of the news article. She said ""it has since been brought to his attention that the CDC later revised its number to 61,000."" In early March, PolitiFact National spoke with infectious disease experts who cautioned against comparing the flu and COVID-19. McClintock’s claim about flu deaths suggests he believes the coronavirus threat is overblown. ""The prevalence of flu is higher at this moment in time,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security, in the March 10 article. ""[But] pound for pound, if you had both viruses, the one that’s more likely to make you die is the coronavirus."" Experts told PolitiFact in early May that COVID-19 still appears more lethal than the seasonal flu, noting that infection fatality rates that may seem small can lead to mounting death tolls. As of May 5, COVID-19 had killed 70,847 Americans, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker.  Our rating Rep. Tom McClintock claimed ""the flu killed 80,000 Americans last year, according to the CDC.""  In reality, 34,000 Americans died of the flu during the 2018-19 influenza season, according to the federal agency. McClintock said he relied on a 2018 news article, which cited the CDC’s initial estimate of 80,000 deaths for the 2017-18 influenza season, a figure the agency later revised down to 61,000 deaths. The outdated figure remains in many 2018 news headlines. In the end, the congressman cited the wrong year and failed to note that a significant downward revision had been made, making his claim misleading at best.  We rate McClintock’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C157600>],/factchecks/2020/may/05/tom-mcclintock/tom-mcclintock-claimed-flu-killed-80000-americans-/

No, the first volunteer in a UK COVID-19 vaccine trial hasn’t died
","As scientists race to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, a screenshot of a frightening headline has been shared on social media.  ""First volunteer in UK coronavirus vaccine trial has died,"" it says above an image of a woman smiling as a health care worker appears to place a small bandage on her upper arm.  An April 25 Facebook post sharing the image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The screenshot comes from a WordPress blog called News NT.  ""Elisa Granato, the first volunteer who availed herself in Oxford for a jab in the first Europe human trial of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus pandemic has died,"" the story says. ""She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated."" Elisa Granato is a real person. She is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford’s zoology department. But as her Twitter bio says, she’s ""100% alive."" The image in the Facebook post is authentic, and shows Granato after she was injected as part of a coronavirus vaccine at the University of Oxford. She was the first of more than 800 people who were recruited for the first human trial in Europe of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the BBC. Granato, who was the first volunteer to be injected, told the BBC: ""I’m a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can."" The Department of Health and Social Care in the United Kingdom also used Twitter to dispel misinformation about Granato’s death.  ""News circulating on social media that the first volunteer in a UK #coronavirus vaccine trial has died is completely untrue,"" the April 26 tweet says. That same day, Fergus Walsh, a medical correspondent for the BBC, tweeted that he spoke to Elisa Granato over Skype and that ""she is very much alive and she told me she is feeling ‘absolutely fine.’"" In a video clip Walsh tweeted of Granato, she says, ""I’m very much alive, thank you."" The University of Oxford has said that any updates about its COVID-19 vaccine trial will appear on its website. ""We are aware there have been and will be rumours and false reports about the progress of the trial,"" an April 26 post on the site says. ""We urge people not to give these any credibility and to not circulate them."" Considering the attention paid to the fake news about her death, Granato’s actual passing would have certainly drawn media coverage. But as we prepared to publish this fact-check, the most recent report we could find about her was a May 5 story in the Oxford Student, a student newspaper at Oxford. It quotes Granato saying she was randomly chosen as the first person to be vaccinated, resulting in ""a lot of attention from the media, countless emails from all over the world and — sadly — some pretty vicious online attacks by individuals and groups opposed to vaccines.""  We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3AC400>],/factchecks/2020/may/05/blog-posting/no-first-volunteer-uk-covid-19-vaccine-trial-hasnt/

Cuomo’s claim on New York’s contributions to federal treasury needs clarification
","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently objected to the idea that the federal government would send money to help state and local governments dealing with high infection rates of Covid-19. The political affiliations of the elected leadership in these states, such as New York, California and Illinois did not go unnoticed by McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. ""Stop the Blue State Bailouts,"" read a news release from McConnell’s office. He suggested in a radio interview that these states declare bankruptcy instead. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, responded swiftly, calling McConnell’s bankruptcy suggestion ""one of the really dumb ideas of all time.""  Cuomo then claimed that New York sends more money to the federal government than it gets in return, and that McConnell’s state regularly gets ""bailed out"" by the rest of the country.  ""He represents the state of Kentucky, okay?"" Cuomo said at a recent press briefing. ""When it comes to fairness, New York state puts much more money into the federal pot than it takes out. Okay? At the end of the year, we put into that federal pot $116 billion more than we take out. Okay? His state, the state of Kentucky, takes out $148 billion more than they put in.""  ""Senator McConnell, who’s getting bailed out here?"" he said later. ""It’s your state that is living on the money that we generate. Your state is getting bailed out. Not my state."" We wondered if Kentucky gets $148 billion more from the federal government than it puts in, and if New York puts in $116 billion more than it takes out. SUNY report We approached Cuomo’s office, which said the governor was referencing an analysis from the Rockefeller Institute, published in January. The Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York, produced the report with support from Cuomo’s executive branch. The report found that New Yorkers sent $116 billion more than they received in benefits over fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, while Kentucky received $148 billion more than it sent over the same period. In each of those years, New York led all other states in sending more money to the federal government than it receives, a measure also known as the ""balance of payments."" Meanwhile, 42 other states received more from the federal treasury in 2018 than they contributed, according to the report. The Rockefeller Institute, using preliminary data, estimates that in the year ending on Sept. 30, 2018, New Yorkers sent $22 billion more to the federal government than they received, more than the amount sent by residents of the next two states that gave more than they got: New Jersey, with a deficit of $11.5 billion, and Massachusetts, with a deficit of $9.1 billion. When calculating the balance of payments on a per-person basis, New Yorkers paid $1,125 more than they received, more than all but three other states, according to the report. A state’s balance of payments to the federal government can be affected by whether a state has military bases, defense contractors, or is home to a large population of federal workers, all of which require the federal government to spend money in that state. Also, the number of its residents that receive Social Security, Medicare, and welfare benefits, or whether a state is home to a lot of high-income households that pay more federal taxes, affects the balance of payments. In New York, the deficit between taxes paid and federal funds received is driven by high earners and businesses paying more in taxes, according to the Rockefeller Institute.  New York’s independently elected comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, a Democrat, also tracks New York’s balance of payments. In January, DiNapoli found that in 2018 New York’s deficit was higher, and that Empire State taxpayers sent $26.6 billion more to Washington, D.C., than the state received in federal funds. Kentucky, meanwhile, received $29.9 billion more in federal funds than its taxpayers paid, DiNapoli found. The Comptroller’s Office analyzed New York’s balance of payments in federal fiscal year 2013, 2016, and 2017. The cumulative deficit in the balance of payments from 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018 was $111.5 billion, according to the comptroller. ""As in past years, the imbalance largely reflects New York’s comparatively high federal tax payments,"" DiNapoli wrote. ""The State generated nearly $254 billion, 8% of the $3.2 trillion in federal tax receipts. By contrast, the $227 billion in federal spending the State received represented 6% of the nationwide total, virtually the same as New York’s share of the U.S. population."" The late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who served from 1977 to 2001, brought attention to this imbalance of payments in a report he issued annually, known as ""the fisc."" In his 1985 report, for example, Moynihan found that New Yorkers had paid $2.1 billion more than the state received in federal funds during the previous year.   PolitiFact fact-checked a similar claim in 2018, specifically that New York is a ""donor state,"" and found it to be True. Our reporting then showed that in a system of progressive taxes, where wealthier people pay more, and that money is redistributed to people in need, it’s not unusual that states with wealthy residents give more than they get. Our ruling Cuomo said that ""at the end of the year,"" New York puts $116 billion more into the federal treasury than the state receives in federal funds, while Kentucky receives $148 billion more than it contributes. Cuomo was referencing figures from a report from the Rockefeller Institute, which has been widely cited. However, a listener to Cuomo’s news conference would likely think that these figures represent yearly contributions. They are actually four-year cumulative totals contained in the Rockefeller Institute analysis. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C203640>],/factchecks/2020/may/05/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-claim-new-yorks-contributions-federal-treas/

No shortage expected, but meat supply could see new constraints
","Outbreaks of COVID-19 at meat-packing plants around the country — including several in Wisconsin — have raised concern nationwide over meat supplies. But one local official says those fears are overblown. In a Facebook post April 30, 2020, Waukesha County Executive Paul Farrow posted a image comparing ""rumor"" and ""fact"" about the meat supply locally. It read: RUMOR: The United States is facing a meat shortage because processing plants are closing due to COVID-19. FACT: Most meat processing plants across the US are still open. You may see short-term changes in meat selection or prices, but a shortage is not expected. Is Farrow right that no shortage is expected? There have been clusters of COVID-19 cases linked to meat packing facilities across the country, USA TODAY reported on April 22, 2020. Trump ordered meat packing to stay open, deeming them a ""critical"" industry. Wisconsin has seen a number of outbreaks. In Brown County, 290 cases are associated with JBS Packerland employees, 203cases with American Foods Group, and 35 cases with Salm Partners as of May 1, as reported by the Green Bay Press-Gazette.  In Cudahy, officials reported 85 COVID-19 cases at the Patrick Cudahy plant as of May 1, according to FOX-6. Asked for evidence of the claim, a spokeswoman for Farrow said the county’s emergency operations center reached out to local farmers and businesses and consulted with the Wisconsin Department of Trade and Consumer Protection to get an overview of the meat supply. ""Right now the overwhelming message for members of the public is not to panic buy or overstock meat supplies,"" Nicole Armendariz said in a May 1 email. ""At this time, there are some limitations to certain meat items and fluctuations in prices, but meat is available. There are concerns that panic buying by consumers could aggravate existing limitations."" Armendariz also noted local suppliers said they have enough meat to meet customer demand at this point. So Farrow’s evidence is focused on Waukesha County, which is referenced in the graphic he posted. But experts said the outbreak has disrupted the supply chain for meat throughout the country. USA TODAY reported on April 30 that the U.S. will see meat shortages despite Trump’s order for meat packing plants to remain open. Jayson Lusk, head of Department of Agricultural Economics of Purdue University, told USA TODAY, ""The meat sector is in a real serious, critical condition."" Lusk said there will just be limited availability of certain products, depending on where you live. However, Lusk and other experts said most Americans will still be able to buy meat. USA TODAY reported meat production in the week of April 20 was 75% of what it had been that time last year. Poultry remains available, and only 13.5% of retailers were out of stock of poultry as of April 27 -- better than the week prior. Andrew Stevens, professor of agricultural and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said shortages could happen because the meat supply chain is complex and relies on refrigeration in transport and production facilities. ""It is definitely reasonable that individual people and individual retail outlets could see meat shortages of particular products, especially for short periods of time,"" Stevens said. ""The reason why that would make sense to me is that a lot of these supply chains are much more based on individual contracts between suppliers and retailers, where a particular weak link in that supply chain could lead to a short-run breakdown."" If a meat packing plant goes offline and a grocer only gets a particular meat product through them, it will take some time for that supply chain to adjust and for retailers to find other suppliers, Stevens said. Stevens said to think of the concept of meat shortages along a time scale.  In the short run for individual products and stores: meat products are going to be affected the way produce has been affected where it may not be in stock for a few days.  In the long run: as the economy adjusts to new realities, retailers will adjust to short-run disruptions and consumers may see higher prices.  He said consumers will likely not lose complete access to meat products. And in the longer term – from a few months to within the year – nodes of the supply chain will adjust to any new production constraints. Farrow said a meat shortage is ""not expected,"" labeling claims to the contrary as rumors. The key point here is how one defines a shortage. Farrow does not consider fewer choices and higher prices in the short-term a ""shortage,"" while other experts say it is -- just one limited in scope. Experts agree that Americans will still be able to buy meat. We define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.

Scott Fitzgerald says Wisconsin has no contact tracing program “we can speak of.” Not true.
","Facing a growing push to re-open Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers has laid out a series of key benchmarks for easing social distancing restrictions, dubbed the ""Badger Bounce Back"" plan. The state is tracking data on cases, symptoms and hospital usage, but Evers has also pointed to three other logistical elements: access to personal protective gear, expanded testing and expanded contact tracing. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald homed in on the last of those while criticizing Evers in an April 26, 2020, interview with WISN-TV’s ""UpFront"" program. ""We need better information. More explanations,"" said Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. ""They have no tracing program going on that we can speak of."" Contact tracing, done by public health officials, is the process of supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infections. Steps include identifying who else they had contact with, warning those other individuals and educating everyone exposed on how to protect themselves and others through isolation and other steps. It’s a fundamental element of the pandemic response, helping to identify clusters of cases early on to minimize the spread. Does Wisconsin really have no such program ""to speak of""? Asked for evidence of the claim, Fitzgerald spokesman Alec Zimmerman said this: ""The point he was trying to make is the same that (Wisconsin Department of Health Services) makes daily in the briefings -- tracing as it is now isn’t enough."" Zimmerman noted the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported on shortcomings in the system. For instance, the newspaper contacted 10 people who had the disease or lost loved ones within the first few weeks of the outbreak, and seven said they were never contacted by health officials as of April 23 when the story published. A story published May 1, 2020, detailed how Milwaukee has added staffing and made other changes to improve the tracing program. Health officials across the nation are scrambling to add contact tracers. The number of tracers needed for the pandemic is about double the usual need, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. ""Public health nurses do this regularly, for example, for sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis,"" DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email. ""What is new in this space is mainly the large scale of cases and the speed at which the virus is able to spread – which means we need additional contact tracers to do this work so that we are able to reach each identified exposed person really quickly."" DHS doesn’t know how many tracers are working in Wisconsin or how many tracing investigations have been done since those efforts are lead by local health departments. DHS Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said at the April 28 COVID-19 media briefing that the goal is to have 1,000 contact tracers ""between the DHS surge capacity and the capacity of local health departments."" The state had trained 400 contact tracers as of April 30 to provide ""surge capacity"" for local health departments, Goodsitt said. The number trained was closer to 250 when Fitzgerald made his claim. ""The state surge team has been part of more than 1,100 interviews (as of April 30), which is just a fraction of calls our local public health tracers have made,"" Goodsitt said. The number of tracers varies widely among some of the state’s larger health departments. As of April 25, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee Health Department had dedicated 19 people to tracing, about 8% of its staff (though that was up to 54 by May 1, 2020). The Washington Ozaukee Health Department had dedicated 15 people, or about 38% of its 40-person staff. CBS 58 reported April 23 that Waukesha County had 30 contact tracers. Milwaukee officials told the Journal Sentinel the initial tracing interview had been conducted within a week for 92% of all positive cases in the city, but it’s an extensive process. They make about 10 contacts for every positive case. Fitzgerald said Wisconsin has ""no tracing program going on that we can speak of."" Wisconsin — like every other state — is still ramping up the capacity for tracing. And there have clearly been gaps in the work so far. But it’s a significant exaggeration to summarize that as having no program when hundreds of people are doing this work around the state. Tracing was being done around the state when Fitzgerald said this, and those efforts have continued to ramp up since.  We rate this claim Mostly False.

Healthy people have been confined before COVID-19, contrary to lawmaker’s claim
","Have healthy people ever been the subject of a quarantine in St. Louis or Kansas City?  Missouri state Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin says they haven’t. O’Laughlin (R-Shelbina) said in part of a since-deleted March 22 Facebook post: ""I see no time in the history of this country when perfectly healthy people have been basically confined to their homes or only able to do essential things as in Kansas City or St. Louis."" O’Laughlin’s statement referred to stay-at-home orders announced March 21 in Kansas City and St. Louis city and county. At the time of O’Laughlin’s statement, the state of Missouri had not issued a stay-at-home order.  The statewide order expires May 4 and will be replaced with a phase-in of businesses and activities.  How does stay-at-home in 2020 compare historically? We went looking — and found holes in O’Laughlin’s assertion nationally and in the state. When we reached out to O’Laughlin for context, she called the stay-at-home orders in St. Louis and Kansas City ""expanded quarantines"" and said she believes they are taking away Missouri residents’ rights. The CDC says quarantines restrict movements of sick people. A statewide stay-at-home order says residents should ""avoid leaving their homes or other places of residence."" The order has exceptions, including allowing people to get groceries, prescriptions or gas. People are encouraged to get fresh air and get outside but abide by social distancing guidelines. Were there similar restrictions placed on healthy people before COVID-19? One place to start looking is the 1918 flu pandemic. Restrictions then looked a whole lot like today. O’Laughlin’s claim encompassed ""the history of the country."" Our fact check on a statement by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cited several studies of cities' responses to the Spanish flu in which most public places were closed.  We couldn’t find a specific ""stay-at-home"" order for the 1918 flu in St. Louis. Still, the city’s health commissioner ordered that all public gatherings like sports events, schools and churches be canceled.  All non-essential businesses were closed. Only banks, newspapers, embalmers and coffin makers were allowed to be open.  We looked at newspaper pages from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that were archived on newspapers.com. Some of the headlines in the late fall of 1918 included: ""Influenza Closing Order Extended to All Churches."" On the same page, a sub-headline reads ""Playgrounds closed"" (Oct. 8). ""Governor Forbids All Public Gatherings in the State"" (Oct. 9) . ""No Public Funerals"" (Oct. 15). The 2020 St. Louis citywide order said in part: ""This order allows residents to continue meeting their basic needs and that essential services are provided; however, residents will be required to stay at home when possible.""  What about Kansas City? According to an article by KCUR, the city in 1918 never saw heavy restrictions because many people and businesses resisted. Schools were closed but were opened back up in October 1918. The city’s mortality rate from the the Spanish flu was higher than most cities in the country.  O’Laughlin said in a Facebook post: ""I see no time in the history of this country when perfectly healthy people have been basically confined to their homes or only able to do essential things as in Kansas City or St. Louis."" Many cities during the Spanish flu outbreak enacted similar restrictions. And in Missouri, based on St. Louis’ efforts to combat the 1918 flu pandemic, we can safely say that this ""time in history"" did occur. People were restricted on what they could do. Public gatherings were prohibited. Closed or canceled non-essential businesses, in-person churches and sports events also occurred then and now.

Claim that New York Times 'censored' Joe Biden sex assault story is wrong
","As pressure built on Joe Biden to answer a sexual assault allegation made against him, the New York Times was accused of squelching a story to help the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.   ""New York Times Editor Admits Biden Sexual Assault Story was Censored at Behest of Biden Campaign"" was the headline of an article on FrontPageMag.com, a website published by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, which identifies itself as a conservative think-tank. The FrontPageMag.com article was shared in a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It concerns a 2,500-word New York Times article published April 12 that examined the allegation. Following its publication, the Times removed 13 words from one sentence after receiving an objection from the Biden campaign. The deleted words were not about the most recent allegation, one that comes from Biden’s former staff assistant, Tara Reade. Rather, the removed portion referred to previously reported descriptions of Biden’s past physical contact with women. These descriptions are elsewhere in the story. In a series of media interviews starting with a podcast released March 25, Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her when he was a senator.  She said the assault occurred in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building in the spring of 1993, when Reade was a 29-year-old staff assistant to Biden. Reade said Biden pushed her against a wall, groped her and penetrated her with his fingers. In April 2019, around the time several other women complained of unwanted physical contact with Biden, Reade told a California newspaper that Biden had inappropriately touched her, but she did not allege any sexual assault. Biden’s campaign denied Reade’s sexual assault allegation. After some Democrats pressed him to respond, the former vice president appeared on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" May 1 and released a statement denying the allegations. ""I’m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened,"" he said. For their lengthy April 12 article, New York Times reporters spoke to several people who worked in the Senate office with Reade who said they didn’t recall discussion of such an incident. The Times reported that Reade said she complained about Biden’s behavior but did not mention the alleged assault to Marianne Baker, Biden’s executive assistant, and two top aides, Dennis Toner and Ted Kaufman. They declined to take action, Reade said.  Two friends of Reade’s would only talk to the newspaper if their names weren’t used. One said that Reade told her about the alleged assault in 1993. The other said Reade in 2008 told her that Biden had touched her inappropriately and that she’d had a traumatic experience working in his office. The FrontPageMag.com article homed in on a sentence that Times executive editor Dean Baquet said was edited after publication. The sentence was found in the sixth paragraph of the New York Times story, which initially read (emphasis ours): ""No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses, and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable."" FrontPageMag.com claimed the second sentence was ""deleted"" after the article was posted online. Web archives show the sentence was not deleted, but edited so that it ended at ""Biden"": ""No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden."" There is no editor’s notation on the online article disclosing the post-publication change. Here’s what FrontPageMag.com ignores in its analysis: Two paragraphs earlier in the Times article, the story reads that, ""Last year, Ms. Reade and seven other women came forward to accuse Mr. Biden of kissing, hugging or touching them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.""  Nothing about that paragraph was changed. FrontPageMag published its article on April 14, the day after the Times ran a question-and-answer article in which media columnist Ben Smith interviewed Baquet. In the Q&A, Baquet explains why the sentence was trimmed: Smith: ""I want to ask about some edits that were made after publication, the deletion of the second half of the sentence: ‘The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.’ Why did you do that?"" Baquet: ""Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct. And that’s not what the sentence was intended to say."" Smith: ""And why not explain that?"" Baquet: ""We didn’t think it was a factual mistake. I thought it was an awkward phrasing issue that could be read different ways and that it wasn’t something factual we were correcting. So I didn’t think that was necessary."" In an email to PolitiFact, Baquet responded directly to the FrontPageMag claim, saying that the paper didn’t make the change at Biden’s behest: ""They reached out and questioned the language, and we decided on our own that they had a point. That happens pretty routinely. That head(line) makes it look like they ordered us to change. ""We didn't do an editor's note because I didn't think the change rose to that level. My honest view is that it has become a large issue because of the politicization of the case, not because this was a huge change. I thought doing an interview with Ben was an honest way to discuss the story, how we made the decision to run it, and why we made the change. Ben asked hard questions and I tried to answer them. I thought that was pretty visible and transparent."" An article from the website of a conservative organization claimed ""New York Times Editor Admits Biden Sexual Assault Story was Censored at Behest of Biden Campaign."" The Times removed 13 words from a 2,500-word story about a new sexual assault allegation against Biden. The Times’ editor said that after being contacted by the Biden campaign, the paper deleted, for better clarity, a portion of a sentence that referred to Biden’s previous physical contact with women. The same words that were taken out of the sentence remain in the story two paragraphs before, stating that women had spoken out about Biden ""kissing, hugging or touching them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.""  For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A6EB80>],/factchecks/2020/may/04/facebook-posts/Claim-New-York-Times-censored-Biden-sex-assault/

Claim about congressional pensions is wrong, once again
","A specious claim that’s been making the rounds for about two decades has recently resurfaced: that members of Congress can receive a pension equal to their full pay after serving just one term. But it’s no more accurate now than it ever was. A Facebook post says, ""No one has been able to explain to me why young men and women who serve in the U.S. Military for 20 years, risking their lives protecting freedom, … only get 50% of their base pay. While politicians hold their political positions in the safe confines of the capital, protected by these same men and women, and receive full pay retirement after serving 1 term! Re-post if you believe this is absolutely WRONG."" The part about military pensions is somewhat accurate, but incomplete and outdated. However, the part about pensions for politicians — which we take to mean congressional pensions, since few executive branch politicians serve ""terms"" — is flat-out wrong. Here, we’ll tackle both parts of the claim. U.S. Marines near a military base in al-Hamra, United Arab Emirates, on March 23, 2020. (AP) For years, the Facebook post’s description of the military pension would have been in the ballpark. If you joined the military before September 1980, you get 50% of your final base pay after 20 years of service, or 100% of base pay if you retire after 40 years. If you joined between September 1980 and July 1986, you would be subject to the same percentages but a slightly different formula. Your pension would be based on the average of your three highest pay years, rather than your final base pay. If you joined between August 1986 and December 2017, you could choose between the previous option or a plan under which you get a bonus on your 15th service anniversary in exchange for a lower retirement pay. Under each of the systems above, a service member would qualify for a pension only after many years of service. Those with shorter military careers, who by some estimates account for about 80 percent of service members, would get no pension at all. That changed under a new law that took effect in 2018. It governs pensions for individuals who entered the military starting that year.  Under this system, service members get pensions equivalent to 40% of their base pay after 20 years. But service members would also have a Thrift Savings Plan, which is similar to a 401(k), and after two years, the military would match contributions up to 5%. For the first time, service members will have a plan that can be rolled over after they leave the military, even if their departure comes just a few years after they sign up. So the current military pension system is more complex than the Facebook post suggests, but the post does roughly reflect the system. However, the post’s description of congressional pensions is simply inaccurate. Members elected prior to 1984 belong to a pension program known as the Civil Service Retirement System. But only five current House members and two senators were elected prior to 1984, so the vast majority belong to the successor plan, known as the Federal Employees’ Retirement System.  The latter plan isn’t just for lawmakers; it’s available to every federal employee. It includes Social Security, a pension and the Thrift Savings Plan. (Read a summary of the system on the website of the nonpartisan Congressional Institute and in this report by the Congressional Research Service.) Under either plan, a member of Congress can receive a pension only after serving for five years, although previous service as a federal employee can count toward that five-year vesting period. To be eligible, lawmakers must contribute part of their salary into the pension plan while they’re in Congress. To collect, the lawmaker must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of federal service, or be any age with 25 years of service. (The Constitution dictates a minimum age of 25 years for House members and 30 for senators.) Under the current pension law, the size of the pension is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7% for the first 20 years of service and 1% for subsequent years. Here’s an example, using a typical 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year: The pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, multiply $174,000 (which is the average salary over the last three years) times 20 years times 0.017. Then, multiply $174,000 times 5 years times 0.01 and add that number to the first calculation. The total: about $67,860 per year. A three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,745 for six years of work. That's generous, but not close to full pay. In fact, federal law prevents members of Congress from getting full pay as their pension. By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of his or her final salary. Under the formula, it would take 67 years of federal service to hit that 80% limit. For context, no House member or senator has ever served more than 60 years in office. So, to recap: Retired lawmakers don’t ""receive full pay"" for their pension, and unless they were already a federal employee for three years before entering Congress, they wouldn’t be vested after serving just ""1 term."" And the earliest anyone could start receiving a pension is 50 years of age. The Facebook post said, politicians ""receive full pay retirement after serving 1 term!"" The description of the military pension is in the ballpark, but incomplete and somewhat outdated. However, the description of the congressional pension is thoroughly inaccurate. Retired lawmakers don’t ""receive full pay"" for their pension, and unless they were already a federal employee for three years before entering Congress, they wouldn’t be vested after serving just ""1 term."" Meanwhile, the earliest any retired lawmaker could start receiving a pension is 50 years of age. We rate the statement False. Correction, May 6, 2020: This version corrects the pension calculations in the examples for the 25-year and five-year member of Congress. The rating remains the same.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972464C0>],/factchecks/2020/may/04/facebook-posts/claim-about-congressional-pensions-wrong-once-agai/

Tucker Carlson says coronavirus isn’t as deadly as we thought. Experts disagree
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson railed against continued statewide shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, claiming in a recent TV segment that they did little to flatten the curve and that ""the virus just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was."" Citing recent studies from hotspots such as New York, Carlson said the virus is ""a full order of magnitude less deadly"" than public health officials warned.  ""The virus just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was, all of us, including on this show,"" he said. ""Everybody thought it was, but it turned out not to be.""  More than 65,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s in spite of widespread mitigation efforts to reduce the spread. So how deadly is it? Estimating the lethality of COVID-19 has been a key question for epidemiologists. In the middle of a pandemic, moving targets make the death rate difficult to pin down. But experts told us Carlson’s statement is off-track. Many early mortality estimates were based on official counts of confirmed cases, but epidemiologists were consistent in saying those raw numbers didn’t reflect the virus’s deadliness with complete precision. Ideally, epidemiologists could divide the number of deaths by the number of infections to calculate what’s known as the ""infection fatality rate."" But there’s no way to get a complete count of the number of infected individuals, largely because so many mild cases go unreported.  Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, said there could be as many as 12.5 COVID-19 infections for every confirmed case in the U.S.  Still, scientists work with the data they have, even if it’s evolving and varies with patient demographics and location. Some of the first widely reported death rates were what are called ""case fatality rates,"" which are calculated by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of reported cases.  On March 3, for example, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died — a case fatality rate. Experts told us at the time that the 3.4% was only a snapshot, and one that likely undercounted people with mild symptoms. A WHO spokesperson said it would ""change over time."" The global case fatality rate has actually risen since then. As of May 3, the WHO had tallied 3,349,786 confirmed cases worldwide and 238,628 deaths, for a case fatality rate of about 7%. Now, tests for antibodies in the blood of people exposed to the coronavirus are offering the first glimpses at what the infection fatality rate could be in states such as New York and California. The tests haven’t all been as accurate as many experts would like, and the studies of them haven’t all been peer-reviewed. ""It remains very clear that we do not know the precise mortality of COVID-19 infection,"" said the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Myron Cohen. But their preliminary results suggested the infection fatality rate may be below 1%, handing fodder to some who say the COVID-19 threat is overblown. Carlson said the new information shows COVID-19 is less deadly than expected. On his show, he cited widely disputed findings from two California doctors. A Fox News spokesperson also pointed to a White House press conference, a JP Morgan chart, and recent antibody studies in California and New York to support it. But Shaman, the epidemiologist, said Carlson was ""cherry-picking evidence."" Many early figures were case fatality rates, while the estimates reported as a result of recent antibody studies are infection fatality rates. They shouldn’t be conflated, Shaman said. Seemingly small infection fatality rates can also cause mounting deaths. The New York study showed the state’s infection fatality rate to be around 0.5%, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.  That matches estimates from a model Shaman constructed, which he said put the U.S. infection fatality rate at 0.56%. But in a worst-case scenario where 70% of Americans are infected, a 0.5% rate could amount to 1.2 million U.S. deaths, Shaman said.  And as we’ve reported, the death toll may be higher than we know.  The infection fatality rate for the flu, which kills thousands of Americans annually, hovers under 0.1% and is calculated annually using a mathematical model that estimates the disease burden. There are other problems with Carlson’s sources, including the clip he played of one of two California physicians who gained national attention for calling to end the shutdowns. The doctors, who own an urgent care clinic, used the infection rate among patients tested at their clinic to extrapolate to the entire state and put the death rate at a tiny 0.03%.  The University of Washington’s Carl Bergstrom wrote on Twitter that this amounts to ""sampling bias"" because patients at an urgent care clinic likely think they’re sick. The doctors’ calculations are like ""estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court,"" he said.  The problem with this approach is that during a pandemic, the people who come into an urgent care clinic are not a random sample of the population. A large fraction of them are coming in precisely because they suspect that they have the disease.This generates sampling bias. The video was ""emphatically condemn(ed)"" by the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine; it was also removed from YouTube. Another report cited by the Fox News spokesperson, from the University of Southern California, followed a controversial study from Stanford University.  A number of experts have since warned that both studies used antibody tests known to yield false positive results. (A USC spokesperson said results were adjusted to account for that.)  Carlson’s claim that COVID-19 was projected to be deadlier for infected patients also discounts what many experts said months ago. ""No one knowledgeable thought it was as deadly as known deaths divided by known cases,"" said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  ""Every responsible epidemiologist has been saying that the number of cases is certainly more than those we know about, especially in the U.S., where testing has been inadequate."" Many experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said preliminary case fatality rates could be inflated. The WHO said early on, including in mid- February, that the infection fatality rate would be lower than the initial case fatality rates.  The Imperial College of London, which projected in March that the U.S. could see 2.2 million deaths if it had no response, estimated that 0.9% of infected COVID-19 patients would die. ""It is surprisingly mild only to those who were not listening to competent epidemiologists, and it is in fact considerably worse than seasonal flu,"" Lipsitch said. Carlson said the coronavirus ""just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was."" Scientists warned early in the outbreak that the raw number of confirmed cases didn’t give a fully accurate picture of mortality.  It’s misleading for Carlson to compare early case fatality rates — which divide the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases — with newer estimates of the infection fatality rate. The infection fatality rate should be lower, as experts have said for months. It’s premature to say as a matter of fact that a far rosier picture has emerged.

Without evidence, Trump claims Biden sent him apology letter over China travel ban
","President Donald Trump repeated the misleading claim that former Vice President Joe Biden called him xenophobic for banning travel from China in response to the coronavirus outbreak.  Trump added a new wrinkle on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, claiming that Biden not only called the travel restrictions xenophobic, but also apologized for the remark ""with a letter on a Friday night."" ""Biden has now written a letter of apology because I did the right thing,"" Trump said during a May 3 virtual town hall with Fox News. ""He actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying ‘he made the right move,'"" Trump said later. ""It wasn’t well played by the press, but he said I made the right move.""  There may be a simple reason why the letter Trump described didn’t get media coverage: There is no evidence such a letter exists. ""Never happened,"" said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. Neither the Trump campaign nor the White House responded to our requests for comment in time for publication, and Trump wasn’t asked to substantiate his claim during the town hall.   We found no public record of any Friday-night letter of apology — or any letter of apology — from Biden on Twitter, Google or the Nexis news archive database. Other political reporters and fact-checkers have reached the same conclusion. On Jan. 31, the Trump administration announced temporary restrictions on travel into the U.S. for immigrants and non-immigrants who had recently been ""physically present"" in China, with exceptions made for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their family members.  The move followed similar decisions from roughly 45 other countries and announcements from a number of airlines that they would be suspending flights between China and the U.S. while the outbreak ran its course. Trump has repeatedly touted the policy, crediting it with saving ""hundreds of thousands of lives"" during the Fox News town hall.  Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, declared Biden’s support for the China restrictions months later in a statement to CNN on April 3, a Friday. CNN posted its story in the afternoon. ""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" Bedingfeld told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too."" But Biden never explicitly called the travel restrictions xenophobic, as Trump has claimed.  At a campaign event on Jan. 31, the same day Trump announced the China travel restrictions, Biden cited Trump’s ""xenophobia"" but did not specifically mention the administration’s policy. He said that in a time of ""crisis with the coronavirus,"" the ""credibility of a president is most needed."" ""This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science,"" he said. The following day, Biden tweeted, ""We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.""  We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency. Biden used the word twice more in March. But one comment was in reference to Trump calling the coronavirus a ""foreign"" virus, and the second was not clearly in reference to the travel policy. Bates, Biden’s spokesman, told us in March that Biden ""has decried Trump's xenophobia for years, and was saying that it shouldn't influence the U.S. approach to this outbreak."" ""This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions,"" he said. An April ad from the Trump campaign selectively edited a clip of Biden to make it seem like the former vice president admitted to complimenting Trump for the China travel restrictions. But in its full context, the clip shows Biden was criticizing Trump for not acting with enough ""urgency."" Trump said Biden called the ban on travel coming in from China ""xenophobic,"" and that ""he actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying ‘he made the right move.’"" We found no record of any letter or apology from Biden. Trump appears to be citing a campaign official’s statement to the media in support of Trump’s decision.  Biden has used the word ""xenophobic"" several times in reference to Trump, but not directly in reference to the China travel policy.

Rudy Giuliani wrong about US policy, grant amount to Wuhan virus lab
","A virology lab in Wuhan, China, continues to draw scrutiny for work it did on bat viruses as part of American-funded research. To be clear, there is no sign that the coronavirus that has swept around the globe was bioengineered, but suspicions run high, including from President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani tweeted April 26, ""Why did the US (NIH) in 2017 give $3.7m to the Wuhan Lab in China? Such grants were prohibited in 2014. Did Pres. Obama grant an exception?"" Why did the US (NIH) in 2017 give $3.7m to the Wuhan Lab in China?Such grants were prohibited in 2014.Did Pres. Obama grant an exception? To answer Giuliani’s question, no exception was granted, because none was needed.  The policy that hit pause on certain research in 2014 didn’t apply to the sort of work that was being done in Wuhan. Giuliani’s wrong about what the policy was, and he’s wrong about the dollars that went to the Wuhan lab. Let’s unpack this. In the summer of 2014, a cardboard box of vials labeled Variola was found in an ordinary cold storage room on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The variola virus causes smallpox, and it had no place outside of a secure biological facility. In August 2014, the Obama administration called for a nationwide stand-down and review for all labs working with potentially deadly biological agents. On Oct. 17, 2014, the White House announced it would not fund new projects that involved a certain kind of research called gain-of-function. Like the phrase suggests, gain-of-function research boosts the ability of a pathogen to cause disease. Why would anyone want to do that, outside of building a biological weapon? Well, this sort of work can help spot potential threats and give researchers time to craft ways to thwart a new virus. Administration officials said that until they had new policies, this sort of work on viruses that cause influenza, MERS and SARS (two new diseases that had triggered pandemics) wouldn’t get new money, and they asked labs with research underway to hit pause. But the administration specifically let other research continue. The language is technical, but the key word is ""naturally."" ""The funding pause will not apply to the characterization or testing of naturally occurring influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses unless there is a reasonable expectation that these tests would increase transmissibility or pathogenicity,"" the Oct. 17 policy said. The Wuhan lab worked with naturally occurring viruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology was participating in a project led by the New York-based organization EcoHealth Alliance. That’s a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do.  In 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed work that focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Teams in the field gathered blood from bats and local residents. They sent the samples to Wuhan where the initial analysis took place. The point is, any viruses found emerged in nature. ""The policy would not prohibit government agencies from funding any and all research at Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" said Gregory Koblentz, George Mason University associate professor of biodefense. It’s possible, Koblentz said, that some work done as part of the larger U.S. project might have involved gain-of-function experiments, but whether those would fall under the specific types of gain-of-function research covered by the restriction was doubtful. ""To the best of my understanding, Mr. Giuliani’s claim is not consistent with reality,"" said  John Holdren, one of the architects of the Obama administration’s policy and a former assistant to the president for science and technology. The work the lab did for the project did not involve gain-of-function research, but it is possible that other projects at the lab did. Added Robert Kessler with the EcoHealth Alliance: ""We have not ever participated in gain-of-function research. Nor have we ever been funded to participate in gain-of-function research."" Giuliani’s claim has another flaw — timing. The moratorium policy took effect October 2014. The grant was approved at the end of May, five months earlier. We reached out to Giuliani and did not hear back. Giuliani said the National Institutes of Health gave $3.7 million to the lab in Wuhan in 2017.

No, homeless people are not immune from catching COVID-19.
","Amid the coronavirus crisis, there has been much talk about immunity, including how long those who have had COVID-19 may be immune from getting it again. But what if there was a particular group of people who had natural immunity to the virus? If you go to Facebook, you might believe it is true. Here is one post, from April 21, 2020, that appears to have originated in California. ""Homeless line the streets in Cali, no bathing, washing hands, showering, clean clothes, little medical attention, no sanitizers, yet they aren’t piling up dead on the side of the street like logs,"" the post said. ""How are they so immune?""  It includes a photo of an encampment, where dozens of homeless people are living in close quarters. Among the comments on the post: ""That's been on my mind this whole time, if it's so contagious and deadly then why aren't they dropping like crazy?"" And: ""Yup and people still believe this is about a virus."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So, that prompted us to dive in. Are the homeless somehow immune from the coronavirus? In a word: No. Homelessness is a big problem across the country.  In 2018, there were more than 552,000 people experiencing homelessness on a single night in America, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. In California alone, where this post originated, estimates show there are nearly 130,000 homeless people.  And, contrary to the Facebook claim, homeless shelters in cities across the country are dealing with outbreaks of the virus.  In a study done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in four cities -- Seattle, Boston, San Francisco and Atlanta -- out of 1,192 residents tested at shelters, 25% were positive. As for employees of the shelters, out of 313 people tested, 11% tested positive.  People experiencing homelessness are also more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, which also makes them higher risk, according to the CDC. For instance, physical health problems, mental health problems and substance abuse issues -- or a combination of some or all of those -- can make it harder for the body to defend itself against the virus.  In addition, because of the conditions those experiencing homelessness face -- from living in close quarters to being unable to readily wash hands -- they are at a higher risk, according to a fact sheet from the National Alliance to End Homelessness.  A COVID-19 factsheet from the group notes those over the age of 65 are more likely to become ill from the virus. Those who experience long-term homelessness tend to track the same health conditions as senior citizens, but at a younger age. It can also be difficult for the homeless to maintain social distancing due to crowded shelters, according to an April 2, 2020 report from Wired.com. And when shelters reach their capacity, many are forced to sleep outside.  In Milwaukee, those experiencing homelessness are able to take refuge at the Saint Francis de Sales Seminary, where 110 rooms were set up to isolate those with coronavirus symptoms from those who are at high risk of contracting the virus, according to a March 29, 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Plans called for those staying at the seminary to receive three meals a day and be checked on by members of the National Guard and the Milwaukee Health Department. 
  ""Most places do not have easily accessible health care (for the homeless), and then there are people who for many reasons are not going to rush to speak to any authorities -- police, medical, social service, etc. -- because of issues like mental health, addiction, criminal background or just plain suspicion,"" said David Wagner, an emeritus professor of social work and sociology at the University of Southern Maine, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""I think that (COVID-19 infection) rates are generally going to be higher, if anything, among the homeless than the housed.""  A post making the rounds on Facebook claims homeless populations are immune to COVID-19. Not only is there no basis for this claim -- or claiming that any group has natural immunity to a virus that emerged just months ago -- the reality says otherwise. A CDC study of shelters in four major cities found that 25% of those tested were positive. In addition, tests of workers at the shelters came back with 11% positive. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

Gift shop selling COVID-19 coins is not from the White House
","Headlines going around social media are leading some people to wrongly believe that President Donald Trump is trying to profit from the pandemic by selling COVID-19-themed commemorative coins.  The caption on one Facebook user’s post says: ""Just when you think that Trump couldn't stoop any lower.....we find ROCK BOTTOM HAS A BASEMENT!"" Attached is a screenshot of a headline from LGBTQ Nation that says: ""White House Gift Shop is selling coronavirus commemorative coins now."" The coins are being sold on WhiteHouseGiftShop.com — but the White House isn’t selling them. The gift shop featured is a private business. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The name confused a lot of people, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who tweeted on April 29 that if Trump can sell $100 coins, he can use his power to manufacture more supplies for medical workers.  If the White House Gift Shop is going to produce $100 COVID-19 coins, Trump can sure as hell utilize the Defense Production Act to manufacture the gloves, gowns, and masks our medical workers desperately need. https://t.co/Wr6Y1uwG0i The White House Gift Shop is a private company that is no longer affiliated with the U.S. government.  The coins are listed at $125, and the company says it will donate the proceeds to COVID-19 medical research. The shop has sold other commemorative coins in the past, such as a D-Day memorial coin and one for the anniversary of the U.S. embassy moving to Jerusalem.  In 2018, the website started selling a commemorative coin celebrating a summit meeting between Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un that ended up getting canceled.  The shop says the new COVID-19 coins are part of its ""Historic Moments in History Series,"" which includes a coin for the creation of the U.S. Space Force.

Giannini did not respond to a request for comment, but he told fact-checking website Snopes that the shop is ""not affiliated with the White House, nor is the White House involved in any of our decisions, products, or operations."" While the operation isn’t connected to the White House now, it once was and dates back to the Truman administration.  According to a LancasterOnline.com report, the gift shop started as a fund to benefit the family of a slain officer of the White House police, now the U.S. Secret Service. It was originally set up in the basement of the White House before it relocated to the nearby executive mansion.  The now-defunct Secret Service Uniformed Division Benefit Fund ran the gift shop before running into financial trouble. Giannini told Snopes that the ownership of the gift shop was officially transferred to his corporation in 2012, and he was awarded a trademark for the name in 2016. The gift shop no longer has a physical space and operates solely online. A private gift shop is located across the street from the White House, and the White House Historical Association also has a gift shop nearby. People on public White House tours can also buy souvenirs from the association.  People are accusing Trump of trying to profit off the COVID-19 pandemic by selling $125 commemorative coronavirus coins.

Has “Safer At Home” in Wisconsin saved 300+ lives?
","Pushing back against a lawsuit seeking to block his ""Safer at Home"" extension, Gov. Tony Evers laid out his case for isolation measures in Wisconsin. He said striking down the order would ""cripple our ability to respond to the pandemic."" Places without such measures, he said, have yielded ""reports of doctors rationing ventilators and having to choose which patients will live or die"" and ""reports of needing refrigeration trucks for the deceased."" And he made a bold claim about the impact his shelter-in-place order has had in Wisconsin. ""It's working,"" Evers wrote in an April 21, 2020, Facebook post. ""We have flattened the curve here in Wisconsin and have prevented the death of at least 300 Wisconsinites, and perhaps as many as 1,400 lives."" Disease experts have been clear that social distancing can save lives, but is Evers right about saving at least 300 lives? We checked it out. We’ll start out with the obvious: There’s no way for Evers to know this for sure. He is referring to a hypothetical scenario in which actions taken to this point never occurred.  But this is a standard type of statement in disease management and other fields that use predictive models — comparing initial projections with actual observations later. ""It’s quite common to project with a model sort of what would be expected in epidemiology,"" said Patrick Remington, a former CDC epidemiologist and director of the Preventive Medicine Residency Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""What better way to predict than … to say, particularly early in an epidemic, what if we did nothing? The early transmission velocity in an epidemic, what if that were to continue throughout the course of the epidemic?"" We should also note this language is in line with claims from the other side of the aisle.  President Donald Trump asserted in an April 16, 2020, news conference, ""Our experts and scientists report that our strategy to slow the spread has saved hundreds of thousands of lives."" The models used to project the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 are constantly evolving, tweaked to factor in the most up to date trends, new information about the virus and changes in government policies and society’s response to them. The models get better as more data on what is happening is added, which is why the wild swings in projected cases and deaths from early models have leveled out now. Evers is comparing the number of deaths we’ve seen so far to what the earliest version of those models said would happen in Wisconsin. So what did they say? Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said his numbers were based on a model created by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. A version of that released March 18, 2020 projected between 440 and 1,500 deaths in Wisconsin by April 8. The actual death toll on April 8 was 99. Some quick subtraction shows that is in line with Evers’ claim. ""While early models of the virus’s spread are less reliable the further out they project, those models showed that, by April 8, Wisconsin would have seen 22,000 cases which would have resulted in 440-1,500 deaths,"" Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy DHS secretary, said in an affidavit filed in opposition to the Republican lawsuit. ""Therefore, we estimate that the First Safer at Home order saved between 300 and 1,400 lives by April 8th."" Evers’ claim also lines up with early projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, a model that has been widely used by the government and public alike throughout the pandemic. On March 25 it projected 853 deaths in Wisconsin over the following four months. Now that model projects less than half that number. Another model, detailed in an April 24 report from Johns Hopkins University, said their simulations showed about three times as many deaths in Wisconsin by May 1 if ""Safer at Home"" had not been in place. As of April 30, 316 people had died in Wisconsin of COVID-19, DHS reports. Ajay Sethi, associate professor of population health sciences at the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, said the range of lives saved Evers cited is ""consistent with near-term forecasts I had seen."" Remington agreed those figures are ""absolutely within the range of what I’d expect,"" noting that Evers was wise to cite it as a range since it is an estimate and based on many factors. One key factor here is the matter of credit. Just as the number of deaths is an estimate, so is figuring out how many of those lives saved were due specifically to ""Safer at Home."" ""You can’t tease out the effect of that order from the daily White House briefings to all the stuff on social media to late night comedy shows,"" Remington said. ""But you can say the result of all this public education is a change in our behavior."" ""Safer at Home"" was the cornerstone of the Wisconsin response to coronavirus, though, so it’s certainly fair to credit it with a large share of the change in behavior here. ""Without social distancing the virus would have continued to spread like wildfire,"" Sethi said. Evers said his ""Safer at Home"" plan ""prevented the death of at least 300 Wisconsinites, and perhaps as many as 1400 lives."" This claim lines up with projections made by DHS, and experts say it’s in line with what other models projected as well. And Evers was smart to cite a wide range of possible outcomes, since we have no way of knowing precisely how this theoretical future would have played out. But any claim like this is based on a hypothetical scenario of how COVID-19 might have progressed in Wisconsin without the array of government limitations and changes in personal behavior we’ve seen in recent months.  And Evers stated this as a knowable fact rather than an estimate. With that missing context in mind, we rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F8A40>],/factchecks/2020/may/01/tony-evers/has-safer-home-wisconsin-saved-300-lives/

Viral post alleging Obama-era device tax caused current PPE shortage is way off
","A social media post, which in April was shared widely on Facebook and made appearances on a conservative online discussion forum, asserts that former President Barack Obama signed legislation that caused companies to  manufacture medical devices overseas, including items essential for the current coronavirus pandemic. Alongside a photo of Obama, the text of the Facebook post says: ""Let me be clear. I signed the medical appliance tax bill that forced companies to outsource manufacturing of masks, gowns, gloves and ventilaors [sic] to China, Europe and Russia to avoid the tax.""  The image piqued our interest because it combined a few hot-button issues. First, the concern that the U.S. is experiencing a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment, or PPE, like masks, gowns and gloves to help protect front-line workers from coronavirus. Second, issues related to trade imbalances and the outsourcing of American manufacturing abroad are likely to be frequent themes on the presidential campaign trail. So we decided to dig in. Though the image did not include sourcing or sponsorship information, its target — the ""medical appliance tax bill"" — seemed to be a reference to the medical device tax (more formally known as the medical device excise tax) that became law as part of the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, much of the social media post tracked closely to  statements made by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh during an April 2 episode of his talk show, which included a discussion of the medical device tax.    Before we get into the specifics of the medical device tax, two critical elements of the post must be addressed. First, did Obama ever say anything like what the viral image claims? We checked with Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president. In an email he wrote back: ""President Obama obviously didn’t say this!""  A key piece of evidence that supports Schultz’s statement is the use of the term ""medical appliance device tax bill."" Bottom line: We couldn’t find any other reference — either official or unofficial — to a piece of federal legislation bearing this name or nickname. And, though the experts we spoke with agreed the social media post was likely directed at the device tax included in the ACA, none had ever heard it referred to with that moniker — a point that adds more skepticism to the image’s claim. In order to pay for the ACA’s expansion of health coverage, taxes were increased for various industries — including the medical device industry — that would benefit from more people getting health insurance. The tax was controversial and triggered considerable pushback.  The measure set a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices, sold in the United States beginning in January 2013. The tax applied to both domestic manufacturers and importers of medical devices.  But, it did not apply to items made in the U.S. for foreign export, said John McDonough, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who also served as a senior adviser during the Obama administration and helped write the Affordable Care Act.   ""The tax was designed deliberately"" to avoid forcing manufacturers to move their production overseas, McDonough wrote in an email.  Opponents of the tax argued that it was a severe financial burden on medical device manufacturers. They also estimated that it would have resulted in the loss of more than 20,000 full-time domestic jobs in the industry. Joseph Antos, a health policy scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, said that the tax was punishing on the medical device industry because it was implemented on ""gross sales rather than profits,"" which raised issues for small device firms.    However, a 2015 Congressional Research Service report said that the medical device tax seemed to have only ""fairly minor effects"" on jobs with ""output and employment in the industry falling by no more than two-tenths of 1%.""  Antos said that though the tax ""clearly"" had an effect on the industry, he wasn't aware of any studies or statistics that showed production and sales moving overseas because of it.   But Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow and expert in health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, took an even harder line on the social media image’s assertion. ""It’s absolutely false on the face of it,"" he said. ""There was no way the tax provided any incentive to shift production overseas.""   Van de Water also said that while there was some shift of manufacturing overseas while the tax was in effect, there were other factors leading that push, such as competition and pressure to reduce costs.  ""There’s no way to attribute that to the device tax itself,"" he added.   And, there’s another complication. Congress acted to put the medical device tax on hold at the end of 2015 -- in part due to significant lobbying by the medical device industry, as well as opposition to it from both Republican and Democratic members of Congress who had medical device companies headquartered in their states. In December 2019, President Donald Trump permanently repealed the tax when he signed a bipartisan federal spending package.  ""The tax was only in effect for three years, from 2013 to 2015,"" said Van de Water. ""Even if it [the medical device tax] had some effect, that effect would have ended in 2016. We’re now four years later.""  So finally, does the now non-existent medical device tax have anything to do with our current PPE shortage in the face of the coronavirus pandemic? The answer to that is also no, said the experts.   The current personal protective equipment shortage can be attributed to the lack of a stockpile reserve of PPE, an initial slow response by the U.S. and the tariffs imposed against Chinese goods by the Trump administration, said Peter Petri, a professor of international finance at Brandeis University outside Boston.  AEI’s Antos considered it an issue of the huge demand for these items, which has made replenishing stockpiles more difficult. According to a recent report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in 2018 China was the source of 48% of U.S. imports of PPE. Seventy percent of the United States’ mouth and nose protective gear, such as masks, came from China in 2018. Overall, China is a major supplier of PPE to countries all over the world.  Petri said this makes sense, since China is a low-cost manufacturer of these relatively simple products. But it also became a problem once the White House started implementing tariffs on Chinese products.  ""For nearly a year, U.S. buyers have been moving their PPE business away from China to other countries because of the Trump tariff wall,"" Petri wrote in an email. But those manufacturers in other countries were not able to scale up their production to make up for the amount of supplies needed when the coronavirus hit. ""Meanwhile Chinese suppliers were turning to markets in Europe. The U.S. could not have chosen a worse time to turn its back on the world's largest PPE producer,"" said Petri.   China’s massive manufacturing capacity did allow it to scale up production to account for the coronavirus pandemic, but because it had already established businesses in other locales and in response to the imposed tariffs, Petri suggested, it is unlikely now that China would be as receptive to U.S. requests for PPE. Nothing in this viral image is accurate. There is even a spelling error.  Obama did not sign anything into law called the ""medical appliance tax bill."" A moratorium was placed on the medical device tax he did sign into law as part of the Affordable Care Act in late 2015. Therefore, that tax was put on hold in 2016 and eventually repealed by Trump in 2019.  Instead, experts we consulted agreed that the current PPE shortage is more aptly linked to the inadequate national emergency stockpile of PPE, increased demand for the products and the Trump administration’s Chinese trade policies.  Our ruling is Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C5FE40>],/factchecks/2020/may/01/facebook-posts/viral-post-alleging-obama-era-device-tax-caused-cu/

To fight COVID-19, CDC now says wear masks in public
","President Donald Trump has said he can’t see himself wearing one. Vice President Mike Pence didn’t when he visited the Mayo Clinic. But generally, when it comes to protecting against the coronavirus, who should wear a face mask? A widely shared Facebook post appears to offer direction from an authoritative source, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.  ""Please note: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19,"" says what looks like a partial screenshot from a UPMC web page. ""Face masks should be worn by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This post, published April 27, is offering old advice.  The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult. Early in the coronavirus outbreak, the CDC’s guidance did deter people from wearing face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. ""This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected,"" the guidance stated. But that changed. Trump announced April 3, weeks before this Facebook post, that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings.  The CDC said it was making the change based on continuing studies that found that the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic and that even those who eventually develop symptoms can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. In a question-and-answer posting about cloth face coverings, the CDC broadly recommended their use in public settings where six-feet distancing is more difficult to maintain.  The new guidance does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the Facebook post did. The CDC said: People should ""wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting,"" including grocery stores and pharmacies, and especially in public in areas of widespread COVID-19 illness. Cloth face coverings can be fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials. Surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders. A cloth face covering ""is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected, but does not have symptoms."" Cloth face coverings should not be placed on children younger than 2 years of age, ""anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance."" The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and make a tight seal around the wearer’s face. ""Given the current crisis, and lacking an alternative, many layers of densely woven fabric would be the most effective, because it allows for lots of voids in the layers where particles can be trapped,"" Richard Peltier, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, previously told PolitiFact. ""The mask needs to seal as tightly as possible to the face to avoid leaks, though this may not be possible with different designs, fabrics, or face shapes. Thin or porous fabrics are the least likely to be effective."" Cloth masks, he added, ""should be treated as contaminated materials that you bring in to your home — they need to be laundered in hot soapy water, and you’d need to consider sanitizing in bleach or hydrogen peroxide regularly."" A Facebook post reflects outdated information in claiming that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.

How a parody GIF of Biden lolling his tongue became a manipulated video on Facebook
","Facebook users are sharing a manipulated video of Joe and Jill Biden that makes it look like the Democratic presidential frontrunner is lolling his tongue while his wife is talking. The video, which was published April 28 on a popular conservative Facebook page, takes footage from a legitimate video the Bidens released April 26 that shows Jill Biden talking about her husband’s candidacy. But in the altered video, Joe Biden is rolling his tongue in circles while his wife speaks instead of staring silently at the camera as he does in the original. ""I guess the first question would be why is she giving his campaign speech?"" reads the caption on the altered video shared by a Facebook page called Red White Blue News. ""Second question is what the hell is wrong with him?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) We’ve fact-checked several manipulated or deceptively edited videos about the 2020 presidential candidates, so we wanted to check this one out, too. The footage of Biden rolling his tongue is not real — a meme-maker manipulated the video by superimposing a digitally altered GIF on top of the original clip of the Bidens. A parody Twitter account published the GIF on April 26. It shows Biden in a blue blazer against a bookshelf backdrop. While the outfit is different, the head and tongue motion are identical to those in the Facebook video. ""Sloppy Joe is trending. I wonder if it's because of this,"" reads the tweet. President Donald Trump retweeted the GIF on April 26, prompting some Twitter users to say the president had shared a ""deepfake"" video, which uses artificial intelligence to make it look like someone is doing or saying something that never happened. But the GIF is not a deepfake — it was created using an app called MugLife, which lets users animate images Then one meme led to another. We traced the altered clip of the Bidens to a YouTube video uploaded April 27 by an account called ""Solentgreenis people."" The video shows the same watermark as the Facebook clip and has more than 9,700 views.  Solentgreenis people, also known as ""Solmemes,"" is a conservative meme-maker with nearly 20,000 subscribers. Solmemes regularly creates digitally altered videos of politicians like Trump and Biden. Solmemes’ video is labeled as comedy on YouTube, but it’s an example of what the Washington Post Fact Checker calls ""doctoring."" That entails ""cropping, changing speed, using Photoshop, dubbing audio, or adding or deleting visual information"" to deceive the viewer. The clip of the Bidens is the latest example of manipulated videos on the 2020 campaign trail. Both Biden and Trump have published deceptively edited campaign videos attacking one another. In those cases, the ads used clips that omitted context. They did not transform footage altogether as this widely shared altered video does. The Facebook video is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Obama administration did not provide $3.8 million to Wuhan virology lab
","A Facebook post alerted readers to this ""breaking news"": ""President Trump just announced that the ‘biological’ lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created was ‘funded’ by President Barak (sp) Hussein Obama in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars! This fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!"" A different post makes a similar point: ""Well well well, in 2015 Obama gave the Chinese lab in Wuhan 3.7M grant to study the corona virus what a coincidence."" The first post builds on the conspiracy theory that the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China created the virus.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There’s nothing correct in this post, although President Donald Trump does play a supporting role in spreading some of the inaccurate information at the heart of the claim. Here’s where the post either misleads or flat out gets things wrong. Early on in the crisis, the idea took hold that the virology lab in Wuhan engineered the virus. We looked at that claim in detail before and found that the genetic sequence of the virus shows no signs of genetic engineering. A research team at Scripps Research compared the virus to viruses that had hit humans, such as the one behind the SARS outbreak, and viruses that are found in animals. All the evidence pointed to a natural source. ""We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the researchers wrote. There are unresolved concerns that protective lapses at the lab may have allowed a virus collected from nature to escape, and to be clear, that is an unproven allegation, and Chinese officials deny it. But that is different from the virus being intentionally manufactured by human hands. The correct amount sent to the Wuhan virology lab is $598,500, and that was spread over five years, according to the American research group running the project. Here’s what we know about the lab, that work and the U.S. funding. In 2014, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed a project by the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including many in Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam and China. The 2014 project focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. In 2018, alliance researchers reported they had found a virus in bats very similar to SARS. ""If we know what viruses are out there in wildlife, and which people are getting infected, we have a chance to stop pandemics dead in their tracks,"" the group’s president Peter Daszak said in a press release at the time. The group contracted the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct the genetic analyses of the viruses that were being collected in the field. The lab was selected after it was approved by the U.S. State Department and NIH. The National Institutes of Health website shows a total award of about $3.4 million over six years to EcoHealth Alliance. The group’s spokesman Robert Kessler told us that, of that, the Wuhan lab received just under $600,000. That’s about 85% less than the Facebook post asserted. That NIH spending included about $265,000 for the lab under the Trump administration. In 2019, NIH renewed the grant to EcoHealth Alliance for another five years. That decision came on Trump’s watch and he said ""we will end that grant very quickly."" There is a virology lab in Wuhan, and it did get money from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. But the post exaggerates what Trump said about that. In an April 17 White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter from the conservative website Newsmax asked Trump about the grant. Here’s the exchange: Reporter: ""(There’s a) report that the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?"" Trump: ""The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million? I’ve been hearing about that. And we’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area — we’re looking at it, literally, about an hour ago, and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly. ""But it was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We’re going to look at it and take a look. But I understand it was a number of years ago, right? ""When did you hear — when did you hear it was — the grant was made?"" Reporter: ""2015."" Trump: ""2015? Who was president then? I wonder."" Trump didn’t announce anything. He responded to the reporter’s question about the grant and said he’d heard about certain reports and was looking into it. A Facebook post said Trump announced that a lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus ""was created"" received $3.8 million under the Obama administration. A reader would see this claim and assume millions of U.S. tax dollars were used to create the virus that leads to COVID-19. That isn’t the case. Trump didn’t make this announcement. He was responding to a reporter’s question. The best evidence so far says the virus was not created in a lab. The money that went to the lab was about 85% less than what the post said. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809784D380>],/factchecks/2020/apr/30/blog-posting/obama-administration-did-not-provide-38-million-wu/

Both Cuomo, de Blasio can exercise power to close NYC schools
","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his fellow Democrat, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have sparred for years over the governance of their shared state. Now, during the coronavirus pandemic that has hit New York City hard, the two officials are having to work together.  One issue that has come up is whether to open the New York City public schools or keep them closed for health reasons. In an April 11 announcement, de Blasio said the New York City public schools would remain closed for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year, with students continuing remote learning through June 26. ""After very careful consideration,"" de Blasio said, ""I announce today that the New York City public schools will remain closed for the remainder of this school year."" But a few hours later, Cuomo said, ""That’s his opinion, but he didn’t close them, and he can’t open them. It happened on a metropolitan-wide basis."" So who has the authority to open New York City’s public schools? It’s a bit complicated, experts say. (Multiple inquiries to Cuomo’s and de Blasio’s office for this article were not returned.) In normal times, local law would give de Blasio, working with New York City schools chancellor Richard A. Carranza, the authority to close the city’s public schools.  However, in the event of an emergency, such as the one Cuomo has declared, the governor has the power to override local law.  Under New York Executive Law sections 24 and 29-A, the governor ""has the power to supersede any local law in an emergency,"" said Roderick M. Hills Jr, a New York University law professor.  Specifically, section 29-A says that ""subject to the state constitution, the federal constitution and federal statutes and regulation, the governor may by executive order temporarily suspend any statute, local law, ordinance, or orders, rules or regulations, or parts thereof, of any agency during a state disaster emergency."" To exercise such powers, Cuomo has a statutory duty to be specific about what local laws he is suspending. The governor ""shall specify the statute, local law, ordinance, order, rule or regulation or part thereof to be suspended and the terms and conditions of the suspension,"" the statute says. The wrinkle in the current situation is Cuomo has not chosen to exercise the power he holds. ""The governor has not suspended Chancellor Carranza’s power under Education Law 2590-H to close schools in an emergency,"" Hills said. So Cuomo’s existing executive order ""is insufficient to strip the mayor and the mayor’s chancellor of school-closing authority."" Indeed, it was de Blasio in mid-March who closed the 1,800 public schools in the New York City system, according to the New York Times. ""This is something in a million years I could never have imagined having to do,"" said de Blasio.  Going forward, Cuomo said he plans to coordinate reopening plans with other jurisdictions in the metropolitan area, including Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island and Westchester County north of New York City. Cuomo said that under the law, de Blasio ""can’t open"" New York City’s schools. Cuomo has a point that New York state law does permit the governor of New York to seize such powers as closing schools as long as there is a declared emergency. But while Cuomo has declared an emergency due to the coronavirus, he hasn’t gone so far as to exercise the power of pre-empting local school-closing powers. This has enabled the city to continue calling the shots on whether the schools should be opened or remain closed. The statement is partially accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097173140>],/factchecks/2020/apr/30/andrew-cuomo/both-cuomo-de-blasio-can-exercise-power-close-nyc-/
"['Abortion', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Facebook posts']","
Planned Parenthood abortion funding, business claim makes a point but goes too far
","In 2018, Gov. Tony Evers campaigned on a promise to restore funding for Planned Parenthood.  It’s an issue that has taken a backseat in the past year, since the Republican-controlled Legislature quashed an expansion of the Affordable Care Act in the state’s biennial budget, essentially nixing Evers’ Healthy Women, Healthy Babies initiatives.  Among other measures, the proposal would have provided state funding to organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion services. Evers’ initiative prompted a Feb. 21, 2019 article from the anti-abortion website LifeNews.com headlined ""Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers Wants to Force Residents to Fund Planned Parenthood Abortion Business."" So, why are we talking about a year-old article now? It gained new life on Facebook after a April 23, 2020 post in a ""Recall Tony Evers"" Facebook group that has been shared more than 300 times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Evers’ proposal would have allocated funding to Planned Parenthood. But Wisconsin law prevents state or local tax dollars from being used to subsidize abortions, except in rare circumstances. Let’s see how the claim holds up. In 2019, Evers introduced a number of initiatives geared toward women and children’s health as part of his proposed budget. Nearly $28 million would have gone toward services such as cancer screenings, sexually-transmitted infection testing and other policies related to pregnancies and births. The bill would have routed federal funds from the family planning and women’s health block grant programs to Planned Parenthood and other entities.  The proposal also would have allowed the health-care providers to share ""nondirective"" information about pregnancy termination as part of family planning services. Generally speaking, that means they could discuss the option. One important note: Wisconsin generally can’t use state or federal tax dollars to pay for abortions. And that wouldn’t have changed under Evers’ proposal.  State law only permits money going toward abortions when a woman is a victim of sexual assault or incest, or if the abortion is necessary to save her life. Funding is also permitted if the woman has a preexisting health condition and the procedure would ""prevent grave, long-lasting physical health damage to the woman.""  Wisconsin’s policy mirrors the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal funding for abortions in most cases. A 2005 study from the Guttmacher Institute showed 4% of women had an abortion because of health concerns, while less than 0.5% were victims of rape. That suggests exceptions to the policy are not common. So, Evers’ proposal would have restored funding — cut under former Gov. Scott Walker — that went to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions.  But the money never made it into the final budget, and even if it had, it would have generally been barred from paying for abortions. Another part of the claim labeled Planned Parenthood an abortion business. That caught our eye. According to Planned Parenthood’s 2018-2019 annual report, the organization’s health centers performed 345,672 abortions from October 2017 to September 2018 — the most recent data available. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin reported just over 4,600 abortions for the 2017-2018 fiscal year. In Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood also provided around 105,000 sexually-transmitted infection tests, 5,300 cervical cancer screenings, 13,000 pregnancy tests and 860 breast exams.  Nationwide, patients visited Planned Parenthood for contraception, prenatal services, and preventative care like pap tests or HPV vaccinations. Testing for STIs and HIV accounted for half of all services provided.  Abortions comprised 3.5% of those services.  Even at that rate, Planned Parenthood is still the largest provider of abortions in the United States. But to call it an abortion business is a stretch, as the organization provides other services far more often. A Facebook post links to a 2019 article that claimed Evers ""wants to force residents to fund Planned Parenthood abortion business."" Evers tried and failed to restore funding for entities like Planned Parenthood that also provide abortion services. But even if the measure had passed, under state and federal law the money generally couldn’t have gone to pay for abortions. Finally, it’s an exaggeration to call Planned Parenthood an abortion business, when abortions make up a small portion of the services offered.  A statement is Mostly False when it contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.

Donald Trump's claim that US tested more than all countries combined is Pants on Fire wrong
","Responding to weeks of criticism over his administration’s COVID-19 response, President Donald Trump claimed at a White House briefing that the United States has well surpassed other countries in testing people for the virus. ""We’ve tested more than every country combined,"" Trump said April 27. It was a variation on claims he had made April 24, as well as on Twitter the day after — when he said the United States had tested ""more than any other country in the world, and even more than all major countries combined."" The president has made a habit of exaggerating the United States’ capacity for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. But the health system has ramped up its testing since its slow start during the first weeks of the American outbreak. So we wanted to check back. How many people here have been tested? And has the U.S. tested more people than ""every country combined""? We emailed the White House for comment but never heard back, so we turned to the data. Trump’s claim didn’t stand up to scrutiny. In raw numbers, the United States has tested more people than any other individual country — but nowhere near more than ""every country combined"" or, as he said in his tweet, more than ""all major countries combined."" Regardless, raw test numbers aren’t a meaningful metric in gauging the nation’s coronavirus response. When you factor in population size — which experts say is essential in understanding how well we are doing — the U.S. still falls short. We consulted a few independent estimates, all of which were recommended to us by global health experts: the COVID Tracking Project, Worldometer and Our World in Data. All of them place the U.S. total above 5 million tests — the figures range between 5.59 and 5.7 million. And it is correct that no other country has run so many diagnostic tests. But that’s where any semblance of accuracy ends. A White House report on global testing — which sources its numbers from Our World in Data — notes that the United States has done more testing than the combined totals of Australia, Austria, Canada, France, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom. (That addition checks out.) But those are hardly all the world’s ""major countries"" — let alone ""every country."" And to argue the list is exhaustive is absurd, experts said -- especially since it doesn’t include Germany and Spain, which are among Europe’s biggest economies. Additionally, Germany’s robust testing strategy has been credited with its low coronavirus death rate and Russia, also not on that list, is obviously an important player on the world stage. And when you look at European countries alone — which again, is far short of what he claimed — Trump’s comparison quickly falls apart. The Worldometer data shows that, when you add up the number of tests run in Russia, Germany and Italy, the total lands around 6.72 million. You could also tally the number of tests run in Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the U.K. Both Worldometer and Our World in Data place that total above 6 million. Either way, it’s more than what the U.S. has done. Big picture, a truly exhaustive sum of testing by ""every country"" or even ""all major countries"" would generate higher numbers. Trump is also fixating on the wrong figures, global health experts said. ""The highest number of raw tests in and of itself is not meaningful for any particular country or location within a country,"" said Jennifer Kates, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) The United States has a far bigger population than many of the ""major countries"" Trump often mentions. So it could have run far more tests but still have a much larger burden ahead than do nations like Germany, France or Canada. There are other useful metrics: for one, how many people tested positive for COVID-19 compared with the overall number of people tested. Another useful measure is the per capita rate of testing, or the percentage of the nation’s population that has been tested for the virus. On both counts, the United States still underperforms. Hanage pointed out that Germany, Ireland, Belgium and Canada have all tested a much larger percentage of the population than the United States has. Arguably the more important metric, Hanage said, is the percentage of positive test results. A low percentage indicates a nation is aggressively testing, while a higher percentage suggests the country is testing only very sick people — increasing the likelihood that its tracking system is missing cases of infection, undercounting how many people are COVID-positive. And by this measure, the United States fares far worse than a number of countries, including Canada and Germany. As Kates put it, ""increasing the number of tests is important, but a raw number of tests doesn’t tell you much"" about what’s needed, or how well the country is faring. Trump claimed that the United States has ""tested more than every country combined."" There is no reasonable way to conclude that the American system has run more diagnostics than ""all other major countries combined."" Just by adding up a few other nations’ totals, you can quickly see Trump’s claim fall apart. Plus, focusing on the 5 million figure distracts from the real issue — by any meaningful metric of diagnosing and tracking, the United States is still well behind countries like Germany and Canada. The president’s claim is not only inaccurate but also ridiculous.

Claim about stimulus check eligibility for Americans married to immigrants missing context
","A Facebook post claims that despite being married to immigrants, President Donald Trump and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked Americans married to immigrants from receiving stimulus checks. ""Trump and McConnell are blocking stimulus checks for Americans married to immigrants. While they are both married to immigrants,"" said the April 23 Facebook post. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First lady Melania Trump was born in Slovenia. Elaine Chao, who serves as U.S. Secretary of Transportation and is married to McConnell, was born in Taiwan. So the part of the claim about Trump and McConnell being married to immigrants is correct.  What about the claim that they are ""blocking"" stimulus checks for Americans married to immigrants? The $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law by Trump on March 27. But it did not become law against Democratic wishes. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate and only three House Democrats opposed it. Under the CARES Act, eligible people who filed tax returns for 2018 or 2019 and earned up to $75,000 are set to receive $1,200; married couples who jointly earned up to $150,000 are expected to get $2,400. Eligible tax filers with dependent children under 17 years old are expected to get $500 per qualifying child. Individuals and couples who earned more than the $75,000 and $150,000 thresholds — but not more than $99,000 or $198,000 — will get some aid, but not as much as those who earned less. What about Americans married to immigrants? The Facebook post gives the misleading impression that all Americans married to immigrants won’t get a check. That’s not the case. U.S. citizens are ineligible for a stimulus check if they filed a joint tax return with a spouse who used an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. There is an exception to that rule: If either spouse is a member of the U.S. military at any time during the taxable year, then only one spouse needs to have a valid Social Security number. Americans and immigrant spouses who filed a tax return both using a Social Security number are eligible for the stimulus check (if they meet the income criteria). Being married to someone who has an ITIN instead of a Social Security number is not a disqualifying element by itself, either. If the couple filed their taxes separately, then whoever filed using a Social Security number is eligible for the check. ITINs are issued by the IRS for tax purposes, so that foreign nationals and other individuals who don’t have a Social Security number can use it to pay income taxes. Some immigrants in the country illegally pay taxes using an ITIN. About 1.8 million spouses who are either U.S. citizens or green-card holders will be excluded from the stimulus payments, according to estimates from the Migration Policy Institute. A Facebook post said, ""Trump and McConnell are blocking stimulus checks for Americans married to immigrants."" The post wrongly makes it seem as if the law providing the stimulus payment was a doing only of Republicans. The CARES Act passed with bipartisan support. Not all Americans married to immigrants are barred from getting a stimulus check. That applies to couples that filed a joint tax return, one using a Social Security number and the other using an ITIN. That exempts military families. If a couple files tax returns separately, the spouse who filed with a Social Security number is eligible for the payment. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Experts say COVID-19 may well be “here to stay,” even after a vaccine
","The debate over when to re-open Wisconsin has escalated quickly. Frustration with the extended quarantine is mounting on social media, and residents around the state have defied social distancing orders to attend rallies demanding Gov. Tony Evers ease restrictions. Protesters say the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed enough to justify reopening, given the mounting economic and health impacts. One viral Facebook post — making the case to move toward re-opening the state — says we need to get used to living in a world with COVID-19. It was posted April 26, 2020, by Dr. David Murdock, a research cardiologist with the Aspirus health system in Wausau who was placed on leave after attending an April 19, 2020, re-open rally in Mosinee. ""The consensus medical view is that this virus is here to stay. In other words, this virus cannot be defeated simply by staying inside for a couple of months,"" wrote Murdock, who said he was observing from the rear of the rally at a safe distance to gather material for a memoir. ""The world will likely see periodic outbreaks, and we need to accept that and be prepared to deal with COVID long term."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Murdock makes an array of points in the wide-ranging post, which has been shared more than 2,000 times. But we’re especially interested in the claim about the longevity of COVID-19. Of course, the ""Safer at Home"" order from Evers —  and similar efforts across the country, including guidance from President Donald Trump —  is not designed to eradicate the disease. It was implemented to slow the spread so hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.  Understanding that, we still wanted to examine the underlying claim. COVID-19 has sickened 3 million and killed more than 200,000 globally. Is it really here to stay? We asked the experts. Many experts have said a true return to normalcy likely isn’t possible until a vaccine is widely available, which could be a year or more. ""We're going to probably all need to be used to social distancing for the next 12 to 18 months,"" John Raymond, CEO of the Medical College of Wisconsin, said during an April 27, 2020, online briefing for the Greater Milwaukee Committee. ""Until hopefully we have an effective vaccine, it's likely we're going to be living with COVID-19."" But a vaccine doesn’t necessarily mean the end of COVID-19. Like much about this coronavirus, this isn’t something we can say for sure yet. But experts we talked to said complete eradication would be a major undertaking. ""Absent a vaccine, I think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with,"" said Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University’s School of Public Health. ""It is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory viraI infections."" The vaccine he references would be a theoretical one that is 100% effective and gives lifelong immunity. But vaccines are ""almost never perfect,"" notes Barry Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard. Bloom also expressed concern over the volume of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccinations on social media, which include a host of conspiracy theories about pushing people to vaccinate and concerns about how the vaccines may be dangerous. That could affect willingness to take a vaccine once it’s available. ""The vaccine is only a tool if it’s used,"" Bloom said. Hanage said an array of key unknowns will determine the long-term future of COVID-19. They include: Whether people can get re-infected, and how severe those recurrences would be How much immunity results from minor infections How the summer warmup alters infectiousness (based on both people’s behavior and the reaction of the virus itself; generally coronaviruses don’t survive as long in warmer weather) Even if the virus does stick around, though, it may not be the threat it is today. ""If that immunity is not very long-lasting — and we have good reason from other coronaviruses including the original SARS, that it won’t be — what type of infections will people have when their immunity starts to wane?"" Hanage said. ""The first thing to say is we don’t know, but I think it’s also plausible to suggest they might be milder."" It’s worth noting that SARS — a disease caused by a coronavirus that killed 800 during a 2003 outbreak — has been eradicated. But there are key differences that make COVID-19 a more formidable foe. In a March 5, 2020, article for The Lancet medical journal, Annelies Wilder-Smith noted COVID-19 can be passed on by those with minor symptoms or none at all (SARS patients generally weren’t contagious until they had severe symptoms). And COVID-19 is more easily transmitted and has had a more prevalent community spread. ""The virus remains, and we need to learn how to deal with it,"" Wilder-Smith, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Certainly lock-down is only a temporary solution whilst we gear up to provide the true solution. Yes, we need to prepare for this reality."" Charles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told PolitiFact Wisconsin eradicating the virus like we did with smallpox ""will be challenging, to say the least."" Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said COVID-19 sticking around is ""likely, but not inevitable."" Khan noted some countries already are attempting to eliminate the virus. China, New Zealand, Australia and Vietnam have all set a goal of not just containment, but elimination. The New York Times reported April 24, 2020 that the adjoining nations of Australia and New Zealand are seeing just a handful of new infections each day and closing in on their ""extraordinary goal."" A widely shared Facebook post from a Wisconsin doctor said we need to face the reality that COVID-19 is ""here to stay"" and ""we need to accept that and be prepared to deal with COVID long term."" He was making the point that staying indoors for another month or two with extended shelter-in-place orders won’t get rid of the virus. (Though, as noted, the shelter-in-place orders are not meant to fully eradicate the virus.) Experts say it’s still too early to know this with complete certainty, since much remains unknown about the nature of immunity. And we have no clue how effective a future vaccine may be. But a best guess at this point is that COVID-19 could indeed stick around long-term, waxing and waning similar to the seasonal flu. Experts say there’s also reason to believe that lingering version could be less severe, though, a nuance Murdock did not address. Based on what we know now, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0041C0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/29/facebook-posts/experts-say-covid-19-may-well-be-here-stay-even-af/
