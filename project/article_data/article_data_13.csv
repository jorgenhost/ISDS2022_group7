Chain email says Medicare won't pay for 'observational' stay in hospital due to Obamacare
","A reader recently sent us a chain email we hadn’t seen before. The lengthy missive, purportedly written by a ""senior gentleman in Mesa, Arizona,"" details a visit to a hospital made contentious by Medicare payment rules. The anonymous author claims to have experienced ""a medical situation that made it very clear that the ‘Affordable Care Act’ is neither affordable, nor do they care."" The full email, which is lengthy, is accessible in its entirety here. But briefly, the author relates what happened after he sought treatment for a suspected urinary-tract infection. After collapsing in a local urgent-care clinic, he was taken to a hospital. There, the medical staff feared he could be experiencing sepsis, a potentially serious inflammation caused by an infection, so they ordered a battery of tests, including one that could take a day or two to complete. As a result, they told him that he would need to stay in the hospital ""for observation"" rather than going home. Here’s what happened next: ""I said, ‘Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you admit me for observation, my Medicare will not pay anything. This is due to the Affordable Care Act.’ He said, ‘That's right, it won't.’ I then grabbed for my bag of clothing and said, ‘Then I'm going home.’ He said you're really too sick to be going home, but I understand your position. This health program is going to hit seniors especially hard."" Then another doctor came into the room. ""I said, ‘Doc, you and I both know that under the Affordable Care Act anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.’ At which point he nodded in affirmation. I said, ‘You will either admit me for a specific treatment or you won't admit me.’ Realizing he wasn't going to win this one, he said he would prepare my release papers."" We zeroed in on the core claim of this story, that ""under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent."" When we looked into it, we found that Medicare does indeed have different reimbursement policies for patients who had been admitted to hospitals for observation as opposed to being admitted to treat a specific diagnosis. However, the email’s author (and, if his recounting is accurate, each of the medical professionals he spoke to) were sorely misinformed about how Medicare rules operate. The different reimbursement rates have to do with follow-up in-home care, not the original hospital stay. And crucially, the controversy over reimbursement for patients under ""observation care"" has nothing whatsoever to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act. What is ‘observation care’? According to Kaiser Health News, ""hospitals provide observation care for patients who are not well enough to go home but not sick enough to be admitted. This care requires a doctor’s order and is considered an outpatient service, even though patients may stay as long as several days. The hospitalization can include short-term treatment and tests to help doctors decide whether the patient should be admitted."" Because observation care is considered outpatient treatment, Medicare generally covers such visits, minus things like copayments and the cost of routine drugs. Where Medicare reimbursement significantly falls short is once an observation patient leaves the hospital. ""Observation patients cannot receive Medicare coverage for follow-up care in a nursing home, even though their doctors recommend it,"" according to Kaiser. ""To be eligible for nursing home coverage, seniors must have first spent at least three consecutive days (or through three midnights) as an admitted patient, not counting the day of discharge."" In other words, assuming the email author’s story actually happened, he shouldn’t have had to worry about Medicare paying for his time in the hospital while under observation. Medicare would have paid, minus copayments and the like; there was no need for him to go home while in a fragile state just to avoid being responsible for the full cost of his care. Is this related to the Affordable Care Act? Tying this policy to Obama’s law is flat-out wrong. ""The Affordable Care Act has nothing to do with observation status,"" said Mary T. (Terry) Berthelot, a senior attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Several other health-policy experts confirmed that. The policy was established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. While we’re at it, we’ll take a moment to debunk an additional Affordable Care Act-related claim included in the email. The author writes that during a visit to his family practitioner, ""I told him that I had heard that the Affordable Care Act would no longer pay for cancer treatment for those 76 and older, is that true? His understanding is that it is true."" In reality, there are no such age limits. In October 2014, we rated Pants on Fire a chain email that claimed that under the Affordable Care Act, ""at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. …  Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age."" Our ruling The chain email said that ""under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent."" That’s wrong. Medicare will cover the hospital stay, minus standard copayments and the like. Patients kept in the hospital under observation will not be able to receive Medicare reimbursements for follow-up care such as nursing-home stays, however. Even more inaccurate is the charge that this policy stemmed from the Affordable Care Act. In reality, this stems from a separate policy decision and had nothing to do with Obama’s law. The claim is not only ridiculous but also dangerous, by urging ailing patients to leave the hospital for no good reason. This claim rates Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/jun/25/chain-email/chain-email-says-medicare-wont-pay-observational-s/

Scott Walker says Barack Obama told Coast Guard global warming is top threat to military and world
","As he pursues a bid for the White House in 2016, Gov. Scott Walker has made it a point to call for more action against ""radical Islamic terrorism."" He did so again while speaking June 20, 2015, in Washington, D.C., at a conference of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a group led by conservative political strategist Ralph Reed. Toward the end of his remarks, Walker turned to national security -- or what he prefers to call ""safety."" He criticized President Barack Obama and Obama’s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner for president. And then he made a claim about Obama, national security and global warming. ""You know, I think about how mixed up this Obama-Clinton doctrine is when it comes to foreign policy,"" Walker said. ""We've got a president who, earlier this year -- at the graduation ceremony for the Coast Guard Academy -- stood up and actually told the graduates that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming. ""Well, I've got a message for you, Mr. President: The number one threat to the military, the number one threat to America, the number one threat to the world, is radical Islamic terrorism and it's about time we do something about it."" Extended applause followed. But Walker made a far-reaching claim. Did Obama tell graduates from a branch of the military that global warming is the number one threat to the military and the world? What was said Walker’s claim pertains to the commencement speech the president gave May 20, 2015, at the academy, which is located in New London, Conn. The official text shows Obama devoted the bulk of his speech to climate change (he used that term, not global warming), describing it as a serious threat to America’s national security and to global security. He did not go so far as to call it the top threat to the military or the world. Here’s a key portion of what Obama said: And this brings me to the challenge I want to focus on today -- one where our Coast Guardsmen are already on the front lines, and that, perhaps more than any other, will shape your entire careers -- and that’s the urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change. As a nation, we face many challenges, including the grave threat of terrorism. And as Americans, we will always do everything in our power to protect our country. Yet even as we meet threats like terrorism, we cannot, and we must not, ignore a peril that can affect generations …. Here at the Academy, climate change -- understanding the science and the consequences -- is part of the curriculum, and rightly so, because it will affect everything that you do in your careers ….As America’s Maritime Guardian, you’ve pledged to remain always ready -- Semper Paratus -- ready for all threats.  And climate change is one of those most severe threats. And this is not just a problem for countries on the coasts, or for certain regions of the world. Climate change will impact every country on the planet. No nation is immune.  So I’m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security. And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country. And so we need to act -- and we need to act now. So, Walker suggests Obama puts climate change ahead of terrorism as a threat, but in his speech, the president notes that the U.S. needs to confront both. We also checked five news accounts of the speech -- from the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, TIME and Fox News. They all emphasized that Obama described climate change as a threat or serious threat to national security. Other speeches Prior to the Coast Guard speech, Obama -- in a general context -- suggested climate change is the world’s number one threat. For instance, in his State of the Union speech in January 2015, Obama said: ""No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change."" And in April 2015, a few days before Earth Day, he said: ""Today, there's no greater threat to our planet than climate change."" So, after having identified climate change as perhaps the world’s greatest threat overall, Obama did devote a speech, given to members of the military, to the threat climate change poses to national and global security. But he didn’t go as far as Walker claims. Our rating Walker said Obama told the Coast Guard Academy ""that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming."" Obama on various occasions, and in a general context, has said there is no greater threat to the world than climate change. But in the speech Walker cited, the president told Coast Guard graduates that climate change was a serious threat, not the number one threat to the military or the world. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Walker a Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jun/25/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-barack-obama-told-coast-guard-gl/

Ad says NH Governor Hassan proposed $1 billion spending increase
","As budget season threatens to go into overtime and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan ponders her political future, ads are already attacking her management of the state budget. One spot in particular, funded by the ""pro-growth"" group Impact America Action, is called ""Hassan Spending Problem"" and cites a particularly noteworthy number.   ""Maggie Hassan has a spending problem,"" the spot’s narrator says, in a web ad viewed more than 27,000 times. ""As governor, Hassan first proposed a $1 billion spending increase.""   The number also appears in an ad titled ""The Hassan Plan,"" as well as on the group’s website.   But is the claim true? Did Hassan actually propose such an increase with her first budget, for 2014-2015? We decided to check it out.   Hassan came into office inheriting a $10.1 billion total budget approved by a Republican-controlled legislature. Her first budget proposal weighed in at $11.1 billion -- a roughly 10 percent increase -- and it restored many cuts, including a halving of aid to the university system.   Here’s how that $1 billion increase broke down, according to Hassan’s executive summary.   -- $184 million more from the general fund -- $493 million more from the federal government -- $348 million more from ""other funds,"" which includes the education trust fund; fees and assessments to fund the banking and insurance departments and the Public Utilities Commission; county and local funding; and transfers among state agencies:   It’s worth noting that nearly half of that $1 billion increase comes from federal funds -- not New Hampshire state taxes. And that $493 million was meant mostly for the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.   When politicians debate the budget, though, they generally talk about general fund spending, because that’s the pot of money most directly controlled by the state. Looking at that fund alone, Hassan’s budget proposed an increase of about $184 million. That’s up ""7.1 percent, from more than $2.6 billion to nearly $2.8 billion,"" according to Concord Monitor reporting.   The ad cherry-picked the most all-encompassing number -- total spending, including federal grants. (It also was careful enough not to claim claim that Hassan proposed hiking taxes by $1 billion or raising spending $1 billion more from the general fund. Both claims would have been entirely untrue.)   Impact America Action is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit group that isn’t required to report its donors publicly, according to the Sunlight Foundation. But the ad does cite a source for its $1 billion claim. That would be an article from the New Hampshire Union-Leader, dated Feb. 14, 2013.   But even that article clarified that Hassan’s total budget request included  ""federal money and other state revenue such as highway funds and court fines.""   It’s also worth noting, the two-year budget cycle closes on June 30, and the state is expected to ultimately spend about $10.5 billion during the period the ad cites.   New Hampshire Democrats panned the ads, saying the claims had already been debunked by PolitiFact. It’s true when Hassan was running for election in 2012 we checked claims about Hassan’s votes to increase taxes and budget increases when she was Senate Majority Leader. But this recent claim was a new one to us.   Our ruling   Multiple ads from Impact America Action state that ""As governor, Hassan first proposed a $1 billion spending increase."" The reality is more complicated. There was a spending increase of $1 billion in her proposal, but nearly half of that amount came from the federal government, and much of the rest came from other sources of revenue. Only about $184 million -- one fifth of the total increased spending -- came from the general fund.

Ann Coulter's Pants on Fire claim that S.C. Gov. Nikki Haley 'is an immigrant'
","Conservative pundit Ann Coulter thinks talk of removing the Confederate flag from Southern statehouses, including South Carolina, is nonsense. To Coulter, that makes Republicans who support the movement nonsensical. Coulter, however, spouted her own bit of nonsense in trying to defend her position. On the Fox Business show Kennedy June 23, Coulter was asked about the ongoing flag debate. ""Where are you from?"" host Kennedy (the former MTV veejay) asked Coulter. Coulter said she’s from Connecticut. ""Do you have a geographic ... Do you have a horse in this race either way? Do you consider yourself a Northerner?""   ""Oh, you mean the Southern thing?"" Coulter responded. ""Well, I'm a student of American history ... I’d really like to like Nikki Haley, since she is a Republican. On the other hand, she is an immigrant and does not understand America's history."" Coulter got one part of Haley’s background right. Yep, she’s a Republican. But she’s not an immigrant. She was born in South Carolina. ""Born in Bamberg, the daughter of Indian immigrants, Gov. Haley’s first job was keeping the books for her family’s clothing store -- at the age of 13,"" reads the website of the South Carolina office of the governor. Bamberg, S.C., is a small city with a population of less than 4,000 people. You may not have heard of it. But it is definitely in the United States. The New York Times described Haley’s time growing up in Bamberg in a 2010 profile and her life as the American-born child of an Indian Sikh family. When Haley was about 5, she was disqualified from the Little Miss Bamberg pageant along with her sister because ""the judges of the contest, one that crowned one black queen and one white queen, were … flummoxed"" by the sisters. ""(People in my hometown) didn’t know much about the Indian culture, and we didn’t know much about how to teach it to them,"" Haley, who was Nimrata Randhawa, said during an interview with Vogue. Haley went on to receive an accounting degree from Clemson University, and then returned to Bamberg to work in her family’s store again. With her help, the store turned ""into a multimillion-dollar business."" Then, in 2003, a speech by Hillary Clinton inspired Haley to run for state Legislature. ""She said there will be all of these reasons that people tell you you can’t do it. She said that there’s only one reason for you to do it, and it’s because you know it’s the right thing. I walked out of there thinking, I’ve got to do this,"" Haley said to Vogue. The next year, Haley was elected to represent Lexington County in South Carolina’s House of Representatives. On Jan. 12, 2011, Haley was sworn in as governor. She visited India as part of a trade mission in 2014. Prior to that, Haley said the last time she visited the country was when she was two years old. PunditFact reached out to the publisher of Coulter’s latest book Adios, America but did not hear back. Coulter, for the record, describes herself as being of Scottish descent and traces part of her family's roots to ""Puritan nonconformists who came to America in 1633."" She seemed to defend her remarks in a post of Twitter.  Our ruling Coulter said Haley is an immigrant and went on to suggest that Haley doesn't understand American history because she is less-American than others (namely, Coulter).

Chris Christie says parent and teacher complaints prompted change on Common Core
","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s recent changes to the state’s education policy don’t exactly quell rumors that he plans to enter the 2016 GOP presidential field. On May 28, Christie announced the end of the existing Common Core standards in New Jersey. ""It's now been five years since Common Core was adopted. And the truth is that it's simply not working,"" he said. ""Instead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating new ones."" This is not the first time critics have accused Christie of flip-flopping on Common Core -- the state-based educational standards aimed at improving students readiness for college and workplace. (Read our past fact-checks of claims and flops relating to Common Core.) Christie’s decision to nix Common Core is not unexpected, but it is notable considering his initial stance in support of the standards. ""This is one of those areas where I’ve agreed more with the the president than not,"" Christie said in 2011, a year after he implemented them in New Jersey. With an upcoming presidential campaign seeming increasingly likely, we decided to check how Christie’s position on Common Core registers on our Flip-O-Meter. It is important to note that we are not passing judgment on decisions to change positions. Rather, we are just determining whether they did. Christie in support of Common Core Common Core was set into motion in June 2009 as a collaboration between 49 states and territories. Christie signed off on the standards, and New Jersey adopted them in 2010. In September 2011, the Christie administration and New Jersey acting Education Commissioner Chris Cerf worked to implement the standards. Christie praised Common Core standards as ""a building block in our state’s education system meant to ensure that teachers and districts can innovate within a framework of high expectations and accountability."" Common Core Standards were set to be implemented over a three-year period, and the state Department of Education offered 300 presentations within the first year to provide educators with information about the new initiative. In August 2013, Christie maintained a positive view of the standards. ""We’re doing Common Core in New Jersey and are going to continue,"" he said. He attributed majority Republican opposition to the standards as a ""knee-jerk reaction … that if the president likes something, the Republicans in Congress don’t."" Christie in opposition to Common Core Christie’s 180-degree turn on Common Core occurred in slow-motion. In December 2014 he said in an NJTV interview, ""I have real concerns about the Common Core."" Then in February 2015, he expressed ""grave concerns about the way this has been done, especially the way the (Obama) administration has tried to implement it through tying federal funding to these things."" Christie stated publicly that Common Core was ""in the midst of re-examination"" in New Jersey. We’ve fact-checked several claims that Common Core is a federal program or mandate. It’s not. Rather, Christie is referring to the Obama administration using the promise of federal funding to incentivize adoption of Common Core standards. But, despite improving the state’s chances of winning federal money if they adopt educational standards, Common Core itself remains a state-based, voluntary program. Nonetheless, on May 28, 2015, Christie made the full switch, saying the standards have ""brought confusion and frustration to parents. I’ve heard it every day. It’s brought distance between our teachers and the communities where they work, and instead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating morale problems in those classrooms and at home."" Christie’s spokesperson pointed to a document released prior to the governor’s speech on May 28, 2015. The document outlines various efforts Christie made throughout 2014 to canvass the state’s educators and parents about their experiences with Common Core after its three-year implementation that began in 2011.   In July 2014 he established a study commission to review, among other student assessments, Common Core. Then, in November 2014, Christie announced that he was in the midst of evaluating the Core’s effectiveness. Christie attributed his change of heart in May 2015 to the negative feedback he received from the aforementioned study commission and educators’ reviews. In an interview on June 7 on CBS’s Face the Nation, Christie said, ""I’m changing because I gave it four years to work … but in four years, we did not have educators or parents buy into the Common Core."" However, there is one element of the standard’s implementation he’s not phasing out: PARCC testing. Christie has said PARCC testing will continue, and those tests were developed in line with Common Core standards. ""PARCC is a set of assessments meant to test progressions to the standards,"" stated Ashley Jochim, who studies Common Core at the Center for Reinventing Public Education. She added, ""the tests have been developed separately but are meant to align with the Common Core.""   Our ruling Christie was a supporter of Common Core, but five years following its implementation he has become a critic. He attributes his changed stance to negative reviews from educators and parents within the state. We rate his change of position a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2015/jun/24/chris-christie/christie-says-parent-and-teacher-complaints-prompt/

Did Scott Walker say forced ultrasounds to get an abortion are 'a cool thing'?
","The nation’s oldest abortion rights advocacy group attacked Gov. Scott Walker and his presidential aspirations on June 18, 2015 with a TV ad called ""Crazy Ideas."" In it, NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, made a claim about comments Walker made about abortion and transvaginal ultrasounds. Walker, according to the group, ""said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.' "" Let’s see if that’s what he said. Forced ultrasound law The ad, which NARAL said would run statewide in Iowa and New Hampshire for a week, begins with a narrator saying: ""Scott Walker talks and talks about abortion. He said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was..."";  then, to finish the sentence, an audio clip is inserted with Walker saying: ""just a cool thing."" The reference is to a law Walker signed in July 2013. It requires an ultrasound before getting an abortion. But the woman can choose to receive the ultrasound transabdominally, which is done externally; or transvaginally, which is what NARAL refers to as invasive. (For some women, though -- in cases of early pregnancy or morbid obesity, for example -- the transvaginal procedure may in effect be required because it is medically necessary.) ‘Cool thing’ The audio clip used in the ad is from an interview Walker did May 22, 2015 with Dana Loesch, a conservative radio talk show host in Dallas. About halfway into a 30-minute interview, there was this exchange about ultrasounds: Loesch: What place do social issues have in 2016 and why do you think so many Republican candidates are scared of them -- are scared to embrace them; they're scared to get trapped by the media? Walker: Well, I think a little bit of it is the media is a gotcha; some do at least, I don't want to say universally. But I think that -- Loesch: Oh, most of them do. Walker: Yeah. I mean, well, I'll give you an example. I'm pro-life, I've passed pro-life legislation. We defunded Planned Parenthood, we signed a law that requires an ultrasound -- which, the thing about that -- the media tried to make that sound like that was a crazy idea. Most people I talk to, whether they're pro-life or not -- I find people all the time who'll get out their iPhone and show me a picture of their grandkids' ultrasound and how excited they are; so that's a lovely thing. I think about, my sons are 19 and 20 -- you know we still have their first ultrasound picture. It's just a cool thing out there. We just knew, if we signed that law, if we provided the information, that more people, if they saw that unborn child, would make a decision to protect and keep the life of that unborn child. Walker’s comments led to some contrasting news reports. For example, the headline in the Washington Post was: ""Scott Walker, discussing abortion, says ultrasounds are ‘just a cool thing out there.’"" But the headline in the Huffington Post was: ""Scott Walker defends mandatory ultrasounds: they’re a ‘cool thing.’"" Walker did defend mandatory ultrasounds. But what he called cool was the ultrasound technology, not forcing women to get transvaginal ultrasounds. Our rating NARAL Pro-Choice America says that Walker ""said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.'"" Walker did defend the law he signed requiring an ultrasound in order to get an abortion. But the ""cool"" reference wasn’t to forcing some women to get vaginal ultrasounds, but rather to the ultrasound technology that produces images from the womb.

Florida graduation rate was dead last when Bush left office and remains near bottom, Gelber says
","Jeb Bush often talks about how Florida’s graduation rate was abysmal when he became governor and has since risen. But former state Sen. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach, says that the state's graduation rate was nothing to brag about when Bush left office -- or today. ""In 1998, when a newly elected Gov. Bush and a compliant Legislature started Florida’s ‘education revolution,’ our graduation rate was among the lowest in the nation,"" Gelber wrote in a June 21 Miami Herald op-ed. ""After Bush’s two terms in office, Florida’s graduation rate was dead last and remains near the bottom."" He’s right that Florida’s graduation rate was among the lowest in the nation when Bush entered office in January 1999. But when Bush left in January 2007, was the state’s graduation rate ""dead last,"" and does it remain near the bottom today? The answer depends upon which ranking we examine. Was Florida’s rate ‘dead last’ when Bush left office? Bush did battle over what the state’s actual graduation rate was while in office. And Gelber was on the other side of that fight. In 2005, multiple news reports stated that Florida ranked 50th in graduation rates at 56.8 percent. The ranking came from Kansas-based Morgan Quitno Press, which compiled data to come up with annual state rankings on multiple topics. It used data from the National Education Association and the federal government to examine the number of public high school graduates compared with the number of ninth-graders four years earlier. (Morgan Quitno was later acquired by Congressional Quarterly.) Back then, Bush pointed to the Florida Department of Education’s data that showed a graduation rate of 71.9 percent. Florida counted GEDs and special education diplomas, boosting the rate above Morgan Quitno’s, which only counted standard diplomas. That method drew criticism, and now the state only counts standard diplomas. Overall, Bush disputed the rate cited by Morgan Quitno but not the ranking. However, in 2005 Bush announced that Florida signed a compact with 48 states to create common definitions for graduation rates to allow for state-by-state comparisons. Gelber said he found that the state held the 50th-place ranking in 2004 through 2006 using the Morgan Quitno annual data. There are a few different ways to measure graduation rates but those that are most often cited in recent years are methods used by the U.S. Education Department and by Education Week, a respected education publication. To see if Florida was ""dead last"" when Bush left office, we looked at those measures, and by both methods, when Bush left office, the state’s graduation rate was near the bottom of the pack but not ""dead last."" The Education Department’s average freshman graduation rate provides an estimate of the percentage of high school students who graduate within four years of starting ninth grade. Florida was at 62.1 percent in 1997-98, the school year before Bush took office. It was 63.6 percent in 2005-06, Bush’s last full year in office. Four states were lower than Florida in 2005-06, making Florida 45th: Mississippi: 63.5 percent; Georgia: 62.4 percent; Louisiana: 59.5 percent; Nevada: 55.8 percent; South Carolina: 61 percent (based on a projected graduation rate). Education Week does its own analysis of graduation rates based on standard diplomas. (Read about their methodology here about their cumulative promotion index). In 2005-06, Florida’s rate was 57.5 percent, placing it 47th, ahead of New Mexico, Georgia and Nevada. So Florida wasn’t dead last according to two major rankings, but it did rank low. ""I think the big picture here is that every data series you use shows the same basic trend – Florida is real close to the bottom, however the numbers are added up,"" University of Iowa education professor David Bills said. We sent Gelber a summary of our findings. ""Any argument that we were 49th or 48th versus 50th under other equally reliable calculations doesn't alter in any way my statement and, more importantly, doesn't change the sorry state of Florida education after Jeb's alleged education revolution,"" Gelber responded. Does Florida’s graduation rate remain 'near the bottom' today? To examine if Florida’s graduation rate remains near the bottom, we turned to the most current data we could find comparing states’ graduation rates. Since 2010-11, the federal government has used a cohort method, which examines how many students receive a standard diploma within four years. Florida's rate was 76 percent in 2012-13, below the national average of 81 percent. Only seven states had a lower rate -- Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon -- while two, Mississippi and Washington, were tied with Florida. This isn’t to say that Florida hasn’t made any progress. The graduation rate has increased in Florida since Bush started in office, but it has also risen nationally, which means Florida’s ranking compared with other states hasn’t changed that much. Richard Rothstein, a research associate at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, told PolitiFact that it’s not a good idea to attribute changes in graduation rates to any particular governor. ""The biggest predictor of graduation rates is the preparedness with which children come to school in kindergarten.

Did Georgia's water use drop even as the state population grew?
","The bad news regarding water in Georgia is legion. No major reservoir has been built since the 2007-2008 drought to insulate metro Atlanta from future water shortages. Water/sewer rates have gone up in several counties to cover everything from federally mandated upgrades to increased material costs. Then there is the so-called ""water war"" with Alabama and Florida, a multi-year battle of lawsuits over how to meet the water needs across the states. So it was a surprise to read the recent headline in the Athens Banner-Herald: ""Water use in Georgia declines, even as population grows."" The trend, the May 10, 2015 story said, was a 30 percent drop in water usage in the three decades between 1980 and 2010, the last year that federal data was available. Suffice it to say the claim whet our appetite – we save wetting our whistle for after-hours – for the numbers and what might be going on. We reached out to the U.S. Geological Survey, which has a mandate to file a water usage report for the nation every five years. In concert with that work, the agency encourages states to conduct their own reports. Georgia has compiled a report every five years since 1975, in a bid to provide information about the precious resource in a state without a single natural lake. The 1980 report shows that year, Georgia sucked 6.7 billion gallons of water from Georgia rivers and aquifers every day. In 2010, it sipped 4.7 billion gallons every day. While the reports in that overall span show some increases – including a 21 percent jump in daily use during the 1990s – water usage has plunged 30 percent when looking at the three decades. Census figures show the number of people living in Georgia over that period exploded, from 5.46 million in 1980 to 9.69 million in 2010. That’s a 77 percent increase. Given the well-known water woes in the Peach State, how is that possible? Conservation plays some role, which we will get into in a moment. But the biggest factor was the change in how thermoelectric plants across the state operated. Several of the facilities were decommissioned between 2000 and 2010 – during the worst of the drought years and the decade that saw usage plunge nearly 28 percent, said Steve Lawrence, a hydrologist with the USGS in Atlanta. Several other plants converted from coal-fired, which needs plenty of water to cool it as an energy source, to natural gas, Lawrence said. ""Thermoelectric withdrawals account typically for a third of withdrawals, so all water withdrawals decrease when such a large user drops its share,"" Lawrence said. Data is not available for 1980 for the per capita usage in Georgia. But 1985 and 2010 figures mirror the overall trend. Every Georgian used about 860 gallons of water daily in 1985 but only 470 gallons daily in 2010, Lawrence said. Those totals include a person’s share of water that a utility, say Georgia Power, uses to provide electricity. It’s unclear what the per person usage would be in 1985, if the water used by agriculture, industry and utilities are removed. But in 2010, it was an estimated 75 gallons a day per person to bathe, cook and clean, Lawrence said. ""That’s a good number, one you see with the push for water-efficient fixtures and conservation efforts like tiered pricing,"" Lawrence said. Local water providers, however, don’t always follow the statewide trend. The Cobb County Water System can provide daily usage dating back to 1986, when the then-small county used just 38.6 million gallons countywide. In 1990, when the county had about 451,000 people, average daily use was 42.5 million gallons countywide. In 2010, about 688,000 people lived in Cobb, and daily usage was 57.1 million gallons for the county. That’s a 53 percent jump in population, and a 34 percent increase in daily usage. Although the daily usage did not keep pace with the population increase, the jump itself bucks the state trend. However, water system officials point out that Cobb saw usage drop 14 percent countywide between 2006 and 2014, during the worst of the recent droughts. The 2014 daily usage, of 104 gallons per person, also is down 15 percent from the 122 gallons per person in 2005, when the county began looking at per capita usage. ""You can see very clearly the impact of our water conservation efforts, which became much more aggressive in 2008,"" county spokeswoman AikWah Leow said. Our ruling News reports claimed that Georgia has seen its water usage drop over the past three decades, in the same period that the population mushroomed. Federal reports confirm that unlikely shift, largely due to a change from coal-fired electric plants to facilities powered by natural gas. Conservation efforts also have made an impact, even if local water systems don’t show quite the same drop in usage. But the statewide trend is clear.

Jeb Bush: Obama caused 'massive' tax increase on middle class
","After six years with a Democrat in the White House, middle-class Americans face a bigger tax bill than they did before, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in a speech launching his 2016 presidential campaign. ""The party now in the White House is planning a no-suspense primary, for a no-change election,"" he said in his June 15 remarks in Miami. ""They are responsible for the slowest economic recovery ever, the biggest debt increases ever, a massive tax increase on the middle class, the relentless buildup of the regulatory state, and the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making."" The claim that President Barack Obama and the Democrats have significantly raised taxes is bound to come up frequently in the 2016 election, so we decided to take a whack at it now. When we asked Bush’s campaign specifically what tax increases he was talking about, they pointed to the Affordable Care Act. It's a claim we heard before, and one that is flawed. Bush is correct that the Affordable Care Act raises taxes. But pinpointing the middle class as the recipient of ""a massive tax increase"" is misleading. It's the upper-class that is feeling the brunt of the impact. And health care subsidies, in some cases, may be offsetting tax increases. A note: The term ""middle class"" is hard to define, but for the purposes of this article, we are roughly looking at a generous threshold that comprises households making up to $250,000 a year. Health care taxes Let's get the big number out of the way. The health care law is expected bring in more than $1 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, according to a 2013 Joint Committee on Taxation report. The revenue is coming in through 21 new or increased taxes.  Of those 21, 12 could affect households making less than $250,000 a year, according to the Tax Foundation. We’ve looked at this list of 12 before. Some primarily target the middle class, others could hit certain people within the middle class, and others are debatable. Bush’s campaign specifically sent us a list of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform’s ""top-five"" Obamacare middle class tax increases. The five Bush cited are all included in our larger list of 12. A couple of the taxes are obvious, direct taxes on individuals -- such as a tax on indoor tanning services and the penalty for not complying with the individual mandate to have insurance. These only apply to select individuals. Many more are applied to companies, such as the excise tax on certain medical device manufacturers or the so-called ""Cadillac tax"" on high-cost health insurance plans. Many economists anticipate that companies will pass these taxes along to consumers in the form of higher premiums or more expensive products. In any case, none of these taxes affects every single member of the middle class. It’s possible there are individuals who will incur most of these additional costs, while others face a couple. Whether or not these taxes are -- as Bush put it -- ""massive"" increases on the middle class depends on individual circumstances, said Kyle Pomerleau, a Tax Foundation economist. ""I would say that the tax increase in total was large and that some of it definitely hits the middle class in some way,"" he said. ""The degree to which individuals are impacted depends on their situation."" For some perspective, total federal revenues are estimated to be about $40 trillion over 10 years. Tax revenue from the health care law, about $1 trillion, accounts for about 2.5 percent. Looking at the revenue just from the 12 that might affect middle-class taxpayers (as well as those in other income brackets), it’s about 1.25 percent of overall tax revenue.   ""Almost certainly, yes, taxes have gone up for lower- and middle-income people,"" said Roberton Williams, a fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""But have they gone up a lot? Probably not."" ""If I were pulling words out of the air, ‘massive’ is not the word I would pull,"" Williams said. Many of these taxes tend to affect more people at the upper-end of middle class, because people with lower incomes are less likely to opt for the taxed services -- such as optional medical procedures or flexible savings accounts, Williams said Conversesly, some middle-income households might even see tax benefits of the Affordable Care Act -- namely, insurance premium subsidies -- outweigh any tax increases, he added. Premium tax credits will save taxpayers about $19 billion in 2015, while the five taxes cited by Bush and the Americans for Tax Reform list are worth much less, said Laurel Lucia, health care program manager at University of California Berkeley’s Center for Labor Research and Education. In total, those five taxes are worth about $11 billion per year, she said, citing congressional research. ""I certainly agree Obamacare has increased taxes on the middle class,"" said University of California Los Angeles law professor Eric Zold. ""But it is not clear that the middle class as a group are not better off by the combination of Obamacare costs and benefits."" Other tax policies It's worth noting, of course, that the health care law isn’t the only policy that has impacted taxes in the last few years. Some changes have had a positive impact on the wallets of the middle class. Some changes have had a negative impact.  Soon after taking office, Obama signed a bill raising the sales tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products to support the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Less than 20 percent of the population smokes, though polling shows that the percentage of the population that smokes decreases as income increases. In terms of tax cuts, Obama extended the Bush-era tax cuts for people making below $250,000, as well as an array of beneficial measures for small businesses. Additionally, he signed off on several stimulus tax measures to assist with the 2008 economic recovery -- such as a temporarily reduced payroll tax and an increased earned income tax credit. Some are still around, but others have phased out. It's fair to say that under Obama, for the most part, taxes have decreased for lower-income people and increased for upper-income people, Williams said. And it's a mixed bag for the middle class. Our ruling Bush said, ""The party in the White House"" is responsible for ""a massive tax increase on the middle class."" Bush pointed to the Affordable Care Act, which certainly does involve tax increases -- some of which affect the middle class, though not exclusively. It’s not accurate to call the tax increases for the middle class ""massive."" Some individuals might see their tax bill go up, while others see the tax benefits of the health care law outweigh the costs, and some might experience a change so small they don’t notice it. Looking only at the health care law also ignores other pieces of tax policy that have affected the bottom line for the middle class.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jun/23/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-obama-caused-massive-tax-increase-middle-/

Bill Clinton says Hillary was 'completely exonerated' in Whitewater
","Before the little blue dress and the tearful intern, there were 220 acres of prime Ozarks riverfront and a missing ledger of billing statements. While the Clintons’ Whitewater controversy often takes a backseat to the more notorious and sensational Lewinsky scandal, former President Bill Clinton remembers it well (and probably less wincingly). Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Clinton evoked Whitewater as an earlier instance when the American people were told his wife was untrustworthy, but it was then proven otherwise. ""I remember when Hillary was completely exonerated, when I was in the White House, in all that Whitewater business,"" Clinton said on June 14. ""An official federal inquiry said that her billing records, they wished for her sake could have been found earlier, because they completely corroborated everything she'd said."" (In a separate report, we looked at Bill Clinton's other comments about media coverage of Whitewater.) The investigations into Whitewater and the tangled web of the pre-Lewinsky scandals dragged on for six years and grew increasingly complicated, tedious, and impenetrable. Roughly $50 million later, none of the investigations found much evidence against the Clintons. Yet friends, foes, and the general public alike agree on one thing: Whitewater was so boring (""by design,"" writes Ann Coulter) that it became fascinating. So what exactly happened? What were the charges, and was Hillary ""completely exonerated"" as Bill says? Whitewater refresher ""All that Whitewater business"" began with a real estate investment made by then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in 1978. The Clintons along with developer James McDougal borrowed about $200,000 to buy and turn riverfront property into vacation homes. They formed the Whitewater Development Corp. with the initial investment, which was heavily subsidized by McDougal. The homes didn’t sell well, but McDougal and the Clintons kept the business going, and McDougal did occasional political fundraising for Clinton. In 1985, McDougal hired Rose Law Firm (where then-Arkansas First Lady Hillary Clinton was a partner) to do legal work for Madison Guaranty, his savings and loans. Later, when the investigations began, Rose Law Firm’s billing record for the thrift, signed off by Hillary Clinton, could not be found. Madison Guaranty failed in 1989, costing taxpayers an estimated $60 million. McDougal, who had been removed as its president three years earlier, was indicted for fraud for making bad loans. About $134,000 was funneled through Whitewater. The Clintons, who had retained interest in Whitewater throughout, sold their share to McDougal for $1,000 in 1992. During the first year of Bill Clinton’s presidency, the Resolution Trust Corp., a temporary federal agency tasked with investigating failed savings and loans, named the Clintons as ""potential beneficiaries"" of Madison Guaranty's and McDougal’s illegal activities. That summer, Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster committed suicide, a few months after he filed delinquent tax returns for Whitewater. The charge against the Clintons As the scandal began to snowball, so did the questions (and conspiracies): What happened to Vince Foster? How did the billing records go missing? Did the White House cooperate with investigators or try to thwart them? But the overarching charge was this: Did the Clintons benefit from Whitewater-related fraud or, at the very least, was Hillary Clinton aware of it? The Clintons denied knowledge of and participation in any wrongdoings. In 1994, a special counsel was appointed to look into the Clintons’ involvement in McDougal’s activities (he would later be replaced by the now-famous Kenneth Starr), while the RTC hired law firm Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro to independently investigate. The Senate and House began to hold hearings on the matter in 1995. Overall, Whitewater was the subject of at least four separate but overlapping federal probes encompassing more than 50,000 pages of documents. Out of many reports, one So which inquiry was Bill Clinton referring to? His spokesperson wouldn’t speak on the record, but based on Clinton’s past claims, it is likely the former president is talking about Pillsbury’s supplemental 1995 report. ""In mid-December, the complete Whitewater story finally came out, when the RTC inquiry from Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro was released,"" he wrote in his 2004 autobiography, My Life. ""It said, as had the preliminary report in June, that there were no grounds for a civil suit against us in Whitewater, much less any criminal action, and it recommended that the investigation be closed."" This description is more specific than Clinton’s 2015 remarks that his wife was ""completely exonerated"" and, after the discovery of the missing billing records. At the time of the December report’s release, the Clinton administration and Democrats had also lauded it as exoneration. Bruce Ericson, the Pillsbury lawyer who authored the reports, told us even back then he didn't agree with the Clintons’ characterization, given that Pillsbury’s charge was to weigh the pros and cons of a lawsuit. ""(The reports) didn’t condemn them, but it wasn’t our place to make that sort of judgment,"" he said. ""We were a bit uneasy about that word. I’m being lawyerly here, but that’s my job. We found a lawsuit against them would not be cost-effective or meritorious."" In the preliminary and supplemental reports, which were both authored before the billing records were found, Pillsbury deemed that the RTC had ""no cost-effective claims"" against the Clintons, as they could not find evidence of the First Couple’s involvement or awareness in Madison Guaranty-related fraud. The law firm wrote (page 2020):   ""There is no basis to charge the Clintons with any kind of primary liability for fraud or intentional misconduct. This investigation has revealed no evidence to support any such claims. Nor would the record support any secondary or derivative liability for the possible misdeeds of others."" Ericson’s sentiments were also echoed in the report, which noted that its conclusion (page 1945) ""doesn’t necessarily mean that ... the evidence exonerates anyone, it simply means that no basis has been found to sue anyone."" Other reports The mid-December Pillsbury report is one of many Whitewater reports. The law firm itself issued at least half a dozen, including two in late December 1995, just a few weeks after the supplemental report. While one report concluded that Hillary Clinton denied having knowledge of fraud and ""the circumstances support her"" (page 3307), the other stated that the RTC had grounds to sue Rose Law Firm for failing to disclose conflicts of interest that could have damaged the RTC, though a lawsuit wouldn’t be cost-effective (page 1465). After the missing billing records surfaced, Pillsbury released yet another report in February 1996 stating the discovery of the new evidence didn’t change the December conclusions. But, it noted, the records show that Hillary Clinton ""performed more services for Madison Guaranty than previously known"" (page 328).   The Senate’s special Whitewater committee, which was Republican controlled, issued a more damning report, which dealt largely with the White House’s conduct during the probes rather than the Clintons’ culpability in fraud. (The Starr report similarly began as a liability investigation but turned into a Lewinsky probe that only mentioned Whitewater once in passing.) ""Mrs. Clinton has minimized her role in the Rose Law Firm’s representation of Madison,"" the special committee wrote (page 156), ""The billing records ... directly contradict Mrs. Clinton’s claim that her role on the matter was merely to serve as a ‘backstop.’ "" Objecting to the ""partisanship (that) has colored the Majority’s decisions,"" Democrats on the special committee also released minority views, stating, ""No credible evidence has been put forward to show that Mrs. Clinton engaged in any improper, much less illegal, conduct."" Different readings The partisan divide over Hillary Clinton’s innocence extends beyond Capitol Hill. Conservative groups and journalists say the inquiries do the opposite of corroborate Hillary Clinton’s story and they in fact incriminate her ethically, if not legally. Given that Whitewater resulted in Bill Clinton’s impeachment and 16 related convictions, ""the idea that Hillary Clinton was ‘completely exonerated’ is not true,"" said a spokesperson for David Bossie, a former Whitewater investigator and now president of the conservative nonprofit Citizens United. He also pointed us to a May 1996 article in which another Pillsbury lawyer disagreed with the White House’s take on the report. Liberal observers, however, say her legal liability is precisely what matters. ""She wasn't found not guilty. She was never charged with anything except by innuendo in the media,"" said Arkansas Times columnist Gene Lyons. ""It's hard to say somebody was ‘exonerated’ when they were never actually charged. But HRC was certainly accused in the press, and her accusers certainly ignored the report that said she hadn't done anything wrong."" (We checked out that claim, too.) ""It isn’t up to the Clintons to prove their innocence,"" added Salon columnist Joe Conason. Our ruling Bill Clinton said his wife ""was completely exonerated, when I was in the White House""  by an official inquiry on Whitewater. A December 1995 report by the independent law firm Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro report found no evidence of the Clintons’ and particularly Hillary Clinton’s participation in fraud. Pillsbury’s task was to assess whether federal regulators could justify a lawsuit legally and cost-effectively. The report found that they couldn't, but the report and its authors didn’t and still don’t view their findings as exoneration. While some take issue with the word ""exoneration,"" Bill Clinton’s broader point that his wife wasn’t found guilty is accurate. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jun/23/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-hillary-was-completely-exonerate/

No media coverage of Hillary Clinton's 'exoneration' in Whitewater, says Bill Clinton
","Former President Bill Clinton said in a recent interview that questions over his wife’s trustworthiness have been put to rest in the past and will be again. Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Clinton compared the media frenzy over leaked emails, speaking fees, and Clinton Foundation donations with a 1995 Whitewater report that he said ""completely exonerated"" Hillary Clinton. Back then, the alleged exoneration didn’t get much traction in the news, he said. ""The next day, there was nothing in the media about it. There was stunning nondisclosure,"" he said on June 14. ""So, now we have got social media, and we can have disclosure. And we can all live under the same rules. And it's going to be fine."" His claim about missing coverage of Whitewater was as surprising to us as it was to the incredulous Clinton, so we decided to delve into the archives and see if we could confirm his claim. In a separate fact-check, we looked at the claim that the report ""completely exonerated"" her. That earned a rating of MostlyTrue. Investigating Whitewater The long, long Whitewater saga first came to public attention during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, when the New York Times published an article detailing the Clintons’ involvement in the late 1970s with Whitewater Development, a real estate corporation. Together with a longtime friend, James B. McDougal, the Clintons formed the company in order to buy and sell vacation property in the Ozark Mountains. McDougal, however, was also the president of Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan association. Over the following decade, the company became engaged in a number of risky real estate ventures and lending deals, including a number of political donations to Bill Clinton’s Arkansas gubernatorial campaign. When Madison Guaranty finally collapsed in 1989, McDougal was indicted on federal fraud charges; though he was later acquitted, a separate investigation ensued, one that eventually implicated the Clintons as potential beneficiaries of illegal activity. To further complicate matters, Hillary Clinton’s law firm had also represented Madison Guaranty as it fought unsuccessfully to prevent insolvency. After Clinton won the presidency, a confused mass of probes, committees, hearings, and special investigations ensued, proceedings that dogged Clinton through most of his tenure in the Oval Office. Questions were raised, as Republicans in Congress searched for a smoking gun: The only problem, to stretch a metaphor, was that nobody knew the make, the model, or even the existential status of the alleged firearm. The investigation was rife with leaks of undisclosed documents that dripped out slowly, and as we’ll see, that contributed a good bit to why the media covered the scandal the way they did.   The 1995 Pillsbury Report The Pillsbury Report sat squarely in the midst of this bureaucratic tangle. Commissioned in order to investigate the Clintons’ involvement in the Whitewater venture, it concluded that no civil action should be taken against anyone involved in the real estate deals. This is not the first time Clinton has expressed his disapproval over the media’s coverage of the 1995 report in question, which was authored by independent law firm Pillsbury, Madison, & Sutro and commissioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation, a now-defunct federal agency involved in the Whitewater investigation. In his autobiography, My Life, Clinton writes that he ""eagerly awaited"" the coverage of the New York Times and Washington Post on the report’s findings, but was disappointed by the results: ""Immediately after the RTC report was released, the Post mentioned it in passing, in the 11th paragraph of a front-page story...and the New York Times didn’t run a word. The Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and Washington Times ran an Associated Press story of about four hundred words on the inside pages of their papers."" In acknowledging that there was any press coverage at all, Clinton contradicts his recent statement that there was ""nothing in the media"" the day after the report was released. Nevertheless, his larger point seems to be that the press coverage of the event was severely lacking. So, is Clinton’s claim of ""stunning nondisclosure"" factual? The answer is slightly murky, since it’s unclear when the report’s findings came to light, and therefore how quickly news organizations responded to it. There exists a preliminary report dated to April 24, 1995, but it does not appear to have been released to the media at the time (more on this below). It seems more likely that Clinton is referring to the Dec. 13, 1995, report to the RTC, which concluded, ""It is recommended that no further resources be expended on the Whitewater part of the investigation."" The earliest media mention we could find of the December report is from the Dec. 16, 1995, Washington Post story that Clinton mentions in his book. The story focused on the White House easing conditions for the release of certain documents, noting that the report was sent to congressional committees two days earlier. Over the next week, articles about the Pillsbury report trickled out. On Dec. 18, both the Wall Street Journal and the San Jose Mercury News ran short stories, less than 150 words, giving succinct summaries of the report. The next day, ABC’s evening news program Nightline briefly discussed the findings, while the New York Times, like the Washington Post, mentioned the report within a larger story on missing Whitewater files. Later that week, the New York Times’ Sunday edition contained a story focused solely on the Pillsbury report. On Dec. 20, the New York Daily News ran two editorials on the Pillsbury report, one giving a nod and the other exploring the findings at length. So there was some press coverage, even if it wasn’t sufficiently exculpatory for Clinton’s taste. In fact, Howard Kurtz, in an editorial for the Washington Post on Dec. 22 (one praised by Clinton in his autobiography) discussed why there was scant media attention. Kurtz quoted several reporters from major newspapers as saying that the report was old news — a draft had been leaked that June — and beside the point: Attention to the Clintons’ participation in the land venture itself had dissipated, replaced instead by questions surrounding Hillary Clinton’s role as legal adviser to Madison Guaranty, the firm embroiled in the real estate deals surrounding the scandal. That particular issue would not be resolved until the Dec. 28 report on Clinton’s Rose Law Firm was released, which concluded on a similar note to the other report: ""It is recommended that no further resources be expended on this investigation."" We looked back to see if it was true that the December report’s findings had already been covered in the summer, and discovered that it was: Seven different newspapers wrote about the April 24 Pillsbury report on June 26 or 27, with the Washington Post devoting two separate stories to the issue.  Kurtz’s article also supplies another reason why media outlets might have been reluctant to devote too much coverage to the Pillsbury report, even after its findings were made public in December: It wasn’t available to them in its entirety. ""As soon as we can get ahold of the report, it's our intention to write an article about it,"" a New York Times editor told Kurtz, ""There's a lot of spin that goes along with these reports. That's why you have to look at them."" The New York Daily News, in its article from Dec. 20, gives the reason for this, writing that the report ""was shown to the Daily News by congressional Democrats,"" but ""the not-guilty verdict cannot be made public. It contains advice on how to prosecute other Arkansas figures, including their business partner James McDougal, and the government does not want that information to fall into the hands of defense attorneys."" Our ruling Bill Clinton said that after a federal inquiry substantially cleared Hillary Clinton on the Whitewater scandal, ""The next day, there was nothing in the media about it. There was stunning nondisclosure."" While the former president might technically be correct — after the Dec. 13 report was sent to Congress, nothing appeared in the papers the following day — there was some amount of press coverage over the following week and a half, including a discussion of why that press coverage was not more amplified, a discussion that Clinton himself acknowledges in his autobiography. Additionally, there had been substantial press coverage of the findings of a preliminary report once the media managed to obtain information from it.

A startling stat that checks out: 46 percent of young women in Japan are averse, uninterested in sex
","Aziz Ansari departs from the usual comedian slapstick in his first book, Modern Romance, teaming up with a sociologist and traveling overseas to examine the science of how people date in the Internet-at-your-fingertips age. The academic effort intrigued The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart during his June 16 interview with Ansari. Stewart asked his former Daily Show intern if he learned anything shocking during his time reporting for the book. Ansari zeroed in on how dating culture in Japan wasn’t what he expected. ""Well, when we went to Japan, I definitely had this thought of like, ‘Oh, that’s, like, such a technologically advanced culture, they're probably like on the cutting edge of whatever online dating or apps. And then you get there and you realize, I read all these articles, there’s like a crisis there,"" he said. ""And like there was some insane statistic, like, 46 percent of women between the age of 16 to 24 despise sexual contact. And 25 percent of the guys in that same age. ""Despise. Despise. Like, that is like, an aggressive word."" Ansari’s claim about nearly half of Japanese young women not being interested in sex also struck us as incredibly high, so we decided to check it out. What his book says In Modern Romance, Ansari spotlights international cultures in three cities that offer wildly different perspectives on dating: Paris, where relationships are more casual and similar to other European countries; Buenos Aires, which he describes as ""romantically aggressive;"" and Tokyo, where a lack of romance among young people amid falling marriage rates and birthrates has the government on edge. Japan is going through ""a crisis of sorts,"" and leaders are trying to intervene by offering subsidies for parents with kids and throwing state-funded dating events. Ansari brings up the figure about young women not being into sex in his book with a host of other scary statistics, writing, ""In 2013 a whopping 45 percent of women aged 16 to 24 ‘were not interested in or despised sexual contact,’ and more than a quarter of men felt the same way."" Ansari’s coauthor, New York University sociology professor Eric Klinenberg, showed PunditFact by email that the statistic is also cited in 2013 stories about Japanese young people’s disinterest in sex in the Guardian and Slate. Just one problem for English speakers: The source for the statistic is a survey by the Japan Family Planning Association and written in Japanese. PunditFact doesn’t know Japanese, but Kumiko Endo, a Japanese-American academic, does. Endo helped Ansari and Klinenberg navigate the complex story of Japan’s changing relationship norms for Modern Romance. A 34-year-old single woman born and raised in Japan, she said it makes sense why she chose to focus on the identity of Japanese singles and their role in the economy at The New School for Social Research. What the Japanese research shows The Japanese Family Planning Association has conducted this survey every two years since 2002, sending it to 3,000 people between 16 and 49. About 1,300 people responded in 2012, Endo said. Both men and women were asked to rate how interested they are in having sex from Very Interested, Somewhat Interested, Not Very Interested, Not Interested at All, and I Feel an Aversion to It. The percentage of women who responded they were not interested in sex at all or felt an aversion to it was 60.3 percent for ages 16-19 and 31.6 percent for ages 20-24. Combine the age groups, and the average response was about 46 percent negative — the figure that drove attention-grabbing stories in Western media. The association released its newest survey for 2014 a few months ago. In that survey, 65.8 percent of women 16-19 were not interested in sex or felt an aversion to it, and 39.2 percent of women 20-24 felt the same way. This survey is the only one we could find that asks about specific views of sex. Endo mentioned another survey by the government, the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, that asked 4,276 women, of which about 3,400 were 18 to 34, if they had ever had any kind of sexual encounter. The percentage of women ages 18-19 who said they had never had sex was 68.1 percent; for women 20-24, it was 40.1 percent; for women 25-29, it was 29.3 percent; and for women 30-34, 23.8 percent. ""So even at age 34, one out of four women are virgins in Japan,"" Endo said. ""It’s definitely not a religion that’s pushing that number."" (Japan is a secular society.) Endo mentioned a third survey by the NIPSSR that could corroborate the family planning association’s statistic. This one asks men and women if they have any relationships with the opposite sex — even platonic ones. Again, the results speak to a trend of disinterest. In 2010, 49.5 percent of unmarried single Japanese women between the ages of 18-34 said they have no relations with the opposite sex. For men, it was 61.4 percent on average. What changed There’s no simple explanation for what’s going on in Japan.  It’s been years in the making, though the drastic change has occurred in a relatively small window of time.  First of all, it’s important to understand some cultural differences. Endo says that where westerners might see sex as an act unto itself, in Japan ""sex was never an isolated thing."" In addition, the younger generation has never known anything but economic stagnation, which Endo notes could psychologically dampen interest in sex.  And Japanese younger than 27 also are the first to come up in a very changed educational system, one that is no longer centered on competition. All of these things, she speculates, might create a ""generational identity"" that feels differently about sex than the older cohort.  The funny thing is, among younger Japanese, it is only attitudes toward sex, not marriage, that have changed.  In the corporate-centered society that catapulted Japan into a leading world economy after World War II, men would graduate from college with job offers from corporations that offered employment and benefits for life. They met their wives through family or work, and the women would then leave their jobs to take on the role of primary caregiver for children and the elderly.  Family structure and the corporate system effectively constituted Japan’s ""welfare society,"" where the government indirectly provided for the people through its support of the corporations; in turn, their smooth functioning was based upon the understanding that women would provide child care and elderly care while receiving security and benefits in return as part of their husbands’ and sons’ lifetime employment. But the country’s real estate bubble burst in the 1990s, sending Japan into a long period of economic depression and stagnation. Where there once was job stability and the ability to plan ahead, there is now a system in restructuring mode and uncertainty.  On top of the worsened labor market, young people in Japan also have the burden of caring and preparing for the oldest population in the world. It would be reasonable to assume that all of these factors would cut into their interest in marriage, but it really hasn’t.  In 2010, 86.3 percent of men and 89.4 percent of women still said they ""intend to marry some day."" Japanese women assuming a strong professional role is relatively new, and gender equality in the labor market is decades behind other advanced industrialized nations, Endo said. But even though Japanese women are more and more highly educated and career-oriented, she said women 18- to 24-years-old have been expressing an increasing desire to become full-time housewives. It’s just that many of those same women say they’re not very interested in sex by itself. Our ruling Ansari said, ""46 percent of women between the age of 16 to 24 despise sexual contact"" in Japan. Despise seems a slightly bold word for it. Still, the surveys on this question all point to a healthy proportion of the young Japanese population having little interest in sex, relationships and dating, and one survey in particular reflects what Ansari said. Experts say Ansari had it right. We rate this claim True. Update: This item was updated on June 25 with more details about the relationship between marriage and sex in Japan.",/factchecks/2015/jun/23/aziz-ansari/startling-stat-checks-out-46-percent-young-women-j/

Scott Walker says Wisconsin fares better than nation on veteran unemployment
","Gov. Scott Walker is touting his record on veterans as he tours the country preparing to make a presidential bid.   At a ""Politics and Pies"" event May 30, 2015 in New Hampshire, Walker boasted of the success veterans have had finding jobs in Wisconsin. ""Nationally the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate,"" Walker said, adding Wisconsin is ""one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.""    Are Wisconsin veterans doing that well in the Wisconsin job market?   To support his claim, Walker's team sent a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics about veteran and non-veteran employment. This is the best way to make the comparison, as opposed to measuring veterans vs the overall workforce. Let’s see how it breaks down. The national picture: Walker said ""nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate.""   But the national unemployment rate for veterans is actually lower than the rate for non-veterans. For veterans, the rate was 5.3 percent, compared to 6 percent for non-veterans. That's true historically as well.   A report from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs shows that from 2000 to 2013, veterans had lower unemployment rates than non-veterans. The Wisconsin picture: Walker also said in Wisconsin ""unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population.""   Wisconsin's rate for veterans was 4.1 percent while the rate for non-veterans was 5.4 percent. So, the state's veterans are employed at higher rates than their civilian counterparts. How rare is it? In his claim, Walker said Wisconsin’s situation was a ""rare"" one. But 32 other states also had veteran unemployment rates lower than non-veterans. That’s not all that rare. Wisconsin vs. national: Finally, Walker said Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate was ""certainly lower than it is nationally.""  Federal data confirms this aspect of the claim, with Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, while nationally the rate was 5.3 percent. So, the data he provided supported two of the four aspects to his claim. More about the data Comparing the fraction of vets who are unemployed in the state to the fraction of unemployed vets nationally makes sense, said Steven Deller, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But unemployment rates don’t necessarily show the whole picture. The data takes an average from the last year’s monthly Current Population Survey of 60,000 households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. People who have worked at a regular job in the previous week are considered employed, while people who are jobless, looking for a job and available for work are considered unemployed. But the approach doesn’t account for workers who are underemployed or employed outside their field, and doesn’t take into account discouraged workers who stopped looking for a job. BLS does calculate other unemployment rates, though they are not often cited by politicians or the media. One is known as the U-6, which takes the total of the unemployed, all persons marginally attached to the labor force and involuntary part-time workers. A rule of thumb puts the U-6 rate as double the conventional unemployment rate. The U-6 rate for Wisconsin is 12.1, while the national rate is 13.8. BLS economist Steve Hipple calculated an estimated U-6 rate for veterans nationally at 9.7 percent. BLS doesn’t publish state U-6 rates specifically for veterans, . Our rating Walker said ""Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate,"" and Wisconsin is ""one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.""   Data from BLS supported two of the four aspects of his claim and experts cautioned about use of raw statistics. Our definition for Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.",/factchecks/2015/jun/23/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-fares-better-nation-ve/

Trump wrongly claims China is having its ‘worst year in 57 years’
","President Donald Trump exaggerated China’s economic slowdown during a recent rally for congressional candidate Dan Bishop in Fayetteville, N.C. ""I want China to do well, and I hope they do well, but they’ve had now the worst year in 57 years,"" he said during the Sept. 9 speech. It’s true that China’s economy is slumping, but 57 years ago, the country was still suffering from a massive famine brought on by Mao Zedong’s economic policies that historians say killed as many as 45 million people. We found it impossible to believe that today’s China is just as bad. In reality, China’s economy is growing at its slowest rate in about 27 or 29 — not 57 — years. The Trump campaign did not say what Trump was referring to, but based on similar statements he’s made in the past, it’s likely that he was talking about economic growth.  China’s gross domestic product grew 6.2% in the second quarter, marking its slowest pace since the first quarter of 1992, the earliest quarterly data available on record. But that’s the slowest quarterly growth in 27 years, not 57.  The slowdown matched analysts’ predictions, as the International Monetary Fund projected that China’s GDP would grow 6.2% over the course of 2019. The last time China’s GDP grew less than 6.2% in a year’s time was in 1990 — 29 years ago — when it grew just 3.9%. But China saw much harder times before that. For a number of years during the 1960s and ‘70s, the economy was in far worse shape than it is now, according to data from the World Bank. ""In the past 57 years China has had some very bad years in terms of growth and social development,"" said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s China Center. ""The current situation is nowhere near as dire as any of those other periods.""  The Trump campaign pointed to a Wall Street Journal report suggesting China’s growth could be weaker than its official data lets on. ""Some economists who have dissected China’s GDP numbers say more accurate figures could be up to 3 percentage points lower, based on their analysis of corporate profits, tax revenue, rail freight, property sales and other measures of activity that they believe are harder for the government to fudge,"" the report said. But even if China’s GDP growth rate was closer to 3.2%, Trump’s 57-year figure would remain a stretch, since China’s GDP was contracting as recently as 1976, 43 years ago. Oddly enough, the president accurately described China’s economic slide as the ""worst in 27 years"" several times in July and August before experimenting with other timelines. Recently, Trump had said China’s economy was at its worst point in ""30, 40 years,"" ""54 years,"" ""52 or 54 years,"" ""30 to 50 years"" and ""61 years.""  Reports in the Wall Street Journal have also made note of China’s falling currency and diminishing industrial production. But as the New York Times noted, those economic metrics show China struggling, but not to the point of breaking 57-year records.  In August, the Chinese yuan tumbled to its lowest value in 11 years. And in July, China’s industrial output growth slowed to 4.8% from a year earlier, a 17-year low. Mary Lovely, professor of economics at Syracuse University and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said China’s economic slump is not particularly shocking to those who track economic growth data. ""As an economy develops, growth rates come down,"" she said. ""Over the long term, we have seen China’s average growth rate decline, which is what we would expect."" In the United States, for example, the growth rate is much lower — it was 2.8% in 2018, according to the World Bank — because growth is more dependent on technological advances than making efficient use of existing resources, Lovely said. Trump said China has ""had now the worst year in 57 years."" China’s GDP recently grew at its slowest quarterly rate in 27 years, and it is projected to grow at its slowest yearly rate in 29 years. So China’s economy is slowing. But it’s not at its worst point in 57 years.  We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/sep/10/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-china-having-its-worst-year-5/

Did most Americans lose wealth, income under Barack Obama?
","In his new book, longtime Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg argues that the 2016 election sowed the seeds for the demise of the Republican Party. But along the way, he also offers some tough love for Democrats. In Greenberg’s book, ""RIP GOP: How the New America Is Dooming the Republicans,"" he wrote a chapter titled ""How did Democrats let Trump win?"" In it, he argues that Obama-era Democratic messaging on the economy wasn’t breaking through to Americans who continued to feel worried about the economy. ""What was the reality for most Americans during the Obama presidency? Most lost wealth and their incomes fell, particularly for those at the bottom of the ladder,"" Greenberg wrote. Is that correct? Mostly, though it depends a bit on when you start counting. To measure the ups and downs of wealth during Obama’s presidency we first turned to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.  We started by looking at the trends in wealth holdings among several portions of the income spectrum in 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2019. (The survey data is collected every three years.) As the chart below shows, the only increase in wealth during that period accrued to the top 10% of the income spectrum, which saw a 27% rise in wealth. The bottom 80% lost wealth, either a little or a lot. Losses ranged from half a percentage point to 70%   To the individuals facing such losses, the starting point may not matter much, but since Greenberg singled out Obama’s tenure in office, economists suggested we also look at the pattern beginning in 2010, to deemphasize the impact of the Great Recession, which Obama inherited. If you use 2010 as the baseline, the picture looks significantly more favorable to Obama. From 2010 to 2016, only the lowest 20 percent of the income range saw their wealth decline. For every other percentile, wealth rose, with the increases ranging from 12% to 24%.   Meanwhile, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, cautioned that these traditional measures are skewed against lower-income Americans, who may lack big bank accounts and 401(k) balances and may not be homeowners but who can expect to receive payments from Social Security and Medicare that will usually return more than they paid in. To determine whether incomes fell during Obama’s presidency, we turned to a study we’ve cited previously by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. This study looked at how much income people received compared with what they received in 1979. The chart below -- which doesn’t count taxes and federal payments, such as Social Security -- shows that between 2008, the year before Obama took office, and 2015, the final year of the study, inflation-adjusted income was essentially flat for the bottom 80% of earners. Income rose only for the top one-fifth of earners.   However, if you use data that takes transfers (such as government benefits) and taxes into account -- things that Obama would have had some influence on -- the picture is somewhat more favorable. The bottom 20% saw their income rise by 29% above inflation during the Obama years, and for those between the 21st to 80th percentile, it rose by 13%.   Greenberg said, ""What was the reality for most Americans during the Obama presidency? Most lost wealth and their incomes fell, particularly for those at the bottom of the ladder."" Over the course of Obama’s presidency, wealth and income did either stagnate or decline. However, this full tenure included a precipitous drop from the Great Recession that Obama inherited, so the numbers look better if you start counting from the depths of the recession instead. The Obama team can claim they accomplished positive growth on the economy, while Greenberg is right that many everyday Americans still suffered losses.  We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/sep/10/stanley-greenberg/did-most-americans-lose-wealth-income-under-barack/

Did Chris Jones lead the fight for Medicaid expansion in Virginia?
 ","Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, is introducing himself to voters in his newly-redrawn district as the champion of Medicaid expansion in Virginia. The Democratic Party of Virginia says his claim is bogus. Jones, the powerful chairman of the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee, is airing a 30-second ad showing him at work as a pharmacist. ""Chris Jones opened Bennet’s Creek Pharmacy, offering quality, affordable health care,"" the narrator says. ""That’s why he led the fight to expand Medicaid and improve our mental health system."" The ad shifts to L.D. Britt, a surgeon and professor at Eastern Virginia Medical School. ""Chris Jones - to get expansion, that is a major accomplishment,"" he says.The screen flashes: ‘CHRIS JONES EXPANDED MEDICAID for 400,000 VIRGINIANS."" The state Democratic party, in an Aug. 20 news release, denounced Jones’ ad as ""a craven attempt to mislead his constituents."" The Democrats said Jones spent years ""fighting tooth and nail to deny thousands of people in his community access to affordable health care."" So we fact-checked Jones’ claim that he led the expansion fight and found that its accuracy varies, depending on the year. Jones’ was a point man in a 2018 bipartisan compromise that allowed Medicaid to cover more than 400,000 additional low-income Virginians. But his ad doesn’t say that from 2013 to 2017, he played a leading part in blocking it. The roles Jones and other legislators played in Medicaid expansion could be a big issue this fall when all 140 General Assembly seats are on ballots. Democrats need to flip one seat in the Senate and two in the House to control of both chambers for the first time since 1999. House Democrats may be aided by a 2018 judicial finding that some election districts had been racially gerrymandered. Court-ordered remapping has placed six Republicans incumbents - including Jones and Speaker Kirk Cox of Colonial Heights - in newly-shaped districts with a majority of Democratic voters.  Jones’ old district, which elected him 11 times, was 56% Republican, 44% Democratic, according to the non-partisan Virginia Public Access Project. His new district is 43% red, 57% blue. Jones is being challenged by Clint Jenkins, a realtor and local Democratic activist.  Let’s take a deeper look at Jones’ record on Medicaid expansion, starting with the early years. Jones, 2013 to 2017 States were offered an option to expand their Medicaid programs to cover households earning up to 138% of the poverty line, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. The Affordable Care Act - or Obamacare - promised the federal government would pay all expansion costs at first, and never less than 90%.  Republican leaders - including outgoing Gov. Bob McDonnell and then-Speaker Bill  Howell - declared their opposition in early 2013, saying they didn’t trust the federal pledge to pick up most of the expansion costs and that Virginia’s program was too inefficient to let grow. The state’s Medicaid costs during the previous decade had grown an average 9% a year, according to the Joint Subcommittee for Health and Human Resources. Jones was on a team of budget negotiators that year that created a commission to find efficiencies in Virginia’s program that might open the door to future expansion. Democrat Terry McAuliffe became governor in 2014 and made Medicaid expansion a top priority, accusing Republicans of turning down a federal windfall. Jones told reporters that January, ""I don’t see any possibility of expansion this session,"" and repeated his reforms-first mantra.  Jones undercut McAuliffe’s efforts to work expansion into the state budget and opposed it in a partisan floor vote. During a Feb. 20, 2014 floor speech, he said expansion should include a work requirement for able, adult Medicaid recipients.  The Washington Post, in a June 23, 2014 article, identified Jones as ""a leader in the fight against Medicaid expansion."" McAuliffe tried again to expand Medicaid during the final three years of his term. Each time, Jones and his Appropriations Committee stripped it from the budget. ""He knows we’re not going to give him that,"" Jones said in Dec. 16, 2016. The Richmond Times-Dispatch - in an April 6, 2017 article - reported that Jones was on a team of five Republican budget negotiators for the House who ""have steadfastly opposed Medicaid expansion.""   At the time, Republicans occupied 66 of the 100 House seats. But they were rocked in 2017 elections when Democrats gained 15 seats and cut the GOP’s majority to one vote. Speaker Howell, a staunch opponent of expansion, didn’t run re-election. Democrat Ralph Northam was elected governor. In the changed political landscape, lawmakers were willing to deal. Jones, 2018 With the blessings of Cox, the new speaker, Jones presented House Republicans with a budget option to expand Medicaid. It won enough support to pass the House with strong Democratic backing. The deal had two key components: *A work requirement for able-bodied adults on Medicaid. The Trump administration announced on Jan. 11, 2018 it would allow states to establish such programs, clearing uncertainty among Virginia Republicans. *Hospitals would pay the state’s expansion costs through a new provider tax, an idea proposed by McAuliffe in 2015 and conditionally backed that year by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. Hospitals concluded that, even with the tax, they would come out ahead because the expansion would cut their losses in treating uninsured patients.  The hospital tax eased GOP concerns that, if the federal government lowered its financial commitment to expansion, the state would be stuck with a large bill. Jones was also able to point to a report showing the efficiency commission had lowered state Medicaid costs by $43 million a year. Jones fine-tuned the deal with Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, the co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Hanger withstood heavy criticism from Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, and gained a few crucial Republican votes. The final deal passed the House in a 68-30 vote to approve the budget, with 21 of 50 Republicans in support. It passed the Senate, 23-17, with four of 21 Republicans in support.  During a June 7 ceremony on Capitol steps, Northam signed the state budget that expanded Medicaid. He credited three Republicans: Jones, Cox and Hanger. Northam said he would save a signing pen for Jones, who didn’t attend the event because of work. Jones’ view Jones says that - unlike many of his Republican colleagues - he never took a hardline position against expansion. He says he consistently said he’d be open to expansion if Virginia's Medicaid program was first streamlined, and that happened. The hospital tax was also key, ""It was always the question of how do we pay for this,"" he said during an Aug. 23 interview. Jones defended his campaign ad. ""I was the chief architect of Medicaid expansion as it is today,"" he said, also giving credit to Hanger and the Northam administration. ""I was the point person in this. I got if off the floor."" Addressing the Democratic Party’s criticism of his commercial, Jones said, ""Maybe they would have preferred for me to say, ‘I led the fight to responsibly expand Medicaid.’"" Our Ruling In a TV ad, Jones claims he ""led the fight to expand Medicaid""  in Virginia. Jones played an enormous role in the 2018 passage of expansion. He was a go-to man in building a bipartisan compromise on an issue that had divided Democrats and Republicans for years. Gov. Northam, a Democrat, has acknowledged Jones’ role.  But the fight to expand Medicaid began in 2013, and during the first four years Jones spearheaded the Republican majority’s resistance. He opposed expansion in a floor vote. As chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, he repeatedly helped strip expansion from proposed state budgets. Jones credibly says he never shut the door on expansion and helped bring Medicaid efficiencies that made the expansion palatable to other Republicans. But it also can be said that Jones helped deny health insurance to 400,000 Virginians for four years. Twenty-nine states expanded their coverage before Virginia. Jones’ ad claim addresses half of a complicated story. So we rate it Half True.  ",/factchecks/2019/sep/10/chris-jones/did-chris-jones-lead-medicaid-expansion-virginia-y/

Evidence shows most of the 47 men in famous 'Declaration of Independence' painting were slaveholders
","As the nation observes the 400th anniversary of slavery, a Chicago documentary filmmaker tweeted about the painting Declaration of Independence, which hangs in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. The painting depicts a moment in 1776 showing 47 men, including Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock and Ben Franklin, most of whom were signers of the declaration. ""This is one of the most famous paintings in American history: Declaration of Independence,"" Arlen Parsa wrote above an image of the 1818 oil by John Trumbull.

Starting with evidence Parsa provided to back up his claim, we did our own research on each of the 47. (This chart identifies all 47.) Go here to see a spreadsheet detailing the evidence we examined. ""Most of the quantification is best-guess and based on available records,"" said historian Terry Bouton at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ""The problem is that property records are pretty spotty for the more obscure founders and even some of the bigger names."" But, using books, historical organizations, research articles and other sources, we found there is strong evidence to back Parsa’s claim. The slaveholders tended to be men of means, including landowners, doctors, lawyers and local government officials.  Here are the 34 men in the painting we found to be slaveholders, in alphabetical order by last name: Josiah Bartlett, Charles Carroll, Samuel Chase, Abraham Clark, George Clinton, John Dickinson, William Floyd, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock,  Benjamin Harrison, Joseph Hewes, Thomas Heyward Jr., William Hooper, Stephen Hopkins, Francis Hopkinson, Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee. And Francis Lewis, Philip Livingston, Robert R. Livingston, Thomas Lynch, Arthur Middleton, Lewis Morris, Robert Morris, William Paca, George Read, Benjamin Rush, Edward Rutledge, Richard Stockton, William Whipple, Thomas Willing, John Witherspoon, Oliver Wolcott and George Wythe. The men who did not own slaves also tended to be well-to-do. Here are the 13 who apparently did not own slaves: John Adams, Samuel Adams, George Clymer, William Ellery, Elbridge Gerry, Samuel Huntington, Thomas McKean, Robert Treat Paine, Roger Sherman, Charles Thomson, George Walton, William Williams and James Willson. Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz noted that at least three men in the painting, including Franklin, were or later became abolitionists. Also, in 1776, slavery was legal in all 13 of the new states and was ""condoned by the entire West,"" including Britain and France, he said. ""As the men who drafted and signed the Declaration were mostly gentlemen of standing and property, it's not at all surprising that this would be the case,"" Wilentz added. Brown University emeritus history professor Gordon Wood said Parsa’s claim reveals how prevalent slavery was.  But, ""what's important is that slavery began to be attacked and eliminated from that moment on,"" Wood said. ""The first anti-slave convention in history was held in Philadelphia in 1775. The American Revolution made slavery a problem for the world when it had not been a problem before, having existed for thousands of years without substantial criticism. All this is lost in today’s climate."" Parsa said 34 of the 47 men depicted in the famous ""Declaration of Independence"" painting were slaveholders. We found strong evidence to back the claim on the 34, recognizing there is no one definitive source on the question.

How many guns are on the streets in the United States?
","During an appearance on PBS’s Amanpour & Company, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke discussed Walmart’s recent decision to stop the sale of ammunition that can be used in assault rifles and to ask customers to not openly carry firearms in its stores. The decision came in the wake of an Aug. 3 mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart, where a gunman killed 22 people. O’Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso, called Walmart’s decision ""a great example of corporate responsibility"" and a ""step in the right direction."" ""But if we wait for this kind of corporate responsibility across the country given the number of gun shows and gun dealers and gun stores, we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives,"" O’Rourke said. ""There are 390 million guns out on the streets of a country of 329 million people. We have to take decisive action and it has to come from our government."" Is O’Rourke right on his figures about the number of guns in the country? The last time PolitiFact looked at these numbers, it was estimated that there were roughly 310 million civilian-owned guns in the United States. New survey Chris Evans, a spokesman for O’Rourke, pointed to a report published by the Global Small Arms Survey in May 2019 that found there are more civilian-owned firearms in the United States than in any other country. The Small Arms Survey, an operation at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, found that there were more than 393 million civilian firearms holdings in the United States, as of June 2018. The report also detailed firearms owned by the U.S. military — about 4.5 million — and by law enforcement agencies — about 1 million. The group’s estimates are developed using a variety of data sources and its work is considered by experts to be the most comprehensive research that exists on private gun ownership globally. In the United States, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives publishes annual reports about the number of firearms that have been manufactured, exported and imported. It also looks at the number of federal licenses issued to manufacturers. But a spokesman for the agency said it does not have an aggregate figure for the total number of guns in circulation. A 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service estimated that in 1996 there were 242 million civilian-owned firearms; in 2000 there were 259 million; and in 2009 there were 310 million. The figure for 2009 was significant, as it marked the first year that the number of civilian-owned firearms surpassed the nation’s total population, according to the Washington Post. Evans pointed to reporting from the Washington Post on the latest Small Arms Survey report, an article titled: ""There are more guns than people in the United States, according to a new study of global firearm ownership."" The Washington Post found that, using the estimate from the Small Arms Survey, there are enough civilian-owned firearms in the United States ""for every man, woman and child to own one and still have 67 million guns left over."" At the end of June 2018, when the estimate was published, the United States’ population was roughly 327 million. Today, it is more than 329 million. Globally, researchers with the group estimate that 85% of the 1 billion firearms in global circulation are in civilian hands — that’s 857 million guns. Of the remaining guns, roughly 13% are in military use and 2% are owned by law enforcement agencies. The number of firearms around the world has increased substantially, largely due to an increase in civilians purchasing guns, researchers found. The number of civilian-owned guns worldwide grew from 650 million in 2006 to 857 million in 2017. The United States makes up the bulk of all civilian-owned firearms. ""Even after adjusting for population, it is clear that the United States far outnumbers other countries,"" reads a release from the group. ""The United States has 4% of the world’s population, but its civilians hold almost 40% of the world’s firearms.""

"['Pensions', 'Illinois', 'Lori Lightfoot']","
Lightfoot stretches the numbers on Downstate public safety pension funds
","The day after her televised ""State of the City"" address, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot made a series of editorial board stops to discuss the city’s major budgetary challenges. At the top of her list was Chicago’s pension debt, which has ballooned to $30 billion across its four public employee funds. In her opening remarks to the Chicago Sun-Times editorial board, Lightfoot said she hoped her speech would serve as ""a call to arms"" for not only Chicago residents but Illinoisans in other cities and towns grappling with chronically underfunded pensions. That underscores a theme from her address that the state must band together to partner in reform. Like Chicago, state government faces its own massive pension overhang. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has ruled out the state stepping in to take over municipal funds, saying that to do so would reduce its credit rating to junk status. However, he has left open the possibility that municipal pension funds could consolidate, pooling their assets to boost investment returns. During her sit-down with the Sun-Times, Lightfoot was asked how she would keep the rest of the state from viewing an all-in approach on pensions as Chicago getting a ""bailout"" from the state, something critics Downstate claim the city often receives. She responded with this: ""We’ve got 600-plus police and fire pensions Downstate that are on the cusp of insolvency because they don’t have the revenues that they need to be able to keep those pensions going,"" she said. ""They’ve done all the things that we have done historically: raised property taxes, sold assets, had their ratings reduced by rating agencies, and they’re out of levers to pull, so they need help just as we do. So this isn’t a Chicago-specific thing."" Lightfoot is correct that cities and towns outside Chicago are pressured with mounting pension debt. By raising the specter of insolvency, however, the mayor suggests the situation faced by the vast majority of Downstate public safety pension funds is far more dire than it really is. Her claim raises questions on its face because the number she cited references the rough tally for all Downstate police and fire pension funds — not just those with severe funding gaps. Each year, Downstate police and fire pension funds file a report with the Illinois Department of Insurance, or DOI. Data from 2017 filings made by 632 such funds were compiled in a July report by the state legislature’s bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. Collectively, the unfunded liabilities for those funds rose to $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, the commission found, and they had the assets needed to cover 55% of their liabilities. While that’s far from the 90% funding level the state requires them to reach by 2040, it doesn’t suggest most will soon be shuttering. That same year, unfunded liabilities for Chicago’s police and fire funds reached nearly $14.5 billion. ""I think highlighting that there are lots of police and fire pension systems that are underfunded is accurate,"" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago. ""I don’t think it’s accurate to indicate that the majority are on the brink of insolvency."" After we reached out to the mayor’s office for clarification, her spokeswoman sent us a response that did not back up Lightfoot’s specific claim. ""The mayor’s point that municipalities throughout the state are struggling with their pension obligations is an important one,"" spokeswoman Anel Ruiz wrote in an email. ""Approximately 30% of the 632 public safety pension funds in the state are currently funded at ratios of under 50 percent, according to the Department of Insurance."" That math tracks with the DOI data included in the commission’s report. For comparison, Chicago’s police and fire pensions are both funded at levels below 25%. Just 25 Downstate public safety funds have a ratio lower than that, records show. But Lightfoot didn’t just reference the declining health of some Downstate public safety funds in the aggregate. Instead, she said more than 600 Downstate pensions are ""on the cusp of insolvency."" Lightfoot said more than 600 police and fire pension funds in Downstate Illinois ""are on the cusp of insolvency because they don’t have the revenues that they need to be able to keep those pensions going."" The source for that figure refers to the total number of Downstate public safety pensions — not just those in financial distress. And while the average funded ratio for those funds is far from the target set by the state, experts told us it’s not accurate to claim that nearly all of them are nearing a point where they won’t be able to make payments to current retirees.

"['Candidate Biography', 'North Carolina', 'Dan Bishop']","
The Bishop campaign says McCready 'really admires socialism.' Pants on Fire!
","In an ad released in the final weeks before a special election in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, Republican Dan Bishop claimed his opponent Dan McCready is a socialist. The ad opens with a mash-up of video clips in which President Donald Trump says, ""Dan McCready … is an ultra liberal. … He likes open borders, and he really admires socialism."" The footage comes from a rally in Greenville, N.C., in July when Trump endorsed Bishop and attacked his opponent. Even though the words come from Trump, the Bishop campaign chose to use the claim in its ad, so we are rating Bishop in this fact-check.  Next, the ad shows McCready alongside Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez while a voiceover drones, ""Dan McCready, a liberal backed by radicals who want open borders and socialized medicine."" Other Republicans have made similar charges about McCready, the Democratic nominee, being a socialist, so we decided to check it out. We’re mindful that this is a familiar page from the Republican playbook. PolitiFact has explored many similar claims about Barack Obama, Sen. Bill Nelson and three members of the Ohio congressional delegation, among others. (In the case of the Ohio Democrats, not just socialists, but ""card-carrying socialists."") Those claims were all rated Pants on Fire. And so it’s no surprise that Bishop’s claim is also ridiculously false. In fact, McCready is a business owner who proudly proclaims himself a capitalist. McCready distances himself from left-wing national politicians Under socialism, the government controls the means of production. But McCready hasn’t called for the end of the private sector. To the contrary, he started his own clean energy investment firm, Double Time Capital.  We contacted Bishop’s campaign to find out what evidence it had of McCready’s socialist leanings and got no reply.  So we tried on our own. We searched McCready’s website and his statements and found no evidence to back up the claim from Bishop’s ad. The National Republican Congressional Committee suggested that McCready was a socialist in a May statement linking him with ""his party’s radical ideas such as infanticide, a socialist takeover of the entire economy with the Green New Deal and government-run socialized health care."" That’s a common tactic, said Dr. J. Michael Bitzer, history and politics professor at Catawba College. Republicans often try to group local Democratic candidates with more liberal national politicians to sway voters.  ""First, it was tying all Democratic candidates to Nancy Pelosi in 2018 to try to lower their favorability. Then, with the president going after AOC and the Squad, guilt by association has become a standard mantra for Republican campaigns,"" Bitzer said. In fact, experts say McCready intentionally has distanced himself from left-wing Democrats in Congress. One Washington Post article tallies all of the ways he’s done that: ""He pledged not to support Nancy Pelosi for House speaker. He opposed impeachment. He returned a donation from Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota after she suggested that Israel's advocates were buying off Congress."" McCready doesn’t support open borders or socialized medicine A recent Trump tweet echoed that McCready ""wants Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities, and Socialism."" (PolitiFact checked Trump’s claim about McCready’s immigration stances and rated it Mostly False.) McCready’s policy proposals are a far cry from socialist. They often don’t even go as far as the mainstream Democratic platform. ""There’s some distance between McCready and the national Democratic platform,"" said Dr. Susan Roberts, political science professor at Davidson College. ""He does not support Medicare for All. He does not support a ban on assault weapons."" Also, he’s repeatedly dismissed the Green New Deal and other policies embraced by many Democratic presidential candidates. In a CNN interview, McCready scoffed at Bishop’s attacks. ""Unfortunately for him, he's not running against a socialist. He's running against a capitalist who's built a business from scratch."" Our ruling Bishop, Trump, and the NRCC are trying to portray the Democratic candidate McCready as a socialist, but there’s simply no evidence to support their absurd charge.  McCready is a businessman who has benefited from capitalism and even has distanced himself from liberal Democrats.  As election day nears, we need to take a match to the Truth-O-Meter.

Reed points to economic gains
","Rep. Tom Reed, R-Corning, recently tied his claims about the strength of the economy to the tax code changes signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017.  ""Recession? I don’t think so,"" Reed tweeted. ""Our economy is booming after tax cuts. The typical American worker’s pay is growing at more than 3 percent a year. Record low unemployment. Retail spending up big.""    Recession? I don't think so.Our economy is booming after tax cuts...✅The typical American worker’s pay growing at more than 3 percent a year.✅Record low unemployment.✅Retail spending up big. pic.twitter.com/VeIft20cxd The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanently reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and made changes to business tax deductions. For individual filers, the act increased the standard deduction and child credit while eliminating personal exemptions, among other changes, such as capping the state and local tax deduction at $10,000. It is true that median worker pay has increased and the unemployment rate is down. But Reed intimated the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is responsible for the economic gains. We asked Reed’s office about the link. Reed's spokesman did not refute that he made such a connection, nor did he provide evidence establishing a link between them.  We wondered if the federal tax law is responsible, as Reed implied, for American workers’ pay increasing and the lower unemployment.   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that as of July 2019, median worker pay increased by 3.7 percent over the last year. When inflation is accounted for, wage growth was 2 percent during the same period. Reed’s spokesman, Will Reinert, pointed us to that data, and economists we spoke with described it as the most reliable data on the topic.  Several economists said Reed’s claim about wage growth is true, though to get a true picture of how well wages are staying ahead of inflation, inflation must be part of the calculation. However, just because inflation isn’t factored in doesn’t make Reed’s claim false, said Benjamin Page, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.  As for unemployment, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Aug. 2 that as of July 2019, the unemployment rate was 3.7 percent. Historical data from the labor statistics bureau shows that the unemployment rate has generally fallen since a high of 10 percent in October 2009. Looking back to 1948, the unemployment rate has been lower than the current rate of 3.7 percent in the late 1960s but also in the 1950s and in 1948. Reed tweeted: ""Our economy is booming after tax cuts."" But is it booming because of tax cuts? In May, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said the effects were minimal. ""On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy,"" analysts wrote. ""Although examining the growth rates cannot indicate the effects of the tax cut on GDP, it does tend to rule out very large effects in the near term."" On wages, analysts found that ""ordinary workers had very little growth in wage rates."" We also interviewed four economists about Reed’s claims.  Page, of the Tax Policy Center, said the tax law had some effect, though the unemployment rate and wage growth are consistent with historical trends. Since 2015, two years before the law was passed, median weekly earnings have been growing, on average, at 3 percent, he said. ""It’s not something that all of the sudden happened,"" he said.    Leonard Burman, a professor at Syracuse University and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis in the Treasury Department, said that the tax law and spending increases signed by Trump boosted the economy primarily by increasing households’ disposable income, but that economists ""cannot precisely measure the current effects of the tax cut as compared with many other important factors.""  ""The main explanation for the statistics that Congressman Reed cites is that we are at the peak of the business cycle,"" Burman said.  Neel Rao, an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University at Buffalo, said Reed’s claims have ""some basis in fact,"" but that ""it’s not the whole story."" Rao said there is no solid evidence linking what is happening in the labor market to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics data show, unemployment has been on a downward trend before the tax reform package went into effect.   Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy at the free-market American Enterprise Institute, agreed that wages are rising nominally by 3 percent per year and that unemployment is at historic lows, but that there isn’t enough evidence that the tax reform package had anything to do with it.  ""If you look at the trend in average wages and employment before and after December 2017, there is nothing to suggest that the (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) has had an impact on that trend,"" Mathur said. Both unemployment and wages were ""trending smoothly"" well before the tax legislation was passed, she said.  After tax cuts, Reed said, unemployment is at a record low and that average worker pay is rising by more than 3 percent.  That's not in dispute, with the caveat that unemployment was lower in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. But he implies it is because of the tax cuts, and that's not the case, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the economists we talked to. The economic indicators were trending that way before the law was passed in 2017.  His statement is partially accurate. There have been economic gains. But he takes things out of context when he neglects to mention economists and a nonpartisan congressional research report indicate the tax cuts didn't have much to do with it.

Andrew Yang revives debunked claim about Green New Deal killing air travel
","When asked about the Green New Deal during CNN’s climate change town hall, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said he embraced the plan, with one caveat: Its deadline for ending air travel is too tight, he said. ""The only issue I have with the Green New Deal is the timing of the timeline,"" Yang said. ""I mean, they are right that we need to take urgent action, but the timeline that they put out there would do away with commercial air travel and a lot of other things in a particular time frame, that, if we have a little bit more time, we can head in the same direction and achieve most of the same value."" But Yang got his facts mixed up. The Green New Deal makes no mention of air travel, much less doing away with it. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., unveiled a House version of the Green New Deal Feb. 7. In the Senate, Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey introduced a companion measure. Broadly speaking, these resolutions express aspirations to curb climate change and protect the environment by investing in renewable energy and infrastructure, in a way that’s equitable and creates jobs. Even if it were to pass both chambers, the resolution is nonbinding.  The initial proposal was met with great fanfare among Democrats. The House version had 89 Democratic co-sponsors, and nearly a dozen Democratic senators — including presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — sponsored their chamber’s version. So what does the Green New Deal say about air travel? In a word, nothing. It makes no mention of airplanes at all. It does call for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" Yang’s campaign did not respond to our request for comment. But his mixup may trace back to the Green New Deal’s sloppy rollout — which became the basis of the (mostly Republican) talking point about Democrats wanting to phase out commercial air travel. Around the time of the Green New Deal’s unveiling, Ocasio-Cortez’s office released a frequently asked questions, or FAQ, as a supplement to the plan. The document mentioned airplanes twice, stating (emphasis ours) ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero."" The FAQ also called for the United States to ""totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle."" Republican politicians, including President Donald Trump, senators and conservative media outlets pounced on the idea that the Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete. Ocasio-Cortez’s press office did not reply for this fact-check, but her chief of staff previously said that there were many shared documents among various interest groups, and that the release of this particular document was a mistake. Fact-checkers at PolitiFact, the Washington Post and Factcheck.org have all debunked the claim. But as Yang’s statement shows, the notion persists. When we previously looked at this claim, experts on climate change told us it’s important to focus on the language in the actual resolution and not the FAQ, which carries no weight. ""It seems to me those lines from the FAQ were lighthearted and ill-considered, and it’s not clear why they were posted,"" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA law school. Air travel retains a unique role in moving people long distances. ""When people rank the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the hardest both technologically and practically, and there aren’t serious policy proposals yet that would solve the issue through limiting air travel or changing the energy sources for commercial aircraft on a significant scale,"" Hecht said. ""So it’s not a priority for policy."" In the long run, electric planes may be feasible, said Paul Bledsoe, a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute and a lecturer on environmental policy at American University. ""No serious climate experts advocate ending air travel — that's simply a red-herring,"" said Bledsoe, who was a climate change advisor to the Clinton White House. Yang said the Green New Deal ""would do away with commercial air travel."" The resolution makes no mention of ending air travel. Instead, it calls for ""overhauling transportation systems,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" His claim may trace back to a Republican talking point, based on a messaging document from Democrats that mentioned, perhaps in jest, getting rid of ""farting cows and airplanes."" But we found no evidence that getting rid of airplanes is a serious policy idea from climate advocates.

Elizabeth Warren blamed 3 industries for 70% of greenhouse gases. That muddles the picture
","Near the end of her turn on CNN’s climate change town-hall-a-thon, host Chris Cuomo asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren about lightbulbs. Specifically, if the government should be telling people the kind of lightbulbs they can have. The Democratic presidential candidate cast the issue as a diversion from the real task at hand. ""This is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we're all talking about,"" Warren said. ""They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, straws and cheeseburgers, when 70% of the pollution of the carbon that we're throwing into the air comes from three industries."" After the town hall, Warren repeated the 70% statistic on Instagram.   The fossil fuel industry wants to keep us arguing about light bulbs and cheeseburgers while 70% of pollution comes from just three industries. We need to focus on creating big, structural change to tackle this climate crisis and the Washington corruption head-on. #ClimateTownHall A post shared by  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Sep 4, 2019 at 8:20pm PDT We wondered which three industries the Democratic presidential candidate had in mind. Warren’s campaign directed us to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency’s page on the sources of greenhouse gas emissions shows that three sectors —transportation, electricity production and industry — account for 78% of the American total. But those are activities, not industries in themselves. Transportation, the biggest of the three, includes the cars people drive and the flights they take for business and pleasure. ""It is strange, obviously, to say ‘three industries’ with one of them being ‘industry,’"" said the co-director of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change John Reilly. The focus on industry, Reilly said, shifts attention away from the broader ways that energy consumption is woven into the fabric of American life.  ""This may lead to the implication that the cost of reducing these emissions will fall on industry,"" he said. ""To the extent that myth is perpetuated, that is a problem. One way or another, we will all bear the cost of doing things differently.""  The climate researchers we reached said Warren’s term was off the mark. Where they differed was on the significance. In contrast to Reilly, Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said he didn’t find it to be a major issue. As it turns out, Warren has used the 70% figure in a couple of ways that are more accurate, without saying ""industries."" Earlier during the town hall, Warren said she wanted to focus on ""the three areas where we get the most carbon pollution in America right now."" ""They're in our buildings and homes, right? What we're burning. It's our cars and light-duty trucks that we drive. And it's the generation of electricity where we're still using a lot of carbon-based fuel to make that happen.""  Eliminating the carbon footprint in all three by 2035 would, she said, ""cut 70% of the carbon that we are currently spewing into the air."" That’s a slightly different mix of sources, and based on the EPA numbers, they add up to the reduction Warren claimed. In her $1 trillion clean energy plan that Warren posted a day before the town hall, she was fully accurate.  ""Electricity, transportation, buildings, and related commercial activity are responsible for nearly 70% of all U.S. carbon emissions,"" she wrote. Warren said that three industries account for 70% of the carbon that goes into the air. That’s imprecise. It is accurate to say that transportation, producing electricity and industry writ large are the three largest sources of greenhouse gases and represent more than 70% of the problem. But those are activities, not industries. Individual Americans as well as companies contribute to the situation in ways that are often intertwined. Warren herself has been more accurate in her energy plan and even during the town hall itself. But she pushed the focus on industry on social media, and climate change researchers say that word doesn’t fit with the 70% figure she used.

No, actor Tim Allen didn’t write that viral anti-Democrat post on Facebook
","An extensive political tirade criticizing Democrats and liberals recently went viral on Facebook – and claims that actor and comedian Tim Allen wrote the whole thing.  The nearly 500-word post includes numerous observations attributed to the actor and has gotten almost 5,000 shares since being posted Sept. 1. The post features a photo of Allen with his alleged statement written as the caption. For the purposes of brevity, we will not post the entire passage attributed to Allen, but it begins:  ""Tim Allen is credited with writing this ... Here are some interesting points to think about prior to 2020, especially to my friends on the fence, like moderate Democrats, Libertarians and Independents and the never Trump Republicans and those thinking of ‘walking away’ from the Democratic party … Women are upset at Trump’s naughty words -- they also bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray … Not one feminist has defended Sarah Sanders. It seems women’s rights only matter if those women are liberal … No Border Walls. No voter ID laws. Did you figure it out yet?..""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because there’s no evidence the actor actually said this. Before we get to that, we want to note that we have fact-checked some of the claims made in the statement:  No, House Democrats did not vote to allow noncitizens to vote as part of HR 1 Will Trump's border wall cost less than Obamacare website? Complex tale involving Hillary Clinton, uranium and Russia resurfaces A meme about migrant cell phone use at the U.S. border takes an AP photo out of context No, the Green New Deal doesn't aim to end air travel, as Florida Sen. Rick Scott says Newt Gingrich misleading in saying Bill Clinton paid $850,000 'penalty'  But as to whether Tim Allen – a Republican who has been open about his conservative viewpoints in interviews – actually said or wrote this, a review of all the available evidence indicates the answer is no.  Not one media organization reported that Allen authored the post and the statement was not posted to any of Allen’s official social media accounts. Claims that Allen said this began surfacing in late August 2019, when other fact-checking organizations came across similar posts.  But it appears that days before social media posts began crediting Allen with the statement, a version of it was posted on the Facebook page of singer Ted Nugent, who is also known to be a vocal conservative. A day later, the message was shared by a Facebook user who is coincidentally named Tim Allen, but is not the actor. It is likely the actor was misattributed after another man with the same name shared it.  We rate this False.",/factchecks/2019/sep/06/facebook-posts/no-tim-allen-didnt-write-viral-anti-democrat-post-/
