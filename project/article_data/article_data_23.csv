","We may have all seen the ""Florida man"" make his way onto our social media platforms. And each account of his exploits are often more bizarre than the last.  But as amusing as these anecdotes are, they’re not always true.

Video of Pfizer CEO was deceptively edited to make false claim
","An alarming video provides supposed proof that Pfizer’s leaders are plotting a massive reduction in the world’s population — except that it doesn’t. The video, viewed tens of thousands of times, is nothing more than a deceptive edit of Pfizer’s announcement of a program that aims to help poor people afford medications. A headline on British-based video hosting service BitChute claims otherwise: ""Exposed! Pfizer CEO says it’s their dream to reduce the population by 50 percent in 2023.""  The video shows a portion of a May 25 conversation between Albert Bourla, the pharmaceutical giant’s CEO, and Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at the organization’s annual meeting in Davos. But the video clip leaves out the full context of the discussion, which was that Pfizer had just launched a new accord that would provide its current and future patent-protected medicines and vaccines at cost to the world’s 45 poorest countries, which is about 1.2 billion people, Bourla said. The video also edits out some of Bourla’s words to make it sound like he said something he did not. Here’s what the edited video shows Bourla saying: ""I think that it’s really the fulfillment of a dream that we’ve had, together with my leadership team when we started in 19 — the first week we met, in January of 19 in California —  and set up the goals for the next five years. And one of them was, by 2023, we will reduce the number of people in the world by 50%. I think today, this dream is becoming reality."" And here’s what Bourla actually said, with the edited-out words in bold: ""I think that it’s really the fulfillment of a dream that we’ve had, together with my leadership team when we started in 19 — the first week we met, in January of 19 in California — and set up the goals for the next five years, and one of them was, by 2023, we will reduce the number of people in the world that cannot afford our medicines by 50%.

A video claims that Pfizer’s CEO said the company’s goal was to cut the world population by 50% by 2023.

The Pants on Fire claim that ‘nobody in any election in America gets 74% of the votes’
","Nearly a week after Georgia’s primary — an election in which two of Donald Trump’s endorsed candidates failed to knock off Republican incumbents he’d targeted for defeat — the former president sent a blast email touting a blog post by conservative commentator Emerald Robinson. Robinson, who was taken off the air by the conservative channel Newsmax after sending controversial tweets and was also permanently suspended by Twitter, wrote a Substack post echoing Trump’s longstanding (and debunked) complaints about rigged elections. The post was titled, ""Something Stinks In Georgia: The GOP primary numbers are funny because the votes were rigged."" In her May 26 post, Robinson expressed disbelief that even though Trump’s national win-loss record in endorsements ""stands at 92-7,"" several of Trump’s top targets in Georgia — incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp and incumbent Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — beat Trump-backed primary challengers. Kemp defeated former Sen. David Perdue, 74% to 22%, while Raffensperger defeated Rep. Jody Hice, 52% to 33%. Robinson wrote that the RealClearPolitics.com average of pre-primary polls showed that Kemp was averaging 52% support, compared with 38% for Perdue. Yet ""on primary day in Georgia,"" she added, ""Kemp gets 74% and Perdue gets 22%. Nobody in any election in America gets 74% of the votes. Ever. It doesn’t happen. Obvious fraud."" No credible evidence has surfaced of widespread fraud. And it’s wrong to say that ""nobody in any election in America gets 74% of the votes."" For instance, more than four dozen U.S. House general elections in 2020 alone produced blowouts bigger than Kemp’s over Perdue. But the most illustrative way to debunk Robinson’s assertion is to look at the primary races in which Trump has made an endorsement this year. In five statewide races so far, a Trump-endorsed candidate has notched more than 74% of the vote in a primary: Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky (86.3%), Arkansas attorney general candidate Tim Griffin (85.7%), Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar (83.8%), Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Sarah Huckabee Sanders (83.4%), and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (78.7%). Another three Trump-backed statewide candidates ran unopposed, effectively winning 100% of the vote. Democrats have won races with at least 74% as well. In North Carolina, Senate candidate Cheri Beasley won her primary with 81%, while in Texas, Beto O’Rourke won his gubernatorial primary with 91%. In Ohio, Reps. Joyce Beatty and Marcy Kaptur were unopposed. In Pennsylvania, six incumbent Democratic members of Congress were unopposed, and one, Dwight Evans, won with 76% of the vote.  The list of Trump-endorsed U.S. House candidates with landslide primary victories is even longer. Trump counts among his endorsements 31 candidates who ran unopposed in the Republican primary. And he endorsed an additional 20 candidates who ended up winning more than 74% of the vote. Notably, several other Trump-backed candidates approached or exceeded 74% of the vote in the very same Georgia primary. Rep. Rick Allen won his primary unopposed, while fellow Georgia Reps. Buddy Carter and Andrew Clyde won with 82.2% and 76.6% of the vote, respectively. Two other Trump-backed candidates in Georgia won with margins almost as large as Kemp’s: Senate candidate Herschel Walker (68.7%) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (70.4%). In all, about one-third of Trump’s endorsees’ victories came from races in which the endorsee faced no opponent at all. Robinson wrote, ""Nobody in any election in America gets 74% of the votes. Ever. It doesn’t happen."" It happens all the time. It occurred in dozens of general elections for U.S. House seats in 2020. Even just looking at Trump’s endorsed candidates, at least 59 have won races with between 74% and 100% of the vote so far this year. On the same primary election day in Georgia, three Trump-endorsed candidates won with at least 74% of the vote. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!

Active shooter drills are common in American schools, not evidence of false flag attack
","Active shooter drills are pervasive in American schools. Although there is growing concern that active shooter drills increase students’ anxiety, school shootings like the one at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, often prompt calls for more active shooter drills.  Many states, including Texas, require schools to run active shooter drills. About 95% of American public schools conduct lockdown drills, according to U.S. Education Department data.  Despite this, some social media users claim that the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s active shooter trainings somehow prove that the elementary school shooting was a ""false flag"" attack. ""So let me get this straight,"" said a man in a TikTok video also posted to Instagram on May 26. ""They conducted an active shooter drill at the high school in the same town two months prior, and then magically, they had a shooting at the elementary school."" The video featured eerie background music and a New York Post article with the headline, ""Chilling images show students at Salvador Ramos’ HS pretending to be dead during active-shooter drill.""  Authorities have said that 18-year-old Ramos killed at least 19 students and two teachers at the elementary school on May 24. A law enforcement officer killed Ramos at the scene. Authorities are still investigating the shooting. The post containing the video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Taken in its totality, the video suggests that an active shooter drill at Uvalde High School in March is evidence that the elementary school shooting was a ""false flag"" attack. That’s a baseless claim. The term ""false flag"" refers to harmful actions that are designed to look as if they were perpetrated by one person or group, but were committed by someone else. Unfounded claims often circulate after mass shootings suggesting that the attacks were ""false flags"" devised by the government in an effort to enact gun control laws. In March, the school district’s police department said the goal of an active shooter training at the high school that month was ""to train every Uvalde area law enforcement officer so that we can prepare as best as possible for any situation that may arise."" The man in the TikTok video also said a police officer who was part of the training was married to one of the teachers killed. That is true, but not indicative of a ""false flag"" operation. Uvalde is home to about 15,000 people. ""Everyone knows everybody,"" Uvalde resident Tim Wiginton told Canada’s CBC on May 26. ""So whether you were directly impacted (by the school shooting) or you know someone who was there, whose kids were there, first responders who responded — everyone knows someone that was connected with it."" A video shared on Instagram claimed an active shooter drill at Uvalde High School two months before the Robb Elementary School shooting shows the event was a ""false flag."" This is not true. Active shooter trainings are common in schools across America. The fact that an active shooter training was held at Uvalde High School two months before the elementary school shooting does not mean that the death of 19 students and two teachers was a ""false flag"" attack.

This off-duty Border Patrol agent didn’t kill the Uvalde school shooter
","As questions mount over the police response to the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting, some Facebook users are singling out one brave father for taking extraordinary measures at Robb Elementary School — but they’re also botching his story. ""In case anyone missed it, the man that killed the school shooter in Texas wasn't even an on duty officer!!"" one viral Facebook post claimed. ""It was a parent and spouse of a 4th grade teacher, he just happened to be a border patrol agent."" The post includes photos and links to a recent Newsweek article about Jacob Albarado, an off-duty Border Patrol agent whose wife and daughter were in the school during the attack. At the end of the Facebook post, the author wrote: ""He then evacuated his wife and daughter and went back in and shot the suspect."" The post gets some details right, but multiple things wrong. According to a report by the New York Times, which the Newsweek article cites, Albarado rushed to the school with a borrowed shotgun and, working with other officers, helped evacuate children. But neither article said Albarado was the one who shot and killed Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old gunman. Law enforcement credited a tactical team for that, though they haven’t named the people involved.  Albarado appeared on ""Today"" on May 31 and confirmed that he wasn’t on duty and didn’t have any gear but said he helped evacuate children from outside. We reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Texas Department of Public Safety for comment but did not hear back.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The New York Times included an excerpt about Albarado’s actions in a May 26 story about Uvalde parents who were furious about law enforcement’s delayed response. The Justice Department is reviewing police actions that day. The story said that Albarado was about to get a haircut when he received a text from his wife, Trisha, a fourth-grade teacher at Robb Elementary, who told him there was an active shooter and asked for help.  Albarado sped to the school with the barber’s shotgun, the story said. Once he arrived, he learned that a tactical team was forming to go inside the wing with the gunman. ""So Mr. Albarado quickly made a plan with other officers at the scene: evacuate as many children as possible,"" the Times reported. ""Two officers provided cover, guns drawn, he said, and two others guided the children out on the sidewalk."" The story never said Albarado was the one who killed Ramos. On the contrary, it says that a tactical team shot and killed Ramos after breaching the classroom.  But that didn’t stop the social media version of events from taking off. In another version of the claim, Albarado was ""first in the line of fire"" and cleared every ""wing of the school"" before busting down the door to the room where Ramos was and killing him.  Albarado appeared on ""Today"" to talk about what happened at the school. He told anchor Savannah Guthrie that he didn’t have any gear and wasn’t on duty, so he didn’t go inside the school.  ""I met up with one of the officers there, trying to see what was going on, I tried to make my way toward the door. Like I said, I didn’t have any of my gear, I was off duty, so I didn’t go in,"" Albarado said in the May 31 interview. As he was helping kids evacuate outside the building, Albarado said his wife contacted him and told him she made it out and that his daughter was across the street at the funeral home.  Albarado said he went to make sure his daughter was safe and then continued to help. He said he didn’t know where Ramos was at the time or whether he was still in the building.  In a May 27 news conference, Texas Department of Public Safety director Steven McCraw described how Uvalde police officers, Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement assembled in the hallway of the school, eventually breaching the room where Ramos was located around 12:51 p.m.  ""They killed the suspect,"" McCraw said. Ramos was killed approximately one hour and 20 minutes after he first entered the school.  A Facebook post claims that off-duty Border Patrol agent Jacob Albarado shot and killed the Uvalde school shooter. This post misrepresents what Albarado and law enforcement have said transpired at the school. While Albarado is a Border Patrol agent who helped with the evacuation effort while off-duty, he said he did not go inside the school. And law enforcement has not indicated he was part of the tactical team that killed Ramos inside the school.

TV interviews with Uvalde victim's family fuel false claim
","Television interviews with two different men — each identified as the father of a mass shooting victim in Uvalde, Texas — have many on social media falsely claiming or insinuating that they are crisis actors and the shooting was staged. ""What’s the explanation for this? Same victim from Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tx. Anderson Cooper, CNN and Savannah Guthrie, NBC each interview the child’s father. Same victim, 2 different fathers??"" read a tweet posted on May 29 that links to an edited video showing clips from the CNN and NBC interviews. ""WHAT A SCAM! THEY ARE PLAYING US! TOTAL FED OP AND WE'RE FED UP!!!"" The explanation is far simpler than this claim suggests: One man is the child’s biological father and the other is her stepfather. Amerie Jo Garza, 10, was one of 19 students slain when a gunman attacked the school May 24. A picture of her that circulated after the shooting showed her proudly holding a certificate for making the school’s A/B honor roll, an award given during a ceremony that had been held earlier in the day. Amerie’s grandmother told The Daily Beast that her granddaughter was shot as she tried to call 911 after gunman Salvador Ramos entered the fourth-grade classroom. On May 25, CNN’s Anderson Cooper interviewed a man named Angel Garza about the girl’s death. Both Cooper and the chyron on screen during Cooper’s interview referred to Garza as Amerie’s father, a clip of which was included in the tweet. The next day, NBC aired an interview between journalist Savannah Guthrie and a man named Alfred Garza III, who was also identified in that segment as the girl’s father. Alfred Garza described waiting six hours after the shooting to learn whether his daughter was alive or not. An obituary clears up the confusion. It describes Amerie as a caring, sweet and sassy child who liked to swim and draw. It also lists Alfred Garza III as the child’s father and Angel Garza as her stepfather. A GoFundMe set up by a family friend refers to ""both of Amerie’s fathers, Angel and Alfred."" CNN did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment about the way Angel Garza was identified in the May 26 segment, but two separate CNN articles posted on May 27 and May 29 refer to both men, citing Alfred Garza as the girl’s father and Angel Garza as her stepfather. The edited video that appeared in the tweet made the rounds on social media, and could be found on YouTube, Twitter and Bitchute, as well as Facebook and Rumble accounts belonging to conservatice commentator Charlie Kirk. A ""false flag,"" which often follows mass shootings, is an event designed to make it look like it was done by one person or group but was actually done by another. There have been real ""false flags"" throughout history, but more often than not in recent years, baseless assertions have spread widely on social media after horrific events, such as the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 people, 20 of them children. Fueled by conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones, these hoaxes are premised on the idea that these attacks were staged or planned to prompt gun control legislation. In 2018, these unfounded claims earned PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year designation after the internet shared and reshared hoaxes suggesting a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was nothing but political theater. It was not. Seventeen people died. A tweet said that the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was staged and cited as evidence separate TV news interviews showing two different men being identified as the father of a child shot to death in her classroom. However, the explanation is much simpler: One man was the child’s biological father and the other was her stepfather. There is no evidence the shooting, which claimed 21 lives, was staged.

Bill Gates’ comments about preparing for pandemics doesn’t mean he planned monkeypox outbreak
","A Facebook post claims that Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates planned the monkeypox clusters in Europe and North America and that there is a coordinated effort to plan virus outbreaks.  Monkeypox is a virus related to smallpox. Monkeypox cases around the world are being investigated by public health authorities, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  A May 22 Facebook post shared a screenshot of what appeared  to be a prior post from Feb. 19. That February post included a photo of Gates and text that read: ""I actually think it will be a smallpox-type outbreak. He has mentioned it several times and look in the comments from the Google pic from yesterday.""  ""It’s hard to fathom why people in power would want to do evil things,"" text in the May 22 post read.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gates has talked about smallpox, but he has done so in the context of preparing for an outbreak, not planning one. In a conversation with former British health secretary Jeremy Hunt in November 2021, Gates talked about the level of funding and organization required to prepare for pandemics, and said that funding could go to things such as ""germ games,"" where public health authorities test different scenarios.  Shortly after Gates’ conversation with Hunt, social media users inaccurately linked Gates with vials labeled ""smallpox"" found in a Pennsylvania laboratory. The vials contained the virus that is used in the smallpox vaccine, vaccinia, not the virus that causes smallpox, variola. PolitiFact found no connection between Gates’ comments and the discovery of the vials.                                                        The ""Google pic"" the Facebook user mentions is likely the Google Doodle from Feb. 17, which is a drawing of Japanese virologist Dr. Michiaki Takahashi, who developed the first vaccine against chicken pox. Google described his work this way: ""Takahashi’s vaccine has since been administered to millions of children around the world as an effective measure to prevent severe cases of the contagious viral disease and its transmission."" Gates, a philanthropist who has used part of his fortune to promote public health, has long been a target of misinformation by people who object to vaccines. Gates financially supports and promotes vaccine development. There is no evidence to support the conspiracy theory that he has planned virus outbreaks. Gates and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have committed funding to prepare for pandemics, not to plan them. A Facebook post claimed that Gates planned a smallpox-type outbreak. That’s unfounded. Gates has spoken about preparing for future pandemics, not orchestrating them. Gates has long been the target of baseless conspiracy theories by people suspicious of his work to fund and promote vaccine development.  We rate this statement False.

Some Democrats did and some did not weigh in on Madison pro-life office arson
","When a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the headquarters of an anti-abortion group in Madison, and its building vandalized,  U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., at 11:46 a.m. on May 8, 2022, tweeted: ""This attack is abhorrent and should be condemned by all."" The incident, which occurred in the wake of a leaked draft opinion that suggested the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, was at the offices of Wisconsin Family Action. Police said the Molotov cocktail didn’t explode, but a fire broke out and this message was spray-painted on the building: ""If abortions aren't safe then you aren't either.""   Many politicians — including prominent state Democrats — quickly condemned the attack. Yet, three days later, in a May 11, 2022, news release, Johnson had this to say: ""Unfortunately, members of the radical left have firebombed a pro-life office in Wisconsin and are threatening the safety of Supreme Court Justices and their families in an effort to intimidate them to impact their vote. Democrats have yet to condemn activists who are engaging in this repugnant illegal activity."" We were interested in the claim included at the end: Is it true that, at the time the statement was issued, Democrats had not spoken out against the violence? Johnson lists a bunch of Democrats who had not. But he ignores those who did. When asked to back up the claim, Johnson’s office sent a list of a host of Democrats — some from Wisconsin, many national figures — whom they said had not condemned the May 8 incident, including:   The Democratic National Committee, Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, and Mark Pocan, Ron Kind and Gwen Moore, all of Wisconsin. But that measure sets up a standard that goes against what Johnson actually said. It suggests Johnson would be correct if there are any prominent Democrats who had not issued statements, ignoring the ones who did.  And there are many — especially among party leaders in Wisconsin — who did speak out against the incident. For instance, Gov. Tony Evers, in a 12:13 p.m. May 8, 2022, statement on Twitter, said: ""We reject violence against any person for disagreeing with another’s view. Violence is not the way forward. Hurting others is never the answer. We will work against overturning Roe and attacks on reproductive rights by leading with empathy and compassion."" The following day, May 9, 2022, according to The Associated Press, Evers was asked about the incident while at a groundbreaking event in a Madison suburb.  ""It was a horrible, horrible incident,"" Evers said, and remarked that the responsible party ""should be arrested and put on trial. This is unacceptable."" On May 8, the day of the attack, at 1:34 p.m., Attorney General Josh Kaul, tweeted: ""This is disgraceful and unacceptable. This incident must be fully investigated and whoever is responsible should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""  In a Cap Times article posted that day, Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said, ""I understand that people are afraid and angry, but violence is not an acceptable response. Madison believes strongly in the right to free speech, but it must be exercised nonviolently by all sides in this increasingly contentious debate."" In an ABC News report that day, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tom Nelson, now Outagamie County executive, said: ""I am committed to protecting women’s rights — but we must do it the right way. Violence and destruction are not the answer. I’m glad no one was hurt."" The following day, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., tweeted: ""I fully reject this act of violence and vandalism, and I support the investigation by law enforcement to hold those responsible for these crimes accountable.""  We could go on, but we are focusing on reactions from Wisconsin officials, who would be most expected to react to an incident that happened here. To be sure, not every prominent Democrat in the state spoke out. And we could not find statements, via news releases, on individual websites or Twitter,  from the three Wisconsin House Democrats cited by Johnson — Moore, Kind and Pocan, who represents Madison.  But there is also some hair-splitting going on by Johnson. In an email, Johnson’s spokesperson, Alexa Henning, noted that in a May 13, 2022, letter sent to various high-level Biden administration officials, Johnson noted that ""To date, President Biden has made no public remarks, and neither DOJ, FBI, nor DHS have issued a statement condemning this attack."" But according to The Hill, there was this statement from a White House official released the day after the attack: ""President Biden strongly condemns this attack and political violence of any stripe. The President has made clear throughout his time in public life that Americans have the fundamental right to express themselves under the Constitution, whatever their point of view.""  Johnson claimed that in the immediate wake of a fire and vandalism at the Madison headquarters of an anti-abortion group, Democrats had not condemned ""activists who are engaging in this repugnant illegal activity."" But at the time of the claim, Evers, Kaul and Baldwin, plus the Madison mayor and others had already done so. In addition, the White House issued a statement saying Biden condemned the incident.  To be sure, we could not find statements from several key elected Democrats in Wisconsin, including the congressman who represents Madison. And, clearly, not every Democratic leader in the nation had issued such a statement. But that wasn’t the nature of Johnson’s claim. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097559F80>],/factchecks/2022/may/31/ron-johnson/some-democrats-did-and-some-did-not-weigh-madison-/

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa: ""In 2013, I introduced legislation called Grassley-Cruz which targeted felons and fugitives and those with serious mental illness. It directed the Department of Justice to do an audit of federal convictions to make sure felons are in the database. It directed the Department of Justice to prosecute and put in jail felons and fugitives who try to illegally buy firearms.  ""In the Harry Reid Democrat(ic) Senate, a majority of the Senate voted in favor of Grassley-Cruz, but the Democrats filibustered it. They demanded 60 votes. They defeated it, because they wanted to go after law-abiding citizens instead of stopping the bad guys."" I’m going to keep fighting to target felons and fugitives who try to buy firearms.We need to stop bad guys from getting guns, not law-abiding citizens. pic.twitter.com/q7zFfC0Hwp Was that accurate?  A review of the legislative wrangling from 2013 shows that Cruz accurately explained the voting on the Grassley-Cruz amendment. However, Cruz is wrong to suggest that only Democrats were to blame for the amendment’s failure. Cruz’s statement leaves out his own party’s use of the very same tool — the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster — to block other measures that were able to secure majority support in the chamber. In seeking to enact legislation after Sandy Hook, the then-majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., established a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Reid’s technique — allowing a fixed number of amendments for both sides, each requiring a 60-vote majority for passage — has become common in the Senate in recent years, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and author of ""The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate."" It usually happens like this: The minority party makes clear they’re going to filibuster an underlying bill, as Republicans did with the gun legislation backed by the Democratic leadership in 2013. To counter this filibuster threat, the majority leader uses a procedural maneuver to block the minority from offering any amendments.  This inevitably produces a stalemate. The usual way of resolving this stalemate is for each side to agree to vote on a limited number of amendments, each with a stiff 60-vote threshold. ""Sounds crazy, right?"" Smith said. ""It is, but it gives senators on both sides an opportunity to offer alternatives and put senators on the record."" The parameters for debate and voting are set in motion by the majority leader’s ""unanimous consent"" request. If any senator objects to the majority leader’s request, the voting plan doesn’t go forward. But as long as no one objects, the votes on amendments can proceed, with the supermajority threshold. An important point Cruz leaves out is that every Republican accepted Reid’s ground rules. The Senate’s makeup at the time was 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans. Ultimately, when the voting was held on April 17, 2013, nine amendments received a vote. A few that were relatively uncontroversial passed with a 60-vote supermajority, while a few fell short of even a simple 50-vote majority. The Cruz-Grassley amendment attracted majority support, but not 60 votes. It received a vote of 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it (Max Baucus and Jon Tester of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Mark Pryor or Arkansas) and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah). The same day, the Senate voted on an amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have toughened background checks for purchasing guns.  The Manchin-Toomey amendment, which was backed by the Democratic leadership, also received a majority vote (54-46) but it, too, fell short of the 60 votes required for passage. It attracted two more votes than Grassley-Cruz did. Four Republicans joined most Democrats in supporting Manchin-Toomey — Susan Collins of Maine, Kirk, John McCain of Arizona, and Toomey. Five Democrats joined Republicans in opposition: Baucus, Begich, Heitkamp, Pryor, and Reid. (Reid’s vote against it was not due to the substance of the measure but rather as a procedural tactic that would allow him to call the amendment up at a later date.) Meanwhile, two other amendments secured majority support but fell short of 60 votes. One focused on firearm trafficking and was sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. It resulted in a 58-42 vote. Another amendment that addressed veterans’ gun rights was sponsored by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. It produced a 56-44 vote. Steve Guest, a special advisor for communications with Cruz, said the senator’s statement was ""absolutely correct.""  Guest said it is ""disingenuous to say that somehow the blame is on both sides of the aisle for filibustering Grassley-Cruz. The fact of the matter is Grassley-Cruz would have passed had over 80% of the Democrats in the Senate not blocked it via the filibuster."" This recording of history is incomplete, however. Reid set the 60-vote threshold in response to Republican threats to filibuster the Democratic measure, meaning that both sides were playing the same game. And to get out of the standoff, Republicans unanimously agreed to the 60-vote threshold Reid established for all amendments.  This endgame has been common since the 1990s, Smith said, creating a system where senators on either side can avoid accountability by taking votes that have no chance of passage but serve the party’s campaign messaging. ""Senators can make all kinds of claims that are half-truths, and the public cannot possibly make sense of it,"" Smith said. Cruz said that in 2013, under a Democratic Senate, ""a majority of the Senate voted in favor of"" the Grassley-Cruz amendment to tighten background checks, ""but the Democrats filibustered it."" This retelling is accurate up to a point, but it leaves out half the story.  Reid set a 60-vote threshold for all amendments because the Republicans’ made their own filibuster threats against what the Democrats wanted to pass. To get out of the standoff, Republicans unanimously agreed to the 60-vote threshold for all amendments.  The Cruz-Grassley amendment attracted majority support, but not 60 votes. The same was true of the Democratic-backed Manchin-Toomey amendment. We rate the statement Half True.

No, Ted Cruz doesn’t tweet the same ‘thoughts and prayers’ message after each mass shooting
","Offers of ""thoughts and prayers"" by U.S. elected officials after mass shootings are often received with criticism — with people claiming the messages are empty and void of any actionable response. After the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting on May 24, some social media users accused Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, of having a response template ready to go whenever a shooting occurs. At least 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde by a man named Salvador Ramos, authorities said. ""These mass shootings happen so much that Ted Cruz really got a template ready to tweet whenever they occur,"" a May 26 tweet said. The tweet shows a wall of screenshots supposedly from Cruz’s Twitter account, with the most recent being about the Uvalde school shooting. Each tweet is almost exactly the same, with the exception of the location of the shooting, making it look as if  Cruz uses the same apologetic message for each tragedy.    This claim is bogus. The tweet Cruz wrote on May 24 about the Uvalde shooting is real, but the rest of the images of the other tweets are fake.  Heidi & I are fervently lifting up in prayer the children and families in the horrific shooting in Uvalde.We are in close contact with local officials, but the precise details are still unfolding.Thank you to heroic law enforcement & first responders for acting so swiftly. A review of Cruz’s Twitter account shows that he has posted different messages following mass shootings. Many do follow similar patterns, with him and his wife offering prayers to the victims and their families, but the posts aren’t copied and pasted like the claim suggests. Examples of some of his tweets:  On May 16, after a gunman killed 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo, NY, Cruz wrote: ""Heidi & I are praying for the families of the victims of the horrific shooting in Buffalo, NY. The killer must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and brought to justice. The racism & antisemitism that purportedly motivated this killer have no place in America … I’m thankful there are heroes like security guard Aaron Salter, Jr.,  retired police officer, who fought back, and lost his life defending those around him."" On Aug. 3, 2019, after a shooter killed 23 people in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, Cruz wrote: ""My heart is with everyone in El Paso struck by this unspeakable evil. Heidi & I are praying for the victims & their families & are grateful for the first responders, local authorities & law enforcement working tirelessly to bring the perpetrator of this depraved act to justice."" On June 18, 2015, after a gunman killed nine people at a historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, Cruz wrote: ​​""My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of last night's shooting in Charleston.""   We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809757CF80>],/factchecks/2022/may/27/tweets/no-ted-cruz-doesnt-tweet-same-thoughts-and-prayers/

Fact-checking Marco Rubio claim that no guns used in mass shootings were bought online
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said stringent gun regulations would not prevent crimes like the May 24 shooting in Uvalde, Texas.  ""There hasn't been a single of these mass shootings that have been purchased at a gun show or on the internet,"" Rubio said on May 25. ""If people want to do it, we can have that debate, but don’t link it to these horrible events. They have nothing to do with it."" Rubio told reporters he wouldn’t support expanding background checks for commercial sales, like gun shows, saying that the issue is unrelated to mass shootings.  We wondered whether Rubio’s characterization of where firearms from high-profile shootings were obtained was accurate. Research shows that it’s not.  Rubio did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  A 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defined a ""mass public shooting"" as a multiple-homicide incident where four or more victims are murdered with firearms. By that standard, there have been 66 mass public shootings from 1999 to 2013. A more recent analysis from advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety listed 274 mass shootings since 2009.  Contradicting Rubio’s claim, PolitiFact found several instances where a perpetrator of a high-profile shooting obtained their weapons at a gun show or on the internet. In 1999, for example, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold — the individuals behind the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado — acquired their firearms at a gun show with the help of an 18-year-old classmate.  At least one of the handguns Seung-Hui Cho used to kill 33  at Virginia Tech in 2007 was purchased online, according to the Virginian-Pilot.

Jody Lee Hunt, a convicted felon, bought a firearm through a private seller on Facebook. In 2014, Hunt used the gun to kill his former girlfriend, a business owner, and two others in West Virginia.  Federal law requires licensed firearm dealers to perform background checks on prospective buyers. However, federal law does not impose that requirement on unlicensed sellers, who generally sell guns online or at gun shows.  It’s worth noting that some licensed firearm dealers do sell online or at gun shows, and they perform background checks on their sales. It’s the seller’s licensing status that determines whether there’s a background check or not. Rubio’s broader point was that expanding the background check requirement to include unlicensed sellers would not prevent a mass shooting, contending that such sales aren’t correlated with such crimes. Experts, however, disagreed with that argument.  John Donohue, a Stanford University law professor who brings a strong data approach to gun crimes, said focusing just on mass shootings misses the larger picture of the crimes where these weapons show up.  ""Everyday murderers and criminals frequently procure their guns without going through background checks,"" Donohue told PolitiFact. ""Because the 18-year-old mass killer in Uvalde purchased his weapon directly from a licensed dealer is not a reason to oppose closing a dangerous loophole in American law."" Rubio said, ""There hasn't been a single of these mass shootings that have been purchased at a gun show or on the internet."" PolitiFact found several instances where the firearms used in a mass shooting were purchased online or at a gun show. A high-profile example includes the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School.

"['National', 'Guns', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump says he's done more than other presidents to solve the gun problem. Has he?
","As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump accepted the endorsement of the National Rifle Association and released a Facebook video headlined by the remark, ""I won’t let them take away our guns!!"" Now, as president, he wants to be seen as a problem-solver on gun policy. At a media availability on Aug. 4 following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, a reporter asked President Donald Trump, ""The gun problem – what are you going to do about it? How are you going to address it?"" Trump responded, ""We’re talking to a lot of people, and a lot of things are in the works, and a lot of good things. And we have done much more than most administrations. And it’s ... really not talked about very much, but we’ve done, actually, a lot. But perhaps more has to be done."" We wondered whether it’s accurate that Trump and his administration have ""done much more than most administrations"" to curb gun violence. We found that Trump has made two concrete moves that tightened gun policy and has taken additional actions on other aspects of curbing mass shootings. This is more than some of his predecessors have done. However, this tells only part of the story, because Trump and his administration have simultaneously advanced more policies that would expand gun rights or prevent efforts to limit gun rights. Trump has clearly acted to limit gun rights in two cases. • Using regulatory powers to bypass Congress, Trump in 2018 acted to ban bump stocks, an accessory that uses recoil to effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic one. This technique was used by the shooter who killed 58 people and injured almost 900 attending a music festival in Las Vegas in 2017. • Trump signed a large federal spending bill that included language to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. The legislation had received bipartisan support in Congress. In addition, under Trump, the federal government has increased prosecutions of firearms offenses. (See our fact-check.) The Trump campaign said he deserves credit for actions beyond the scope of guns specifically. They cited his signing of the STOP School Violence Act, which authorizes more than $1 billion in grant funding through 2028 to support violence-prevention programs in schools. The campaign also pointed to Trump’s establishment of the Federal Commission on School Safety. (The commission released a final report in December 2018.) Still, the Trump administration’s gun-specific efforts have tended to focus on expanding gun rights or opposing tighter limits on them. Some examples: • He signed legislation to overturn a rule enacted under President Barack Obama that made it harder for some mentally ill people to obtain guns. (Advocates for disabled Americans and civil-liberties groups joined with gun advocates in supporting Trump’s action.) • Trump in 2019 threatened to veto bills passed by the House to require federal background checks for all gun sales. (A veto has not been necessary since the measures remain stalled in the Senate.) • Trump’s Interior Department reversed a ban on hunting with lead ammunition in national parks and other federal lands. • Trump’s Interior Department formally proposed a rule to expand hunting on federal lands. • Trump’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives delayed an Obama-era rule to make gun-safety devices more readily available where firearms are sold. • Trump’s Justice Department formally sided with plaintiffs seeking to overturn New York City restrictions on transporting handguns at the Supreme Court. So, for Trump to focus solely on his efforts to limit gun rights ignores the more numerous examples in which he has sought to expand gun rights or prevent restrictions of gun rights. ""The Trump administration has been mostly missing in action on enhanced gun control,"" said Harold (Jay) Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida. The universe of comparable presidents is actually pretty small. In the past 50 years, only two presidents — Bill Clinton and Obama, both Democrats — made tightening gun policies a significant item on their policy agendas.  In 1993, Clinton signed the Brady Bill, which heightened requirements for background checks, and the following year, he signed the assault weapons ban, which sunsetted after 10 years in 2004.  Obama, for his part, pursued gun control policies, especially after the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. But facing a Republican-controlled Congress opposed to gun control, such efforts went nowhere. Instead, between 2013 and 2016, Obama undertook executive actions on mental health treatment, strengthened background checks, restarting federal gun research that had been frozen for years, funding additional federal agents, tracing guns found during investigations to determine trafficking patterns, and guiding U.S. attorneys to go after felons looking to buy guns or people lying in order to pass background checks. ""Trump has not had a pro-control record, although most previous presidents have not done much more"" than he has, said Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck. However, experts caution against a direct comparison between Obama’s record and Trump’s. ""During Obama's administration, there were at least four bills to close the ‘gun show loophole,’ two attempts to renew the assault weapons ban, two attempts to ban high-capacity magazines, two to ban ‘build them yourself’ assault rifle kits, and one to ban imported assault weapons,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. ""Every single one of these 11 bills died on the floor of either the House or Senate, so it was never an option for Obama to sign them into law."" Given that Republicans — the more consistently pro-gun party — have controlled either the presidency or at least one chamber of Congress for most of the past quarter-century, ""it’s not really surprising that more restrictions have not been passed at the federal level,"" Schildkraut said. Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" Trump said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot."" Trump has banned bump stocks, supported a bipartisan effort to improve the background-check database, and prioritized gun-related prosecutions. This number does compare favorably to what some other recent presidents have accomplished. At the same time, Trump’s comment ignores that his administration has pursued multiple efforts to expand gun laws and regulations or to block efforts to tighten them.  We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966CE300>],/factchecks/2019/aug/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hes-done-more-other-presidents-s/

No, President Trump wasn’t ‘kicked off’ the California ballot. That’s Pants on Fire.
","The California Republican Party made a misleading and blatantly inaccurate claim this week that President Donald Trump was ""kicked off the California ballot"" during a fundraising pitch on its website. It asks supporters to donate to get Trump ""back on the ballot.""  The message goes on to claim ""Governor Newsom signed SB27, preventing President Trump from appearing on next year’s ballot. The law is clearly unconstitutional and disenfranchises millions of California voters. We need your support to overturn SB27."" We set out on a fact check.  Our research  Gov. Gavin Newsom did sign Senate Bill 27 into law last week. But it doesn’t prevent Trump or anyone else from appearing on the California ballot, nor does it mean he’s ""kicked off.""  Instead, it requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to run in the state’s primary. The requirement does not extend to the general election. Here’s what the law says:  ""This bill would enact the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act, which would require a candidate for President, in order to have the candidate’s name placed upon a primary election ballot, to file the candidate’s income tax returns for the 5 most recent taxable years with the Secretary of State, as specified."" Trump has refused to release his returns, saying since his campaign for president they are under audit.  Trump, the Republican National Committee and California Republican Party have all filed lawsuits over SB 27, arguing it is unconstitutional and ""a naked political attack"" on Trump. The law passed on a party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Some legal analysts have questioned it, as did former Gov. Jerry Brown when he vetoed a similar law two years ago, saying it would create a slippery slope of trying to force candidates to release additional information to run for president.  The courts will eventually decide on its constitutionality. But as it stands, it does not prevent Trump from appearing on the ballot.  Asked about the accuracy of the claim, a spokesperson for the California Republican Party pointed to a news release on the party’s website about the lawsuits. The release criticizes the law and contends Democrats are using it ""to keep Republicans home"" during the next election.  But it doesn’t provide any information showing Trump was kicked off the ballot or prevented from being on it. California is still several months from finalizing its ballot for the March 2020 primary.  After we asked about the claim, the headline on the party’s website changed slightly from President Trump ""kicked off"" the ballot to President Trump ""off"" the ballot.  Another line changed from asking donors to contribute to get Trump ""back on the ballot"" to get him ""on the ballot."" Our ruling The California Republican Party recently claimed President Trump was ""kicked off the California ballot"" as a result of Senate Bill 27.  The recently signed law requires candidates for president and governor to release five years of tax returns to run in the state’s primary. It does not apply to candidates in the general election. Republicans are challenging the law in court, saying it’s unconstitutional.  The law very well may be struck down by a court. But, as written, it does not kick Trump off the ballot or prevent him from being on it. That ballot is still several months from being finalized.  It might be a difficult decision for Trump to release his tax returns, which he has refused to do, but it still provides this avenue for him and all future candidates for president and governor to appear on the primary ballot.  The message on the state party’s website is blatantly false, ignores any mention of what’s actually in the law and how candidates can comply.

Bernie Sanders says private citizens have up to 10 million assault weapons, more than US military
","The United States doesn’t require gun registration. So, when U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., claims private citizens have more assault weapons than members of the military do, how does he know? ""There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military,"" the 2020 presidential candidate said in the wake of the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. ""We're talking about 5 (million) to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens."" Sanders’ claim suffers a bit from comparing private and military weapons, which are different. Plus, he has to rely on wildly varying estimates, although his seems on the lower end.  We’ll sort out the facts for you.  In both shootings, assault-style weapons, legal in both states, were used. Each weapon was semiautomatic — the gunmen could fire as quickly as they could pull the trigger — and carrying enough ammunition to potentially kill dozens of people in minutes.  The New York Times reported that the El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47-style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds; and that the Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds.  We’ll note that ""assault weapon"" does not have a universal definition. For example, a bill called the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018 defined an assault weapon differently than the federal law that banned assault weapons from 1994 to 2004, before expiring.  ""None of the so-called ‘assault rifles’ legally owned by U.S. civilians are assault rifles as the term is used in military contexts,"" said Florida State University criminal justice professor emeritus Gary Kleck, who has done research on large-capacity firearms used by mass shooters. ""Assault rifles used by members of the military can all fire full automatic, like machine guns, as well as one shot at a time, whereas none of the so-called ‘assault rifles’ legally owned by U.S. civilians can fire full automatic."" But Kleck agreed that semiautomatic weapons evolved from earlier military weapons, many look like military weapons, and they can kill people rapidly. Sanders campaign policy director Josh Orton acknowledged to us that the precise number of a particular type of weapon in civilian hands is not known, given there is no national gun registration. In fact, federal law prohibits there being a national registry. But Orton argued that Sanders’ figure of 5-10 million of semiautomatic rifles, such as the AR-15, is a conservative estimate. He cited a 2016 CNBC news article that quoted the National Rifle Association as saying there were 5 million AR-15s in circulation; he also cited other data suggesting the figure could be much higher.  Harvard University gun researcher Deborah Azrael told us that her latest survey of gun owners showed there were about 90 million rifles in private hands in the United States in 2015. The survey did not ask about about AR-15s, but 5-10 million is plausible, said she and her colleague on the survey, Matthew Miller of Northeastern University. As recently as June 2019, the NRA called a reported figure of more than 11 million AR-15s ""an arguably lowball figure.""  Gun researchers including Kleck, Miller and Philip Cook of Duke University, cautioned us on relying on estimates made by the NRA or the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s trade association. Those figures could be inflated with the aim of making assault-style weapons appear common.  ""The fact is, we just don’t know"" the actual number, Miller said. Aaron Karp, a senior consultant to the Small Arms Survey and a political science lecturer at Old Dominion University in Virginia, told us he believes Sanders’ estimate for private citizens is ""very conservative.""  Karp estimates there are 15 million to 20 million assault-style weapons in the hands of Americans. Gun researchers we consulted told us they are not aware of any counts of assault-style weapons held by members of the military. Sanders’ campaign pointed us to an estimate of 4.5 million from the Small Arms Survey, an independent research project based in Geneva, Switzerland. That is for all U.S. military-owned firearms, not assault-style weapons. But it would be exceeded by the estimated 5 million or more assault-style weapons in private hands. Sanders said: ""There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military. We're talking about 5 (million) to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens."" There are no official counts of assault-style weapons, either in private hands or in the U.S. military. But estimates that the civilian figure could be 5 million or more appear to be conservative and would exceed the estimated number of all weapons in the military. At the same time, those are semiautomatic weapons, not fully automatic like those used in the military.

Ad misleads about Dan McCready backing bill costing consumers $149 million
","Democratic congressional candidate Dan McCready has made a name for himself as a clean-energy businessman in North Carolina. However, Club for Growth Action, a conservative-leaning PAC, has come after him for his energy business in a new attack ad. ""A tax-exempt special interest outfit McCready helped run pumped $450,000 into lobbying for costly state energy regulations that benefited McCready’s own business. Then, McCready handed you the bill. The cost to consumers here? $149 million a year in higher energy costs,"" the ad said. McCready’s spokesman, Matthew Fried, said the ad’s claim that solar energy has raised rates is ""demonstrably false."" When asked where it got the information for the ad, Club for Growth referenced an article from the Washington Examiner that echoed the claims made in the ad. We check claims that are widely shared or published; are about a topic of concern to many of our readers; can be proven or disproven through facts; and could cause people to act or vote in a certain way. This topic met all the criteria. The race for the 9th Congressional District is going to be a close one. The Charlotte Observer reported last week that multiple GOP groups spent $4 million in ad buys against McCready. This means that this Club for Growth ad is one of many that will be popping up ahead of the Sept. 10 special election.  Additionally, electricity is an important expense for many households. The Club for Growth ad aims to convince voters that McCready lobbied in order to grow his renewable business at their expense. Before McCready ran for Congress, he was the co-founder of Double Time Capital, an investment firm launched in 2013 that focuses on solar farms in North Carolina. Because of his involvement in sustainable energy, McCready was named a member of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association’s 2015-2016 board of directors, meaning he served on the board from January 2015 to December 2017. The $450,000 figure could mislead voters, since it includes lobbying money spent before McCready joined the NCSEA board. But we decided to investigate specifically the most hard-hitting part of the ad, that he backed legislation that cost consumers money. The ""costly state energy regulations"" the ad refers to is North Carolina’s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard, established in 2007, eight years before McCready was elected to the NCSEA board. It requires all investor-owned utilities in North Carolina to get 12.5% of their retail electricity sales from eligible renewable energy resources by 2021. In 2015, a bill in the state House, House Bill 760, would have revised the standard to only require utilities to get 6% of their electricity from renewable energy resources. This legislation passed the House but died in committee in the Senate. A 2015 report from the North Carolina secretary of state’s office shows NCSEA spent $288,842.97 on lobbying that year. We couldn’t find research showing what would have happened to costs if HB 760 had become law. But there are estimates about the cost of these standards more generally. The Washington Examiner article quotes a study by Utah State University and Strata Policy. A 2017 update of the study estimates RPS costs residential electricity consumers $149 million, or $34 per person and a 2.3% increase in cost to residential consumers. The credibility of this study has been contested by left-leaning groups. David Pomerantz, executive director of the liberal-leaning Energy and Policy Institute, said the study may have been tied to the oil industry because of funding the university received from an oil mogul. The head researcher, Randy Simmons, served as the Charles G. Koch Professor of Political Economy at Utah State from 2008 to 2013. He said this is just one element of a ""fatally flawed"" study. ""The lynchpin of the study’s ‘economic analysis’ is that it looked at how states that passed RPS laws fared economically before they passed compared to how they fared after they passed. That method conveniently (if you want a skewed outcome) takes advantage of the fact that many states passed their RPS right around the time of the onset of the 2008 recession,"" Pomerantz said in an email interview with the News & Observer. We looked into this issue and found that there are many different studies on the effects of RPS, and their estimates of the program’s overall cost range from slight savings to cost increases. Lori Bennear, a professor of energy economics and policy at Duke University said this is because of ""methodological challenges in isolating the impact of RPS’s on electricity costs."" The National Renewable Energy Laboratory did a comprehensive study that found RPS could cause energy cost savings of up to 0.7% or a cost increase of up to 0.8%. Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and an expert on the regulation of housing, land, energy, the environment, transportation, and labor, pointed to a study from the University of Chicago which estimated cost increases of 11-17% of retail rates. The study estimated that RPS can cost from $115 to $530 per metric ton of reduced carbon dioxide emissions, a much higher cost than has been estimated elsewhere. Of course, the renewable standards have benefits, too, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But the University of Chicago study cited estimates by the Obama administration that damages caused by climate change have a ""social cost"" of about $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions, much less than the study's calculation of the cost of RPS. A range of studies estimate that renewable standards do increase electricity rates. How much rates increase is estimated from less than 1% to 17% of retail rates. However, the Club for Growth ad misses the benefits of renewable energy, Bennear said. The Club for Growth ad says McCready backed regulations that would cost consumers $149 million a year in their electric bills. While it is true that the clean-energy group pushed to keep a renewable portfolio standard in North Carolina, the standard had already been established for close to a decade at the time McCready joined the group’s board. It is misleading to say that NCSEA lobbied for ""costly state regulations"" when RPS had already been in the law for years before the House put forward legislation that would have watered it down. The ad gives an exact figure for the costs of the standard, but experts told us that estimates on the effects of RPS vary widely, ranging from savings to costs. What’s more, the ad fails to mention that renewable energy decreases toxic and costly carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, we rate this statement Mostly False. Correction: A previous version of this story had incorrect figures for the estimated cost of carbon dioxide emissions and a University of Chicago study's estimate of the cost of renewable standards per metric ton of reduced carbon emissions. This does not change our ruling. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Ivanka Trump conflates Chicago gun violence statistics
","Over the weekend, mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio left 31 dead and dozens more wounded. Additionally, the city of Chicago experienced yet another bloody summer weekend of gun violence. As President Donald Trump came under intense criticism for his divisive rhetoric in the wake of the mass shootings, his daughter Ivanka took to Twitter to express concern about unrelated shootings in Chicago.  ""As we grieve over the evil mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, let us not overlook that Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year,"" she tweeted. ""With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground in the Windy City—and little national outrage or media coverage—we mustn’t become numb to the violence faced by inner city communities every day."" With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground in the Windy City- and little national outrage or media coverage- we mustn’t become numb to the violence faced by inner city communities every day. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, both Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson swiftly condemned the first daughter’s statements as ""wrong"" and ""misleading."" But what part of these tweets was incorrect, and how did Trump get the story mixed up? We took a closer look to find out.  As Lightfoot and Johnson pointed out at Tuesday’s press conference, the tweets imply that the victims all came from a single shooting incident. In reality, those numbers represent citywide statistics for gun casualties that occurred between Friday, August 2 and Sunday, August 4.  ""She said seven killed and 52 shot near a playground. That’s not what happened,"" Johnson said. ""She’s conflating the whole weekend activity into one incident."" One shooting that left seven injured did occur near a playground in Douglas Park during the early morning hours on Sunday, as the Sun-Times pointed out. But the rest of the victims sustained gunshot wounds from many other isolated shooting incidents around the city.   According to CPD Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, Trump was also wrong in saying that last weekend was the deadliest weekend of 2019 for Chicago, although it was the most violent weekend in terms of total shooting victims. Data collected by the Sun-Times shows that gun violence left nine dead after a weekend in mid-July and eight dead in early June.  While news of the violence here in Chicago certainly took a backseat to the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton nationally, Trump mischaracterized the situation by saying there was ""little national outrage or media coverage."" The outbreak of gun violence was front-page news in the Chicago Tribune and the Sun-Times, and it even found its way into Monday’s issue of The New York Times.  After angrily lamenting Trump’s dissemination of misleading information—the original post got over 35,000 likes and 8,000 retweets on Twitter—Lightfoot took the occasion as an opportunity to explain what a healthy partnership between Chicago and the federal government might look like.  ""That’s the danger of trying to govern via Tweet,"" the mayor said. ""If they want to help, they should actually call us and ask for specifics, which we’d be happy to share, and we would offer them specific ways in which the federal government can actually partner with us to help address the issue of violent crime.""  While Trump failed to issue a formal retraction or correction, the White House did release a statement regarding the situation following Lightfoot’s comments.  ""Ivanka has appreciated getting to know Mayor Lightfoot, respects her commitment to addressing this issue and looks forward to continuing the conversation around this issue, workforce development and economic opportunity for all,"" the White House said. ""To the extent that her quote was misleading in implying that all of the shooting incidents occurred in one location, it remains important to note that there were 7 deaths and 52 wounded across the city, resulting in one of the deadliest weekends in the city this year."" Still, the mayor emphasized the importance of communication in getting the facts right the first time, especially when those facts involve sensitive issues like gun violence.  ""It’s important when we’re talking about people’s lives to actually get the facts correct, which one could easily do if you actually cared about getting it right,"" she said.  Ivanka Trump tweeted ""that Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year...With 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground."" Only seven of the wounded were shot in an incident that occurred near a playground in Douglas Park. Last weekend also was not the deadliest weekend of the year in Chicago, according to data from CPD.  As a result, Trump severely misstated the gun violence situation in Chicago during the first weekend of August. We rate her claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE — The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2DC500>],/factchecks/2019/aug/07/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-conflates-chicago-gun-violence-statis/

Is Walmart ‘one of the largest sellers of assault-style weapons,’ as MSNBC anchor said?
","On the heels of a pair of mass shootings, MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle asked a gun control activist how big businesses could contribute to curbing gun violence. Ruhle homed in on Walmart, one of the nation’s largest retailers and the site of the attack in El Paso, Texas, which left at least 22 people dead and dozens more wounded. ""Walmart is America,"" Ruhle said in the Aug. 5 interview. ""Walmart is the largest employer in the United States, one of the largest sellers of assault-style weapons.""  It’s true that Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States, but the retailer does not sell assault-style weapons. In fact, the company banned the sale of assault-style rifles in its stores in 2015. Ruhle’s use of the term ""assault-style weapons"" could lead to some confusion, since there’s no universal definition for it. Generally, people on both sides of the gun debate agree that fully automatic weapons, which are heavily regulated, should be considered assault weapons. (Fully automatic weapons are subject to strict regulations that make them difficult for civilian buyers to purchase.) But there’s disagreement over semi-automatic rifles, which have been used in several mass shootings. When a now-expired ban taking on ""semi-automatic assault weapons"" passed in 1994, the Justice Department said, ""In general, assault weapons are semi-automatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use,"" according to CNN. Several big-box retailers currently sell semi-automatic rifles. Walmart just isn’t one of them. Walmart still sells some firearms and ammunition, as part of its long and complex history with guns. But it has ended the sale of weapons that could be considered assault-style. Walmart has said its current gun sales policy will not change following the two recent mass shootings, meaning the company will continue selling certain firearms despite calls to drop gun sales entirely. But Walmart has taken some steps over the last several years to refine that policy. Those steps included ending the sale of assault rifles in 2015, a decision the company attributed to low consumer demand, not calls for gun control, according to the New York Times.  ""We stopped selling assault-style weapons in 2015,"" Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told PolitiFact. ""We have a longstanding commitment to selling firearms safely and compliantly."" It is accurate that Walmart is one of the largest sellers of firearms and ammunition in the United States, Hargrove said. He noted the company sells guns in roughly half of its 4,700 U.S. stores and not, for example, in its ‘neighborhood market’ stores, where the focus is on groceries.  In 2018, Walmart removed some airsoft guns, toys and other items from its website that resemble assault-style rifles, Hargrove said. It also raised the age limit on gun purchases to 21. The company has also said it only sells handguns in its Alaska stores, and in July, it stopped selling all guns in New Mexico after the state broadened its law on background checks. Dick’s Sporting Goods decided to stop selling assault-style rifles in 2018, as well. According to CNN, Bass Pro Shops still sells semi-automatic rifles, and its subsidiary Cabela’s offers what its website refers to as ""semi-automatic tactical rifles."" Gander Outdoors also lists ""semi-auto action"" firearms on its website. Other online retailers sell semi-automatic rifles, too. MSNBC did not respond to a request for comment. Ruhle said Walmart is ""one of the largest sellers of assault-style weapons."" Walmart does not sell automatic weapons, and it stopped selling semi-automatic rifles in 2015. So we rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3F9440>],/factchecks/2019/aug/07/stephanie-ruhle/walmart-one-largest-sellers-assault-style-weapons-/

The Elizabeth Warren quote likening abortion to tonsil removal? It’s edited and taken out of context
","A viral Facebook posts says Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren likened abortion to tonsil removal.  The post features a photo of the Massachusetts senator with text above and below the image that reads: ""‘Having an abortion is no different than someone having their tonsils removed.’ - Liberal Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren. Yes she really said this and is really this damn crazy and stupid!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Warren did make a comparison between abortion and tonsil removal procedures, but the quote shared in the post is heavily edited and is not something Warren said or wrote.  After searching the web and Nexis news archives, the first instance we could find of Warren discussing tonsils and abortion came in a Jan. 21, 2018, opinion column in Time magazine. She wrote:  ""On the 45th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, I think about what has changed since abortions became legal. Our health care system has pretty much dealt with the safety issue: thanks to Roe vs. Wade, abortion is now safer than getting your tonsils out. A lot of women are alive today because of Roe."" Warren made the same statement a few days later in a speech she delivered on the Senate floor in opposition to legislation that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In another opinion column, published in Marie Claire magazine in July 2018, Warren wrote that Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court could threaten the overturn of Roe vs. Wade. In the column, she again makes comparisons between the safety of the two procedures:  ""The threat of overturning Roe vs. Wade is also serious. When abortions are illegal, women don’t stop getting them — they just risk their lives to do it. Today, thanks to Roe, getting an abortion is safer than getting your tonsils out. Before Roe vs. Wade, many women turned to back-alley butchers to end their pregnancies."" In the piece, Warren links to a Time magazine article, which reported in 2014 that women who get abortions are less likely to have complications than people who have their wisdom teeth removed, citing a study published in the peer-reviewed Obstetrics & Gynecology medical journal. Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, the author of the study, told Time that of the 54,911 abortion procedures analyzed, ""only 2.1% resulted in a complication — considerably lower than the 7% complication rate for wisdom tooth removal and 9% rate for tonsillectomy."" A Facebook post shares an image of Warren and claims she said ""having an abortion is no different than someone having their tonsils removed."" Warren never said having an abortion ""is no different"" than removing a tonsil. In arguments defending Roe vs. Wade, Warren compared the overall safety of the two medical procedures, once by citing a study. This post takes Warren’s statement, swaps out her words and places the heavily edited statement inside quotation marks to make it look like she said something she didn’t. So while it contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Did mass shooting deaths fall under the 1994 assault weapon ban? Checking Bill Clinton's claim
","It is one of the most controversial gun control policies: A ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines that allow shooters to keep firing longer without reloading. While defining what is and isn’t an assault weapon is hard, singling out the broad class of firearms the term conveys is not. Following the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, former President Bill Clinton invoked the ban that passed on his watch. ""How many more people have to die before we reinstate the assault weapons ban and the limit on high-capacity magazines and pass universal background checks?"" Clinton tweeted Aug. 5. ""After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again. We must act now."" How many more people have to die before we reinstate the assault weapons ban & the limit on high-capacity magazines & pass universal background checks? After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again. We must act now. Clinton touched back on the trend in an op-ed for Time on Aug. 8. So we wanted to check it out. We’ve dug into the general question of the impact of the 1994 law before. This is the first time we examine its specific tie to mass shooting deaths, and whether the death toll rose after the ban ended. (Clinton’s tweet assumes that the presence or absence of the ban changed the number of mass shooting deaths. Proving cause and effect is a heavy lift.) The topic is riddled with tough data challenges. The law banned only certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Should rampages using other kinds of assault-style weapons count? Plus, mass shootings happen much less frequently than other gun crimes, which puts any scientific analysis at a disadvantage. That said, the evidence shows that mass shooting deaths rose in the years after the ban. The drop during the ban is less clear cut. The impact of the law is debated, but some researchers say that data and logic show that limits on large capacity magazines and assault weapons help reduce fatalities. The 1994 law barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. People who owned such weaponry could keep it. When the ban took effect, there were roughly 1 million assault weapons in private hands. An estimated 25 million weapons were equipped with large capacity magazines. The ban expired in 2004. In a key 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Justice Department, researcher Christopher Koper wrote, ""The ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban assault weapons and large capacity magazines ensured that the effects of the law would occur only gradually."" ""Should it be renewed, the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,"" Koper wrote. Clinton’s office cited a 2019 study from New York University’s School of Medicine. A group led by epidemiologist Charles DiMaggio homed in on mass shooting deaths. (Other research has tracked the number of times mass shootings happened, which is not the same thing.) Researchers define mass shootings in different ways. Following the FBI’s definition, DiMaggio’s group looked at incidents where at least four people died. In raw numbers, they found that mass shooting deaths fell during the years of the ban, and rose afterwards. DiMaggio shared his data.  ""During the ban period, there were fewer bodies,"" DiMaggio said. The death toll from mass shootings went from 4.8 per year during the ban years to 23.8 per year afterwards. Many factors drive gun deaths. To help account for those, DiMaggio’s team put mass shooting deaths in terms of the total number of firearm homicides. Viewed that way, they found that between 1994 and 2004, the yearly rate fell by 7-9 people per 10,000 firearm homicides.  There’s room for debate over what happened to death rates, in contrast to raw numbers, before and during the ban.  ""There is some evidence they actually declined — or at least didn’t continue to increase during the period of the ban,"" DiMaggio said. Epidemiologists speak in terms of risk; that is, the odds of something bad happening. DiMaggio’s study concluded that mass shooting deaths were 70% less likely during the ban.  On the key policy question of whether the ban drove the decline, DiMaggio urges caution. ""It is pretty much impossible to prove cause and effect,"" he said. That’s the consensus among a number of researchers. Philip Cook at Duke University said the death toll is real, but complicated. ""Violence rates were quite volatile during that period generally for reasons that had nothing to do with gun regulation,"" Cook said. ""That doesn’t mean that the ban was ineffective — only that we don’t know and probably cannot determine the answer given that the outcome of interest (mass shootings) is so rare.""  The drop of 15 mass shooting deaths from before the ban to during it is a slender difference on which to base firm conclusions. Economist Rosanna Smart at RAND, a consulting nonprofit research group, agreed that mass shootings rose after the ban ended, but noted, ""I don’t think (DiMaggio’s) methods are well-suited for determining the causal impact of the assault weapons ban."" In a 2018 article, Smart reviewed two studies on the impact of the ban. She said strictly in terms of statistical methods, the results were ""inconclusive."" Although one report did find that state-level bans were effective at reducing mass shooting death rates. The debate over the value of a ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines often includes Christopher Koper at George Mason University. Koper wrote the 2004 study that gave both sides in the gun control debate material to lean on. Recently, Koper has spent more time assessing the role of large capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.  In an article, Koper wrote that more than the semiautomatic weapons themselves, the latest data ties the larger magazines to a rising death toll. ""Considering that mass shootings with high capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place,"" Koper wrote in an article to be published in a few months. Democrats introduced a legislation to block people from buying large capacity magazines. Semiautomatic rifles account for a small percentage of deaths, but there are a lot of them. According to the industry trade group National Shooting Sports Foundation, yearly sales averaged about 200,000 during the years of the ban. In the eight years after the ban ended, sales averaged about 700,000 a year. Clinton urged lawmakers to reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. ""After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again,"" he said. Clinton spoke too strongly about the drop. In simple numbers, mass shooting deaths fell during the ban years —15 deaths over the course of the decade. But statistically, that number is too small to allow strong conclusions. Even the author of the report Clinton relied on said the death rate might have declined —or levelled off. The rise after the ban expired is supported by the evidence, although definitions of mass shootings will vary. The role of the ban remains unclear, but Clinton’s statement did not specifically say that the ban was the key factor. Clinton exaggerated the decline but was right about the rise. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C09FC0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/07/bill-clinton/did-mass-shooting-deaths-fall-under-1994-assault-w/

No, congressional salaries have not gone up 231% over the last 30 years
","Public interest is usually high when it comes to stories about lawmakers giving themselves pay increases. But sometimes those stories are wrong. Take, for example, the claim that Congress voted to give itself a pay raise in 2018 (it didn't), or the rumor that members can retire with full pay after only one term in office (they can’t).   Now, a Facebook post says that while House Democrats are requesting a pay increase, congressional salaries have gone up a whopping ""231%"" over the last 30 years. The post, which includes text over a photo of the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, says: ""Over the past 30 years, Congressional Salaries have gone up 231% While 80% of Americans haven’t even been able to keep up with Cost of Living! Now Congress is saying they need a $4,500 raise … for doing WHAT???"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The part of the claim that says ""80% of Americans"" can’t keep up with the current cost of living is essentially correct. According to a 2017 Career Builder report, 78% of full-time workers in the U.S. said they live paycheck-to-paycheck to make ends meet. And while members of Congress have, indeed, gotten raises over the years, it hasn’t happened since 2009. As well, the salary increases that have been approved in the last 30 years appear to add up to less than half of the 231% figure the post employs. Required by Article I, Section 6, the Framers of the Constitution decided that Congress would determine its own salary. In 1789, members earned $6 a day when they attended sessions. The per diem was increased to $7 for senators that same year, marking the first official congressional pay raise. After that, Congress periodically enacted specific legislation to alter its pay – until 30 years ago with the passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. The bill established the current automatic annual adjustment formula, which is fixed to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) that measures changes in wages – meaning that the raises must be equal to increases in the ECI. Under this system, congressional pay increases are automatic each year unless Congress votes it down – which it has done since 2009 – the last year senators and representatives received a salary adjustment.  According to a Congressional Research Service report, rank-and-file members of Congress were making $89,500 30 years ago in 1989. Today, they receive the same salary they have since 2009: $174,000. That comes to a 30-year increase of 94 percent. (Note that Congressional leadership receives higher salaries: $223,500 annually for the Speaker of the House today, and $193,400 for the Senate President pro tempore. The majority and minority leaders in both chambers also receive $193,400.) Bill Ryan, spokesperson for the Library of Congress, confirmed to PolitiFact that, per the Congressional Research Service report we consulted, the salaries have seen a 94% increase since 1989. The post is even more incorrect when you consider inflation. The $89,500 lawmakers were earning in 1989 today would be worth nearly $182,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics's inflation calculator. When it comes to the upcoming adjustment in January 2020, if the potential increase of $4,500 is approved, the projected percentage increase for the year would be 2.6%, bringing the total 30-year increase to 84 percent over the $96,000 salary members received in 1990. A post on social media says that over the last 30 years, congressional salaries have gone up ""231% while 80% of Americans haven’t even been able to keep up with Cost of Living!""

Doctors argue plans to remedy surprise medical bills will ‘shred’ the safety net
","Chances are, you or someone you know has gotten a surprise medical bill. One in six Americans have received these unexpected and often high charges after getting medical care from a doctor or hospital that isn’t in their insurance network. It’s become a hot-button issue in Congress, and high-profile legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to make the medical providers and insurers address the billing question and take the consumers out of the dispute.  That means doctor specialty groups, hospitals and insurers are among the stakeholders that could be financially affected by the outcome.  The effort has caught the attention of Physicians for Fair Coverage, a coalition formed by large companies — firms such as US Acute Care Solutions, U.S. Anesthesia Partners and US Radiology Specialists — that serve as corporate umbrellas for medical practices. The group is running a $1.2 million national commercial about these congressional efforts. It first aired in mid-July.  The ad issued a warning: ""What Congress is considering would cut money that vulnerable patients rely on the most. That means seniors, children and Americans who rely on Medicaid would be hurt."" We wondered: Will any of the surprise billing proposals being debated in Congress really affect Medicaid and these patients — ""shredding the safety net,"" as the ad claims? So we dug in. We reached out to Physicians for Fair Coverage (PFC) to find out the basis for this claim, but the phone number listed on their website no longer worked. Several emails and a direct message on Twitter later, we connected with Forbes Tate Partners, the public relations firm that produced the ad. We were then referred to Megan Taylor, a spokeswoman for PFC. ""When we talk about the safety-net, we’re talking about the health care system that the uninsured and underinsured rely on — like emergency departments, where two-thirds of the acute care is provided to uninsured Americans and where half of the acute care provided to Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program patients is delivered,"" Taylor wrote in an email. To be sure, studies have shown that ERs see a large share of vulnerable patients. But independent experts we spoke with still didn’t follow the ad’s logic. ""I’d like to think that I’m fairly well-informed about surprise billing legislation, but I’m struggling to understand what argument they are even trying to make here,"" Benedic Ippolito, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has testified before a Senate committee on this issue, wrote in an email. Focusing on the real trouble spot  The surprise medical bill legislation is an effort to help consumers who generally mistakenly thought they were getting health services covered by their insurers but instead find themselves dealing with an out-of-network provider. The insurance often covers a small portion of services, and the patient is on the hook for the rest. It’s called a ""balance bill."" That happens, for example, when people seek care at an in-network hospital but the doctor treating them doesn’t accept their insurance. The consumer can be responsible for paying the entire bill. Most surprise bills come from specialty physicians — such as anesthesiologists, radiologists and emergency room doctors — like those in the practices represented by Physicians for Fair Coverage. There are two major solutions on the table in the congressional legislation: arbitration, which would send the insurers and health care providers through an independent review to determine a fair price, and benchmarking. The ad doesn’t explicitly say so, but it’s referring to benchmarking. Under this approach, when a doctor sees an out-of-network patient, the patient’s health plan pays the doctor the median of what other doctors in the area are paid for the procedure. The ad paints a grim picture — complete with photos of children, families and even older patients in wheelchairs — of what will happen if Congress adopts benchmarking. It suggests insurance companies will offer doctors artificially low in-network rates, which, in turn, will bring down out-of-network rates. Those low rates will make it hard for doctors and hospitals to make up for uncompensated care or low payment rates from Medicaid and Medicare patients. The concern is that this will make it difficult for emergency rooms and rural hospitals to operate and force them to close. Taylor pointed to California’s 2017 law that set up a statewide benchmarking system as Exhibit A.   ""By setting a guaranteed benchmark rate at the median in-network rate, it means that insurers can push doctors out of their network, by cancelling contracts or demanding artificially low rates, in order to make the benchmark rate the default. In California, where a benchmark rate has been implemented, doctors report that insurance companies are already doing this and that Californians’ premiums are rising,"" she wrote in an email. She also cited a letter from the California Medical Association about this state law that reiterated how it is affecting patients’ access to care. So we turned to Anthony York, the director of communications for the California Medical Association, to ask about how the law was affecting the supply of doctors. He said at least nine medical facilities in the state have no anesthesiologists that are in network for some local health plans. For instance, he added, a search on Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, United Healthcare and Health Net shows no contracted anesthesiologists within 30 miles of Children’s Hospital of Orange County. But Loren Adler, associate director of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, wrote in an email that there is not enough data yet from California to say whether insurance companies are kicking doctors out of networks. He said networks are often in flux as insurers and providers wrestle about payment rates or other contract issues. ""Despite what the medical association is saying, we don’t have any evidence on this question one way or the other,"" Adler said. ""Of course there are anecdotes of contract cancellations, but contracts change over frequently."" How does Medicaid fit into this?  One thing needs to be clear: No piece of surprise bill legislation is cutting the federal funding for Medicaid or Medicare. The text of the House bill doesn’t even mention either program; the Senate bill mentions them only in the course of data collection or cost studies. ""No one on Medicaid would be affected one way or the other by any of the surprise billing proposals on the table,"" noted Adler. So how can the commercial claim that either one is ""shredding"" the safety net? It goes back to Taylor’s view that the safety net includes having access to an emergency room. This point brings up a broader issue raised by the ad: that ERs would close if physicians were paid the median in-network rate for out-of-network services. And that drew skepticism from Adler, who pointed out that many factors are responsible for emergency physician shortages or rural hospital closures. Letting doctors send large bills to patients, he said, won’t keep ailing hospitals open. ""That’s a completely illogical and contradictory set of claims they’re making,"" he wrote. Both he and Ippolito think the link to ER closures is overblown. Ippolito called the commercial a ""vague scare tactic."" He acknowledged that problems do exist with rural hospital closures and emergency room staffing, but he said solving those problems should be separate from dealing with surprise bills. ""Policymakers should solve surprise billing in the best way they can,"" he wrote, adding that concerns about access to care should be ""dealt with directly."" Our ruling Physicians for Fair Coverage claims in this commercial that Congress is considering a surprise billing solution that would ""cut money that vulnerable patients rely on."" This, in itself, is inaccurate. Neither of the proposed pieces of legislation would cut money to any programs, specifically Medicaid, CHIP or Medicare. There is also scant evidence that these proposals would trigger emergency room closures. The group claims the consequences of this proposal would ultimately lead to ER closures. But experts say their evidence is anecdotal at best. This claim raises serious health system alarms — reduced access to care, higher premium costs and even shuttered emergency rooms — without logically supporting these concerns.   We rate it as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097219F00>],/factchecks/2019/aug/07/physicians-fair-coverage/doctors-argue-plans-remedy-surprise-medical-bills-/

Fact Check: Are there ‘more gun deaths by far' in America than any other country?
","Following the recent mass shootings in Gilroy, California and El Paso, Texas, and just hours before a separate mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein made a sweeping statement about the number of guns and gun deaths in America.  ""There are more guns in this country than people, and more per capita than any other country in the world. And there are more gun deaths by far,"" Feinstein, a strong advocate for gun control, said on Twitter on Aug. 3, 2019. ""I continue to hope that opponents of commonsense gun reform laws will come to their senses and join the effort to save lives.""  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, posted this tweet on Aug. 3, 2019. As of early this week, 22 people were killed in the El Paso shooting, nine in Dayton and three in Gilroy. The suspected gunmen in Dayton and Gilroy also died.  We examined each part of Feinstein’s statement, but found we couldn’t place a Truth-O-Meter rating on the first two parts because there’s no official count on the number of guns in America and there are competing estimates on how many exist.  We did place a rating on the last portion about America having ""more gun deaths by far"" than any other country.  We’ll provide analysis on each piece of Feinstein’s statement below.  Feinstein on guns First, here’s some background on the senator. In 1994, she authored the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which was signed by President Bill Clinton. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. It also banned the manufacture and sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. The bill expired in 2004 after efforts to extend it failed in Congress. Its restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons or magazines made before the ban’s effective date: Sept. 13, 1994. Feinstein has remained an advocate for gun control. In February of this year, she introduced a bill that would pay for states to create their own extreme-risk protection laws, also known as red flag laws. Those would allow family members to petition for a court order to ""grant law enforcement the authority to temporarily take weapons from dangerous individuals who present a threat to themselves or others,"" according to Feinstein’s office.  California, Maryland and Florida have already enacted similar laws. There is no official count of the number of firearms in the United States, only widely varying estimates, as PolitiFact has reported in the past.  As the Pew Research Center has observed: ""Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down."" We found estimates as low as 265 million civilian guns in the U.S. in January 2015 — to as high as 393 million in a report last year. Researchers say estimates can include guns that no longer work, leading to an overcount. Meanwhile, some survey respondents will understate the number of guns they own, leading to an undercount.  With no definitive tally, we decided not to place a rating on this portion of Feinstein's statement. This second part of the claim is generally on the right track, whether looking at the high estimates for guns in America or the lower ones. But again it relies on a topic for which there’s no settled data.  Taking the estimate of 393 million civilian firearms, there would be 120.5 guns for every 100 residents in the United States. As The Washington Post reported, that’s twice the per capita rate of the next-highest nation, Yemen, with just 52.8 guns per 100 residents.  Using the lower estimate of 265 million guns in 2015 would still produce about 83 guns for every 100 Americans that year.  While this part of Feinstein’s claim is likely more accurate, the per capita rate doesn’t mean all Americans own guns. Instead, gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population — as surveys from the Pew Research Center and General Social Survey suggest, according to the Post.  This part of Feinstein’s statement is not supported. We found the United States experiences more firearm injury deaths than other countries of similar socioeconomic standing. But that’s not what Feinstein claimed. She suggested it had ""more gun deaths by far"" than any other country. In 2017, Brazil had the most overall gun deaths of any country at 48,493, including homicides, suicides and unintentional gun deaths, according to a June 2018 report by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.  The United States had the second most overall gun deaths at 40,229, though it had the highest suicide by gun total of any nation, at nearly 25,000. Data from the report showed Brazil had the most overall gun deaths at least from 2015 through 2017. ""Yes, Brazil is highest by number"" for overall gun deaths, the study’s author, Professor Moshen Naghavi, said by email.  ""We believe 2018 and 2019 will be higher,"" Naghavi said in a follow-up phone interview, citing decisions made by Brazil’s new president to make firearms more accessible.  Feinstein’s office did not respond to our request for information supporting this portion of her statement.  PolitiFact Texas fact-checked a similar claim last week by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and rated it Mostly False. O'Rourke said at the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit that ""we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to."" It cited the University of Washington study and noted that more than a dozen countries had more firearm deaths per capita than the United States in 2016. Our rating Sen. Dianne Feinstein claimed, ""There are more guns in this country than people, and more per capita than any other country in the world. And there are more gun deaths by far.""  We could not place a rating on the first two parts because there is no official count of guns in America, only widely varying estimates.  The last part of her statement, however, is not supported. A recent study showed Brazil, not the United States, had the most overall gun deaths of any country over the last several years. America, however, had the highest total of suicides by firearm of any nation.  In the end, she was wrong that there are ""more gun deaths by far"" in the United States than any other country in the world.  We rate that portion of her claim False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Facebook post mischaracterizes scientists' cow flatulence studies
","Are bags being attached to cows’ backs in an attempt to fight climate change? The short answer is in some cases, but some social media posts that have surfaced recently are mischaracterizing and oversimplifying this fight against flatulence.  The Facebook post making the rounds shares an image of a cow with a red bag strapped to its back and says:  ""I wish this was a joke but fringe leftist(s) are now advocating for cow fart bags to capture farts as a way to help prevent ‘global warming.’ You can’t make this stuff up folks."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image used in the post is real and was taken in 2008 in Argentina by Reuters photographer Marcos Brindicci. But the soft plastic tank was used by researchers from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology to collect the cow’s burps in order to study the effect its diet had on the production of methane. So, while it is certainly related to the fight against climate change, the bags in the photo were not attached in order to eliminate bovine methane emissions from the atmosphere, but to study the cow’s digestive system and measure the impact of its emissions. Then, in 2013, the same researchers used the bags as a collection system to transform and convert the methane into renewable biofuels. One of the project’s technicians, Ricardo Bualo, said in the institute’s report that the purified and compressed biomethane could be used to generate caloric, light and motor energy: ""A cow emits about 300 liters of methane per day, which can be used to operate a 100-liter refrigerator at a temperature between two and six degrees for a full day,"" he says. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years. In 2017, about 9% of U.S. emissions came from the agriculture sector, the agency says. So, yes, scientists are attaching backpacks to cows in order to collect their gas ⁠— burps, not flatulence ⁠— and transform it into renewable energy in an attempt to hamper the levels of methane that the animals release.  But the Facebook post doesn’t explain any of the details of the studies, including the methane’s conversion, and it incorrectly pegs scientists and researchers as ""fringe leftists.""  The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Fact-checking the claim that Ida B. Wells was ignored because she was a Republican
","A recent Facebook post touts the activism and accomplishments of Ida B. Wells, a black investigative journalist who reported on lynchings in the United States during the 1800s. But the celebration turns accusatory as the July 19 post suggests she was ignored because of her political beliefs.   ""Ida B. Wells refused to give up her seat 71 years before Rosa Parks did,"" the post says. ""At age 33, she owned the first African American newspaper in Chicago, the Chicago Conservator. Why do you never hear about her? Because she was a Republican."" This post, which was shared more than 2,300 times within a week, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Some details in the post are accurate but the closing allegation that she has been snubbed because she was a Republican is wrong. Here’s what you need to know. Who was Ida B. Wells? Wells was born in Mississippi in 1862 and grew up during the Reconstruction era following the Civil War.  She was 30 years old and working as a newspaper editor in Memphis when she started reporting on lynchings in the South. Her work, which relied on documents and included eye-witness interviews, challenged the notion that black men were rapists. When her work ran in The Memphis Free Speech and Headlight, a newspaper she co-owned, she faced death threats and, in 1892, the offices of her newspaper were destroyed by a mob. In 1884 — 71 years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in 1955 —  railroad workers forcibly removed Wells from a train traveling from Memphis to Woodstock, Tenn., after she refused to leave a car reserved for white women. Wells moved to Chicago in the early 1890s. In 1895, she married Ferdinand L. Barnett, the editor of the Chicago Conservator, the city’s first African American newspaper. Paula Giddings writes in her book, ""A Sword Among Lions,"" that Wells took majority ownership of that paper around the time of her wedding, when she was 33 going on 34. What were her politics? Wells’ father, James Wells, advocated for the rights of newly freed black people and worked with the Republican Party during Reconstruction, the Washington Post reported. Both of her parents were active in the Republican Party, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Living in Chicago, Ida Wells and her husband were politically loyal to Charles S. Deneen, a leading Republican in Illinois, the introduction of Wells’ autobiography, ""Crusade for Justice,"" says. As state’s attorney, Deneen appointed Barnett assistant state’s attorney, and he was the first black man to hold that position.   When Ida Wells later ran for Illinois State Senate (and lost) in 1930, she ran as an independent.  Daphene R. McFerren, executive director of the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis, shared with PolitiFact an 1885 letter Wells wrote to the New York Freeman that underscores this point.  ""I am not a Democrat,"" Wells wrote, ""because the Democrats considered me a chattel and possibly might have always so considered me, because their record from the beginning has been inimical to my interests. I am not a Republican, because, after they — as a party measure and an inevitable result of the war — had ‘given the Negro his freedom’ and the ballot box following, all through their reign — while advocating the doctrine of the Federal Government’s right to protecting her citizens — they suffered the crimes against the Negro, that have made the South notorious, to go unpunished and almost unnoticed and turned them over to the tender mercies of the South.""  She goes on to say ""it is not in favor, nor against the interest of either party that I write this. Let a man be Democrat, Republican or Independent as his judgment dictates, if he is obeying honest and intelligent convictions.""  Women were not granted the right to vote until about a decade before Wells’ death in 1931, but  McFerren said, ""what black person wasn’t a Republican after the Civil War?"" The Republican Party was then the party of President Abraham Lincoln, and it was unheard of for a black person to be a Democrat from 1920 to about the 1940s, she said. That shifted during the 1950s and 60s as black people starting voting for Democrats, she said, and the historical context matters.  ""To say a black person is a Republican of her era is a compliment, it has no relationship to how we understand Republicans today,"" McFerren said. ""Labeling her as a Republican when they’re trying to use her in a contemporary sense is ridiculous.""  ""Of course she was a Republican!"" Theodore Karamanski, a history professor at Loyola University Chicago, told us. But, he added, ""the GOP was at that time the party of Lincoln NOT the party of Trump or even Reagan. Most African Americans were Republicans in the 1940s. The Republican Party switched its policies regarding African Americans with the Democrats in the 1960s."" Has she been ignored?  Last year, the New York Times ran a belated obituary for Wells. That’s because since 1851, a few years before Wells was born, the newspaper’s obituary pages were dominated by news of the deaths of white men. The paper in 2018 set out to rectify the record in an ongoing project called ""Overlooked,"" which seeks to recognize the legacies of other remarkable people in its obituary pages.  ""Wells is considered by historians to have been the most famous black woman in the United States during her lifetime,"" the New York Times obit says, ""even as she was dogged by prejudice, a disease infecting Americans from coast to coast. She pioneered reporting techniques that remain central tenets of modern journalism. And as a former slave who stood less than five feet tall, she took on structural racism more than half a century before her strategies were repurposed, often without crediting her, during the 1960s civil rights movement.""  She organized economic boycotts before civil rights activists who were mostly men were credited with the tactic’s success, according to the Times. As she aged, her influence waned while activists like Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois rose in prominence.  Historian John Hope Franklin wrote in the foreword of Wells’ memoir that ""for more than 40 years, Ida B. Wells was one of the most fearless and one of the most respected women in the United States.""  In June 2018, though, the Washington Post reported that her pioneering work was ""all but unrecognized in (Chicago), which has no shortage of statues and monuments to leading white men."" But, the Post said, ""Wells is enjoying fresh attention."" Hundreds of thousands of dollars were raised to build a monument to Wells there. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala., features a selection of quotes and a stone inscribed with her name. The Ida B. Wells Legacy Committee was formed to support the candidacies of black women. This year, a major downtown thoroughfare in Chicago was renamed after Wells.  Back in 1991, the Chicago Tribune ran a story about Wells that called her an ""inspiration."" But in 2018, the Guardian called her ""the unsung heroine of the civil rights movement."" Responding to a Twitter account that tweeted the same image that was used in the Facebook post, Nikole Hannah-Jones, a New York Times reporter and co-founder of the Ida B. Wells Society, which seeks to increase the ranks and influence of journalists of color doing investigative work, said: ""We know who the hell she is."" ""Y’all need to stop this,"" Hannah-Jones tweeted in February 2018. ""If the modern Republican Party wants to adopt the platform it had during Ida B. Wells’s time — like sweeping civil rights legislation, reparations — then every black American would be Republican again. Stop being dumb."" Later that year, she responded to another Twitter account that said Wells didn’t get the credit she deserved for refusing to give up her train seat because she was a conservative Republican.  ""Ida B. Wells was a conservative Republican,"" Hannah-Jones said. ""I think I almost choked on this one. The Republicans at the time of Ida B. Wells were radically liberal, pushing for massive expansion of govt in the protection of black civil rights."" ""She didn’t ‘get credit,’"" Hannah-Jones said, ""because white, racist conservatives burned her newspaper down when she exposed the lie of why black men were lynched and then across the South white conservatives systematically implemented black codes to force black people back in to quasi-slavery."" Today, McFerren said, Wells is ""celebrated everywhere,"" and she’s enjoyed a renaissance in the past several years.  Karamanski told us that if you haven’t heard of Ida B. Wells, ""it is because you have been willfully ignorant of Chicago history, women’s history, and African American history. It is NOT because she was Republican."" Our ruling The Facebook post gets these things right: Wells refused to give up her seat 71 years before Rosa Parks did, and she owned the first African American newspaper in Chicago in her early 30s. But the post also said that people never hear about Ida B. Wells because she was a Republican. That’s not true.  Wells ran for a seat in the Illinois Senate as an independent but she was the child of Republicans and supported Republicans. African Americans were largely partial to the Republican Party during Reconstruction. Historians note it’s not the Republican Party of today, though it bears the same name.  Though Wells may not have received enough credit for her journalism and activism through much of history, the record shows that she hasn’t been invisible. When she was overshadowed at points in history, it doesn’t appear that it was due to her political affiliation but rather that she was writing in detail about lynching at a time when the African American voice and experience, and especially the African American female voice and experience, was devalued in a society dominated by white men. Today, Wells has several namesakes and markers to her legacy. McFerren suspects she gets the most attention of her contemporaries of the 1800s. We rate this Facebook post as Half True. Correction, Aug. 7, 2019: The husband of Ida B. Wells, Ferdinand Barnett, was appointed assistant state's attorney in Illinois. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that her father, James Wells, was appointed.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DE7140>],/factchecks/2019/aug/06/viral-image/fact-checking-ida-b-wells-ignored-republican/

Pants on Fire: State rep claims mass shootings are down under Trump
","On Aug. 3, 2019, a gunman walked into a packed Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and opened fire, killing at least 22 and injuring 24. In the wee hours of Aug. 4, a gunman opened fire on the street in a Dayton, Ohio, entertainment district, killing nine and injuring 27. Later that day, Wisconsin state Rep. Ron Tusler was on Facebook claiming mass shootings are down under President Donald Trump. ""Less mass shootings under Trump! His base doesn't hate anyone,"" declared Tusler, R-Harrison, in a since-deleted post. The text accompanied a re-posting of a chart shared by another person that showed 24 mass shootings under President Barack Obama and four shootings under Trump. That’s quite the disparity.   There’s a lot to cover — and a lot wrong — in this seemingly simple claim. Let’s break it down. Tusler’s claim is ridiculous on multiple fronts. For one, the data it references is badly outdated. The chart in Tusler’s post is pulled from a Spring 2018 article in National Affairs, a quarterly journal from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. RELATED: Fact-checking misinformation after the El Paso, Dayton shootings The chart says it pulled the tallies for each president from an LA Times timeline published in October 2017, then added the February 2018 Marjory Stoneman school shooting in Parkland, Fla. So the data at best ends a year and a half ago, reflecting less than half of Trump’s time in office to date. The chart itself is flawed as well. Converting the LA Times narratives to a chart implies a degree of consistency and comprehensiveness that the newspaper did not intend. The article didn’t define any criteria for inclusion aside from a sentence at the top saying, ""Here are some of the most notable mass shootings in the U.S. in recent decades."" The National Affairs chart is particularly haphazard since it added in the Florida shooting but ignored the Texas First Baptist Church massacre in November 2017 that killed more people. The broader issue with both the chart and Tusler’s claim is the use of raw numbers to compare one partial term under Trump to two full terms under Obama. Simple tallies will, of course, be larger over a longer time period. So what are those tallies? And how does Tusler’s claim about less shootings hold up to a better comparison, such as mass shootings per year? Those answers depend on how you define a mass shooting. Though bandied about in politics, media and culture, there is no universally accepted definition of the term.  The U.S. Justice Department defines it as three or more killings in a single episode. The Washington Post database uses four or more shot and killed in a single incident, excluding gang-related killings. Mother Jones uses three or more shot and killed. The much broader Gun Violence Archive uses four or more shot (not necessarily killed). None include the perpetrator in those tallies. We turned to the Washington Post and Mother Jones, since both have been tracking this subject in detail and have data going back several presidential administrations. We find a trend line that doesn’t match up with particular presidents or party control, it simply shows a steady increase in shootings over time.   Our analysis of The Washington Post data shows an average of 2.4 mass shootings per year under President Ronald Reagan, 2.3 under George H. W. Bush and 3.6 under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The rate jumps to 5.1 per year under Obama and 7.9 per year so far under Trump — a roughly 50% increase. In terms of raw numbers, that’s 41 shootings in the eight years Obama was in office, compared to 20 already in the two and a half under Trump. The data from Mother Jones shows a similar trend, though the numbers are different since they have a broader definition of mass shootings and aren’t as comprehensive as the Post in prior years. Mother Jones reports 1 to 2 shootings per year from the Reagan era through George W. Bush, then 4.8 under Obama and 11.5 under Trump. (The Gun Violence Archive doesn’t shed much light on this claim since it only goes back to 2014.) We asked Tusler if he was aware the data was outdated, and whether he felt raw numbers were a fair way to compare Trump and Obama. ""If there is newer data, please provide it and I would update. I prefer the most up to date information,"" he said in a Facebook message. ""I don't think raw numbers tell the whole story. But, at least they are not interpreted with a bias."" It’s an ironic response given that it’s the use of raw numbers that paints a skewed picture of the Trump and Obama eras. Doing an annual average equalizes the comparison. Tusler said he thought the data was more recent and had removed the post from Facebook, though it remained until this fact check published. In the wake of two mass shootings that left 31 dead in the span of 13 hours, Tusler claimed there have been fewer such shootings under Trump than Obama. That’s nonsense. The chart Tusler based his claim on is both incomplete and outdated — including only half of Trump’s time in office. And it’s absurd to use a raw tally of shootings to compare just over two years under Trump to eight years under Obama. Using more comprehensive data and a reasonable criterion like shootings per year, we see that mass shootings have risen steadily in recent decades regardless of who is in the White House.  So shootings are up — not down — under Trump.

No, the Dayton shooting suspect didn’t die in 2014
","Connor Betts was shot and killed by police over the weekend after the 24-year-old man reportedly shot and killed nine people and injured dozens more outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio. But social media posts shared online claim Betts actually died in 2014, five years before the mass shooting. This one, posted on Aug. 5, includes three screenshots. The first two are of an obituary on Legacy.com for someone named Connor D. Betts, who died in 2014 at the age of 22. It says he was survived by four siblings, including someone named Megan Betts. The third screenshot shows a Daily Beast headline identifying the Dayton shooting suspect’s sister, also named Megan Betts, who was among those killed in the shooting. The post seems to suggest that she and the sister of the Connor Betts who died in 2014 are the same person. But they’re not. Which is why this post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A link to the obituary on Legacy.com doesn’t work, but we found it on Nexis, a news archive. On Feb. 23, 2014, the Hartford Courant ran the obit featured in the Facebook post. It says that Betts was born in Hartford, Conn., and lived in Suffield, Conn., before he died on Feb. 19, 2014. He graduated from Suffield High School in 2010 and then attended Lincoln Tech for Diesel Technology. He worked at Folsom Construction.  The Courant reported that Betts and the owner of Folsom Construction died after a dump truck bed hit overhead electrical wires and they were electrocuted. The Dayton shooting suspect, meanwhile, was raised in Bellbrook, a Dayton, Ohio, suburb, and he attended Bellbrook High School. Media reports have quoted former classmates, an ex-girlfriend and a former Bellbrook principal about Betts. More recently, he had been studying psychology at a local community college and worked at a Chipotle restaurant, the Washington Post reported.  The obituary in the Facebook post is for Connor D. Betts, but the Dayton shooting suspect’s middle name was Stephen.  The obit for Connor D. Betts said he was survived by his mother, Kathleen O’Leary Betts, and his father, Robert Betts. The parents of Connor Stephen Betts, the Dayton shooting suspect, are named Moira Betts and Stephen Betts.  Photos of Connor D. Betts and Connor Stephen Betts bear a resemblance; both men had brown hair, for example. But a closer look at the images shows that they are clearly different people. The post is likely meant to fuel a false conspiracy that the Dayton shooting was a ""false flag"" operation carried out by the government. We rate this Facebook post as False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D3A80>],/factchecks/2019/aug/06/viral-image/no-dayton-shooting-suspect-didnt-die-2014/
