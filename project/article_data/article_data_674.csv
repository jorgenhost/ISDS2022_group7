Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele says he's balanced 5 budgets without raising property taxes
","Facing an election challenge from a state senator in his own party, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele unveiled two campaign ads on Nov. 2, 2015. Both TV spots make the same boast about taxes. In the ad titled ""Foundation,"" the narrator puts it this way: ""As county executive, he balanced the budget without raising taxes, five years in a row."" Really? Then why is the property tax levy millions of dollars higher than when Abele took office? It’s been well documented that the county Board of Supervisors has generally raised property taxes in making changes to Abele’s budgets. But Abele has, in his own way, adopted those increases as well. The numbers Abele has proposed five county budgets since winning a special election in April 2011 to finish out the final year of Scott Walker’s term, after Walker was elected governor. Abele won a full four-year term in 2012, running unopposed. But he faces a serious challenge from state Sen. Chris Larson of Milwaukee in the April 2016 election. (Although both Abele and Larson are Democrats, the county executive position is officially nonpartisan.) As the following table shows, for each of his five budgets, Abele proposed a property tax levy freeze -- in other words, he proposed levying the same total amount of property taxes that was levied the previous year. But it’s also clear that Abele’s proposed levy has increased every year, and was $13 million higher in 2016 than it was in 2012. Budget Year Property tax levy proposed by Abele` Property tax levy adopted by County Board following vetoes and veto overrides 2011 (Proposed by Scott Walker) $269.6 million 2012 $269.6 million $275.4 million 2013 $275.4 million $279.3 million 2014 $279.3 million $279.3 million 2015 $279.3 million $282.9 million 2016 $282.9 million $287 million* *The County Board on Nov. 9, 2015, adopted the 2016 budget, though Abele can still issue vetoes. The pattern was essentially the same each year: Abele proposed a budget that would have frozen the levy. The County Board approved changes in the budget that -- except for 2014, when the levy stayed the same -- raised the levy. Abele issued a number of budget vetoes, some or all of which were overridden by the County Board. The result was that, except for 2014, the County Board ultimately adopted a budget that contained a property tax levy larger than what Abele proposed. So, by proposing the freezes, and issuing the vetoes, each year, Abele tried to keep the property levy from going up. But when it came time to propose a budget for the next year, Abele used the previous year’s levy. In other words, each year, Abele took advantage of the fact that the County Board had adopted a levy that was higher than he proposed. So, the ""freeze"" he proposed each year was on the higher amount adopted by the board, not the lower amount that he had proposed and tried to preserve with his vetoes. This was the same pattern Walker followed as county executive. Our rating Abele says he balanced the Milwaukee County budget ""without raising taxes five years in a row."" That claim has the ring of finality to it, as though Abele has presided over five budgets without a tax increase. In reality, Abele did propose a freeze in the property tax levy each year and he issued budget vetoes that would have kept the levy down. But the County Board ultimately adopted a budget that raised the total property tax take in four of the five years, and Abele took advantage of those actions when he proposed a freeze the following year. So, taxpayers are paying more than when he took office. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

Wading into the question of hydropower in Georgia
","Anyone who has ever visited Niagara Falls has a very clear idea of the power of water. But the same might be said about the Chattahoochee River for anyone who has ever decided to explore some of the whitewater. So a recent claim made by one member of the Georgia Public Service Commission, in touting the state’s commitment to nuclear power, caught our attention. ""Our state has no major rivers to produce big hydro power,"" Commissioner Tim G. Echols wrote in Power Engineering, a magazine that covers the power generation industry. ""What we do have is nuclear power, and it enjoys widespread support."" No major rivers? And what is ""big"" hydro? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check Who decides? We reached out to Echols, who cited both state and federal reports to back up his claim. The 2014 Georgia Energy Report by the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority said that hydroelectric generated 2 percent of power generation and 5.5 percent of capacity in 2012, Echols said. And a 1998 report for the U.S. Department of Energy evaluated ""undeveloped hydropower potential"" and found Georgia’s undeveloped hydropower potential was between about 613 megawatts and 1,137 megawatts of power. Large-scale hydropower is more than 30 megawatts in size. Each of the two nuclear units being built at Plant Vogtle, which we will get to in a moment, will generate about 1,117 megawatts each. ""So, if we extracted every last megawatt of potential hydropower that has been identified in Georgia, we would equal the output of a single nuclear reactor under the most favorable interpretation,"" Echols said. ""In a more realistic scenario, we could generate roughly 60 percent of that."" Rivers run through it Part of whether the statement makes sense falls on whether Georgia has any ""major"" rivers. As any elementary school student can tell you, many towns and cities developed alongside rivers throughout the nation’s history, with the waterways serving as transportation for people as well as goods. The Chattahoochee, Savannah and Suwannee are the major rivers in Georgia. The Hooch is the state’s longest, flowing about 435 miles.  There are 13 dams along the Chattahoochee, designed to both regulate flow and generate hydropower.  By comparison, 56 dams built exclusively for hydropower sit in the Columbia River Basin, which stretches for 1,240 miles. Hydropower supplies about half of the electricity used in the Northwest - about 8,664 megawatts a year. So, Georgia may have major rivers, by our own state standards, but those rivers may not necessarily be major in terms of water-power electric generation. Peach State energy Georgia, like many states, is in the midst of a big shift in how it generates that electricity. The move has been away from coal as the primary fuel and into cleaner, greener options. Years ago, Georgia Power committed to building two new nuclear reactors at its Vogtle site south of Augusta.  The project is years behind schedule and well over budget but, once done, will allow nuclear to grow beyond the 9 percent of capacity it accounted for as of the third quarter this year, according to Georgia Power. Nuclear is small in capacity terms, especially compared to the 32 percent capacity from coal and 49 percent from natural gas. But it’s almost double the 5 percent capacity from hydropower, the electricity generated from 18 plants Georgia Power operates across the state. Capacity versus energy From that perspective, neither hydropower nor nuclear appears ""big"" energy generators. (In hydropower’s case, it’s not big relative to other regions of the country). But experts look not only at the capacity, or how much could be provided, but at energy, or what is actually generated to meet the need. Looking at it that way, hydro appears even smaller, accounting for 5 percent of capacity but just one percent of energy, said Georgia Power spokesman John Kraft. Nuclear, meanwhile, accounts for 9 percent of capacity but generated 19 percent of the energy in the third quarter. And, as we mentioned, Georgia Power has put its money behind nuclear. The company has not sought to build a new hydroelectric facility since the mid-1970s and last brought two units online in 2005 as upgraded replacements for long-used plants, Kraft said. ""Many of the prime hydroelectric generation locations in Georgia are now in use. In addition, the rivers that flow through Georgia originate in Georgia, therefore, their drainage basins are relatively small,"" Kraft said. ""The really large river systems such as the Columbia, Ohio and Tennessee include multiple states in their drainage basins and have much larger hydropower potential."" Outside view It’s not just the company that thinks so. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is one of the world’s largest suppliers of hydroelectric power. By the Corps calculations, Georgia Power has about 340 megawatts of capacity on the Chattahoochee and some smaller power generation elsewhere in the state. The Corps has another 350 megawatts of capacity on the Chattahoochee, too. But those plants are usually the ""last on, first off"" resources to meet demand. Nuclear plants operate continuously, making direct comparisons difficult, said spokeswoman Lisa Parker. ""I feel that Georgia does have major rivers that have been developed by USACE and GPC for peak hydropower,"" Parker said. ""It does not have major rivers that could support large base load hydropower, such as the Columbia River."" Still, the U.S. Department of Energy’s updated hydropower assessment found in 2014 that the south Atlantic-Gulf region, including Georgia, had untapped potential for another 2,561 megawatts of power. Our ruling In explaining Georgia’s support of nuclear energy, Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols wrote in a trade publication that the state has no ""major rivers to produce big hydropower."" In the most simple terms, Georgia does have major rivers where hydroelectric plants are a key part of the mix in meeting the state’s energy demands. As a percentage of power generation, hydropower is destined to remain a relatively small part of that mix given the limitations of our rivers compared to massive waterways in places such as the Pacific Northwest. There is some room for growth in hydroelectric, which Echols’ statement ignores, even if other energy sources will always dominate. We rate Echols’ statement Mostly True.","[('PowerEngineering.com, ""Why Georgia marches on toward more nuclear,"" Oct. 26, 2015', 'http://energy.gov/eere/energybasics/articles/large-scale-hydropower-basics'), ('Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, 2014 Georgia Energy Report', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Hydropower Resource Assessment Final Report, December 1998', 'http://gefa.georgia.gov/sites/gefa.georgia.gov/files/related_files/document/Georgia-Energy-Report-2014.pdf'), ('U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Hydropower Resource Assessment for Georgia, October 1998 \xa0', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Energy, Large-scale hydropower basics, Aug. 14, 2013', 'http://www1.eere.energy.gov/wind/pdfs/doewater-10430.pdf'), ('Maps of the World, Georgia state rivers, Nov. 14, 2014', 'No link'), ('The Georgia River Network, Chattahoochee River', 'http://hydropower.inl.gov/resourceassessment/pdfs/states/ga.pdf'), ('U.S. Geological Survey, Lengths of the major rivers, July 30, 2015', 'No link'), ('The Northwest Power and Conservation Council, Guide to major hydropower dams of the Columbia River Basin, Nov. 13, 2013', 'http://energy.gov/eere/energybasics/articles/large-scale-hydropower-basics'), ('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Georgia Power slows pursuit of another nuclear project,"" Feb. 4, 2015', 'No link'), ('The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Hydropower', 'http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/states/georgia/georgia-river-map.html'), ('U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Laboratory National Hydropower Assessment Program, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interviews, Tim Echols, commissioner, Georgia Public Service Commission, Nov. 4-6, 2015', 'http://garivers.org/other-georgia-rivers/chattahoochee-river.html'), ('Email and phone interviews, Lisa Parker, spokeswoman, U.S. Army Corps Of Engineers, Nov. 2 and Nov. 3, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email and phone interviews, John Kraft, spokesman, Georgia Power, Nov. 2-6, 2015', 'http://water.usgs.gov/edu/riversofworld.html')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/10/tim-echols/wading-question-hydropower-georgia/

Rubio spent tax money to renovate Florida House, state Dems say
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio railed against taxes during his career in Florida politics, but his presidential campaign has been facing accusations that he has a long history of being a spendthrift with other people’s money. The Florida Democratic Party posted a message Nov. 5, 2015, on Facebook about Rubio’s financial habits as incoming speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. ""Remember that time Marco Rubio spent $400K of your tax dollars remodeling offices, and building a members-only lounge? We do,"" the post read. It included a link to a 2010 Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald story about Rubio’s use of a Republican Party of Florida credit card. It’s common for incoming speakers to spruce up the chambers as they see fit, so we wondered if Rubio really spent $400,000 for renovations and a new lounge. Rubio’s renovations In August 2006, before he was officially sworn in as speaker, Rubio did order some renovations to the House. The Times/Herald story the Democrats linked to noted, ""When Rubio became speaker, he spent about $400,000 in tax dollars to remodel offices and build a members-only dining room so lawmakers rushing to meetings or in the throes of negotiations would not have to leave the Capitol to eat."" The story was written before renovations were complete. The West Miami Republican said he sought to ""decentralize the power of the speakership from being some imperial position to being more of a manager of the process."" That involved moving some offices around inside the Capitol. He wanted the clerk and sergeant-at-arms moved from the fourth floor to the fifth floor, which pushed the House rules and calendar council to the 12th floor. Rubio also wanted the budget and policy committees together, and did have a members-only dining room built.   A dining area just for lawmakers raised some eyebrows at the time. While the Capitol had a public cafeteria and separate snack bar, some critics wondered if a private room was an excuse for lawmakers to meet away from where public records laws could find them. (The dining room was built, and is still there.) In all, Rubio ordered almost $560,000 in renovations, according to records from the Speaker’s Office. There were some rumblings that a state representative so opposed to taxes and government waste — in 2006 he published his book 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future — shouldn’t have been spending that kind of money. But is that a lot? Consider that his predecessor Allan Bense only spent $1,500, according to the Times/Herald. On the high end, John Thrasher spent almost $7 million in 1999 to renovate the House chamber, the speaker's office and the House office building. Former Speaker Daniel Webster spent about $100,000 in 1997 to build a spiral staircase between the Speaker’s Office and the Republican Majority Office. Rubio closed the staircase. The leader of the House Democrats at the time, Rep. Dan Gelber of Miami Beach, acknowledged the spending but didn’t make it an issue, instead praising Rubio for including Democrats in new committee suites. ""I think the speaker has a prerogative to spend his budget as he sees fit,"" he said at the time. Criticism of Rubio’s spending as speaker came up during his 2010 U.S. Senate campaign against then-Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist criticized Rubio for the renovations and for inflating his staff’s payroll by $2 million over his predecessor. Rubio hired 20 new workers, many of them from former Gov. Jeb Bush’s office, paying several of them more than $100,000. One of them was Rubio’s chief of staff, Richard Corcoran, who earned $175,212 — $46,000 more than Crist did as governor. Corcoran, now a state representative from Land O’Lakes, takes over as speaker of the House in 2016. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said, ""Marco Rubio spent $400K of your tax dollars remodeling offices, and building a members-only lounge."" It was actually more than that. Rubio spent almost $560,000 to move around offices, renovate meeting spaces and open a dining area in the Capitol. Other speakers have spent more or less than that, as they saw fit. Democratic leadership at the time didn’t quibble with the changes, although Rubio did face some criticism over the moves, especially when he ran for U.S. Senate. We rate the statement True.  ","[('Florida Democratic Party, Facebook post, Nov. 5, 2015', 'https://www.facebook.com/FlaDems/posts/10150584744609975'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Rubio already changes House,"" Aug. 31, 2006', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""On special session stage, he\'ll star,"" June 10, 2007', 'http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/31/State/Rubio_already_changes.shtml'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Records show Marco Rubio spent thousands with GOP credit card,"" Feb. 24, 2010', 'No link'), ('Associated Press, ""Analysis: Crist\'s attacks stretch the truth,"" March 12, 2010', 'http://www.sptimes.com/2007/06/10/State/On_special_session_st.shtml'), ('PolitiFact Florida, ""Alan Grayson attacks Daniel Webster\'s \'stairway to nowhere\',"" Aug. 31, 2010', 'No link'), ('Orlando Sentinel, ""Democrats\' best campaign tool is Marco Rubio\'s record,"" Sept. 12, 2010', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/records-show-marco-rubio-spent-thousands-with-gop-credit-card/1075692'), ('Washington Post, ""Five myths about Marco Rubio,"" June 15, 2012', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Val Demings says Daniel Webster ‘used taxpayer funds to build a lobbyist lounge’,"" Sept. 28, 2012', 'http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100313/ARTICLE/3131037?p=2&tc=pg&tc=ar'), ('National Review, ""When Rubio Was the Man of Florida’s House,"" April 13, 2015', 'No link'), ('Orlando Sentinel, ""Rep.

Claim says all California drivers are insured
","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  Convincing all California drivers to carry insurance has vexed state officials for decades. The most recent estimates show that 4.1 million drivers, or about one in seven on the state’s roads, were uninsured as of 2012. A state law that went into effect in January has suddenly wiped away that problem, according to Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas. Alejo announced in September that more than half a million undocumented state residents had obtained a driver’s license under AB 60, which he authored. He went on to say his law erases any worry about uninsured motorists rumbling down California’s roads. ""I am proud to have authored this historic measure for not only the millions of hard working undocumented Californians that call California home, but also the 38 million California residents that can now rest assured that everyone on California’s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured,"" Alejo said in a press release. We wanted to fact-check the head-scratching claim that ""everyone on California’s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured,"" with a focus on the insurance portion. We started with some sobering data from the California Highway Patrol, which enforces the state’s requirement that all drivers carry insurance. In the first eight months of this year, its officers issued more than 66,000 citations statewide to drivers who failed to show valid insurance. *NOTE: The 2015 figure is a projection. As of Aug. 31, 2015, the CHP has issued 66,003 citations to improperly insured drivers. Source: CHP Clearly, uninsured motorists are still keeping the CHP busy. Eric Lin, a professor who studies insurance at Sacramento State University, called Alejo’s statement wishful thinking. ""First of all, it’s inaccurate,"" Lin said. ""I think that it’s a goal that all of us should be trying to get to."" The professor cited an Insurance Research Council report from 2014 that estimates California had the most uninsured motorists in the nation in 2012, with 4.1 million. While the report centers on trends from three years ago, Patrick Schmid, the council’s research director, said there’s no doubt people are still driving without insurance in California. ""The fact of the matter is there are motorists out there both nationally and within the state of California that are making the unwise decision to drive uninsured,"" Schmid said. We asked Alejo’s office to explain the lawmaker’s claim. His spokeswoman responded in an email that the statement ""should have been a little more precise."" ""In retrospect,"" she added, ""it should have read: ""…but also the 38 million California residents that can now rest assured that everyone on California’s roads will be properly licensed, tested and insured.""  Assemblyman Luis Alejo. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio Lin said he’s ""not optimistic"" that Alejo’s prediction will come true. ""This uninsured motorist problem is perplexing. It’s very difficult to mitigate,"" the professor said. He said AB 60 has the potential to reduce uninsured driving in California, though he and state insurance and motor vehicle officials said it was too early to say whether the law is having that impact. California does not require proof of insurance to obtain a driver’s license. It does, however, require insurance to register a vehicle. Insurance experts say Alejo’s claim about ""everyone"" being insured on California’s roads is far from true. But they point out that the percentage of uninsured motorists has been falling in recent years. Nationwide,  it dropped from 14.9 percent of drivers in 2003 to 12.6 percent in 2012, according to the research council. Compared with a few years ago, Schmid said the cost of auto insurance is less and more people are working, both of which persuade people to carry insurance. The CHP data also point to fewer uninsured motorists. It shows a significant drop in citations issued for drivers who failed to show proof of insurance in each of the past five years. Our ruling Assemblyman Luis Alejo says ""everyone on California’s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured."" This statement is clearly a dream, with no basis in fact. While indicators show the number of uninsured motorists is dropping, CHP officers are still very busy citing uninsured drivers. They wrote more than 66,000 tickets for uninsured drivers from January through August. Insurance experts call Alejo’s claim inaccurate and wishful thinking. They also strongly doubt the problem will ever be fully solved. We rate the claim Pants On Fire, which we define as a statement that is ""not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.""

Trump says 300,000 veterans died waiting VA care
","Donald Trump came to the U.S. Navy stronghold of Norfolk on Halloween afternoon to announce his plan to fix the ""disaster"" at the Department of Veterans Affairs. ""The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,"" Trump said at a rally in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin. ""Over 300,000 - and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now - over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care."" We decided to check Trump’s claim, which also has been made by Carly Fiorina, one of his rivals for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to our request for more information, but it’s a safe bet that his statement was based on a Sept. 2 report by the VA’s Office of Inspector General that denounced the agency’s record-keeping system as ""inadequate."" The inspector general’s investigation, as noted by The Washington Post’s Fact Checker in September, was triggered by whistleblower complaints about backlogs in providing services at the VA. The probe focused on operations at the agency’s Health Eligibility Center, which is described as the ""authoritative system for veterans’ health enrollment and eligibility information.""  It holds about 22.3 million records. The report found that as of Sept. 30, 2014, 866,879 records were listed as ""pending,"" a status given to VA applications that are incomplete - usually because they lack financial information. Of those records, 307,173 pertained to individuals who had been reported dead by the Social Security Administration. So there’s a basis for Trump’s number, but the figure is very complex. The report says the VA’s record-keeping was so shoddy that there’s no way of knowing how many of the 307,000 actually were waiting to be enrolled for VA health care when they died. The agency’s enrollment database was started in 1998 and includes pending files on veterans who died before that year, although the report does not say how many. The inspector general found, for example, that one veteran who died in 1988 still was listed with a pending VA application in 2014. Adding to the complication is that in 2013, the agency added into the entry center’s database ""millions"" of records from other arms of the VA. Many of these records ended up in the pending file, according to the report, but software glitches made it impossible for investigators to determine how many of the records pertained to veterans seeking health services. You have to remember that the VA provides many services, including home loans and disability payments. In some cases, it provides health care to family members of veterans; patients whose military service has not been confirmed; and people receiving humanitarian care. The report also notes that some of the pending files pertain to people inquiring about services rather than actually applying for them. The VA ""does not have a reliable method to distinguish which enrollment records were created in response to an enrollment application or records entered into (the database) by actions other than enrollment,"" the report says. Making matters worse, about 55 percent of the pending files are missing contact dates with the VA. The omissions make the database ""unreliable for monitoring timeliness or determine if a record represents a veteran’s intent to apply for VA health care,"" according to the report. The inspector general concluded, ""Most of the pending records are old and inactive and many of them were misclassified."" Our ruling ""Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care,"" Trump said in a Norfolk speech in which he promised to overhaul the VA. Trump offered the most dire possible interpretation of a scathing report on VA record-keeping and went well beyond what the inspector general was able to conclude. The report found that 307,173 dead people were listed last year on a VA database as having pending status with the agency. But shabby records make a detailed dissection of that number impossible. Investigators said that some of those people were not veterans; not all of them were seeking health care or necessarily any VA service; and some of them died before 1998, when the database began. No doubt, the VA is ripe for criticism. But Trump’s statement takes liberty with the facts, and we rate it Mostly False.","[('Donald Trump, Speech in Norfolk, (veterans comment at 48:00 mark), Oct. 31, 2015.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcJljz-Adko'), ('The Virginian-Pilot, ""Statistic Donald Trump referenced during Norfolk stop in question,"" Nov. 2, 2015.', 'No link'), ('The Washington Post Fact Checker, ""Carly Fiorina’s claim that 307,000 ‘died while waiting for health care,"" Sept. 21, 2015.', 'http://hamptonroads.com/2015/11/statistic-donald-trump-referenced-during-norfolk-stop-question#_ga=1.224854618.1564608178.1446481571'), ('U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, ""Important facts, context on the OIG report on VA’s health enrollment center,"" Sept. 3, 2015.', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, ""Review of alleged mismanagement at health eligibility center,"" Sept. 2, 2015.', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/21/carly-fiorinas-claim-that-307000-veterans-died-waiting-for-health-care/'), ('Trump campaign, ""Veterans Administration reforms that will make America great again,"" Oct. 31, 2015.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/09/donald-trump/trump-says-300000-veterans-dies-waiting-va-care/

Fact-checking Ben Carson's defense of his West Point scholarship story
","Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson stuck to his story about being offered a scholarship to West Point after a Politico article blasted him for ""fabricating"" the account. Carson has highlighted the offer to the prestigious military academy — allegedly made by Gen. William Westmoreland in 1969 when Carson was a ROTC student leader in Detroit — in his books and comments throughout the years. But Carson never applied to West Point nor does Westmoreland’s schedule place him in Detroit at the time Carson said he was, according to Politico. What’s more, there’s no such thing as a ""full scholarship"" to West Point, as everyone accepted to the five federal service academies receives free tuition in exchange for their service. When asked about discrepancy on ABC’s This Week by host George Stephanopoulos, Carson said the academy itself uses the terminology. ""Wait a minute George, go look on the West Point website, and you’ll see those specific words, ‘full scholarship to West Point,’ "" Carson said Nov. 8. ""So even though it is, you know, given as a grant for anybody who gets in, those words are used. And if a recruiter or somebody who’s trying to get you to come there or trying to get you to do that, those are the very words they will use. It’s on their website."" We wondered if the words really are advertised on West Point’s website. We could not reach the military academy. Searching for the ""specific words ‘full scholarship to West Point’"" turned up no results on West Point’s own website or on Google. The official admissions page also makes no mention of a scholarship of any kind. Instead, it simply notes that  tuition, room and board, and expenses are fully paid for those who are selected to attend West Point. The academy’s diversity page, however, states that ""this four-year college experience is a fully funded scholarship."" Carson’s spokesperson told us that West Point has referred to their benefits as a full scholarship in publications, a point Carson made in a Nov. 8 Facebook post. He uploaded two West Point recruitment ads targeted at African-Americans that contain the word ""scholarship,"" including one from the 1960s, when he was a student.   We also found examples of the words ""full scholarship"" used in publications that are linked on West Point’s website, as well as some old recruiting advertisements: • A dataset from 2014: ""At the United States Military Academy all students receive a full scholarship, including room & board and medical- and dental-care are provided by the U.S. Army."" • A prospectus from 2012: ""As a cadet, you are a member of the U.S. Army and receive a full scholarship and an annual salary of more than $10,000 from which you pay for your uniforms, textbooks, a laptop computer, and incidents."" • An ad in a 1991 issue of Black Enterprise magazine: ""Each year about 1,400 young men and women take advantage of the opportunity to attend West Point on a full government scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board and medical care. • An ad that appeared in a few issues of Ebony magazine in 1990: ""You receive a full scholarship, earn a degree from one of the country’s finest colleges, and build a foundation for a challenging career of service to the nation.""   The financial benefits to attending military academies have been essentially described as scholarship-like or equivalent to a scholarship by USA Today, a West Point spokesperson in Forbes, and the Naval Academy. But the term ""full scholarship"" is an inaccurate description, experts told us. The phrase typically refers to a college providing financial aid to allow a candidate to attend a college free of charge, but that doesn’t really apply to West Point’s across-the-board zero-tuition policy, said Antonio Buehler, a West Point alumnus who founded the admissions coaching service Abrome. ""No such scholarship is named, every cadet is treated the same and there is an eight-year military commitment after graduation. Hence, not free,"" Buehler said. The proper terminology is ""appointment,"" said Vu Tran, a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy who runs the Denver-based admissions consulting firm Service Academy Coach. But because that’s not apparent from the get-go, Tran says he can’t fault Carson for using the term loosely, albeit incorrectly. ""I can definitely see where parents and students who are beginning the process can misconstrue it to be a scholarship,"" he said. ""But for those who have gone through the admission process and through the nomination process, they would never call it a scholarship."" Carson’s use of the words ""full scholarship"" is even more inaccurate if he’s describing his own experience, experts agreed. Tran told us it’s conceivable a ROTC commander or even a general would encourage a student to apply to West Point, touting the free tuition, but noted that anyone familiar with the process understands that that’s contingent upon nomination and acceptance. ""(Carson) would not have been ‘offered’ the opportunity to attend West Point at no cost, like all other cadets, until he applied and received an appointment, which he never did,"" Buehler said. Our ruling Carson defended his use of the word scholarship in discussing his recruitment to West Point, saying, ""Go look on the West Point website and you’ll see those specific words, ‘full scholarship to West Point.’"" The military academy has used the words ""full scholarship"" a few times in admissions literature and advertisements and in one place on its website. However, experts say Carson’s use of the word scholarship doesn’t properly explain the application and appointment process to West Point. Carson’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. Correction: After this story was published, we found an additional instance of the words ""full scholarship"" on West Point’s website. The article has been updated to reflect that. The ruling remains Mostly True.","[('Politico, ""Exclusive: Carson claimed West Point \'scholarship\' but never applied,"" Nov. 6, 2015', 'http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben-carson-west-point-215598'), ('ABC, This Week, Nov. 8, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Doug Watts, spokesperson for Ben Carson, Nov. 8, 2015', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-ben-carson/story?id=35044135'), ('Email interview with Antonio Buehler, founder of Abrome, Nov. 8, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview with Vu Tran, consultant at Service Academy Coach, Nov. 8, 2015', 'https://www.facebook.com/realbencarson/posts/551602598339544'), ('Email interview with Peter Gray, pyschology professor at Boston College and Abrome adviser, Nov. 8, 2015', 'No link'), ('Search WestPoint.edu', 'https://books.google.com/books?id=Ql8CIGb9y5QC&pg=PA73&dq=Cadets+receive+a+four-year+scholarship,+which+includes+full+tuition,+room+and+$147.30+a+month+allowance.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIsfCSnLaByQIVS3E-Ch067ged#v=onepage&q=Cadets%20receive%20a%20four-year%20scholarship%2C%20which%20includes%20full%20tuition%2C%20room%20and%20%24147.30%20a%20month%20allowance.&f=false'), ('Google search', 'No link'), ('Facebook, Dr. Ben Carson added 2 new photos, Nov. 8, 2015', 'http://www.usma.edu/oir/common%20data%20set/common%20data%20set%202012-2013.pdf'), ('Ebony, June 1966', 'No link'), ('United States Military Academy, ""Common Data Set,"" 2013', 'http://www.westpoint.edu/admissions/shared%20documents/wp_prospectus.pdf'), ('West Point, ""Prospectus,"" Jun. 2012', 'No link'), ('Black Enterprise, Feb. 1991', 'https://books.google.com/books?id=GF4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT109&dq=%22the+opportunity+to+attend+West+Point+on+a+full+government+scholarship%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAGoVChMIq-Hl4YyByQIVyE0mCh3kTgx3#v=onepage&q=%22the%20opportunity%20to%20attend%20West%20Point%20on%20a%20full%20government%20scholarship%22&f=false'), ('Ebony, May 1990', 'No link'), ('Ebony, Feb. 1990', 'https://books.google.com/books?id=7NMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA20&dq=%22You+receive+a+full+scholarship,+earn+a+degree+from+one+of+the+country%E2%80%99s+finest+colleges,+and+build+a+foundation+for+a+challenging+career+of+service+to+the+nation%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAGoVChMIpIDFk46ByQIVRjUmCh10LQe8#v=onepage&q=%22You%20receive%20a%20full%20scholarship%2C%20earn%20a%20degree%20from%20one%20of%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20finest%20colleges%2C%20and%20build%20a%20foundation%20for%20a%20challenging%20career%20of%20service%20to%20the%20nation%22&f=false'), ('USA Today, ""Pride and patronage,"" Sept. 15, 2014', 'No link'), ('Forbes, ""The Colleges Where Tuition Is Still Free,"" June 12, 2013', 'https://books.google.com/books?id=p8wDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA141&dq=%22You+receive+a+full+scholarship,+earn+a+degree+from+one+of+the+country%E2%80%99s+finest+colleges,+and+build+a+foundation+for+a+challenging+career+of+service+to+the+nation%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAWoVChMIpIDFk46ByQIVRjUmCh10LQe8#v=onepage&q=%22You%20receive%20a%20full%20scholarship%2C%20earn%20a%20degree%20from%20one%20of%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20finest%20colleges%2C%20and%20build%20a%20foundation%20for%20a%20challenging%20career%20of%20service%20to%20the%20nation%22&f=false'), ('United States Naval Academy, ""Tuition and Financial Aid,"" accessed Nov. 8, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/08/ben-carson/carson-defends-west-point-scholarship-story/

Trump: 'My numbers on leadership, it’s two or three or four times higher than anybody else'
","Polls show that Americans think Donald Trump has the best leadership skills out of the 2016 candidates, according to the real estate mogul himself. On CNN’s State of the Union Nov. 8, host Jake Tapper asked Trump why voters should pick him to be their president. ""I’m the one who’s going to make this country great again,"" Trump responded, adding, ""When you do polls, and in fact when CNN does polls, you look at my numbers on leadership, it’s two and three and four times higher than anybody else."" With other candidates nipping at Trump’s heels in the polls -- notably retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson -- we wondered if it’s accurate that Trump is so far ahead on the question of which candidate would be the strongest leader. We went through all of the national Republican primary polls collected by Real Clear Politics, from May through November (about 50 polls). We found only a handful that surveyed people about candidates’ leadership qualities, and just one that asked respondents to compare candidates in terms of leadership. As far as polling goes, that’s a fairly small sample. But Trump does have a point. Here’s what we found: Washington Post/ABC poll, conducted Oct. 15-18 This poll asked Republican-leaning respondents who among six candidates is the strongest leader. Nearly half of respondents -- 47 percent -- selected Trump. Twelve percent said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (11 percent), Carson (9 percent), Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (8 percent), and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (6 percent). This poll comes the closest to matching Trump’s talking point: Nearly four times as many respondents said Trump is the strongest leader compared to Bush, the candidate with the next-highest results. However, this is the only poll we could find that asks people to choose the best leader among several candidates. Trump led the Washington Post/ABC poll overall with 32 percent support; Carson was second with 21 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, released Nov. 1 This poll asked, ""Would you say that (candidate) has strong leadership qualities or not?"" When presented this question about Trump, 60 percent of respondents answered ""yes"" -- the highest percentage of yes answers.   Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed, each receiving 56 percent. Rubio and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., each received 48 percent. Carson got 47, and Cruz got the lowest with 45 percent. CBS News poll, released Oct. 11 CBS asked Republican voters about various qualities held by the three outsider candidates: Trump, Carson and Fiorina. Among respondents, 84 percent said Trump has strong qualities of leadership. Carson followed, at 72 percent, and 60 percent said Fiorina has strong leadership qualities. Quinnipiac poll, released Sept. 24 Like the other Quinnipiac poll, this one asked, ""Would you say that (candidate) has strong leadership qualities or not?"" When presented this question about Trump, 58 percent of respondents answered ""yes"" -- the highest percentage of yes answers.   Clinton followed, receiving 55 percent. Next was Vice President Joe Biden (54 percent), Bush (52 percent), Fiorina (52 percent), Carson (48 percent), and Sanders (45 percent). (Quinnipiac has released a few other polls that ask this question over the past few months, with similar results.) What about that CNN poll Trump specifically mentioned a CNN poll, but searching through Real Clear Politics’ collection and on the CNN website, we couldn’t find one that asked about leadership qualities. We also reached out to Trump’s campaign but didn’t hear back. Our ruling Trump said that in polls about 2016 candidate leadership skills, he comes out ""two and three and four times higher than anybody else."" Only a few polls so far have asked about candidates’ leadership qualities, but Trump has a point that he usually comes out on top. One poll in particular supported Trump’s claim: Compared to the candidate with the next-highest results, about four times as many people said Trump had the best leadership skills among a group of candidates. But that was just one poll. Most polls have asked respondents to say whether each individual candidate has strong leadership qualities -- not comparing the candidates against each other. In these polls, Trump beats out his opponents by a handful of percentage points, not two, three or four times higher. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.","[('CNN, State of the Union, Nov. 8, 2015', 'http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html#polls'), ('Real Clear Politics, Republican primary 2016 polls database, accessed Nov. 8, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/08/donald-trump/trump-my-numbers-leadership-its-two-or-three-or-fo/

Ben Carson's Pants on Fire claim that no signer of the Declaration of Independence held office
","Ben Carson -- currently the top-polling Republican presidential candidate -- posted a message on Facebook on Nov. 4 to rebut critics who say his lack of experience in elected office would be a serious obstacle to his serving as an effective president. Soon after it was posted, we began hearing from readers asking us to check one of his claims. ""You are absolutely right — I have no political experience,"" Carson wrote in the initial version of his post. ""The current Members of Congress have a combined 8,700 years of political experience. Are we sure political experience is what we need. Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience. What they had was a deep belief that freedom is a gift from God. They had a determination to rise up against a tyrannical King. They were willing to risk all they had, even their lives, to be free."" After our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed Carson’s claim that ""every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience"" and gave it Four Pinocchios -- the column’s worst rating -- the quote was changed. It now reads, ""Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience"" (emphasis added). We were already looking into Carson’s initial Facebook comment when the wording change was made. We’ll address both versions here. The signers had 'no elected office experience' Many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had held elective office before joining the Continental Congress, which produced the declaration. We found a long list, so take a deep breath before you start reading. They include: • John Adams. Elected to Massachusetts Assembly, 1770; attended First Continental Congress, 1774-1776. • Thomas Jefferson. Represented Albemarle County as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses, 1769-1775 • Benjamin Franklin. Philadelphia councilman, 1748; elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly, 1751. • John Hancock. Elected to the Boston Assembly, 1766; president of the provincial congress of Massachusetts, c. 1773; elected to the Continental Congress, 1774, and then president of the congress in 1775. • Samuel Adams. Elected to Massachusetts Assembly, 1765; delegate to the First Continental Congress, 1774. • Elbridge Gerry. Elected to Massachusetts Legislature, 1773; provincial Congress, 1774. • Roger Sherman. Elected to Connecticut General Assembly, representing New Milford, 1755-1758 and 1760-1761; elected to various offices representing New Haven in the 1760s and 1770s; elected to the Continental Congress starting in 1774. • Caesar Rodney. Elected to Delaware Colonial Assembly, 1758-1770 and 1771-1776; delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; elected to the Continental Congress, 1774. • George Taylor. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1764-69; elected to Continental Congress, 1775. • John Morton. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1756-1775; delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; president of the provincial assembly, 1775. • George Ross. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1768-1776; Elected to Continental Congress, 1774. • James Wilson. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial congress, 1775; elected to the Continental Congress, 1775. • Thomas McKean. Member of the Delaware Assembly, 1762-79; Delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1774. • Matthew Thornton. Member of the New Hampshire provincial assembly, 1758-1762. • William Whipple. Elected to New Hampshire provincial congress, 1775 and 1776. • Stephen Hopkins. Speaker of the Rhode Island Assembly,1750s; member of the Continental Congress beginning in 1774. • Lewis Morris. Member of New York provincial legislature; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1775. • Philip Livingston. Alderman, New York City. • Carter Braxton. Virginia House of Burgesses, 1770-1785; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1774-75. • Thomas Nelson Jr. Member of the House of Burgesses, 1774; Virginia provincial convention, 1775. • Francis Lightfoot Lee. Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses 1758-1775; elected to Continental Congress, 1775. • Benjamin Harrison. Elected to Virginia House of Burgesses, 1764; member of the Continental Congress, 1774. • George Wythe. Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, 1755-65. • William Hooper. Elected to general assembly of North Carolina, 1773; member of Continental Congress, 1774-1776. • Joseph Hewes. Member of the colonial assembly of North Carolina, 1766-1775; member of new provincial assembly, 1775; elected to Continental Congress, 1774. • John Hart. Member of the New Jersey Assembly, 1761-1771; member of provincial assembly, 1775; elected to the Continental Congress, 1776. • William Williams. Town clerk, selectman, provincial representative, elected state legislator, delegate to colonial conferences, 1770s. • William Paca. Delegate to the Maryland Legislature, 1771; elected to Continental Congress, 1774. That’s at least 28 of the 56 signers -- about half, and we were conservative in who we counted. The real number may be higher. Either way, Carson’s original claim, that ""every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience,"" is way, way off. The signers had 'no federal elected office experience' The edit Carson made to the Facebook post doesn’t help his case, since there was no federal government before the Declaration of Independence was signed. This makes his entire claim illogical, experts say, ""Of course they did not have federal elected office experience because there was no federal government at the time -- we were a British colony,"" said Michael Gerhardt, scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center and professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina. ""It does not make sense to use the term ‘federal’ when no federal government existed,"" agreed Danielle Allen, a political theorist and author of Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality. ""The signers of the declaration very often had leading political experience in their colony or, as they called them, in their ‘countries.’ "" Jan Lewis, a professor of history at Rutgers University-Newark and the author of The Pursuit of Happiness: Family and Values in Jefferson’s Virginia, finds Carson’s claim ridiculous. ""It makes about as much sense as saying none of them had been to the moon,"" Lewis said. ""Of course they hadn't, because it was an impossibility at that time. No one could possibly serve in the federal government before there was a federal government, at least in the absence of time travel."" Carson’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Both the initial and the revised versions of Carson’s claim are far off base. About half or more of the declaration’s signers had held elective office previously, a reality that severely undercuts Carson’s overall point that the drafting of the Declaration of Independence showed how a lack of political experience can produce landmark political achievements. As for his later addition of ""federal"" to the comment, this makes the claim nonsensical, since there was no federal government prior to the signing of the declaration. We rate Carson’s claim Pants on Fire.  ","[('Ben Carson, Facebook post, Nov. 4, 2015', 'https://www.facebook.com/realbencarson/posts/549786315187839'), ('USHistory.org, Signers of the Declaration of Independence, accessed Nov. 6, 2015', 'No link'), ('Washington Post Fact Checker, ""Ben Carson’s absurd notion that the Founding Fathers had ‘no elected office experience,’ "" Nov. 5, 2015', 'http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/Signers/index.htm'), ('Email interview with Emily Sneff, research manager of the Declaration Resources Project at Harvard University, Nov. 6, 2015', 'No link'), (""Email interview with Andrew J.

Rick Santorum claims he's the only candidate who doesn't support amnesty
","Presidential candidate Rick Santorum cast himself as the only candidate in the 15-person Republican field who opposes legal status for undocumented immigrants. ""I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty,"" Santorum said during remarks at the Republican Party of Iowa’s Growth and Opportunity Party event on Oct. 31. ""Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here in one form or another."" Of the 15 candidates in a GOP race that has focused heavily on immigration, is Santorum really the only one who’s ""against"" amnesty? As previous fact checks on similar statements have noted, ""amnesty"" is a tough word to define, and can mean different things to different people. Santorum offers a pretty succinct definition in his statement, though, by noting that other candidates would ""allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another."" In a follow-up email, a campaign staffer said Santorum defines amnesty as ""providing legal status to illegal immigrants."" Fellow presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made similar statements, which we’ve previously found to be Mostly True. Santorum’s statement differs in important ways, however. In August and again in September, Cruz said ""a majority"" of GOP candidates have supported amnesty — wording that acknowledges some candidates’ views may have shifted over time. Santorum, by contrast, asserts that every other candidate currently supports an immigration policy that could be defined as amnesty. That’s a much higher standard — and a harder one to support. Let’s review each candidate individually, starting with those who have clearly indicated support for citizenship or legal status that meets Santorum’s definition of amnesty: Jeb Bush: The former Florida governor has made clear that he supports immigration reform that would provide legal status to the millions of undocumented people currently living in the U.S. Marco Rubio: The Florida senator was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight who pursued comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship. He has since taken more hardline views on immigration but still supports legal status for undocumented people currently living in the U.S. Lindsey Graham: The senator from South Carolina was also a member of the ""Gang of Eight"" who led efforts to pass immigration reform in 2013, and supports a pathway to citizenship. Carly Fiorina: The former Hewlett-Packard CEO said in June that she was open to legal status for the undocumented. John Kasich: The Ohio governor has said he ""doesn’t like the idea of citizenship"" but believes it may be necessary. George Pataki: The former New York governor supports legal-resident status for undocumented immigrants who have no criminal history and agree to 200 hours of community service. Jim Gilmore: The former Virginia governor supports legal status allowing undocumented immigrants to work in the United States, but opposes a pathway to citizenship. Other candidates supported citizenship or legal status in the past, but have tempered or reversed their views since entering the presidential race: Rand Paul: In 2013, the Kentucky senator told undocumented immigrants in a speech that ""We will find a place for you"" and implied (according to the New York Times) that he supported a pathway to citizenship. In more recent presidential campaign materials, though, Paul states that he ""opposes amnesty"" and believes the U.S.-Mexico border must be ""secured"" before ""issuing any visas or starting the legal immigration process."" Mike Huckabee: The former Arkansas governor has indicated support for a pathway to citizenship in the past, but used much tougher rhetoric this year, stating that he opposes ""amnesty"" and is unwilling discuss legal status until the border is secure. Chris Christie: In 2010, the New Jersey governor plainly said he supported a path to citizenship. Last May, however, he said he opposed a pathway to legal status. Donald Trump: Trump’s views on immigration have evolved over time, but his position now is among the toughest in the GOP field. He reportedly was supportive of the DREAM Act in a 2013 meeting with immigration activists and said just last July that he could support a ""merit-based"" system for allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. Since then, though, he’s advocated for deporting all of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the country. Finally, in direct contradiction to Santorum’s claim, some candidates have simply never supported amnesty as his campaign defines it. Ben Carson: In a 2014 op-ed in National Review, the retired neurosurgeon proposed a guest-worker program for immigrants, but said all participants would have to apply from outside the United States — meaning undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. would have to leave and apply to re-enter. Bobby Jindal: Despite an op-ed endorsing legal status in 2013, the Louisiana governor has repeatedly refused to take a position on the millions of undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S since becoming a presidential candidate. He argues that the border must be secured before devising a policy to address those already living here. Ted Cruz. He has repeatedly stated that he’s the only candidate in the race who has never supported amnesty – statements that have been found to be Mostly True. Cruz voted against the 2013 Senate immigration bill and opposed a 2014 House proposal to grant more limited legal status to undocumented immigrants. Correspondence with Santorum’s campaign team makes clear his statement was aimed at drawing a contrast with Cruz, who’s lately been gaining momentum in the GOP race. A Santorum aide pointed to a series of amendments Cruz offered to the 2013 reform bill, which laid out additional conditions for granting legal status to those who are undocumented. Among other measures, those amendments removed the bill’s pathway to citizenship and made it more challenging for undocumented residents to receive legal status. Santorum’s campaign says those amendments amount to support for amnesty, but they could just as easily be read as efforts to weaken the bill and undermine the amnesty measures it contained. Our ruling Santorum said, ""I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty. Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another."" While it’s true that seven of 15 GOP candidates currently support policies that meet Santorum’s definition of ""amnesty,"" four candidates who once supported such policies no longer do, and two more have consistent records of opposition. The last, Jindal, hasn’t outlined his position. We rate Santorum’s claim False. ","[('Wall Street Journal, ""Jeb Bush Says He Has a ‘Grown-Up’ Immigration Plan,"" March 13, 2015', 'http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/03/13/jeb-bush-says-he-has-a-grown-up-immigration-plan/'), ('Politico, ""Rubio veers right in latest immigration twist,"" Oct. 20, 2015', 'No link'), ('The Hill, ""Graham to GOP: Don\'t be \'delusional\' about immigration reform,"" June 15, 2014', 'http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/marco-rubio-immigration-sanctuary-cities-214931'), ('The Washington Times, ""Carly Fiorina is open to legal status for adult illegal immigrants, citizenship for their kids,"" June 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('Politico Magazine, ""The Real GOP Split on Immigration,"" Jan. 14, 2015', 'http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/209421-graham-to-gop-dont-be-delusional-about-immigration'), ('CNN, ""Pataki challenges Trump to debate on immigration, as Trump slams critics,"" July 8, 2015', 'No link'), ('Jim Gilmore campaign website, ""Immigration and Border Enforcement""', 'https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/15/carly-fiorina-open-legal-status-adult-illegal-immi/'), ('The New York Times, ""G.O.P.

Clearing the air over marijuana support
","Gallup pollsters took the nation’s pulse on marijuana legalization in October and the findings led supporters of legal pot use to declare victory. ""It’s pretty clear which direction our nation is heading on this issue,"" Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a news release. ""The status quo has shifted. Marijuana prohibition has been a public policy disaster, and most Americans are ready to put it behind us and move on."" We started our fact checking with Gallup’s recent report to see if it really does show that a majority of Americans support legalization. Just the title of the report — ""In U.S., 58 percent back legal marijuana use"" — gave us a pretty clear sign that it does. ""Americans’ support for legalizing marijuana is the highest Gallup has measured to date, at 58 percent,"" the report concludes. ""Younger generations of Americans,"" Gallup says, ""have been increasingly likely to favor legal use of marijuana as they entered adulthood compared with older generations of Americans when they were the same age decades ago. Now more than seven in 10 of today’s young adults support legalization."" The 58 percent figure represents the percentage of 1,015 people who answered ""Yes,"" when they were asked, ""Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?"" The percent of Americans who support legalization first hit 58 percent in 2013, dipped to 51 percent in 2014 and rebounded back to 58 percent in 2015, according to Gallup. ""Over the past six years, support has vacillated a bit, but averaged 48 percent from 2010 through 2012 and has averaged above majority level, 56 percent, since 2013,"" says the report. The poll was conducted Oct. 7 to Oct. 11, just before leading Democrats faced off in a presidential nomination debate televised by CNN on Oct. 13. During that exchange, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed their views on marijuana legalization. Clinton laughed, at the debate, when she was reminded that about a year ago she had told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that she didn’t smoke marijuana when she was young and has no intention of starting now. Clinton said ""No"" when she was asked if she is ready ""to take a position"" on legalization. But she said she’s interested in learning more about legalization from states that have approved recreational marijuana use. For his part, Sanders said he would vote for a local Nevada measure that would legalize recreational pot use. He has proposed removing marijuana from the federal government’s list of most dangerous outlawed drugs, according to the Washington Post. The same Gallup report says Democrats and independents are the ""most likely"" of ""political groups"" to favor legalization while Republicans and older Americans are least likely to support it. Late last week, Republican Donald Trump, speaking at a rally, said states should be allowed to legalize marijuana if they choose to do so, according to the Post. This was a softer stance on the subject for Trump, who says he doesn’t drink or smoke tobacco. Two of the other leading Republican candidates are holding the line. Republican, Marco Rubio would enforce federal law against states that have legalized marijuana use. And Republican Ben Carson, who is leading in the polls, is a retired neurosurgeon who staunchly opposes legalization. Many studies, he says, show marijuana has a harmful effect on a brain as it develops, which continues into a person’s late twenties. ""So why would we even think about it?"" he asked. ""This should be completely off the table."" Our ruling Gallup’s survey has found that a ""majority"" of Americans support marijuana legalization. It’s been a trend that a few of the candidates for president have reflected in their campaigns. Tvert got it right. The statement is True.  ","[('MPP.org, Marijuana Policy Project, ""New Gallup Poll Finds 58% Support Making Marijuana Legal,"" Oct. 21, 2015, accessed Oct. 27, 2015', 'https://www.mpp.org/news/press/new-gallup-poll-finds-58-support-making-marijuana-legal/'), ('Gallup.com, ""In U.S. 58 percent back legal marijuana use,"" Oct. 21, 2015, accessed Nov. 2.', 'No link'), ('CNN.com, ""On Marijuana, what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would do,"" Oct. 14, 2015, accessed Nov. 2, 2015.', 'http://www.gallup.com/poll/186260/back-legal-marijuana.aspx'), ('WashingtonPost.com, ""Trump softens position on marijuana legalization,"" Oct. 29, 2015, accessed Nov. 2, 2015.', 'No link'), ('ABCNews.go.com, ""Ben Carson on why his perspective as a black man is important to the GOP,"" Feb. 26, 2015, accessed Nov. 3, 2015.', 'https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/13/politics/pot-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/'), ('TampaBay.com, ""Rubio says he would use federal law to crack down on marijuana,"" Aug. 10, 2015, accessed Nov. 3, 2015.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/08/mason-tvert/clearing-air-over-marijuana-support/

Greg Abbott, embarrassed, says Californians buying more new guns this year than Texans
","Greg Abbott is embarrassed? So the Texas governor said in this October 2015 tweet: ""I'm EMBARRASSED: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA. Let's pick up the pace Texans."" Can’t be right. Right? It wasn’t. Abbott’s tweet linked to a news blog post in which the Houston Chronicle reported that while the number of requests to buy firearms in Texas had topped 1 million for the year, the Lone Star State still trailed California in such requests, according to the FBI. The post drew on FBI counts, all right, but the agency doesn’t track the number of firearms purchased in each state. When we asked spokesman Stephen Fischer about such detail, he emailed us a link to the agency web page tallying requests made by firearms dealers through the National Instant Criminal Background Check system known as NICS to determine whether a person should be disqualified from buying a gun based on a range of matters, such as prior criminal history to mental health. A footnote to the chart says: ""These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale."" That’s a big caveat. Background checks in 2015 Still, let’s see how the requests for instant background checks have been stacking up. From January through October 2015, the most background checks were submitted from Kentucky — 2.6 million such requests. California was next, with 1.3 million, and then Texas, with nearly 1.2 million checks. Adjusting for population We recognized another way to evaluate how each of the 10 states with the most requests for background checks stack up: Adjust for population. Drawing on U.S. census estimates of each state’s population as of July 2014, we found that Kentucky led nationally through the first 10 months of 2015 by generating nearly 0.6 requests for background checks per resident. States lagging far behind included Alabama and Indiana (0.1 requests per resident); Tennessee, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio (less than 0.1 requests per resident) and Texas and Florida (0.04 requests per resident). We found California ranking last in this subgroup (0.03 requests per resident). Guns purchased without background checks A wrinkle: Any estimate of gun purchases by state is hindered by the unknown number of private purchases or gifts of guns not preceded by background checks. A 1997 study occasionally is invoked to suggest 40 percent of gun sales don’t involve background checks. That’s not a correct reading of the study, PolitiFact has noted. Also, one of the researchers has since said it’s not known how many purchases occur without background checks. We asked Abbott’s office about his claim and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Abbott said: ""Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA."" Hold fire: The FBI counsels against using requests for instant background checks to estimate gun purchases, which was Abbott’s basis for his statement. Besides that, Texas ranked third behind Kentucky and California in the number of checks requested for gun purchases through the first 10 months of 2015. Adjust for population and among the 10 states with the most requested background checks, Texas tied with Florida for 8th place with both states and seven others accounting for more per-capita requests for background checks than California.

It would take Taylor Swift 3 years to pay one day's debt interest, state GOP says
","Pop superstar Taylor Swift is known for being generous to her fans. But is she charitable enough to help Washington pay interest on the national debt?  The #squad at the Republican Party of Florida asked (and answered) the question with a viral image on their Facebook page on Oct. 29, 2015, the same week Swift was in the Sunshine State for concerts in Miami and Tampa. ""How many concerts would Taylor Swift have to perform to pay off one day of interest on our national debt? She would have to perform every day for three years,"" the post read. We just couldn’t shake it off. We wondered, would it take three years or more for the biggest pop star in the country to pay off the interest on the national debt, playing a concert every single night? We checked to see if it would be possible, even in our wildest dreams. Because there’s no telling just how much Swift is personally raking in these days (beyond, you know, a lot), there’s going to be a lot of estimating here, possibly a blank space or two. But we do know the national debt is up over the $18 trillion mark these days, so she’s got her work cut out for her. Just so we didn’t cause any bad blood, we reached out to the state GOP and asked them how they were figuring Swift’s tour schedule through 2019. They credited the stat to the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. We noted the original version was slightly different: ""How long would it take Taylor Swift to pay off our debt? Forbes estimates that T. Swift earned around $80 million in 2015 and performed 55 concerts. She would have to perform every day for three years to pay for one day of interest that accrued on our debt."" They also point out how hard other big names would have to work, like boxer Floyd Mayweather having to fight for every night for 331 years or Bill Gates having to fork over 229 lifetimes’ worth of personal income to pay the same bill. The foundation told us they figured out Swift’s workload by calculating that she took home 28.6 percent of the gross receipts from her March 2013-June 2014 Red Tour, then stretched it out as if she played for 365 nights straight. That ends up being $526,000 per show, or $192 million for a whole year of Swift concerts (and a whole lot of Instagrams). So how much is the daily interest on our national debt? Heritage used the 2015 estimate for interest from the Office of Management and Budget, which was $229.2 billion for the year. One day of that is $628 million. Break that down and Swift would have to play every night for just more than 3¼ years to pay for one measly day of interest on an $18 trillion debt. Now, the Heritage Foundation told us they used the Red Tour because it has a full net estimate. But we here at PolitiFact Florida always like to note when everything has changed. Swift is a megawatt star these days, and she has been practically printing money since this year’s 1989 World Tour began. The tour topped $185 million between May and mid October. That’s about about 60 shows, give or take, with 20-plus to go until Swift can take a breather. Forbes and Billboard do generally use a third of gross receipts as a rough guideline — remember, those tours have to pay for all sorts of things besides the artist, like sets and costumes and roadies. The $80 million Forbes estimate for June 2014-June 2015 is hard to parse, because it includes all income, which could range from t-shirts to albums to streaming royalties. We’ll note it’s really not possible to say what she makes from any given show, because every venue is different. The tour stood to make $2.75 million from her Halloween show in Tampa, with a $928,000 bonus if the show sold out. (We can’t confirm whether it did, but reports make it sound like it came close.) In any case, we figure these days it's fair to say Tay Tay is worth closer to a very rough average of $1 million per show, especially when she's playing bigger arenas. That would really help her put a dent in the nation’s outstanding bills. We could also cheat with some creative bookkeeping and use data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which puts 2015 debt interest at a slightly lower $223.3 billion. That works out to $612 million per day. Do the simple math and our estimate knocks Swift’s theoretical slate of shows down to about 612 nights. That’s a little over 1½ years of concerts. But there’s always the chance she wouldn’t want to fork over all her earnings for the interest payments. She could use a little walking around money, you know? Also, she needs a little time to go home to cats Meredith Grey and Olivia Benson. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida asked, ""How many concerts would Taylor Swift have to perform to pay off one day of interest on our national debt? She would have to perform every day for three years."" This viral image was inspired by the Heritage Foundation, and while their math is based on old estimates, it stands up to scrutiny. We’ll note that Swift likely makes a lot more money these days, so she could probably pay the bill faster. But the point that it would take an inordinate amount of time to pay just a single day’s interest on the $18 trillion-plus national debt stands. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('Republican Party of Florida, Facebook post, Oct. 29, 2015', 'https://www.facebook.com/FloridaGOP/photos/a.10150146318989480.285082.10766454479/10153372282264480/?type=3&theater'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""The Legacy of Debt: Interest Costs Poised to Surpass Defense and Nondefense Discretionary Spending,"" Feb. 3, 2015', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Taylor Swift and Hillsborough taxpayers may benefit from Halloween show,"" March 29, 2015', 'http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/02/03/the-legacy-of-debt-interest-costs-poised-to-surpass-defense-and-nondefense-discretionary-spending/'), ('Billboard, ""Taylor Swift\'s 1989 Tour Has Earned $17 Million… And Counting,"" June 11, 2015', 'No link'), ('Forbes, ""Taylor Swift\'s Earnings: $80 Million In 2015,"" June 29, 2015', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/taylor-swift-and-hillsborough-taxpayers-may-benefit-from-halloween-show/2223358'), ('Billboard, ""Taylor Swift\'s 1989 Tour: $86 Million Grossed (And Counting),"" Aug. 5, 2015', 'No link'), ('Billboard, ""Taylor Swift\'s \'1989 World Tour\': $173 Million Grossed So Far,"" Oct. 14, 2015', 'https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6597763/taylor-swifts-1989-tour-hot-tours-chart'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Taylor Swift Halloween concert at Raymond James Stadium having no trouble making profit,"" Oct. 16, 2015', 'No link'), ('Daily Signal, ""How Many Concerts Would Taylor Swift Have to Perform to Pay Off One Day’s Interest on the Debt?,"" Oct. 28, 2015', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2015/06/29/taylor-swifts-earnings-80-million-in-2015/'), ('Billboard, ""Maroon 5\'s World Tour Has Grossed $71 Million...

Website says Texas legislation allows teachers to kill students if 'they felt it was needed'
","A reader asked us to look into an article headlined: ""This new bill would allow Texas teachers to kill their students if they felt it was needed."" Good thing Texas lawmakers are no longer in session, eh? The article, posted in February 2015 on a website called the Greenville Gazette, said the Teacher’s Protection Act ""would allow teachers to use deadly force on school property, a school bus, or at an event sponsored by a school either in self-defense or defense of students at the school."" Use of force in the classroom has made headlines. On Oct. 28, 2015, most recently, a school resource officer in South Carolina was fired after a video surfaced of him throwing a female high school student on the ground.   So, was there a proposed act permitting Texas teachers to kill their students if necessary? The Teacher’s Protection Act No one at the Gazette responded to us. But a web search led us to a proposed Teacher’s Protection Act. State Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Van, filed House Bill 868 on Jan. 22, 2015 but it didn’t advance into law or draw a hearing; the last action shown in legislative records was its referral to the House Public Education Committee on March 4, 2015. The bill says: ""An educator is justified in using force or deadly force on school property, on a school bus, or at a school-sponsored event in defense of the educator’s person or in defense of students of the school that employs the educator if (he or she) reasonably believes"" themselves to be ""justified under"" sections 9.31, 9.32, 9.33 and 9.43 of the Texas Penal Code. Those sections establish that a person can use force or deadly force against another in self defense or in defense of property if the person ""reasonably believes"" it to be ""immediately necessary."" Under the legislation, a teacher would be shielded from from criminal and civil charges ""for injury or death that results from the educator’s use of force or deadly force."" While the measure didn’t specify a teacher could kill a student, we asked Flynn if it left that option open. By phone, Flynn said that was not his intent. ""That’s a ridiculous statement,"" he said. ""It totally mischaracterizes the bill."" Flynn said the proposal’s purpose was to protect any teacher from facing criminal or civil charges for defending himself or herself against a student assault. ""You hear all the time,"" Flynn said, ""that teachers are getting broken noses, being slapped, being pushed around, being taken to the floor by overzealous students who know that they can do it without fear of reprisal."" He did not provide specific examples. Asked about the legislation permitting a teacher to use ""deadly force,"" Flynn said he used the same language that otherwise broadly appears in existing law, perhaps referring to the penal code provisions permitting a person to use force or deadly force against another in self defense or in defense of property if the person ""reasonably believes"" it to be ""immediately necessary."" Call in the lawyers Next, we asked lawyers by phone to appraise the proposal: Would it allow Texas teachers to kill their students if they felt it was necessary? All four said Flynn’s proposal would allow a teacher to kill a student, but only if the action was justified under the existing penal code conditions—a limit stressed by Shannon Edmonds of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association and Sam Bassett, president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. Edmonds and Bassett also said teachers may currently use deadly force in keeping with the penal code, though attorney Paul Tapp of the Association of Texas Professional Educators suggested Texas teachers cannot yet typically use deadly force. Tapp pointed us to section 9.62 of Texas Penal Code, which says teachers can use ""force, but not deadly force"" to ""maintain discipline in a group."" After surveying the lawyers, we followed up with Flynn, who maintained that his proposal was not redundant and that teachers are currently not protected from prosecution. He cited ""bad press and a lack of understanding about what we’re trying to accomplish"" as reasons for the bill not advancing and he said he plans to offer a version of the measure afresh in the 2017 legislative session. Our ruling The website declared: ""This new bill would allow Texas teachers to kill their students if they felt it was needed."" This statement is partially accurate in that a bill was introduced in 2015 to give teachers greater legal protection if deadly force were employed against a student. But saying that it would ""allow Texas teachers to kill their students if they felt it was needed"" is a stretch that suggests that the bill would allow teachers to just start firing away.   We rate this claim, which lacks this context, Half True.

Critics argued that the moves were partisan and that the Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican governor wanted to block Democrats and churches from geting out the vote. Dubbed ""Souls to the Polls,"" Democratic-friendly groups sometimes bussed voters to election sites on that final Sunday.

And getting rid of that final Sunday affects minorities, said U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville.

""Statistics show that in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33.2 percent of those who voted early on the last Sunday before Election Day were African-American, while 23.6 percent were Hispanic,"" Brown wrote in a June 15 press release.

Brown’s precise percentages caught our attention, so we decided to check out her numbers.

Florida's voting rules

First, a little background: Early voting started in Florida in 2004. It expanded traditional Election Day voting to include early voting sites. Starting in 2002, Floridians could also request a ""no excuse"" absentee ballot, so anyone could vote by mail for any reason.

In 2011, the Florida Legislature passed a new law (HB 1355) that made a variety of changes to rules for early voting. The legislation cut the number of days of early voting from 14 to eight, and it eliminated voting the final Sunday before Election Day. In 2012, that means that Floridians can early vote Sunday, Oct. 28, but not Nov. 4 -- two days before Election Day.

We should point out that early voting on the final Sunday was never required. Instead, it was an option for counties, and  only about 10 of 67 took advantage of it in 2008, including some counties with higher minority populations.

Smaller counties generally chose not to have early voting on Sundays, because officials figured people were attending church or spending time with their families rather than going to vote, said Vicki Davis, Supervisor of Elections in Martin County and now president of the statewide association of election supervisors.

When legislators decided to get rid of early voting on the final Sunday, some county officials were disappointed, while others wanted that last Sunday to prepare for Election Day, she said.

The state is required to get federal approval for any changes in voting law for five counties that have had historical voting problems, including Hillsborough County. The state has sought approval from a federal three-judge panel in Washington and several voting rights’ groups have filed objections with the court. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law has argued on the side that claims that the law will disproportionally harm minority voters. None of the five pre-clearance counties offered early voting on that final Sunday in 2008.

Researchers examined the race of voters on the final Sunday

Brown’s spokesman said that the statistics about minority voting on the final Sunday came from the NAACP, and we found several researchers have cited similar statistics to Brown’s claim.

They arrive at those numbers by obtaining statewide early vote data and then matching voters’ information with registration records which list self-reported race and ethnicity.

Here is what professors and lawyers found for who voted early on Sunday Nov. 2, 2008

The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law:
• African-American: 33.2 percent
• Hispanic: 23.6 percent

The Brennan Center was focused on the impact of minorities and didn’t list a percentage for whites. 

University of Florida political science professor Daniel A Smith and Michael Herron, professor of government at Dartmouth:

• Whites: 40 percent
• African American: 34 percent
• Hispanics: 24 percent
• Asian: 2 percent

""We find that Democratic, African-American, Hispanic, younger, and first-time voters were
disproportionately likely to vote early in 2008 and in particular on weekends, including the final Sunday of early voting,"" wrote the professors in a paper. 
Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School:
• White: 37.2 percent
• African-American: 31.5 percent
• Hispanic: 22.4 percent
• Unknown: 5.1 percent
• Other: 3.8 percent

Levitt told us in an email that those percentages represent conservative estimates: Voters of unknown race or ethnicity were treated for purposes of this analysis as white.

The three sets of research reached similar conclusions for the turnout on the final Sunday of early voting: About one-third were black and about one-quarter were Hispanic.

That’s higher than their representation in the overall electorate that year: Blacks comprised 13 percent of total voters and Hispanics 11 percent, Levitt wrote.

Other perspective on the Sunday law

Chris Cate, a spokesman for the state Division of Elections, said in an email that, ""Advocates of Sunday voting should actually favor the new law because it requires a day of Sunday voting, which the previous law did not."" The required Sunday voting is about a week and a half before Election Day -- not the final Sunday.

Cate said he didn’t have data on voting by race for only the final Sunday of early voting in 2008. However he pointed to statistics cited in the pre-clearance case that looked at voter turnout by race or ethnicity for the days that have since been repealed -- including that final Sunday -- compared to the remaining days. The data showed that whites comprised the largest group of early voters and that more whites, African-Americans and Hispanics voted on the remaining days than the repealed ones leading the state to argue that ""shortening the early voting period will have no discriminatory effect on account of race or ethnicity.""

It's no surprise that more whites used early voting than minorities, though, because whites make up the largest share of the state’s voters.

Our ruling 
Brown said that ""Statistics show that in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33.2 percent of those who voted early on the last Sunday before Election Day were African-American, while 23.6 percent were Hispanic.""

She used that statistic to predict that changes to voting law will disproportionately impact minorities. The law’s proponents predict that it won’t, and that minorities will avail themselves of other days and times for early voting.

We can’t settle that argument. But we did check the numbers Brown cited. Those numbers are backed up by sound research from multiple sources. We rate her claim True.","[('\nU.S. \xa0Rep.

Barca says voters aren’t fully behind Walker -- 70 percent were just uncomfortable with a recall
","
In the wake of the failed effort to unseat Gov. Scott Walker at mid-term, top Wisconsin Democrats insisted the June 5, 2012, election results were not an endorsement of the Republican governor’s political agenda.

At the party’s convention, Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, put it this way:

""The GOP is engaging in pure folly if they misread this election to think that the electorate of Wisconsin is fully behind this Walker agenda,"" Barca said. ""Because 70 percent of the people who voted just didn’t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor.""

He added: ""After all, Wisconsinites are sort of forgiving people and fair minded people. And I guess they felt when Gov. Walker said, if they gave him another chance he’d do things differently, that he’d build a consensus and work for bipartisanship.""

Before the recall rancor recedes into history, let’s look at how voters viewed the recall and what it says about support for Walker’s policies.

To recall or not to recall

Wisconsinites’ qualms about recalls were evident early on.

In a January 2012 poll Marquette University Law School, more than 40 percent said recalls should only be allowed in cases of criminal wrongdoing by an officeholder. By June, after the recall, another MU poll found 50 percent support for that.

On election day, widely cited exit poll results by Edison Research addressed head-on the question of the legitimacy of the recall. The firm asked 1,224 voters statewide when recalls are appropriate.

--10 percent said recalls never should happen.

--60 percent said recalls should only occur for official misconduct.

--27 percent said they should happen ""for any reason.""

Those results show a large majority who felt the recall was inappropriate to the circumstances, at least if you read ""official misconduct"" as some kind of civil or criminal charges by the person being recalled

Barca added the first two results and got the 70 percent figure he cited in his remarks, Eric Greenfield, a Barca legislative office spokesman, told us.

So, the numbers add up. But is it a fair reading of the exit polls that 70 percent ""didn’t feel comfortable"" with the recall?

Charles Franklin, a political scientist who directs the Marquette poll, told us Barca’s comment stands up based on the exit polls.

Since Walker has not been charged with official misconduct, it’s reasonable to lump the 60 percent in with the 10 percent ""never"" group as people who were not comfortable with the circumstances under which this recall was held, Franklin said.

David Wegge, executive director of the Strategic Research Institute at St. Norbert College, agreed. ""Not comfortable"" may actually understate the intensity of the anti-recall feeling, Wegge said. The institute polls regularly on politics and other state issues.

The Walker agenda

But there’s another aspect to Barca’s remarks.

He cited the 70 percent to bolster the notion that support for Walker’s agenda is softer than it may appear from the 53 percent majority Walker rang up compared to 46 percent for Barrett.

Franklin and Wegge both said it’s really hard -- if not impossible -- to prove that from the available exit polling data.

Indeed, it’s clear from the exit polls both Walker and Barrett got a large number of votes from people who seemed to think the recall was inappropriate. Nearly 95 percent of Walker supporters said recalls should never occur or only be for official misconduct. For Barrett, 42 percent of his backers felt that way.

But that doesn’t tell us how many of the recall skeptics disagreed with Walker’s policies but voted for him anyway to somehow make a statement that the recall itself was inappropriate.

There is one hint in the exits -- from a question on whether voters approved of Walker’s limits on collective bargaining by public employees.

Ten percent of those who disagreed with Walker on that issue nevertheless voted for Walker. And there was an equal, opposite effect: 10 percent of those who approved of the union limits nonetheless voted for Barrett. (Overall on that question, the result closely mirrored the election: 52 percent approved and 47 percent disapproved.)

Our rating

Barca asserted that ""70 percent of the people who voted just didn’t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor"" weakening the notion Wisconsin is ""fully behind"" Walker’s policy agenda.

Barca reasonable constructs the figure from a widely cited exit poll. Given the negative attitudes toward the recall election, he’s on safe ground.

But there’s not enough information to judge the piece of Barca’s statement about the meaning of the anti-recall sentiments. And the exit poll question that comes closest provides murky results at best.

We rate his claim Half True.","[('\nWisPolitics.com, audio of Peter Barca speech, Democratic Party convention, June 8, 2012\n\nEdison Research, exit poll results, 1, 2 and 3, June 5, 2012\n\nPhone interview, Erik Greenfield, spokesman, Rep.

American Crossroads says Va. lost 65,000 jobs when Kaine led DNC during his governorship
","
American Crossroads, a conservative advocacy group, is airing a TV ad accusing U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine of abandoning Virginia in 2009 when he became chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

Kaine, in January 2009, was entering the last full year of his governorship when, at President Barack Obama’s request, he agreed to also run the national party.

The ad has footage of an airline jet in the sky, a man putting up a ""Sorry we’re closed"" sign on a business door and a hand pushing a note across a desk saying ""You’re Fired!""  

""As Virginia lost over 65,000 jobs, Kaine put partisan ambitions first"" by serving as DNC chairman during his final year as governor, the announcer says.

The commercial then shows footage of Kaine speaking with excitement about becoming Democratic chairman.

We were curious if Virginia did lose 65,000 jobs during the final year of Kaine’s governorship and, if so, whether the loss can be tied to him becoming DNC chairman.

Kaine became DNC chairman on Jan. 21, 2009. His last day as governor was Jan. 16, 2010.

American Crossroads -- a political action committee affiliated with Karl Rove, who was senior political adviser to former President George W. Bush -- backed its claim by citing seasonally adjusted job data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The BLS, based on household surveys, estimated that the number of unemployed people in Virginia rose from 240,953 in January 2009 to 306,635 in January 2010. That’s an increase of 65,682.

Economists usually rely on different BLS data, gleaned by surveying businesses on their numbers of workers, to measure changes in the number of jobs.  A BLS quarterly census of jobs and wages shows a drop of 84,197 drop employees in Virginia between January 2009 and January 2010.

So, yes, Virginia lost more than 65,000 jobs during that last year of Kaine’s governorship.

But is Kaine to blame? The ad implies he focused on being DNC chairman and left the state defenseless against the job losses.

What happened in Virginia, however, was no different from what occurred nationwide. The U.S. was limping out of a severe recession that started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.

From January 2009 to January 2010, U.S. unemployment rose by 2.9 million people, according to the seasonally-adjusted BLS figures. The national unemployment rate soared from 7.8 to 9.7 percent during that time, an increase of 1.9 percentage points. In Virginia, the unemployment rate increased 1.5 percentage points during that span  -- from 5.8 to 7.3 percent.

BLS figures show that every state saw an increase in the number of unemployed residents during the timeline Crossroads cites. The 1.5 percentage point rise in Virginia’s unemployment rate was lower than the jobless rate jump in 31 states.

As we’ve noted many times, economists tell us governors have a small impact on their state economies. Governors tend to get too much blame when the economies are doing poorly and too much credit when things are going well.

Our ruling

American Crossroads said that while Kaine was governor and chairman of the DNC, Virginia lost more than 65,000 jobs. That number checks out and we could make an argument that the job loss was higher.

But every state saw unemployment rise from January 2009 to January 2010. Virginia’s unemployment rate remained well below the national average.

Governors have little control over their state economies in good times or bad. The suggestion that Kaine could have inoculated Virginia from a national recession had he not been DNC chairman is unrealistic.

On balance, we rate American Crossroad’s claim Half True.","[('\nAmerican Crossroads, ""American Crossroads: ‘Behind’ VA,""\xa0June 13, 2012.\n\nE-mail from Nate Hodson, spokesman for American Crossroads,"" June 15, 2012.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""State and area employment, hours and earnings,""\xa0Virginia’s total non-farm jobs, accessed June 15, 2012.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, \xa0""Local area unemployment statistics,""\xa0accessed June 19, 2012.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""Labor force statistics from the Current Population Survey,""\xa0accessed June 19, 2012,.\n\nInterview with Terry Rephann, regional economist at the University of Virginia Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, June 20, 2012.\n\nInterview with Stacey Standish, economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 20, 2012.\n\nVirginia Workforce Connection, ""Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages,"" \xa0accessed June 20, 2012.\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, ""U.S. business cycles expansions and contractions,"" accessed June 19, 2012.\n\nMedia General News Service, ""DNC formally elects Governor Tim Kaine chairman,""\xa0Jan. 21, 2009.\n\nNew York Times, ""Virginia Governor is named DNC chief,"" January 4, 2009.\n\nDemocratic National Committee, ""Rep.

"['Ohio', 'Campaign Finance', 'Elections', 'Jim Renacci']","
Jim Renacci says a government investigation targeted contributions to election foe Betty Sutton
","
Attacking a political rival when one of their donors runs into trouble is a campaign tactic that’s as old as dirt.

Republican Rep. Jim Renacci tossed plenty of that dirt two years ago when the incumbent Democrat he defeated, former Rep. John Boccieri of Alliance, hung onto campaign cash he got from veteran New York Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel after the House Ethics Committee chided Rangel for taking a Congressional Black Caucus trip that was improperly funded by corporations.

""As if John Boccieri’s voting record isn’t troubling enough, the fact that his campaign coffers have been fueled by the fruits of Washington’s culture of corruption raises further questions about his judgement and his ethics,"" said a March 1, 2010 statement from Renacci’s campaign.

Similar attacks have been leveled at Renacci since a May 18 article in The New Republic revealed that federal law enforcement authorities were examining donations that Renacci’s campaign got from employees of a North Canton direct marketing firm called Suarez Corporation Industries.

Federal agents sought contribution records from  the campaigns of Renacci and GOP U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel after the Toledo Blade published a report about large donations Suarez employees made to the two campaigns.

Wealthy political donors sometimes try to skirt limits on the amount they can give campaigns by having other people write checks and reimbursing them. That practice is illegal. The company and its employees deny any wrongdoing, as do the political campaigns. Mandel subsequently returned the money. 
But Renacci held on to the cash, pending the investigation’s outcome, and that has prompted the same sort of attacks as this year’s election looms that Renacci directed at Boccieri two years ago.

""Since news broke that over $100,000 in questionable donations to Congressman Jim Renacci’s re-election campaign are the focus of a federal investigation, Jim Renacci has yet to do the right thing and return or donate them,"" says a notice on the campaign website of Renacci’s Democratic election rival, Rep. Betty Sutton of Coply Township, near Akron..

Renacci was queried about the controversy at a June 14 town hall meeting in Rocky River. He responded with an attack against Sutton: ""My opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.""

Sutton, he said, ""kept them for two years until there was a final decision made, and then she returned them.""

PolitiFact Ohio wasn’t aware that the federal government had investigated political contributions that Sutton received, so we asked Renacci’s campaign to explain his assertion.

Campaign spokesman James Slepian said the congressman misspoke, and that he instead meant to reference a past investigation into Rangel, her campaign donor. Slepian said Renacci accidentally referred to Sutton’s campaign ""contributions"" rather than using the word ""donor.""

""When he said ‘contributions’ under investigation in reference to Sutton, what he clearly meant to say was ‘donor’ under federal investigation,"" said an email from Slepian. ""As you know, Jim has issued numerous statements to the press (including The Plain Dealer) that one of Sutton’s donors was under investigation for two years and that he is following the same course she took by waiting for the outcome of the investigation before deciding whether or not to return the donations. That is what he was trying to communicate.""

Slepian also blasted Sutton and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House of Representatives’ Democrats, for stating that Renacci himself is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The DCCC made that claim in a June 1 press release. PolitiFact Ohio rated that it False after the head of the FBI’s Canton office debunked the accusation.

Sutton was among dozens of Democratic office holders to whom Rangel donated money. It is true that allegations about Rangel began to surface in 2008, when The New York Times ran a series of articles about Rangel that suggested irregularities.

Allegations in those articles included abuse of  rent-stabilized apartments and failure to report $75,000 in income, as well as his protection of a tax loophole that favored one of his donors. Within a week of the House Ethics Committee's Feb. 25, 2010, report on Rangel’s improper junket, Sutton announced that she was giving the $7,000 she got from Rangel to charity. Sutton subsequently called on Rangel to resign from the House of Representatives.

Slepian says Renacci’s decision to wait until the FBI probe is complete before deciding whether to get rid of the the Suarez money parallels Sutton’s decision to wait. But does it?

The Rangel conduct under investigation had nothing to do with Sutton or the donations Rangel made to her campaign. The FBI’s investigation specifically involves donations made to Renacci.

Also, Rangel was being probed by the House Ethics Committee for violating House of Representative rules. The FBI is probing donations to Renacci as potential crimes.

And the amounts of money involved are significantly different: $7,000 from Rangel to Sutton’s campaign; more than $100,000 from Suarez employees to Renacci’s campaign. Data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics says Suarez is Renacci’s biggest political donor.

Regardless, the claim on the Truth-O-Meter is Renacci’s statement to the town hall audience that ""my opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.""

PolitiFact Ohio doesn’t play ""gotcha"" games. To their credit, the folks in the Renacci camp acknowledged he provided incorrect information to the crowd in Rocky River.

But to those in attendance, the information they have to go on is what Renacci told them that night. That’s why the comment merits a check from PolitiFact Ohio.

"['Georgia', 'State Budget', 'Nathan Deal']","
Cuts to state workforce not as steep as Deal said
","
Georgia begins a new budget year July 1 with a smaller state workforce -- but how much smaller?

In a May 7 news release acknowledging Gov. Nathan Deal’s signing of the new budget, Deal’s office said the state had trimmed its workforce by 12.4 percent since the recession began in the 2008 fiscal year. We thought a claim that the state has shed one out of every eight of its employees deserves a second look.

The boast of job cuts was a throw-in line in a news release in which Deal talked about using his line-item veto power to ""eliminate wasteful or inefficient spending,"" but the statement made its way into news accounts across the state, including an Associated Press story.

Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said the numbers originated from the State Personnel Administration, a department that essentially serves as the human resources department for much of state government. The department has kept a running tally of state workers since 1998.

Robinson forwarded a spreadsheet showing the ebbs and flows of state offices from accounting to workers’ compensation. Fiscal 2008 -- which ended June 30, 2009 -- was the peak year with 82,080 workers drawing a state paycheck.

Since then, the overall number has declined each year. Among the offices taking the most losses: 

-- The Governor’s Office of Consumer Protection, which went from 96 employees in 2008 to 47 by the end of fiscal 2011, a cut of 51 percent. 

-- The Student Finance Commission, which dropped from 41 employees in 2008 to 29 in 2011 a loss of 29.3 percent.
  
-- The Insurance Commissioner’s Office, which fell from 251 employees to 190, a decline of 24.3 percent.

Deal just took office in 2011, so he cannot claim all the credit for shrinking state government. But the trend has continued under his leadership.

Not every area of state government shrank, though. The state Defense Department, the State Road and Tollway Authority and the Technical College System all added workers.

Most departments showed a loss of some sort, but is the 12.4 percent brag accurate?

Robinson said the news release compared the 2008 figure with the ""most recent workforce number available,"" which he said was a December 2011 figure of 71,881. That’s a difference of 10,199 employees from the end of fiscal 2008 -- a 12.4 percent decrease. Right on the button. (For sticklers, these measurements are of actual full-time workers, not positions that may or may not be filled, so it is a more accurate measure of the size of the government’s workforce.)

But there was something missing. The spreadsheet lists 76 different offices and departments, but the University System of Georgia was not among them. Why?

Robinson said the Office of Planning and Budget provided the information and the OPB considers University System employees different from other state workers for a couple of reasons. The first is where they get their money.

A statement from the OPB forwarded by Robinson said the University System can offset budget cuts with higher tuition and avoid cuts where other offices don’t have that option.
That’s true to a point. Other areas of government can offset state budget cuts by increasing revenue elsewhere, such as Georgia Public Broadcasting with fundraising.

The other reason the University System was left off was a matter of interpretation. According to the statement, the OPB believes ""there is a distinct difference"" between education and the rest of state government.

Without arguing that distinction, the figures Robinson initially provided include the Department of Education, the Department of Early Care and Learning, and the Technical College System. So some educational figures were included in the overall state count.  

Perhaps the most persuasive reason Deal’s news release didn’t include the university employment numbers is because they weren’t available. That data is kept by the Board of Regents and is not integrated into the state’s human resource database.

Robinson said the governor’s office asked for employment figures and worked with what it had.

""According to OPB, what we used accurately reflects how the state has historically discussed state job numbers,"" he said.

Are university employees ""state workers""? A reasonable person might conclude they are, so we asked for those numbers.

What we found was significantly higher employment among the state’s colleges and universities.

In fiscal 2008, the University System had 40,155 employees. Today, 45,592 are on the payroll. That’s a 13.5 percent increase.

Add those figures to the rest of state employment and you get 122,235 workers in 2008 and 117,473 today -- a 3.9 percent decrease.

The statement in Deal’s news release about the shrinking of state government overreaches significantly. It does not include University System employees, a striking omission.

Include those employee and you still see a decrease. But it’s a much smaller one than the governor claimed.

We rate Deal’s statement Mostly False.","[('\nOffice of Gov.

State Rep. Michael Chippendale says Rhode Island has the worst maintained bridges in U.S. and second worst maintained roads
","
State Rep. Michael W. Chippendale rose on the House floor earlier this month to steer his colleagues away from a bill mandating more studies before any future road projects are completed.

The bill (H7352) required the state Department of Transportation -- whether it was constructing a new highway or putting in a crosswalk --  to use ""complete street design principles"" that considered the ""mobility needs of all users."" The department would then have to issue a report showing it had considered, for example, the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians ""of all ages.""

Chippendale, a Republican from Foster, called the bill arduous and costly. He said he’d rather see the money that would go toward design studies used to improve the state’s roads, because, he said, the state has the ""worst-maintained bridges in the United States of America . . . and we have the second-worst maintained roads only to Alaska.""

The poor condition of the state’s bridges and roads has been a focus of attention for years. Rhode Island, like many other states, just doesn’t have enough money to repair and rebuild all those needing attention. But we wondered whether we really have among the worst roads and bridges in the nation.

On the House floor, Chippendale attributed his information to the National Highway Safety Association, a transportation entity we searched in vain to find. But Chippendale might be forgiven for mixing up the name, considering the multitude of groups that have weighed in on state road conditions.

Among them: The Governors Highway Safety Association; the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Surface Transportation Policy Project; TRIP, a private transportation research nonprofit; U.S. PIRG, the federation of state public interest research groups; the Reason Foundation -- the list goes on.

All the groups use the same basic data that state highway agencies submit each year to the Federal Highway Administration on road and bridge deterioration and spending. Researchers for the groups then choose their own various criteria from the data to study and compare, to suit their objectives.

When we contacted Chippendale, he acknowledged that he attributed his statement incorrectly on the House floor. He said the basis of his claim came from a report he had filed away with information from his 2010 campaign. He then e-mailed us a copy of the 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems, issued in September 2010 by the Reason Foundation, a  Libertarian research group that monitors government spending and efficiency.

Chippendale said he had also seen other reports, as well as newspaper stories that supported his statement.

The Reason Foundation report  is based on 2008 data compiled by the Federal Highway Administration. It indeed rated Rhode Island’s bridges and roads the worst overall in the country. (The state Department of Transportation doesn’t dispute the findings. It says the problem is an issue of money.) Alaska came in right behind us at 49th.

(By  the way, Massachusetts was ranked 44th and Connecticut, 41st. New Hampshire was the best ranked New England state, at 27.)

The states that ranked best -- North Dakota and Montana, for example -- had roads that were in good condition and had small transportation budgets. The foundation reported that ""Rhode Island is spending about two to three times the national average, per mile, on its state road system . . .""

Other recent reports have offered similar findings about the Ocean State’s roads and bridges.

In 2009, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that sets standards for road design and construction, ranked Rhode Island the third worst state in the country for ""poor"" roads, with only New Jersey and California having worse roads.

In 2010, the consumer group U.S. PIRG, a federation of consumer activist groups from around the country, issued a report that said Rhode Island had the highest percentage of ""structurally deficient"" bridges (27 percent) in the country. The group, using Federal Highway Administration data, defined structurally deficient as meaning ""a bridge has a major defect in its support structure or its deck is cracking and deteriorating.""

That percentage has since dropped to around 22 percent -- the fourth worst in the country -- because the Route 195 relocation project eliminated about a dozen of those bad bridges, a state DOT spokesman says. The findings are also in a report from Transportation For America, another coalition of road budget watchdogs.

Our ruling

State Rep. Michael Chippendale turned down a path familiar to Rhode Island motorists when he described the Ocean State as having the ""worst maintained bridges in the United States of America"" and "" the second worst maintained roads only to Alaska.""

Rhode Island’s rankings may go up or down a few notches depending on which report you look at and what year it came out. But every one we’ve seen shows the Ocean State is clearly at the bottom when it comes to road and bridge conditions.

Chippendale might have incorrectly attributed his statement on the House floor, but his figures were accurate.

We rate his claim True.

Facebook post claims nearly 60 percent of public housing residents are illegal immigrants
","
One of the strongest charges aimed at illegal immigrants is that not only have they broken the law, but they are relying heavily on government handouts.

A PolitiFact reader sent us a link to a Facebook post that lists many such claims of unlawful residents benefiting from federal programs. Among them was the claim that, ""Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD housing in U.S. are illegals."" The post went up on June 10 and since then has been shared over 3,900 times.

To assess this statement, we looked at the total number of people using HUD subsidized housing. According to HUD’s website, the count was about 9.6 million in 2009, the most recent year for which they have data. That includes public housing, rent vouchers, Section 8 and a couple of other programs.

If the 60 percent claim were accurate, then there would be about 5.8 million illegal immigrants living in HUD properties. There are about 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States according to a 2010  Pew Hispanic Center estimate.

""It seems implausible on its face,"" says Chris Herbert, Research Director at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. ""It would mean that about half of all the illegal immigrants in the country lived in assisted housing.""

If the practice were so widespread, Herbert says, it  would come up often -- and he’s never heard any discussion of it. We checked with another of the country’s leading housing policy groups, the Furman Center For Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, and they too drew a blank.

We asked HUD ourselves. A spokesman could find no published report on illegal immigrants in HUD housing. HUD does require information on citizenship when people apply for assistance. Public housing and vouchers represent the bulk of HUD’s subsidized housing. The agency says 96 percent of those residents are citizens and about 4 percent are legal immigrants.

""The claim that 60 percent are illegal is certainly nonsensical,"" says Brian Sullivan, a HUD spokesman.

Applicants for subsidized housing must be citizens or legal immigrants. Sullivan notes that undocumented immigrants are allowed to live in subsidized housing if at least one member of the household is in the country legally. Typically, this happens when undocumented parents have a child in the U.S. Anyone born here is automatically a citizen and the parents could then rent in a HUD-subsidized property. In these cases, HUD reduces the subsidy for each undocumented person in the unit.

Sullivan says, ""The taxpayer would not be on the hook for assisting in their housing.""
 
We found one article that references an estimate of the number of illegal immigrants living in subsidized units. An item from the Associated Press says HUD pegged the number at about 30,000. That would be about 0.3 percent of all HUD residents -- a tiny fraction of 60 percent. An unconfirmed blog post in circulation on the Web mentions that Arizona HUD officials estimated that perhaps 10 percent of its occupants are in the country illegally.  

To be complete, we should note that whatever housing benefits an illegal immigrant might enjoy -- such as being allowed to live in a HUD unit because a family member is a citizen -- those benefits don’t count in certain kinds of deportation hearings. The government can deport someone if it determines they are a ""public charge"" which is defined as someone who is ""primarily dependent on the Government for subsistence.""  HUD housing is not part of that calculation.

Clearly, there are some illegal immigrants living in HUD housing and there are rules that might allow them to stay, but in no way do the numbers match the claim that 60 percent of HUD housing residents are ""illegals.""

Our ruling

The Facebook post says ""Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD housing in U.S. are illegals.""

The closest but unverified estimate we could find for illegal occupants in HUD housing is less than 1 percent nationwide. The claim of 60 percent is ridiculously false.

"['National', 'Jobs', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Women', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama ad says women are paid ""77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men""
","President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign released a new ad aimed at women on June 21, 2012.

Here’s the narration: ""The son of a single mom, proud father of two daughters, President Obama knows that women being paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men isn't just unfair, it hurts families. So the first law he signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help ensure that women are paid the same as men for doing the exact same work. Because President Obama knows that fairness for women means a stronger middle class for America.""

In this item, we're checking the claim that ""women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.""

The 77 cent figure has become a rallying cry for those who seek to eliminate employment discrimination based on gender. And it’s a genuine statistic. In a report released in September 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau wrote that in 2010, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.77."" Translated into dollars, that means that in 2010, women working full-time earned 77 cents for every dollar earned by men working full time.

But the Obama ad takes a solid statistic and describes it incorrectly. The campaign is wrong to say that the 77-cent figure describes the pay differences between men and women ""doing the same work."" (By contrast, former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine recently earned a Mostly True on a similar claim because he was not specifying the number was for the same occupations.)

The 77-cent figure compares all male and female workers, regardless of their occupation. Whether due to a historical legacy of discrimination or because of personal choice, women and men are disproportionately represented in certain jobs. For instance, women dominate the ranks of receptionists, nurses, and elementary and middle-school teachers, among other fields. Men are disproportionately truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers.

""If more men tend to be employed in occupations that pay higher wages both to men and women, then men may enjoy an overall earnings advantage even if all women in each occupation receive exactly the same hourly pay as the men who are employed in the occupation,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.

Indeed, if you look at men and women working in the same professions, the pay gap is much smaller (though for most professions, it doesn’t disappear entirely).

For computer programmers, for instance, women earn 95 cents for every dollar a man earns. For cashiers it’s 92 cents. For cooks and customer service representatives, it’s 95 cents. Other occupations have more unequal ratios. Women who are personal financial advisers, for instance, earn just 58 cents of what men in that job earn. (The statistics come from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a think tank focusing on women’s issues.)

There are at least two other factors that weaken the accuracy of the ad’s claim.

One involves hours worked. While calculations that led to the 77-cent figure did not include any part-time workers, the label ""full time worker"" can actually be applied to employees with a wide range of hours worked per week.

The official Bureau of Labor Statistics definition of a full-time worker is someone who works at least 35 hours per week. Someone who gets no vacation time and works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks would work 2,080 hours in a year. By contrast, a worker on a 36-hour-per-week schedule who has two weeks off would work only 1,800 hours. Meanwhile, a worker with two weeks off who averaged four hours per week of overtime would end up with 2,200 hours.

""Some workers have even longer work schedules than that, especially when the economy is expanding rapidly,"" Burtless said. ""So even among full-time, year-round workers, there is considerable variability in annual work hours."" This variation can work its way into the gender pay gap if women seek more flexible schedules or if men happen to fill jobs with greater opportunities for overtime.

(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

The other complicating factor involves seniority on the job. Men have typically held their jobs longer than women in the same position. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, men in 2010 who were between 45 and 54 years old had a median job tenure of 8.5 years, compared to 7.1 years for women in the same age group.

""Women have shorter job tenures than men because they have more work interruptions than men, usually because they have children and assume heavy responsibility for rearing those children,"" Burtless said. Improving access to child care or offering stronger protections for workers who leave the workforce temporarily to raise children, as some other advanced industrialized nations do, would probably decrease the wage gap, Burtless said.

When we contacted the Obama campaign, they reiterated the importance of the overall figures and noted a Bloomberg analysis that showed that only one occupation out of 265 with more than 10,000 men and women employed did women out-earn men -- namely, ""personal care and service workers, which include butlers, valets, house sitters and shoe shiners.""

""No matter how you look at it, women make less than men -- at the same job, at different jobs, weekly, annually and by occupation,"" said Kara Carscaden, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign.

Nothing in our analysis suggests that gender discrimination doesn’t exist. In fact, the experts we consulted agreed that no matter how much you adjust the models to equalize for outside factors, a difference in pay between men and women remains, and it’s one that can’t be explained away.

Still, those same experts also agreed that ad goes too far in claiming that the 77-cent statistic describes the pay gap for women ""doing the same work as men.""

""Sexism may explain differences in occupation, industry, education, hours and weeks worked, so it’s hard to know how much of the gap is due to discrimination. But (77 cents) isn’t the right statistic for saying ‘the same work as,’"" said Betsey Stevenson, a business and public policy professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and visiting economics professor at Princeton University who previously served as chief economist for Obama’s labor secretary.

Burtless agreed. ""It’s hard to defend the last seven words in the ad’s claim.""

Our ruling

The Obama campaign took a legitimate statistic and described it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it actually is. The 77-cent figure is real, but it does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. Describing that statistic as referring to the pay for women ""doing the same work as men"" earns it a rating of Mostly False.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
David Dewhurst says most of Ted Cruz's ""money comes from Washington, from outside the state of Texas""
","
Fresh from leading the May 2012 Republican primary for his party’s U.S. Senate nomination, David Dewhurst declared that voters in his July runoff with Ted Cruz will be choosing between Texas and Washington.

According to a June 5, 2012, email blast from the Dewhurst campaign, the lieutenant governor told Sean Rima of San Antonio’s KTSA (550 AM): ""This is a choice, ladies and gentleman, between Texas and Washington. Most of Ted Cruz’s money comes from Washington, from outside the state of Texas, and they’ve run millions and millions of untrue ads against me.""

Questionable advertising aside, we wondered if Cruz, a lawyer and former state solicitor general, had indeed raised most of his money from Washington and out of state.

To back the claim, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed out a Houston Chronicle news story published five days after Dewhurst made his comment. We’d typically rule out this type of research since we expect a statement to be supported at the time it’s made. In this case, though, we confirmed that figures cited in the story were based on finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission by Dewhurst and Cruz before Dewhurst spoke.

According to Cruz’s campaign-finance filings as posted on the election commission website the day we searched, his reports at the time the Chronicle did its story covered contributions received from early 2011 through May 9, 2012.

The Chronicle story says Dewhurst has raised more than 90 percent of his campaign cash in Texas, while Cruz has pocketed 35 percent of his proceeds from outside the state, raising more than $1.5 million from more than 1,000 donors who live outside Texas.

The story says Cruz has received donations from every state except for Vermont, while Dewhurst has reaped $180,800 from 88 people in 20 other states and the nation’s capital. Generally, the story says, Dewhurst has outraised Cruz, $18.4 million to $5.8 million, but Cruz has an 8-to-1 edge beyond Texas.

A June 19, 2012, analysis by the Texas Tribune notes that it’s not known where more than $1 million of Cruz’s contributions came from. That’s because donations of $200 or less are not required to be itemized.

The Tribune reported that of $4.6 million in itemized individual contributions that Cruz received, 39 percent — $1.5 million — came from out-of-state contributors.

According to a related June 12, 2012, post on the Chronicle’s Texas on the Potomac blog, Cruz has raised $381,451 from 169 Washington donations. By our math, such donations account for about 7 percent of Cruz’s total contributions.

Dewhurst, the post says, had drawn 11 donations from Washington donors, totaling $6,750.

So, Cruz has raised less than 10 percent of his money from Washington givers, less than 40 percent from donors outside Texas, though this does not account for the origins of his unitemized donations. 
When we followed up, Hirsch of Dewhurst’s campaign pointed out that outside groups have put some $3.8 million into touting Cruz or opposing Dewhurst, also as reported by the Chronicle. That $3.8 million includes $1.3 million designed to directly support Cruz's candidacy, the Chronicle reported, and $2.5 million spent by the anti-tax Club for Growth on targeting Dewhurst.

The Tribune said in its article that two Texas super PACs have put $3 million into supporting Dewhurst’s candidacy.

Hirsch pointed out, too, that according to the Center for Responsive Government, which tracks campaign spending, FreedomWorks, another group, has spent about $133,000 promoting Cruz, while the Senate Conservatives Fund has spent more than $500,000 doing the same.

Throw in these outside expenditures and one could speculate that as much as $5.3 million intended to help Cruz or oppose Dewhurst has been raised from, or spent by, individuals and entities from outside Texas, though we do not know how much of the outside groups’ spending originated from non-Texas givers.

Significantly, though, it’s unlikely the groups spent such funds hand-in-glove with Cruz’s campaign. That’s forbidden. The election commission says on its site: ""Independent expenditures represent spending by individual people or groups or political committees... expressly advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates. These expenditures may not be made in concert or cooperation with or at the request or suggestion of the candidate, the candidate’s campaign or a political party.""

Our ruling

Dewhurst says Cruz has raised most of his money from donors in Washington and out of state. Through early May 2012, in reality, Cruz had gathered less than 10 percent of his campaign’s itemized contributions from Washington givers and less than 40 percent from outside Texas.

That’s not ""most.""

Our sense is that spending by outside groups for or against Cruz or Dewhurst belongs in a different category than money either one has raised. Such groups are barred from coordinating expenditures with candidates.

Still, Dewhurst’s statement has an element of truth; Cruz has gotten considerable out-of-state support. We rate Dewhurst’s claim Mostly False.","[('\nEmail and telephone interview, Matt Hirsch, deputy communications director, David Dewhurst campaign, June 18, 2012\n\nNews article and blog posts, The Houston Chronicle, ""Senate candidate Cruz pocketing big bucks from across the country,"" June 10, 2012; ""Top Ten: Which states have most donors to Cruz and Dewhurst?""

There's no wildlife in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, says Dave Weldon
","
We’re guessing most Floridians don’t know much about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, located about 5,000 miles away from us in Alaska’s northeast corner.

But if we had to bet, we’d probably say it contains at least one thing. There’s gotta be wildlife, right?

Wrong, says former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, the Republican newcomer in the U.S. Senate race. Weldon is vying with several candidates, including U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, to win the Republican nomination and run against incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson in November.

One way Weldon really breaks from Nelson, he said, is he wants to drill for oil in the refuge to lessen dependence on foreign sources. (The refuge is commonly called ANWR and pronounced an-whar.)

In an interview on Central Florida News 13’s Political Connections show, Weldon emphatically said there is no wildlife in the refuge.

""We should be drilling up there,"" he said. ""I don’t know why Democrats have been opposing that for years. I have been up there. There’s a ton of oil up there, and there’s no wildlife. We drill in something like 15 wildlife refuges in the lower 48. I just don’t understand why Democrats like Bill Nelson don’t want to drill up there.

""I have gone up there. It’s like a moonscape. There’s no trees, there’s no animals. They call it the wildlife refuge, but there’s absolutely nothing up there. It’s just tundra, it’s ice. And in my opinion you can drill safely up there.""

A reader asked us to examine his comments about wildlife, especially after she found conflicting information right away on the refuge website that boasts of ""42 fish species, 37 land mammals, eight marine mammals, and more than 200 migratory and resident bird species.""

So is the area more like a moonscape or a serengeti?

For this fact-check, we’re focusing on a simple question: Is there wildlife on the refuge? For now, we’re staying away from the debate of whether wildlife would be affected by oil drilling in the refuge.

Congress created the refuge in 1960 and expanded and renamed it in 1980. Part of the law required 1.5 million of its 19 million acres be set aside for possible oil and gas development, which would need congressional approval.

Congress has never approved that. Several environmental groups urged Obama to declare the refuge a national monument so that it never happens. He has not.

The refuge is about the size of South Carolina. Its tundra terrain is sometimes mountainous, sometimes forested, and sometimes plains.

Located east of the Prudhoe Bay oil field, the refuge could possess one of the country’s largest untapped onshore supply of oil. (You can read more about that in this PolitiFact report, which examined Sarah Palin’s 2008 claim that ANWR drilling would affect ""2,000 out of 20-million acres."")

Weldon does have a point about there being no trees. While the southern part of the refuge, known as the boreal forest, is heavily forested, the greenery turns to shrubs and grass farther north.

""This is a tundra biome, not a forest,"" said Alan Springer, a research professor at the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. ""That fact hardly diminishes its intrinsic value as a pristine, unique ecosystem within the borders of the United States.""

The area eyed for drilling has ""extensive vegetation cover that is nearly continuous, except for gravel bars along rivers, a few sandy dunes, and rocky beaches along the Arctic coast,"" said David Payer, the refuge’s supervisory ecologist since 2001 and a veterinarian. (Read more about wildlife in the refuge in this booklet.)

Yes, there is wildlife

Without question, there are animals in the refuge, even in the zone that most people eye for drilling, known as ""1002."" Weldon told us in an interview that is the location to which he was referring, but he’s still wrong about wildlife here.

The Arctic’s long, dark winter isn’t conducive to a lot of wildlife, but several kinds of animal species stick it out during those months, Payer said.

He points to Muskoxen, wolves, wolverines, Arctic and red foxes, polar and grizzly bears (they stay in their winter dens, but they’re still there), as well as a number of bird species, including ptarmigan and ravens. Lemmings and other small creatures live beneath the outer layer of snow, which acts as an insular blanket.

During the few summer months, large congregations of animals gather and breed, particularly on the coastal plain, he said. Hundreds of thousands of migratory birds, including several kinds of imperiled shorebirds, come each year.

The Porcupine caribou herd, estimated at 169,000 members, depend on the treeless tundra terrain of the coastal plain to raise their young, typically in June and July.

Polar bears, a threatened species (not endangered), are hard to detect but can be spotted along the Beaufort Sea.

""With regard to the lack of animals, he appears to be very uninformed,"" Springer said of Weldon. ""There are indeed animals, and a lot of them.""

And that’s just those on the ground. There are a number of rivers, streams and lakes throughout the refuge that are home to fish, which Inupiat (Eskimo) people depend upon for sustenance. Marine life, such as seals and whales, exist in the Arctic Ocean.

""We should give fish their due,"" Payer said.

Our ruling

Weldon acknowledged his overstatement in an interview with PolitiFact Florida but stood by his observations gathered from a congressional trip through the refuge in the 1990s.

""There’s more wildlife in your backyard than that area where they want to drill,"" he said.

We won’t argue with relative statements, but Weldon got it wrong when he said there is no wildlife in ANWR.

Under Obama, 1,700 transportation workers eclipse $170,000 per year, GOP Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde says
","
Political newcomer Eric Hovde has introduced himself to Wisconsin voters with television and radio ads that largely criticize how Uncle Sam handles money.

In a June 12, 2012 interview, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate hammered away some more at that theme, singling out President Barack Obama.

""The only people that are getting wealthy, or doing well, are in government,"" Hovde told conservative radio talk show host Vicki McKenna, whose show airs in Milwaukee and Madison.

""I think you had only one person in the (U.S.) Department of Transportation making $170,000 a year going back four years ago and now, under President Obama, you have 1,700 employees just at the Department of Transportation making over a 170 grand.""  

Hit the brakes.

Hovde hedges a bit on the first part of his statement, but he’s claiming that since Obama took office, the number of federal transportation employees earning more than $170,000 per year went from nearly none to 1,700.

That’s quite a jump. Let’s get under the hood for some analysis.

Michele Bachmann

In 2011, two other fact-checking operations examined a statement by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn, that is similar to Hovde’s.

The Washington Post Fact Checker evaluated Bachmann’s claim that only one DOT employee made $170,000 a year ""at the beginning of the recession. We had the trillion-dollar stimulus, and 18 months into the recession, we had 1,690 employees making over $170,000.""

The Fact Checker noted that Bachmann’s claim almost exactly quoted a December 2009 article in USA Today, which reported on an increase in the number of all federal workers earning more than $100,000 since the recession started in December 2007.

When we asked Hovde campaign spokesman Sean Lansing for evidence to back Hovde’s claim, he cited the same sentence from the article, which said:

""When the recession started, the Transportation Department had only one person earning a salary of $170,000 or more. Eighteen months later, 1,690 employees had salaries above $170,000.""

Lansing noted the statistic was also repeated in Stealing You Blind, a July 2011 book published by conservative Regnery Publishing.

But as The Fact Checker pointed out, USA Today made it clear that the recession began under President George W. Bush -- and that Bush had recommended across-the-board raises for federal employees. Those raises, after getting through Congress, resulted in boosts of 3 percent in January 2008 and 3.9 percent in January 2009.

The Fact Checker concluded ""it is clear that the bulk of the new salaries were instituted before (Obama) took office.""

The University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org also said Bachmann wrongly blamed Obama in her claim, concluding that at least two-thirds of the DOT employees were receiving more than $170,000 before Obama took office.

We also asked the Obama administration to respond to Hovde’s claim.

Moira Mack, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said there were 1,699 transportation employees who earned more than $170,000 when Obama took office. Nearly all worked in the Federal Aviation Administration, primarily in flight control towers.

Mack said that as of December 2011, the number had risen to 2,464. She attributed the increase of 765 employees during Obama’s tenure to the Bush-led across-the-board pay increases as well as a collective bargaining agreement for air traffic controllers, signed under Obama, that provided 3 percent raises in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

When we pointed out the two fact checks and the OMB’s information to Lansing, he said Hovde’s main point is that the number of federal employees is ""exploding"" and their pay has gone up under Obama.

Our rating

Hovde said that since Obama took office, ""you have 1,700 employees just at the Department of Transportation"" earning over $170,000.

Actually, there were that many federal transportation workers earning over $170,000 a year when Obama took office, largely as the result of raises pushed by President Bush.

Chris Christie claims he stopped Assembly Democrats from raising the gas tax by $2.4 billion
","
The way Gov. Chris Christie makes it sound, Democrats in the state Assembly are a bunch of crazed junkies looking for their next fix of raising taxes and he’s the one forcing them into withdrawal.

At a June 13 town hall meeting in Atlantic County, the Republican governor pointed to his opposition to a proposed gas tax increase as an example of him fighting off the Democrats’ addiction. 
""Now I’ve been governor now for over 800 days and we vetoed two income tax increases. They wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that,"" said Christie, according to a video posted June 14 on YouTube. ""Imagine now if you’re paying 20 to 25 cents more a gallon. That’s what the Assembly Democrats would have gotten for you. We’re saying no to all that stuff.

""So now…you got to see what’s happening with the Assembly Democrats. They’re like people going through withdrawals. They haven’t gotten to raise a tax in over 800 days. They’re down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no.""

Such colorful language, and yet so misleading, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

There has been a proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but despite Christie’s suggestion, it hasn’t been pushed by the Assembly Democratic leadership and stopped by the governor. In fact, the legislation has never made it to the governor’s desk for him to take any action.

State Assemblyman Albert Coutinho (D-Essex) has introduced the bill twice over the last roughly two years, but has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing. The full Assembly has never voted on the proposal.

As Coutinho put it, ""this bill is going nowhere.""

First introduced in May 2010, Coutinho’s bill called for annual increases of 8-cents-per-gallon in fiscal years 2011 through 2013. According to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, those increases were projected to generate a total of about $2.4 billion over the three-year period to go toward the state’s Transportation Trust Fund.

Coutinho said the tax hike would allow the state to stop borrowing for the fund, which supports various transportation projects. 
But the bill, which Coutinho reintroduced in January for the current legislative session, hasn’t moved an inch since being referred to an Assembly committee.

""Leadership’s not looking to do this,"" Coutinho told us. ""Nobody seems willing to politically have that conversation.""

Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, explained that Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver does not support raising the gas tax.

""Hundreds if not thousands of bills are proposed each session without getting a hearing. Nothing unusual about it at all,"" Hester said in an e-mail. ""The governor is once again misleading the public.""

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak noted how other Democrats have indicated support for a gas tax increase, including state Sen. Raymond Lesniak and state Assemblyman and state Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski.

As for Christie’s role in stopping such a tax hike, Drewniak added: ""The Governor was emphatic many times amid this discussion by Democrats that he would not sign legislation increasing the gasoline tax and add a new tax burden on over-taxed New Jersey residents.

""The unambiguous promise of a veto is often just as effective in stopping legislation in its tracks as is the actual act of a veto.""

Our ruling

At a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Assembly Democrats ""wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that."" Now Democrats are ""down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no,"" Christie added.

The governor’s right about there being a Democratic proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but Assembly Democratic leaders have stopped the bill from moving forward. Since its first introduction in May 2010, the bill has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing.

Since Christie’s claim ""ignores critical facts that would give a different impression,"" we rate the statement Mostly False.

DCCC claims FBI is investigating Jim Renacci over campaign donations
","
There’s nothing like a law enforcement investigation to set off a political mudslide.

That’s what happened to Wadsworth Republican Rep. Jim Renacci after a May 18 article in The New Republic revealed that federal law enforcement authorities were examining donations that his campaign received from employees of a North Canton direct marketing firm called Suarez Corporation Industries.

Federal law enforcement officials sought contribution records from  the campaigns of Renacci and GOP U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel after the Toledo Blade published a report about large sums of money the firm’s employees gave to the two campaigns. Wealthy political donors sometimes try to skirt caps on the amount they can give campaigns by having other people write checks and reimbursing them. That practice is illegal. The company and its employees deny any wrongdoing, as do the political campaigns.

Still, the questions were enough to prompt Mandel -- who serves as Ohio’s state treasurer --  to return the donations at issue.

""We have decided to issue refunds for any contributions that appear to be under investigation by federal authorities,"" Mandel campaign treasurer Kathryn Kessler said in a letter to Suarez Corporation.""We believe we have no reason to be concerned with the contributions, but out of an abundance of caution and until the investigation is complete, we believe this course of action is most appropriate.""

Renacci’s decision to hang onto the cash pending the investigation’s outcome prompted predictable political attacks from his foes. Demanding that an opponent get rid of donations from a controversial campaign backer is a common political tactic, one that Renacci himself has repeatedly used in the past.

""After several months of investigation and countless stories in the press about suspect campaign contributions, Congressman Renacci’s continuing refusal to return the funds speaks volumes,"" said a May 29 press release from Renacci’s November election rival, Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton.   ""Every day that passes is a day that he fails to do the right thing to come clean about what he knew about these potentially illegal contributions and return or donate the suspect funds.""
 
Eager to capitalize on the controversy, the campaign arm of Democrats in the House of Representatives issued a June 1 missive announcing it had named Renacci its ""Corrupt Republican of the Month,"" a designation whose sole purpose seemed to be providing an excuse for press releases.

""Congressman Jim Renacci is under FBI investigation for taking $110,250 in suspect campaign cash and refuses to return the money,"" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in the release.

While it is clear that the FBI is investigating Suarez Corporation’s donations, PolitiFact Ohio had not heard that Renacci himself was under investigation by the FBI.

We asked the DCCC to back up their claim.

The DCCC said its assertion was consistent with statements from groups such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government, whose website claims that the FBI is investigating Renacci, and headlines such as this one from the Medina Gazette’s online edition: ""FBI confirms campaign investigation of U.S.  Rep. Jim Renacci."" The article underneath that headline clearly stipulates the FBI is investigating Suarez’ donations to Renacci and Mandel, and states ""The candidates are not accused of any wrongdoing.""

While a claim on a watchdog website, or sloppy headline could have conveyed the impression that Renacci or his campaign was being investigated by the FBI, none of the news coverage we found on the subject indicated that was the case. To settle the question, we went straight to the source: the Canton office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In a June 18 interview, Andrew Hayden, the supervisory senior resident agent of Canton’s Federal Bureau of Investigation office confirmed that Renacci is not a target of the FBI’s investigation.

""We are looking into the donations from the Suarez Corporation, and not the congressman’s campaign or the congressman,"" Hayden said.

It couldn’t be much clearer than that. The FBI says it is not investigating Renacci.

Do 97 cents of every Lottery dollar played go back to the state?
","
Every biennium, about a billion dollars flows into the state’s budget by way of the Oregon Lottery. People who play scratchers and video poker are, in a roundabout way, sending some of their cash to schools and parks and other ventures even as they hope to win the big one.

But what piece of the overall Lottery revenues does that represent? Well, according to the Lottery website, billboards, TV spots and print ads, it’s about 97 cents on the dollar.

Here’s what the Lottery said in a recent print ad that appeared in the June 17, 2012 Oregonian:

""Every time a dollar is played on a Lottery game, think about ninety-seven cents of that dollar helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all. Ninety-seven cents represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds. Ninety-seven cents really adds up.""

We’d seen this same messaging several times before (some variation of the 97-cent ad has been in circulation since October 2010). And so had at least one of our readers who wrote in asking us to take a look at this claim.

We called the Oregon Lottery’s spokesman, Chuck Baumann, to see where they got the figures.

He pointed us to a lengthy report on the Lottery’s home page that details the operation’s finances for fiscal year 2011. The pertinent table, he said, was on Page 24 and showed that the Lottery had net sales of some $9.8 billion in 2011. Of that cash, about $300 million -- or 3 percent -- went to administrative expenses, which left 97 percent for the state.

The thing is, not all of that leftover 97 percent is going to community development. The same chart shows just $523 million going to the economic development fund -- the pot of money that helps schools and parks and other areas of the state. But, as most any math student can tell you, $523 million is not 97 percent of $9.8 billion -- it’s a bit more than 5 percent.

The majority of it -- more than $9 billion -- went to ""prizes to the public.""

After looking through the report, we found another breakdown of expenses that seemed to tell a different story altogether. This one, on Page 14, showed the Lottery’s total operating revenue at just over $1 billion. Of that money, $514 million went to operating expenses -- prizes, salaries and wages, game vendor charges, market research, public information, etc.

Another $550 million went to the economic development fund -- about 52 percent of the the total operating revenues.

We asked Baumann what the difference was between the two tables.

The one he showed us, which has nearly $10 billion in revenues, counts something called ""churn,"" he said. See, the state’s biggest source of income (as far as gambling goes) comes in the form of video Lottery. Let’s say you sit down to play and put $20 into the machine. You play the full $20 dollars and you wind up with $10 in winning credits and you play them and lose. Well, that all gets added up in the chart as $30 of revenues -- even though that subsequent $10 never existed as real cash into the system.

Conversely, the operating revenues chart that we looked at only represents the initial $20 that you played -- the actual cash into the system.

In the end though, it doesn’t really matter which way you look at it, the Lottery’s ads are clearly misleading. The way the ads read, you’d think 97 cents of each dollar goes to ""helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all.""

Now, the Lottery does note that $500 million dollars is returned ""to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds."" But, however you slice it, that $500 million is not 97 cents of each dollar played.

If you look at the big total, which includes the churn, that $500 million is about 5 percent of the Lottery revenues. With the smaller operating revenues budget, it’s a bit over 50 percent.

If the Lottery were really returning 97 percent of every dollar played to those programs, the state’s budget problems would be smaller by at least a billion dollars a biennium.

The Lottery argues that the prize money going back to players ultimately benefits the state’s economy -- that’s why some earlier ads simply said ""97 cents of every dollar played comes back to Oregon."" But even those ads mislead by highlighting state services.

And what’s more, winnings don’t necessarily stay here. If you win $1 million in the Oregon Lottery, would you spend it all in Oregon?

Baumann defended the earlier version but acknowledged that you could ""certainly misconstrue"" the meaning of the ad we’re ruling on.

We think it’s more than a matter of misconstruing meaning. For nearly two years, the Oregon Lottery has been running a disingenuous ad campaign that tries to paint playing the Lottery as giving back to schools, parks and other economic development projects. Yes, a piece of the revenue goes there -- but not 97 cents of every dollar played.  We think a state agency that deals with money in billions -- and spends nearly $13 million a year on advertising, market research and public information  -- should know better.

Facebook post says ""less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops, but 41 percent are on welfare""
","
A reader recently sent us a Facebook post with ""10 Illegal Alien Facts."" One of them was, ""Less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops, but 41 percent are on welfare.""

We’ll examine each part of the claim.

""Less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops""

Farming has traditionally been a common occupation for immigrants from Mexico and other countries south of the U.S. border, including many who are here illegally.

According to figures compiled in 2005 by the Pew Hispanic Center from Census Bureau data, 19 percent of farming, fishing and forest workers were illegal immigrants -- the highest proportion of any broad employment category Pew studied.

But as a share of all the jobs held by illegal immigrants in the country, farming does indeed represent a small percentage.

About 3 percent of illegal immigrants were working in farming and related sectors, according to Pew, which was well below the percentage working in service occupations (33 percent), construction and extractive jobs (17 percent), production, installation and repair (16 percent) and transportation and moving (8 percent). A subsequent Pew study pegged the number working in farming and related sectors slightly higher, at 4 percent.

Steven A. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, said it’s possible that during peak harvesting times, as many as 5 percent of the U.S. illegal immigrant population is working in agriculture. But in general, the statistics involving illegal immigrants are, not surprisingly, tricky to pin down. So we think that saying that ""less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops"" is reasonably accurate.

""41 percent (of illegal immigrants) are on welfare""

This half of the statement is more problematic.

The most detailed statistics we found were from Camarota’s group. In a 2007 report, the center published a table titled, ""Welfare Use for Illegal Alien-Headed Households."" The table reported that 40 percent of illegal immigrant-headed households used any ""major welfare"" program in the previous calendar year. The percentage was even higher in illegal-immigrant headed households that included children: a whopping 71 percent, according to a a 2011 report by the center.

So there is some basis for the 40 percent figure. However, it’s important to keep two bits of context in mind:

• This statistic addresses households headed by an illegal immigrant. However, many of these households include American citizens within the family, often children who were born in the United States and who received citizenship at birth. Indeed, given the web of restrictions on the granting of government benefits to illegal immigrants, most of the ""welfare"" benefits being counted in the CIS table are going to citizen children, not to adult illegal immigrants. Indeed, the government is responsible for checking the immigration status of people receiving benefits.

It’s true that some types of benefits, such as food stamps, can be shared among all members of a family. An illegal immigrant, for instance, may end up eating food bought with a citizen relative’s food stamps. Still, the Facebook post’s phrasing -- that 41 percent of illegal immigrants are on welfare -- is misleading because it ignores that the benefits in question are generally going to American citizens.

• We suspect that when many people hear the term ""welfare,"" they think of cash benefits. However, very little cash assistance is going to illegal immigrants. According to CIS, less than 1 percent of illegal-immigrant-headed households included anyone receiving direct government cash assistance, such as Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or state-run cash aid. This is not surprising: Illegal immigrants are generally barred from receiving such payments.

Instead, the kind of ""welfare"" these households received were primarily one of two types: health care or food.

In all, 27 percent of such households received coverage from Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor, while 33 percent received food assistance, such as free or reduced-price school lunches, food stamps, or benefits from the Women-Infants-Children program (WIC). As noted earlier, many of the recipients of these programs were actually citizen children of illegal immigrants. Few illegal immigrants received housing benefits, the other major category of assistance from the government, CIS found.

Medicaid and food assistance certainly qualify as government benefits, and they cost the taxpayers money. But it’s less clear that they fit the commonly understood definition of ""welfare.""

Our ruling

The Facebook post’s first claim, that ""less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops,"" is close to correct. The post’s second claim, that ""41 percent (of illegal immigrants) are on welfare"" is misleading. Most of the ""welfare"" benefits in question are going to U.S. citizens who live in illegal immigrant households, not directly to illegal immigrants, and very little of it comes in cash form, which is the traditional definition of ""welfare."" On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.","[('\nFacebook post, ""10 Illegal Alien Facts""', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=432620803435045&set=p.432620803435045&type=1&ref=nf'), ('\nPew Hispanic Center, ""Background Briefing Prepared for Task Force on Immigration and America\'s Future,"" June 14, 2005', 'No link'), ('\nPew Hispanic Center, ""Unauthorized Immigrant Population: National and State Trends, 2010,"" Feb. 1, 2011', 'http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/46.pdf'), ('\nCenter for Immigration Studies, ""Welfare Use by Immigrant Households with Children: A Look at Cash, Medicaid, Housing, and Food Programs,"" April 2011', 'No link'), ('\nCenter for Immigration Studies, ""Immigrants in the United States, 2007: A Profile of America’s Foreign-Born Population,"" November 2007', 'http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/02/01/unauthorized-immigrant-population-brnational-and-state-trends-2010/'), ('\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, ""Non-Citizen Requirements in the Food Stamp Program,"" Jan. 2003', 'No link'), ('\nInterview with Steven A.

Marco Rubio says U.S. admits 1 million immigrants a year, far more than any nation
","
During a Fox News interview on June 18, 2012, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., discussed immigration and said that ""a million people a year come into the U.S. legally. No other country even comes close to that figure.""

We’ll check these two claims in order.

""A million people a year come into the U.S. legally""

The numbers can get a little complicated, but all the experts we spoke to said Rubio was on solid ground.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the United States accepted 1,062,040 legal permanent residents in fiscal year 2011, a number that has been fairly steady over the past few years. Of this number, roughly 45 percent were new arrivals and about 55 percent were people already in the U.S. whose status was upgraded to ""permanent.""

Separately, the U.S. admitted more than 4.4 million people in 2010 on a long-term temporary basis, either for employment or study. This number does not include a much larger total (roughly 42 million people) admitted for shorter stays, including visitors for pleasure or short-term business.

So while one could say that 46 million people actually ""come into the U.S. legally,"" we’ll give Rubio the benefit of the doubt that he was referring to the 1 million who were granted permanent resident status, not those admitted on a temporary basis.

""No other country even comes close to that figure""

We looked at immigration statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research group for advanced industrialized nations.

Using 2009 statistics, the only nation that came close to the U.S. in permanent immigrant inflows was Germany. That year, the U.S. had 1,130,800 permanent immigrants, compared to 606,314 for Germany. So the U.S. had numbers about twice as big. The third-place finisher, Spain, had 469,300.

So Rubio’s correct on this point, too.

Some additional context

Without taking away from the accuracy of Rubio’s statements, we thought it would be worthwhile adding a bit of context.

There are actually many other countries that absorb immigrants at a higher rate than the U.S. does once you factor in the size of each nation’s population.

Using the measurement of permanent, annual immigrant inflows per overall population, the U.S. in 2009 ranked only 11th out of a selection of 28 advanced industrialized nations, trailing such countries as Australia, Austria, Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway and Ireland.

And using United Nations data on the cumulative number of resident immigrants as a share of total population, the U.S. ranks only 25th in the world. Some of the nations with higher immigrant percentages are small, oil-rich Arab countries with large foreign-worker populations, but others with higher rankings include Israel, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, Spain and Sweden.

On the other hand, the U.S. does diverge from most of the rest of the world on the rights granted immigrants once they are made permanent.

""Where the U.S. differs from most European countries is that the immigrants we admit are generally eligible for full membership in society through naturalization, and that the immigrants' U.S.-born children are automatically citizens with full rights,"" said Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center. ""Neither of these is generally the case in Europe.""

Rubio is right that ""a million people a year come into the U.S. legally"" and that ""no other country even comes close to that figure.""

Jim DeMint and other Republicans say Obama immigration plan is amnesty
","
After President Barack Obama unveiled a new immigration plan for young people who came to the U.S. illegally, it didn't take long for opponents to criticize the plan with a familiar word: amnesty.

Sen. Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, responded with a press release that said Obama's action on undocumented youth ""is amnesty."" That was echoed by other Republicans such as U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, who said ""President Obama's decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants is a breach of faith with the American people.""

The Obama plan, which does not require congressional approval, allows young people who came here illegally to apply for temporary relief from deportation. In a memo, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano gave immigration officers the leeway to grant that relief for up to two years at a time. They also can approve work permits.

Obama said it was the right thing to do for the economy and because ""we are a better nation than one that expels innocent young kids.""

He said, ""This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It’s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary, stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people.""

In this fact-check, we'll examine whether it is accurate to call the new Obama plan ""amnesty.""

DeMint’s spokesman, Wesley Denton, says the matter is straightforward.

""When people who are here unlawfully are told by the government that they will not be prosecuted and instead given a legal status and work permits, that’s amnesty,"" Denton says.

In the immigration debate, there is no word more loaded than amnesty. PolitiFact has done many fact-checks on various uses of the word and found it is more accurate when it’s applied to policies that lead to permanent legal status.

A tweet from Georgia congressman Paul Broun during the 2011 State of the Union address saying Obama ""is calling for amnesty"" took a rating of Half-True. While it lacked some necessary qualifiers, it referred to the president’s support for the DREAM Act, a bill that offers the possibility of citizenship.

It’s helpful to look at the legal definitions of amnesty.  

Black’s Law Dictionary defines it as ""a sovereign act of pardon and oblivion for past acts, granted by a government to all persons who have been guilty of crime."" The Legal Dictionary at the FreeDictionary.com offers more background and notes that ""an act of amnesty is generally granted to a group of people who have committed crimes against the state."" It gives the example from 1977 when President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty for Vietnam War draft dodgers.   

Overall, you can break amnesty into two elements, and it’s the second that really matters. It applies to a group of people who have broken the law. And it says to those people, you are permanently free from punishment for your offense.

The new Obama policy matches up on the first part but not the second. ""It does not forgive anything, nor does it create any new rights,"" says Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group that is supported by groups such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the World Bank.

Chishti emphasizes, ""You are still subject to deportation if the the government decides to do that.""

While some have said any relief from legal action is amnesty, whether it lasts for two years or forever, Chishti said the temporary nature of the Obama plan makes it significantly different than true amnesty. Indeed, the legal definitions provide examples where amnesty is permanent immunity from punishment.

Chishti’s group estimates that about 1.4 million undocumented residents would be eligible under the new program. How many actually come forward might depend on their assessment of the risks.  Ben Johnson, Executive Director of the American Immigration Council, a group that supports the move by Obama, agreed with Chishti's point that the policy offered people only temporary relief. He said anyone applying under the program has to understand that they will be giving immigration officials a lot of personal information.

""Two years from now, they might be more vulnerable"" to deportation, Johnson said.

But there's also the practical definition of amnesty. If the ax of deportation never falls, critics of the administration ask, was it ever really there? The Homeland Security memo lays out a program that would grant deportation relief for two years at a time, renewable for as long as the applicant is under 30 years old, after which they would no longer qualify for deferral. During that time, the person could, at local discretion, be granted a work permit.

While the White House made much of the temporary nature of the policy, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, isn’t buying it.

""There’s nothing as permanent as a temporary status,"" Krikorian says. He and other opponents of this approach to young illegal immigrants can’t imagine that after encouraging people to come forward and allowing them to work, the government would then turn around and deport them.

Still, we find it's a stretch to describe an enforcement plan as amnesty, a legal term that connotes broad and permanent protection. The people who are accepted into Obama's plan might not be deported immediately but they still could be in the future.

Our Ruling

DeMint and other critics say the Obama plan is amnesty, but the facts of the plan indicate it's an exaggeration to describe it that way.

Legally, amnesty focuses on a group of people and grants them a permanent pardon. The Obama administration’s policy could reasonably be said to focus on a group, but deferring deportation is not the same as forgiveness and the relief it offers is limited in time. Concerns about where this policy might lead are a valid topic for discussion, but go beyond what the policy actually says.
