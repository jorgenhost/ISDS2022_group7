Interim CEO mostly right on DeKalb police, firefighter hiring
","Public safety is one of the top issues voters cite when creating new cities. So it’s no surprise that interim CEO Lee May would highlight growth in the police and fire departments in DeKalb County – where four new towns are being discussed on the neighborhood and legislative levels. ""Since taking on this position, we have graduated five police academies and three fire academies,"" May said during his recent State of the County address. ""This is proving to make our neighborhoods safer places for our children and families to grow."" The claim would put DeKalb on pace to reach an ambitious goal May laid out in Fall 2013: Hire 160  police officers and 100 firefighters every year for three years to halt a hemorrhage of public safety workers that hurt the morale of workers and taxpayers. But with the press for new cities in the county, and more calls for existing cities to annex neighborhoods, did DeKalb actually hit its annual goal? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. Gov. Nathan Deal tapped May to serve as CEO in July 2013, replacing CEO Burrell Ellis, who is suspended while he faces corruption charges. That put May in charge of preparing the 2014 budget, to be amended and approved by the County Commission. May took over just as DeKalb, like many local jurisdictions, was seeing a small rebound from the collapse in the housing market. The county, also like others, had suffered through the revenue losses in part by cutting jobs or keeping positions unfilled, including those in public safety. In September 2013, DeKalb had 915 police officers to fill 1,100 slots. There were 600 firefighters for 789 positions. Worse, the county also lost more officers and firefighters than it could hire through its training academies, which can take up to 26 weeks to complete. In four years, DeKalb hired 277 police officers while 400 left. The fire department’s attrition was even worse: hiring 71 firefighters in four years, while 236 departed. The end of the economic downturn helped boost last year’s budget by $25 million, to $584 million for the general fund. The county set aside $6.6 million and $2.9 of the extra money to hire additional officers and firefighters, budget records show. And both departments held recruit academies for applicants who already passed basic job requirements. For police, the training lasts three weeks for state-certified officers from elsewhere in Georgia, seven weeks for certified officers from other states, and 26 weeks for all candidates with no previous police experience. The dates and number of hires were: 97th Police Academy, graduated Feb. 14, 2014 – 29. 98th Police Academy, graduated May 30, 2014 – 32. 99th Police Academy, graduated July 31, 2014 – 33. 100th Police Academy, graduated Sept. 26, 2014 – 22. 101st Police Academy, graduated Jan. 16, 2015 – 35. Total hired: 151. That puts the police department at 94 percent of its annual goal. But the overall numbers actually fell. As of Feb. 1, DeKalb had 859 sworn officers, out of 1,060 authorized sworn positions – tumbling from 83 percent filled to 81 percent filled since May took over. Interim Police Chief James Conroy said that the challenge was ramping up the training after going nearly all of 2013 without any academies – all while losing officers. Momentum is on the county’s side, Conroy added. The current academy, the 102nd, has 26 recruits enrolled for a May graduation. Recruitment and retention efforts in the fire/rescue department were better. The department held two general firefighter academies, graduating in February and September. Training includes the courses required for basic firefighters, which takes 18-20 weeks, and also includes advanced EMT training. For recruits with no previous experience, the academy can take up to 10 ½ months. That means the graduates in 2014 may have started with DeKalb in 2013, hired as recruits. But the county also hired 85 additional recruits in September, and 15 more in October, to hit its annual goal of 100 new firefighters, according to Fire Chief Darnell Fullum. The first group from that academy will graduate in April and be placed in stations. ""I know we have met our initiative,"" Fullum said. And, as of Feb. 1, the department had 659 sworn firefighters for 671 spots. That meant the department was 98 percent filled, compared to 76 percent when May started.. May said he considers the aggressive hiring effort a success in both departments, noting that 2014 was just the first year of a three-year effort that will be measured as one initiative. County leaders knew not every recruit who entered the academy would graduate and serve, he added, noting DeKalb is getting better at identifying candidates who will be successful. ""We still have space, in terms of authorized positions, to get us to our goals,"" May said. ""We are communicating as best we can, to everyone from the public to our employees, that public safety is our top priority and we intend to see results."" That means DeKalb is taking strides towards its overall goal, of hiring 480 police officers and 300 firefighters by the end of 2016. So where does that leave us? May said that the county had held five police academies and three fire/rescue academies in 2014. He is right on the number of academies, but off on what that means. Being spot on with the amount of training underway for DeKalb’s hiring binge in public safety doesn’t translate into the goals of that training being fully met.

Beyer says middle class incomes have been flat since 1979
","U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, recently called on Congress to ""jump start"" the economy for middle-class Americans. ""If you look at the income of average Americans -- working-class Americans, middle-class Americans -- they’re absolutely flat in constant dollars since 1979,"" Beyer said during a Feb. 4 speech to the Arlington County Democratic Party. We reviewed his claim. Tia Shuyler, Beyer’s press secretary, said her boss heard about the statistic late last year during an orientation for freshmen congressmen at Harvard University. She also sent us an October 2014 article from the Pew Research Center headlined, ""For most workers, real wages have barely budged in decades."" Pew relied on statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Let’s take a closer look: The data that measure  Beyer’s claim are called ""median usual weekly earnings."" To compute it, BLS compiles the gross weekly paycheck earnings of a sample of all private sector employees in all industries, then establishes the midpoint figure at which half of the workers are earning more and half are earning less. At the start of 1979 -- as far back as the data goes -- median weekly pay was $232 in unadjusted dollars and that rose to $796 during the final quarter of 2014. When adjusted for inflation, the figures don’t move much. The early 1979 weekly pay is worth $757 in 2014 dollars. So in constant dollars, median weekly pay rose by $39 from the start of 1979 to the end of last year, a 5 percent increase. Beyer, of course, said the inflation-adjusted numbers are ""absolutely flat"" since 1979. The BLS data support his claim if you start counting in the third quarter of 1979 when median weekly pay was worth $792 in today’s money. That results in a $1 weekly decline in median earnings over the last 35 years, or about one-tenth of 1 percent. The status of the middle class is an emerging issue moving towards next year’s presidential elections. Several studies show that the holdings of the top 1 percent have soared during recent decades, spurring many Democrats to complain about a growing gap between the wealthy and the middle class. The BLS figures Beyer relies on are not the final word on median income, according to Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan research group. Another way of looking at it, he said, is to use data from the U.S. Census Bureau. It shows median household income before taxes, using 2013 dollars, rose from $49,225 in 1979 to $51,939 in 2013, an increase of 5.5 percent. That’s pretty close to flat growth. But Burtless said widely used methods of examining gross income undercounts certain forms of compensation and gives short shrift to middle class gains over the decades. Burtless prefers a broader measure of income used by the Congressional Budget Office in a November 2014 report. The CBO based it’s computation of household earnings on several factors, including after-tax wages, other earnings, retirement income and benefits including employer-based health coverage and government subsidies. The CBO concluded that median household after-tax income, when adjusted in 2011 dollars, was $26,200 in 1979 and $38,500 in 2011, the latest year figures that were available. That’s a 47 percent increase. Broken down on an annual basis, that comes out to a 1.3 percent income increase each year. Our ruling Beyer says the income of middle-class Americans has been ""absolutely flat"" since 1979. He supports that claim by pointing to oft-cited Bureau of Labor and Statistics data showing little or no inflation-adjusted growth in the median gross wage of workers over the last 35 years. An analysis of Census Bureau data yields similar results. Economists, however, define income in far broader terms than individual gross wages. A wider examination of income by the Congressional Budget Office -- which includes other earnings, benefits and tax payments -- shows median household income has increased by 47 percent over the last generation. So there’s plenty of evidence backing Beyer’s claim, but it doesn’t win unanimous support from economists.

Ted Cruz says Obama refuses to directly arm Kurds in ISIS fight
","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said that arming the Iraqi Kurds is key in the fight against the Islamic State -- but the United States isn’t doing enough in that regard. On NBC’s Meet the Press Feb. 8, Secretary of State John Kerry defended the United States’ current policy regarding the Kurds -- an ethnic group partially located in northern Iraq, in and around cities under Islamic State control. ""We have supplied (the Kurds) with enormous amount of ammunition, weapons, other things. And others are supplying them,"" he said. Cruz characterized the situation differently. ""What makes no sense whatsoever is the Obama administration is refusing to directly arm the Kurds,"" he said the same day on CNN's State of the Union. ""We need to arm the Kurds now because they are our boots on the ground."" Later he said, ""But we're not seeing leadership from the administration to get that done. Instead, they continue to send weaponry to Baghdad, who doesn't pass it onto the Peshmerga (the Kurdish military), and it doesn't get put to use effectively."" With Kerry touting how much military aid the administration is providing, we wondered how Cruz’s claim that they are ""refusing to directly arm the Kurds"" stacks up. The key word in Cruz’s claim is ""directly."" The United States is in fact sending arms and military assistance intended for the Kurds. However, it has to go through the Iraqi government, and some see that as a road block. Direct vs. indirect To make sense of this debate, it’s crucial to understand that the Kurds are a semi-autonomous group. They clash with the Iraqi government in Baghdad because the Kurds -- along with Kurds in Iran, Turkey and Syria -- would like to be an independent nation. Leaders in Baghdad and the United States want Iraq to keep its current borders. However, cooperation between the Iraqi government and the Iraqi Kurds has appeared to improve recently due to the joint goal of defeating the Islamic State. The Iraqi government and the Kurds also recently reached a deal temporarily ending a dispute over oil in the Kurdish region. This recent interactive map out of Britain’s Financial Times shows locations of the Islamic State, Kurds and other Iraqi factions. A State Department official told us that the United States has so far transported more than 3 million pounds of equipment to Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish Regional Government. These shipments have included: over 15,000 hand grenades, nearly 40 million rounds of machine gun ammunition, 18,000 assault rifles, 45,000 mortar rounds, 40,000 RPG rounds and 2,800 RPG launchers. The United States has also been training Kurdish forces and conducting air strikes on their behalf. However, because the Kurds are not a fully independent nation, the United States must coordinate these transfers through the Iraqi government in Baghdad. It’s not that they’re refusing to directly arm the Kurds, as Cruz says, though. It’s the law, required by the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act. Additionally, the United Nations prohibits transferring arms to Iraq other than on terms agreed to by the Iraqi government. The State Department told us that the Iraqi government has approved all shipments and has even provided its own weapons to the Kurds. But Cruz and others argue that this plan hasn’t achieved its intended goal because the Iraqi government withholds much of the military assistance. Quite a few Kurds have reported that they don’t have enough weapons, or they simply haven’t received the weapons the United States promised. ""We are starting to have doubts that there might be a political decision on what sort of equipment should be given to the Kurds,"" Masrour Barzani, chancellor of the Kurdistan Region Security Council, told Bloomberg’s Eli Lake. ""We don’t think this is just a technical issue. It’s been way too long for any technical issue."" Lake noted that the State Department disputed this characterization. Based on recent conversations with Kurdish sources, Michael Gunter, a professor at Tennessee Tech University, said it’s true that the Iraqi government has stalled American weapons shipments intended for the Kurds. Gunter has written several books about the Kurds and visited the region in September. He noted that there’s not much the United States could do legally to step over the Iraqi government and give weapons directly to the Kurds. That is, other than transferring the weapons covertly, which Gunter believes is already happening. For the record, the CIA declined to comment for this story, but there are reports that the agency is providing arms. Given their strategic location and reputation as relatively moderate Muslims, the Iraqi Kurds have significant advantages in the fight against the Islamic State. So why might the Iraqi government not want the Kurds to have these weapons? Gunter said Iraq is mainly concerned with making sure that the Kurds don’t break away. So they give the Kurds just enough weapons to get by, but not so much that they would be able to later turn against the Iraqi government. The United States faces a similar problem when considering how hard to pressure Iraq to ensure the weapons intended for the Kurds make it there. ""To one extent, we want to give the Kurds more weapons so they can fight ISIS, but if we give them too many weapons it, might break up Iraq or make the government even more mad at us,"" Gunter said. ""It’s almost a catch-22 situation."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""the Obama administration is refusing to directly arm the Kurds."" The administration has sent a significant amount of arms and other aid to the Iraqi Kurds to assist in the fight against the Islamic State. However, Cruz is right to say that this aid is indirect -- it has to go through the Iraqi government under current law. While the administration insists that this process works, policymakers like Cruz, as well as Kurds and an expert with knowledge of the situation on the ground, have said that the Iraqi government has stopped some of these weapons from reaching their intended destinations. Cruz might have been better off not using the word ""refusing,"" however. There are domestic laws and United Nations regulations -- as well as diplomatic considerations -- preventing the United States from directly arming the Kurds. Cruz’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-obama-refuses-directly-arm-kurds-isi/

Katty Kay: Countries in Africa 'have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States'
","Sunday show talking heads continued to debate vaccinations of children -- specifically, how there should be no debate -- as they analyzed political missteps from the past week. BBC World News America anchor Katherine ""Katty"" Kay made a startling comparison to highlight how Americans have been less diligent in making sure their children are properly immunized. ""There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States,"" Kay said on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""Because when people really need it, and they see the effects that measles can have on their communities, they will make sure that their children vaccinate."" Rhetoric about the measles outbreak stemming from Disneyland in California, home to a significant measles-resistant population, is keeping PunditFact and PolitiFact busy. We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kay’s claim. While we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kay’s source. The World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, maintains immunization rates for the measles vaccine among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013. There were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percent for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in 2013, according to the WHO data. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts the measles immunization rate in the United States is 91.9 percent. But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.) The countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. United States  91 percent * Algeria 95 percent Botswana 94 percent Burundi 98 percent Egypt 96 percent Eritrea 96 percent Gambia 96 percent Kenya 93 percent Lesotho 92 percent Libya 98 percent Mauritius 99 percent Morocco 99 percent Rwanda 97 percent Seychelles 97 percent Tanzania 99 percent Tunisia 94 percent Zimbabwe 93 percent   Of course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent). More broadly, it’s not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States’ include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. South Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a Feb. 5 press release highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a ""major public health success"" that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day. Still, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. Reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations millenium goals. Unlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added. ""I’m old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available,"" Troisi said, ""and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason we’re seeing this refusal is because parents haven’t seen what these diseases can do."" Because we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about 319 million, making it the third-most populated country. China, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent. Our ruling Kay said, ""There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States."" We found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.

House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello says Rhode Island didn't cut taxes on the rich
","Taxes were one of the topics that WJAR-TV reporter Bill Rappleye raised when he interviewed House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello during the Jan. 18 edition of ""10 News Conference."" Rappleye referred to a report showing that poor people in Rhode Island pay more taxes per person than in other states. Then he asked Mattiello, "" Is there a way to change that?"" The speaker said the solution was to, ""Lift up the middle class."" ""Our middle class revenue is just not what it should be,"" Mattiello said. ""Let's lift everybody up and we'll be competitive with other states. So that's my approach for dealing with it, not changing rates and not charging our more successful folks more money. I think the middle class has been squeezed for a long time."" ""And the tax cuts for the rich don't contribute to that?"" Rappleye said. ""There haven't been tax cuts for the rich. I'm not sure when folks refer to that, I'm not sure what they're referring to. So if you can point to the tax cuts for the rich, I'll be happy to consider that,"" Mattiello said. ""But, realistically, there's never been tax cuts for the rich."" That sparked an immediate request from a few readers to have PolitiFact Rhode Island check his assertion. One reason: in 2010, the General Assembly, when Mattiello was House Majority Leader, lowered the top tax rate for the state's highest earners. That rate was 9.9 percent for income that exceeded $336,550 and in state-by-state rankings, it stood out like stink bomb at a flower show. So the legislature, with the blessing of then-Governor Donald Carcieri, brought the top rate down to 5.99 percent. Thus was born the idea that Rhode Island had given a big tax break for the rich, prompting calls by some legislators to bump the rate up to 7.99 percent for all earnings above $250,000. But, as in all things taxes, it's not that simple. We'll return to the 2010 changes. But first we should travel further back to 2006, a year before Mattiello joined the General Assembly and the year a tax overhaul passed that was designed to increasingly benefit the wealthy Instead of the top tax rate of 9.9 percent, the legislature and then-Governor Donald Carcieri gave taxpayers the option of paying a flat 8.0 percent of their adjusted gross income if they gave up taking credits and deductions. Each subsequent year, that tax cap dropped another 0.5 percentage points. It would have fallen to 5.5 percent if the General Assembly hadn't done its 2010 tax overhaul. When it was proposed, the 2006 change wasn't billed as just a tax cut for the rich. In announcing the plan, then-House Majority Leader Gordon Fox told the conservative Heartland Institute, ""This will undoubtedly help the state's highest wage-earners. But I am proud that this tax package also helps low-income wage earners and the middle class."" As Larry Berman, Fox's spokesman pointed out to Heartland at the time, the plan was designed to entice the well-to-do. ""These are people making $250,000 and above, and when they want to create jobs, they look at Massachusetts and see a 5.3 percent income tax, Connecticut with a 5.0 percent tax, and Rhode Island with a 9.9 percent tax. They make a choice on where to move and create jobs, and that difference in tax rates is a big factor in the choice they make."" So this was clearly an effort to entice the rich and bring them to -- or keep them in -- Rhode Island. In each succeeding year, as the percentage fell, more well-off taxpayers took advantage of it. So by the time the 2010 tax law lowering the top rate was passed, many of the rich weren't paying taxes at the 9.9 percent rate anyway. On the other side of the ledger, in 2009 the rich took a hit when the legislature approved another bill, one that taxed capital gains, which is the profit from the sale of stocks and other investments, as regular income. Capital gains had been taxed at a special reduced rate. Now back to the 2010 legislation, and the tax rates now in effect. Those tax changes did more than lower the top rate. It rejiggered the whole tax structure. Instead of the 9.9 percent rate kicking in for income that exceeded $336,550, the new 5.99 percent rate applied to all income above $135,000. Five levels of taxation were transformed into three. The standard deduction went up. So did the personal exemption. The legislation also phased out most credits and itemized deductions as a person's  income rose, and shifted some of the tax burden to non-residents. When we asked Mattiello's office about the Speaker's claim, Berman sent us a projection from the state's Office of Revenue Analysis done when the changes were being considered. It used tax data from 2008 and compared what people would pay under the old and new systems. We also looked at a later analysis done at the end of 2010, after passage. Both showed the same pattern. Here are the December 2010 numbers: Adjusted gross income Change in average tax paid Number of returns $1 to $12,500 $13 decrease 109,181 $12,501 to $20,000 $29 decrease 61,217 $20,001 to $30,000 $35 decrease 68,407 $30,001 to $40,000 $21 decrease 55,383 $40,001 to $55,000 $24 decrease 62,776 $55,001 to $75,000 $64 decrease 63,230 $75,001 to $110,000 $91 decrease 70,347 $110,001 to $175,000 $350 decrease 48,206 $175,001 to $250,000 $113 increase 14,322 $250,001 to $500,000 $152 increase 9,791 $500,001 to $1 million $955 increase 3,561 $1 million to $5 million $2,276 increase 2,276 $5 million to $10 million $5,159 increase 269 Over $10 million $9,562 increase 340 So compared to what the average tax bill would have been without the changes, higher-income taxpayers -- those with adjusted gross incomes of over $175,000 -- actually paid more. The average filer in that group (representing about 8 percent of filers) paid $574 extra compared to what they would have paid under the previous system. So the rich did not get a big tax break from this law. Finally, there was a major change in the estate tax that passed in 2014. Under the old system, if an estate was worth $921,655 or less, no estate tax was assessed. But if the value was even a dollar higher, the full value of the estate was taxed. Under the 2014 change, the tax only kicks in when the estate is valued at more than $1.5 million. More importantly, the all-or-nothing provision, sometimes called ""the cliff,""  was eliminated and only the portion in excess of $1.5 million is subject to the tax. In addition, the limit is now tied to inflation. The change translates into a collective tax savings of $64,400 to the heirs of someone whose estate is worth more than $1.5 million. The degree to which this change benefited the rich is a matter of debate. If you believe, to paraphrase Mitt Romney, ""Estates are people too,"" than this was a big tax break for the wealthy, saving them up to $64,400 in taxes per estate. In addition, supporters of the proposal said it was designed to prevent wealthy people from leaving the state before they die. Wealth tends to run in families, and not a lot of poor people were lobbying for this tax break. But just because someone's a millionaire doesn't mean that their heirs are rich, and the heirs are the ones who get extra inheritance, thanks to the new law. ""The middle income got the best break because they got rid of the cliff,"" said John Simmons, executive director of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. ""I think the old system was hurting a lot of lower income people,"" said Patricia Thompson, former chairwoman of the federal and state taxation committee of the Rhode Island Society of Certified Public Accountants. ""The wealthy will get a break because the exemption is raised to $1.5 million just as everyone else would, but I wouldn't say it was geared to them at all."" Thompson and other people we interviewed suggested that the best source of information on this would come from Paul Dion, chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis for the Rhode Island Department of Revenue. But Gov. Gina Raimondo's office refused to make Dion available for an interview. Our ruling House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said, ""There haven't been tax cuts for the rich"" in Rhode Island. He later specified a time frame: Never. The 2010 tax changes -- which dropped the top tax rate by four percentage points -- is often regarded as a tax cut for the rich, but the wealthy actually paid more. They also paid more after the 2009 change, which called for taxing capital gains as ordinary income. But we only had to go back to 2006 to find tax legislation that argues against his point. Although no longer in effect, it imposed an ever-lower cap on state taxes that benefitted more and more rich people as the tax cap dropped lower and lower. And the 2014  change in the estate tax meant that wealthier estates weren't taxed as heavily. Overall, we believe the rich disproportionately benefit from this change even though all heirs, paupers and princes alike, get the same break. On balance, the PolitiFact Rhode Island judges rate his statement False.

Paul Stekler says Louisiana's rich incentives caused a 'Texas' movie to be made in New Orleans
","Texans oft think everything — everythang — is bigger and better here. So we were startled when a University of Texas professor declared neighboring Louisiana has a big leg up. Paul Stekler, who chairs the UT Department of Radio-Television-Film, said in a commentary posted online by the Austin American-Statesman Jan. 23, 2015, that the Texas film industry may be imperiled unless state lawmakers bolster a state incentives program. Things were dandy a decade ago after Texas launched its program to encourage film production in the state, Stekler wrote. But other states beefed up, Stekler said, adding: ""The biggest program is in Louisiana — so big that they actually shot an upcoming film initially titled ‘Don’t Mess With Texas’ in New Orleans!"" Neaux way! By phone, Stekler told us his conclusion about the Louisiana incentives causing the movie centered on Texas to be made in the Crescent City was just ""common sense. If it’s a Texas-based film, why would you film in Louisiana — unless they were getting a much better deal?"" he said. He urged us to consult the Texas Film Commission, which is part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s office. Abbott’s office did not address our inquiries, but we spotted a summary of the Texas program’s declared effects in a January 2015 report by the Texas House Select Committee on Economic Development Incentives. By offering rebates to successful applicants with confirmed in-state expenditures, Texas had awarded nearly $147 million in rebates through October 2014, the report said. In turn, awardees spent more than $1 billion in the state over the years, it said. Next, we turned to checking on the Louisiana parts of Stekler’s statement. An online search landed a May 2014 New Orleans Times-Picayune news story saying ""Don't Mess With Texas,"" an action-comedy starring Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara, was to be filmed in Louisiana starting that month. For Witherspoon, the story said, the production marked a return to New Orleans: She was born there in 1976 while her father was in school. The story made no mention of  incentives causing the film not to be shot in Texas. But incentives are in play. Christopher Stelly, who oversees the state’s film outreach, confirmed the film’s producers submitted an application for incentive credits and anticipated spending about $34 million in Louisiana. As of February 2015, Stelly said by email, the state hadn’t fielded an audit to validate any related spending so credits had yet to be awarded. We asked if Louisiana has the nation’s biggest film incentives program, as Stekler wrote. ""We have one of the more popular programs,"" Stelly said by phone. A state spokesman, Ron Thibodeaux, forwarded an April 2013 report written for a state agency indicating that in 2012, $218 million in incentives were awarded to producers who spent $717 million making movies in Louisiana (up from $677 million spending the year before). By a recent news account, the Louisiana program is bigger than other states’ programs. The Dec. 2, 2014, news story in the Advocate, a Louisiana newspaper, called the state’s film tax incentive program ""one of the state’s most popular and fastest-growing giveaways, and thanks to its industry-friendly provisions, the Pelican State has eclipsed Hollywood as the feature film production capital of the nation."" Of 107 projects shot in the state in 2013, the story said, 49 were feature films — more than were filmed in any other state. Also, the story said, Louisiana’s program is the ""richest of its kind"" in the country, covering ""between 30 and 35 percent of in-state production costs, including eight-figure actor salaries, as long as a film’s local costs top $300,000."" A graphic with the story, attributed to Cast & Crew Entertainment Services, which vends payroll services to productions, indicates each of the states touching Texas offers greater tax incentives for making movies:    Source: News story, ""Giving Away Louisiana: Film tax incentives,"", the Advocate, Dec. 2, 2014 (Map information attributed to Cast and Crew Entertainment Services) We asked Stelly if the movie singled out by Stekler was made in Louisiana due to its incentives outpacing incentives available in Texas. He said he didn’t know. But generally, Stelly said, ""the way the business works today, incentives do play a major part in the decision-making process. But again, at the end of the day, you have to look at what the area has to offer. How is the crew base? What is the infrastructure? Do you have what it takes?"" Louisiana, he said, has hosted projects set ""anywhere from New York to outer space,"" including ""Texas Killing Fields,"" a 2011 crime drama. We asked a publicist for the film itself about whether Louisiana’s incentives caused the movie to be made there. Jayna Zelman, representing MGM, declined to comment though she emailed a web link to an Internet Movie Database (IMDb) page stating the movie, set for release in May 2015, is lately named ""Hot Pursuit."" Plot summary: ""A police officer and a prisoner are on the run in Texas."" A linked IMDb page says the movie’s previous working title was ""Don’t Mess With Texas."" Our ruling Stekler said Louisiana’s film incentives program is so big, ""they actually shot an upcoming film initially titled ‘Don’t Mess With Texas’ in New Orleans!"" Louisiana has a strong incentives program and a chase movie set in Texas was filmed there; its makers are primed to receive incentive aid. However, we see no confirmation Louisiana’s incentives explain why the movie was shot on the not-Texas side of the Sabine. We rate this partly proven statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Molly White says Muslim group recently designated terrorist organization by United Arab Emirates
","A Texas legislator who says she asks U.S. Muslims if they renounce terrorism prompted a viral firestorm online with a Facebook post. She followed that up with an explanation, saying the organization behind Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin had been labeled a terrorist group. In her Feb. 3, 2015, web post, ""My Response to the Critics,"" state Rep. Molly White, R-Belton, said her Facebook statement posted Jan. 29, 2015 as Muslims came to the Capitol was misconstrued ""into something intolerant, bigoted and anti-American."" Here’s her original Facebook post, as later highlighted by the Texas Tribune:    In her February follow-up, White wrote: ""As a legislator who has the responsibility to look out for and protect the safety as well as liberties of my constituents and all Texans, it remains my duty to stay vigilant and inform the public about maintaining our rule of law and protecting our 1st Amendment freedoms."" ""First,"" she wrote, ""the genesis of my statement occurred when the organization CAIR was brought to my attention. CAIR, Council on American-Islamic Relations, started Muslim Day at the Texas Capitol in 2003."" Sarwat Husain, a council leader from San Antonio, told us by email the day at the Capitol was started by Texas Muslim groups including the council, which took charge of the gathering starting in 2011. ""Second,"" White’s response said, ""it is worth noting that CAIR was recently listed as one of 82 organizations designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates. That’s right, an Islamic country listed the organization that hosts Muslim Day in Texas as one of 82 terrorist organizations."" For real? Legislator cites news story White’s response included a web link to a November 2014 Fox News story stating the UAE, a tiny oil-rich federation on the Arabian Peninsula, had just designated CAIR a terrorist group on a list including extremists such as the Islamic State and Al Nusra, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. The story also quoted the council calling on the UAE to remove CAIR, the Muslim American Society and other ""civil society organizations"" from the list, saying its own inclusion was a ""bizarre move."" The council, headquartered on Capitol Hill, says it was founded in 1994 to challenge stereotypes of Islam and Muslims. Its Houston-based Texas chapter was founded in 2002. Advocating terrorism isn’t a declared activity. The council says on its website: ""CAIR believes that Muslims worldwide must offer themselves as personal examples of the Islamic values of compassion, tolerance and moderation. We encourage members of the American Muslim community to work in public service."" Also: ""We have a well-established, very public record of denouncing terrorism and religious intolerance."" Council listed as terrorist group In contrast, the UAE named the council a terrorist organization in November 2014. Online, we spotted a full government-issued list of more than 80 groups, including al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, al Shabab and Boko Haram--and CAIR. A Nov. 20, 2014, news story on GulfNews.com said the list designating terrorist organizations around the world had been issued by the government’s cabinet Nov. 15, 2014, in line with an anti-terror law issued in August 2014 by the nation’s president, Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Under the law, the story said, any individual or group that even communicates with a group on the list commits an offense. The story said the list would be reviewed by the government at least once a year. According to the story, Anwar Mohammad Gargash, a government minister, said most objections were from groups tied to the Muslim Brotherhood and ""many of them have engaged in incitement and the creation of an atmosphere of extremism."" CAIR was not singled out. As PolitiFact noted in 2013, the Brotherhood is an Islamic political and social movement founded in Egypt nearly 90 years ago that has millions of members throughout the Middle East. In Egypt and other countries, the Brotherhood has frequently been oppressed. After Hosni Mubarak was ousted from the Egyptian presidency in 2011, the group was legalized. But the year after Mohamed Morsi, the Brotherhood’s candidate for president, won election in 2012, he was overthrown in a military coup and arrested. In an interview with Fox News posted online Nov. 21, 2014, UAE’s foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, was asked why its list included the council and the U.S.-based Muslim American Society, which expressed shock at its inclusion. The minister replied: ""Our threshold is quite low when we talk about extremism. We cannot accept incitement or funding when we look at some of these organizations. I mean, for many countries, the definition of terror is that you have to carry a weapon and terrorize people. For us, it’s far beyond that. We cannot tolerate even the smallest and the tiniest amount of terrorism."" He did not offer specifics (nor was he asked to do so). On Nov. 17, 2014, foreign-affairs reporter Adam Taylor said in a Washington Post news blog post that a significant number of the ""more surprising inclusions on the list appear to have ties to"" the Muslim Brotherhood: ""The Muslim American Society, for instance, was founded by Muslim Brotherhood members in the 1990s. Rumors about links to the Muslim Brotherhood have also dogged CAIR,"" Taylor wrote. We contacted the council. National spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said the council has no connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. Asked about the UAE minister’s statement, Hooper emailed: ""We are one of the nation's most vocal advocates for constitutionally-protected civil liberties. That is hardly ‘incitement.’ And we do not ‘fund’ anyone."" State Department doubts Hooper further pointed out C-SPAN video of a State Department spokesman, Jeff Rathke, saying Nov. 18, 2014: ""The United States does not consider these U.S. organizations to be terrorist organizations,"" going on to specify the council and Muslim American Society by name. Rathke also said the government was asking the UAE for more information.  (See the State Department transcript here.) The council doesn’t appear on the State Department’s list of designated terrorist organizations. Another council official, Corey Saylor, suggested by email that many groups did not belong on the UAE list. Other analyses A Nov. 25, 2014, news story in the Daily Mail, a British newspaper, quoted experts including Frederic Wehrey at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace saying that by listing groups like the council, Islamic Relief UK and some of the largest Muslim associations in Finland, Norway, Sweden and other European countries, ""the UAE is pushing its view that the fight against militant Islamism is as much an ideological war as a conventional one. The real target of the list,"" Wehrey said, is ""politically active Islamism."" Wehry went on: ""(The UAE) is trying to include non-violent, Brotherhood-affiliated groups in the same ideological constellation as real terrorist groups like (Nigeria's) Boko Haram and Al-Qaeda,"" he said. Andrew Hammond, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations' Middle East and North Africa program, said: ""I think the criteria (for the list) has been to look at anything that could have even a remote link to the Muslim Brotherhood."" More recently, according to a Jan. 17, 2015, news story on ArabianBusiness.com, the UAE has agreed to allow groups to appeal listing decisions to the government’s Ministry of Justice; the story said Jenifer Wicks, the council’s civil rights litigation director, had recently ""submitted documents seeking to appeal the designation."" Unindicted co-conspirators? Next, we asked Hooper and Saylor about CAIR in 2007 being named among 300 others as an unindicted co-conspirator in a U.S. case regarding funding to the extremist group Hamas, as Fox News said in the news story noted by White. Saylor said the council was identified that way along with other groups with interests in Muslim or Palestinian issues. In October 2010, Saylor said, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the government had violated the Fifth Amendment rights of another group named as an unindicted co-conspirator — and by implication the council and other groups, Saylor said. The court, saying the government inappropriately failed to file the list ""under seal,"" also said inclusion on the list was the result of ""simply an untested allegation of the government made in anticipation of a possible evidentiary dispute that never came to pass."" In March 2011, the Washington Post noted a federal judge, Jorge A. Solis, denied the council’s request to be stricken from the list of unindicted co-conspirators. Regardless, the story said, the council had never been charged with criminal activity. Reporter Glenn Kessler summed up: ""The repeated references to CAIR being an ‘unindicted co-conspirator’ is one of those true facts that ultimately gives a false impression."" Footnote: White’s February response also noted a Texas Tribune news story revealing her concern that one of CAIR’s Texas leaders, Mustafa Carroll, said at a Capitol rally in 2013 that practicing Muslims ""are above the law of the land."" White’s quotation of Carroll was incomplete, the Tribune said, in that Carroll had prefaced his comment by saying: ""Following the law of the land is part of Sharia. And we follow the law of the land."" Carroll told the Tribune that by saying Muslims were ""above the law,"" he meant practicing Muslims should ""behave in a way that would put them above any possibility of breaking the law."" Our ruling White said the council, which organized Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin, ""was recently listed as one of 82 organizations designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates."" So it was. However, her statement failed to note the U.S. government shortly disagreed with the council’s inclusion on the list, saying it doesn’t consider the council a terrorist group. For our part, too, we found no independent indicator the council merits identification as a terrorist organization. On balance, we rate this singling out of a seemingly flawed designation Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"['Abortion', 'New Hampshire', 'Miscellany Blue']","
Liberal blog says NH lawmaker targets Planned Parenthood for 'cutting children into small pieces'
","Funding for Planned Parenthood has become a divisive issue in New Hampshire over the past few years. Republicans have repeatedly tried to redirect taxpayer money away from family planning services because the funds go to organizations that also perform abortions. The group at the center of these debates is Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, which bills itself as the largest reproductive health care provider in the region. And this year is no different. A recent headline in a liberal blog caught our eye: ""Lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’"" It appeared on the liberal Miscellany Blue website. We’re not checking whether it’s accurate for Groen to say abortions are equivalent to ""cutting children into small pieces,"" in this fact check. Instead we’ll look at the history of the bill and whether any state legislators uttered those words. The article points to State Rep. Warren Groen, a Rochester Republican, as both the sponsor of a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and the source of the quote. At the time the blog post was written, author William Tucker says, Groen was identified as the sole sponsor on a legislative services request. The full bill has since been written and posted online as HB 677. It’s now co-sponsored with Republican Rep. Richard Gordon of East Kingston. Neither current bill -- titled ""an act prohibiting the use of public funds for abortion services"" -- nor an earlier version introduced in 2011 target a specific, named group. Instead, they would affect all health care providers that also offer abortion services. The bill suggests that taxpayer dollars going to these groups indirectly subsidize abortions by paying for ""administrative costs, overhead, employee salaries, rent, utilities, and various other expenses,"" and seeks to ban such funding. Of the affected providers, Planned Parenthood is by far the biggest. For 2014-15, it received $737,586 from state contracts, while the Concord Feminist Health Center received $73,218 and the Joan G. Lovering Health Center in Greenland received $89,214. It’s important to note that the state already bars direct public funding for abortions through Medicaid except in case of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother. Groen’s bill specifically targets funding for other health services provided by Planned Parenthood and similar agencies. The blog headline is close to accurate, but it oversimplifies somewhat. The measure targets all abortion providers in the state, not just Planned Parenthood. And what about the ""cutting children into small pieces"" quote? It comes from a Feb. 9, 2011, Concord Monitor article about a legislative hearing on the earlier version of Groen’s bill. In the article, Groen is quoted as saying: ""I'm amazed the only way we can find to deliver social services is by spending money on an organization whose specialty is cutting children into small pieces."" Tucker says he highlighted that four-year-old quote because it referenced Planned Parenthood specifically, and because it was made in the context of a formal hearing. Groen’s latest bill hasn’t yet come up in the House. Groen is a longtime abortion opponent, and he’s been outspoken in his views. He has made similar statements recently, too. In the Dec. 20, 2014, Concord Monitor, for example, he’s quoted as saying: ""Imagine how poverty-stricken the state has to be, when in order for women to get health care they have to reach out to an organization that kills babies for a living?"" Reached by phone, Groen said the quote that ran in the Monitor in 2011 sounded ""pretty accurate to me,"" and the quote that ran in the paper in 2014 was not exact but ""reasonably accurate."" He also criticized the news media’s focus on Planned Parenthood in the debate. Groen, referring to Planned Parenthood, said ""they have all the money,"" suggesting the group was trying to turn his bill into an attack on them. ""Every reporter wants to talk about Planned Parenthood,"" he said. ""That’s very interesting."". We’ll note that abortions account for a small fraction of the of the overall health care services provided by Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. According to the group, its New Hampshire clinics were visited 22,283 times in 2013. Medical personnel at the clinics performed 1,573 abortions that year, accounting for about 7 percent of all visits. For reference, the clinics did 2,979 breast exams and 1,859 cervical cancer tests over the same timespan. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England only performs first- and early-second-trimester abortions. None would be considered late-term abortions, a type often highlighted by critics of the procedure, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Frizzell. State-level numbers for the number and type of abortions performed in New Hampshire aren’t available from the federal government, as the state does not report them. The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit spun off from Planned Parenthood, reports that 3,200 abortions were performed in the state in 2011. Our ruling A headline in the liberal blog Miscellany Blue declared, ""Lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’ "" Groen’s proposal doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood, but the effect of the bill would be to strip it, and other similar groups, of state funding. Meanwhile, Groen did make the statement about the group ""cutting children into small pieces"" four years ago, and he’s made similar declarations recently. We aren’t rating the substance of Groen’s accusations, but the headline summarizing what Groen said and what he’s proposing in the bill are generally accurate, so we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/06/miscellany-blue/liberal-blog-says-nh-lawmaker-targets-planned-pare/

Despite deliberate actions, Scott Walker calls change to university mission a ""drafting error""
","Echoing other national media, U.S. News & World Report declared Feb. 3, 2015 that Gov. Scott Walker was having a better two-week run than any 2016 presidential hopeful. The very next day, Walker got caught in a political firestorm back home. News broke that language included in Walker’s state budget proposal would fundamentally change something known as the ""Wisconsin Idea"" -- a mission statement for the University of Wisconsin System that had been in place, and held in some esteem, for more than a century. The Wisconsin Idea doesn't have a precise meaning, but an early definition was: ""The borders of the university are the borders of the state."" In short, the Wisconsin Idea is a notion of public service, including the system’s contributions to state government as well as ""research directed at solving problems that are important"" to citizens. Today, the university system includes the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison and 25 other campuses that comprise the $6 billion-per-year UW System. The backlash to Walker's proposal, even from some conservatives, was swift. So was Walker’s response. Using his official Twitter account, the governor stated on Feb. 4, 2015: ""The Wisconsin Idea will continue to thrive. The final version of budget will fix drafting error -- Mission statement will include WI Idea."" ""Drafting error""? Really? Walker’s budget changes The day before his tweet, Walker had given his 2015-’17 state budget address. It made no mention of the Wisconsin Idea. The next day, the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy, a Madison-based group, reported that the 1,800-page budget bill itself included language that, in effect, struck the Wisconsin Idea from the mission of the University of Wisconsin System. That mission is contained in a state statute. As shown in a photo accompanying this story, Walker’s budget deletes a number of phrases contained in the statute. Among the statements that are removed: ""Extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campuses""; and ""Basic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth."" With some added language, the edits to the language emphasized the mission should be to ""meet the state’s workforce needs."" How changes occurred Walker’s ""drafting-error"" explanation suggests the rewriting of the UW System's mission was some kind of mistake -- changes made inadvertently. Walker’s spokeswoman told us the governor had learned shortly before sending his tweet that ""there was a miscommunication during the back and forth of the budget process."" But the evidence indicates the changes to the Wisconsin Idea language were intentional.   As revealed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, based on emails and other information gathered by the newspaper: As the budget was being prepared, Walker’s administration insisted to UW System officials that the changes to the Wisconsin Idea language be made. In December 2014, a budget analyst in Walker's Department of Administration directed the nonpartisan budget-writing office to remove the phrase ""Basic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth"" from the state statute covering the UW System's mission.  In January 2015, the same analyst told the budget-writing office to remove another phrase: ""To extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campuses."" Five days before Walker introduced his budget, a UW System official sent an email to Walker's budget staff raising concerns about the changes, saying: ""We strongly urge that stricken language is unique to depicting the character, mission and vision of the UW System."" That UW official, John Yingling, later told the Journal Sentinel that Walker’s budget staff responded by saying the changes would remain in the budget. Backtracking from earlier statements, Walker eventually admitted that UW System officials had thrown up red flags and been rebuffed -- although he also said there ""was a confusion out there"" and ""it was a mistake that someone made."" Walker’s office also issued a statement claiming that when his office told the budget staff to ""keep it simple, they took that to mean that we only wanted workforce readiness language in the mission when we really wanted the language added to the existing mission statement.....It was a simple miscommunication during the natural back and forth of this process."" Our rating Walker said fundamental changes to the language describing the Wisconsin Idea in the University of Wisconsin System's mission statement were the result of a ""drafting error"" in his state budget proposal. But Walker’s administration had insisted to UW System officials on making the changes, giving detailed instructions on passages to be removed from state law. And eventually Walker himself acknowledged that the UW System had objected to the changes before his budget was put into final form. His original claim was not only inaccurate, but ridiculous.

Scott Walker wants to cut college budgets by 13% and spend $500 million for an NBA arena?
","On Feb. 2, 2015, the day before Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his state budget, Twitter lit up with this claim: ""Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium."" The tweets were a copy-and-paste of a headline on an article by Think Progress, a liberal blog, that was posted the same day. It was an eye-catching claim that went too far. The cut The first part of the claim in the tweets is on target. More than a week before formally introducing his 2015-'17 budget, Walker revealed that he would propose cutting $300 million over two years from the University of Wisconsin System. Top officials in the system, which includes the University of Wisconsin-Madison flagship and 25 other four-year and two-year schools, said the plan likely would lead to layoffs.   In exchange, the system would get more control over its budget and more freedom from state rules in its operations. Walker’s proposed cut -- $150 million for each year of the biennium, for a total of $300 million -- amounts to a 13 percent reduction in state aid for the UW System. That reportedly would be the largest cut ever. It’s worth noting that state funding accounts for $1.2 billion of the system's total budget of $6 billion. Walker’s cut in state aid would amount to 2.5 percent of the total budget. We won't know until mid-2015 whether the cut ultimately becomes part of the final budget approved by the Legislature. But there is no dispute that the $300 million reduction for universities is what Walker has proposed. The arena Money for a new basketball arena is more complicated. The owners of the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks are trying to assemble private and public financing to build a new arena. The total cost is projected at about $500 million. That is not the amount Walker is proposing to spend. Like the university cuts, Walker announced his arena proposal before making his official budget presentation. He offered $220 million in state bonding -- essentially a form of borrowing -- toward the cost of the arena. Debt payments on the bonds would be repaid from growth in the so-called ""jock tax"" -- income tax revenue from Milwaukee Bucks players, employees and visiting teams. The rest of the $500 million would come from the Bucks’ current owners, the team’s former owner -- retired U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl -- and possibly from the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County. Normally, the growth in jock tax revenue would go to the state’s general fund to help pay for things such as schools, roads and other public services. But the Bucks could leave town in 2017 if a new arena is not in place by the fall of 2017. That is a deadline set by the NBA, which could buy the team back from its owners. In other words, without a new Milwaukee arena, there might not be any jock tax revenue. So, Walker is proposing a diversion of $220 million from the state's general fund to the arena. (A footnote: Although the headline on the Think Progress article said Walker would spend $500 million on the arena, the article itself did make a reference to his plan for $200 million in bonds.) Our rating  A slew of tweets claimed: ""Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium."" Walker's 2015-'17 state budget does propose cutting $300 million from the University of Wisconsin System over the two-year period. The governor also proposes, in the form of bonds, a state contribution for a new Milwaukee arena. But it wouldn't be $500 million -- the total cost of the arena -- but rather $220 million.

Essig accurate: Education austerity cuts under $500 million in proposed 2016 state budget
","Georgia’s public schools haven’t been fully funded under the state’s education funding formula since 2002. That’s expected to still be the case in the fiscal year that starts July 1, although the financial picture for schools is looking up. Last year, with the governor and all 236 members of the General Assembly facing re-election, the so-called state austerity cut to K-12 education was reduced by about $314 million. Now Gov. Nathan Deal wants to go further. His nearly $21.8 billion budget proposal for the fiscal year that starts July 1 would commit an additional $280 million to K-12 education and says local school systems would have flexibility to spend the money to reduce or eliminate furlough days, increase instructional days or raise salaries. If lawmakers support the governor’s plan, the austerity cut to schools would fall below $500 million for Fiscal Year 2016, Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute said in a recent blog post. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the math, given what’s at stake for the state’s 180 local school systems and the 1 million-plus students who attend Georgia public schools.. Beginning in 2003, local school system budgets have been squeezed by state austerity cuts cumulatively totalling more than $8 billion, including back-to-back annual cuts of $1 billion-plus from 2010 to 2014. Many school systems have raised class sizes, abandoned the traditional 180-day school calendar, dropped electives and furloughed staff, all while increasing local property taxes and dipping into their rainy day savings. Statewide, systems eliminated more than 8,000 teaching jobs. Before we dive into the numbers, here’s a brief explanation of an austerity cut. It is the gap between the amount of money that school districts need to provide a quality education to all students as determined by the Quality Basic Education (QBE) formula and the amount of money the General Assembly and governor approve. According to the Georgia Department of Education, that gap or austerity cut was (with rounding): $135 million in 2003; $283 million in 2004; $333 million in 2005; $333 million in 2006; $170 million in 2007; $143 million in 2008; $496 million in 2009; $1.4 billion in 2010; $1.1 billion in 2011; $1.1 billion in 2012; $1.1 billion in 2013; $1.1 billion in 2014. As we said earlier, last year, school systems saw some relief when the governor recommended, and lawmakers approved, adding $314 million to the education budget for Fiscal year 2015. That reduced the austerity cut for the current year to about $747 million. Many school systems used the extra money to restore some sense of normalcy -- dozens reverted back to the traditional 180-day school calendar. More than 60, though, continued staff furloughs, according to a GBPI survey last fall. In Pike County, near Macon, Superintendent Michael Duncan said the extra state money this year allowed his system to eliminate furloughs and add back staff needed to launch the new state teacher evaluation system. The system still has ""critical needs in professional development and instructional support materials,"" Duncan said. But, he said, ""the future certainly looks brighter under Gov. Deal’s proposed budget."" That budget earmarks an extra $280 million to education, which will reduce the austerity cut from about $746 million to about $466 million -- or below $500 million as Essig said in his blog. The exact amount, likely between $460 million and $470 million, is determined by the state Department of Education each year, Essig told PolitiFact. Claire Suggs, an education policy analyst on Essig’s staff, said school systems are likely to put any additional money they receive next year to continuing to restore programs that they cut or could not address through the very lean times. ""They are very concerned about teacher salaries and class size,"" Suggs said. ""Only a small number have been able to increase salaries, and district leaders are very sensitive about that."" Class size, she said, is also a ""huge issue,"" but tricky since reducing it means hiring more teachers and finding the money for salaries and benefits. ""It really will come down to what’s most pressing to them."" Our conclusion: Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, is correct in his calculation that, if the governor’s budget proposal is approved, the austerity cut to K-12 education for Fiscal 2016 would fall below $500 million. That’s a huge amount, but well below $1 billion, which was the cut each year from 2010 to 2014. We rate Essig’s statement as True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/06/alan-essig/essig-accurate-education-austerity-cuts-under-500-/

Jeb Bush says 'millions' have given up looking for work
","During a major policy address intended to increase his profile as a 2016 presidential hopeful, former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush criticized the economic performance of President Barack Obama. ""Six years after the recession ended, median incomes are down, households are, on average, poorer, and millions of people have given up looking for work altogether,"" Bush told the Detroit Economic Club on Feb. 4, 2015. We’ve already fact checked a similar claim about median incomes being down ( we rated it True), but we wondered whether Bush is correct that ""millions of people have given up looking for work altogether."" When we checked with Bush’s staff, they pointed us to two Bureau of Labor Statistics data points -- persons who are ""marginally attached to the labor force"" and ""discouraged workers."" These two measurements are similar, but slightly different. ""Marginally attached workers"" are those who ""want and are available for work, and who have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months,"" but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks prior to being interviewed by federal survey takers. The ""discouraged workers"" category is a subset of marginally attached workers, but they have specifically told survey-takers that they aren’t looking for work because they’re discouraged -- specifically, that they ""believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify."" In December 2014, there were 2.26 million marginally attached workers, of which 740,000 were considered discouraged workers. So if you use the definition for ""marginally attached workers,"" then Bush is right that ""millions of people have given up looking for work altogether."" If you use the more specific ""discouraged workers"" definition, the number doesn’t reach into the ""millions."" We can see an argument for preferring the discouraged workers figures. The four-week period without searching for a job certainly suggests that a person has ""given up"" (as Bush put it) but it’s not proof positive. The criteria for discouraged workers is somewhat stronger for the purposes of checking Bush’s claim, because survey takers have confirmed that workers are indeed ""discouraged."" Still, the definition of marginally attached workers isn’t far off from what Bush said, and using that yardstick, the figure is greater than 2 million people, so it qualifies as ""millions."" We asked economists how close Bush was to the mark, and they agreed that he was largely accurate. ""If they want work and are available and have previously looked but haven't looked recently, that sounds to me like they have given up,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. University of Chicago economist Robert Shimer agreed. ""No data allows us to answer this with certainty, but the quote seems reasonably likely to be accurate,"" he said. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, observed that some young workers might not technically fall under the ""given up"" category because the weak labor market since the Great Recession may have convinced them not to begin seeking work at all, perhaps deciding instead to remain in school or become a stay-at-home parent. Still, Burtless said, ""from the perspective of labor-force growth, it amounts to the same thing: A weak job market has kept them from finding work or even looking for work."" Burtless said he’s ""fairly confident"" that roughly 3 million adults between the ages of 25 and 54 who are currently not working or looking for work would have been in the labor force if they had faced the same labor market conditions that existed in December 2007. Our ruling Bush said that ""millions of people have given up looking for work altogether."" There are two statistics that shed some light on this question; one meets Bush’s ""millions"" threshold at 2.26 million  and one does not. But despite some uncertainty over the definitions and the scope of the data, economists told PolitiFact that Bush is on reasonably safe ground in making this claim. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/05/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-millions-have-given-looking-work/

Rush Limbaugh blames measles outbreak on immigrant children
","Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh says the focus on vaccinations in the wake of the measles outbreak is a ""leftist Democratic trick"" to divert attention from the president’s ""DOA"" budget plan. And to the extent that the measles outbreak is real, Limbaugh said Feb. 3, 2015, it was all the fault of the White House anyway. ""We have a vaccination problem for one reason: Barack Hussein Obama and his open borders immigration policy, which opened the southern borders to children sick, healthy, you name it, poor, ill-educated, just tens of thousands of kids flooded the southern border all of last year. ""They were never examined before they got here. They were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles.""   Other conservative voices have linked measles to illegal immigrants. The conservative website The Blaze wrote about Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., who said the disease was brought into the country by ""illegal aliens."" The common thread in these statements is the idea that these children were never examined, that they had measles, and Washington took no precautions before allowing them to stay. None of that holds up, however. In fiscal year 2014, over 68,000 unaccompanied minors presented themselves at the border. The crisis spurred a flurry of activity, largely by two government agencies, the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. Homeland Security set up new processing centers and HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement looked after the children until their fates were resolved. Contrary to Limbaugh’s assertion, the federal government did examine these kids. The protocol, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, was to provide ""vaccinations to all children who do not have documentation of previous valid doses of vaccine."" Limbaugh also claimed that these children were never quarantined if they had a disease. The reverse is true. ""Children receive additional, more thorough medical screening and vaccinations at ORR shelter facilities,"" according to the refugee resettlement Web page. ""If children are found to have certain communicable diseases, they are separated from other children and treated as needed."" Latin America outdoes the United States Further undermining Limbaugh’s case (we reached out to his show and did not hear back) are the vaccination rates for the key countries involved in the influx of unaccompanied minors -- El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. The latest data from the World Health Organization runs through 2013. As this table shows, over the past four years, the vaccination rates among those countries are on par or exceed the rate in the United States. Country Measles, mumps, rubella vaccination rate: 
4-year average El Salvador 92 percent Guatemala 90 percent Honduras 94 percent Mexico 95 percent United States 92 percent   With vaccination rates this high, epidemiologists say there is no particular reason to point to children from these countries as the source of a measles outbreak. What we know about the outbreak As a final point, the information on the measles cases this year reported to health departments fails to suggest a link to immigrant children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that most of the 102 cases stem from exposures at Disneyland in California. California health officials report that 59 cases emerged directly or indirectly from the amusement park. The core group was made up of 40 people who worked at or visited the park. Neither the CDC nor the California Department of Health have traced the outbreak to one of the young people who entered the country last year. In fact, assistant surgeon general Anne Schuchat said in a news conference that ""we assume that someone got infected overseas, visited the parks and spread the disease to others."" Past measles outbreaks have not been linked to Central America. Last year, Ohio saw 382 measles cases. According to state health officials, that began when unvaccinated travelers came back from the Philippines and spread the disease within the local Amish community. The CDC said nearly 80 percent of the cases that year were among people who chose not to be vaccinated due to their religious beliefs. Our ruling Limbaugh pinned the current measles outbreak on the Central American children who flooded the southern border in 2014. Limbaugh said they were never examined and that many had measles. Limbaugh provided no evidence that this is true. Probably, because no evidence exists. The children who came in from Central America were examined and vaccinated as part of a standard routine. There is no data that links this or any other outbreak of measles to those immigrants, who are vaccinated at about the same rate as Americans.  This claim lacks any basis in fact.  We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/feb/05/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-blames-measles-outbreak-immigrant-childre/

The CDC didn’t say its COVID-19 tests can’t differentiate between the virus and the flu
","This past summer, many social media posts claimed that the CDC was withdrawing its PCR test for COVID-19 because the test didn’t differentiate the coronavirus and the flu. That claim was debunked in July by PolitiFact and other fact checkers, but it is back again — and it’s just as wrong now as it was then. An Instagram post showed a screenshot of a Dec. 29, 2021, headline from The Gateway Pundit that read: ""HUGE. CDC Withdraws Use of PCR Test for COVID and Finally Admits the Test Can Not Differentiate Between the Flu and COVID Virus."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what actually happened. On July 21, the CDC issued a lab alert saying that it was withdrawing its request to the FDA for emergency use authorization of ""the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, the assay first introduced in February 2020 for detection of SARS-CoV-2 only."" The CDC alert encouraged labs to instead use newer tests that can detect multiple viruses at the same time, in order to ""save both time and resources as we head into influenza season."" After the initial alert raised questions, the CDC on Aug. 2 issued a clarification, saying that the change was because the FDA ""has authorized hundreds of other SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, many of which … can test for more than one illness at a time.""  The agency said the first diagnostic panel it had been seeking emergency authorization for ""was specifically designed to only detect SARS-CoV-2 viral genetic material. It does not detect influenza or differentiate between influenza and SARS-CoV-2. The presence of influenza viral genetic material within a specimen will not cause a false positive result."" What’s more, in a July 30 fact-check, PolitiFact found that the original CDC request was not for a physical test as the false claim suggested, but rather for a protocol for how to test for COVID-19.  The CDC had also sought emergency use authorization earlier in July for its Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay that could test for both viruses, which the FDA soon granted. The reason this claim may be cropping up again now is that the CDC said in the alert that its withdrawal would be effective on Dec. 31 in order to give laboratories plenty of advance notice. In a Dec. 30 email to PolitiFact, an FDA spokesman pointed us to the instructions for use for the CDC’s original panel, which ""includes sensitivity data as well as specificity/exclusivity data regarding Influenza and other viruses."" The CDC did not respond to an email seeking comment on the recent claim, but says on its website that the original test ""filled an important unmet need"" in early 2020, but that newer tests that can detect both COVID-19 and influenza are more efficient. An Instagram post claims that the CDC is withdrawing its COVID-19 test and admitted that it’s because the test can’t tell the difference between the flu and the coronavirus. But that’s not what happened. The CDC said in July it would withdraw from FDA consideration its emergency use authorization request for its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel because it was designed specifically to detect only COVID-19.  But the CDC said it was because it wanted laboratories to use newer FDA-authorized tests that could already detect the flu as well as COVID-19, in order to save time. The clarification made clear that the initial test only detected COVID-19, not the flu.

No, declining the COVID-19 vaccine won’t make you ‘99.8%’ safe from the virus
","An image shared on Instagram claims that people are largely safe from catching COVID-19 even if they don't take the vaccine. ""By declining the vax, I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.8% safe from COVID,"" the image's text reads. ""I'd say those are pretty safe [odds.]"" The image appears to be a screenshot of an Instagram post. Although the account featured in the post does have several anti-vaccination posts, we could not find that specific image on its timeline. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the post doesn’t give a source for the figures it cites, we’ve fact-checked similar claims before about unvaccinated people and their chances of survival against COVID-19. As with the previous claims, this post appears to conflate the global survival rate for the virus with an individual’s chance of survival. Of the 290 million people in the world who have tested positive for the virus as of Jan. 3, around 5.4 million people, or fewer than 2%, have died, according to The New York Times. That means at least 98% of people in the world who had COVID-19 survived. However, the global survival rate for the virus should not be considered the same thing as an individual’s chance of survival. A person's age, gender, health history and where they live all factor into how likely they are to survive an infection, according to Our World in Data. No vaccine is ever 100% effective, but early studies showed the protection provided by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can reduce a person's risk of infection from the virus by as much as 91%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can reduce that risk by 66%. The vaccines' effectiveness has waned over time and with the prevalence of more infectious coronavirus variants like delta and omicron, prompting health officials to approve booster shots. Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson have said booster doses of their vaccines are able to protect against severe symptoms and hospitalization related to the omicron variant.  Health officials have also stressed the vaccines are safe to use and that serious adverse reactions are rare. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said during a November White House briefing, before this post was made, that unvaccinated people in the U.S. are six times more likely to test positive for the virus and have at least a 14 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with vaccinated people. In a December briefing following a surge in cases caused by the omicron variant, Walensky said those figures only went up: Unvaccinated people in the U.S. were 10 times more likely to test positive for the virus and were at 20 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with vaccinated people who received a booster dose. The hospitalization rate for unvaccinated adults in the country was also 17 times higher. ""Our vaccines are working really well to prevent severe disease and hospitalization and death,"" Walensky said. ""They’re actually also working quite well to prevent cases, although we do know more breakthrough cases are happening in the context of omicron."" The latest data from the CDC also show the case and death rates of COVID-19 remain high among unvaccinated individuals compared with those who are vaccinated. Similarly, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a July interview with NBC that unvaccinated people accounted for 99% of deaths in the U.S. related to the virus. And, accounting for omicron, he said in the December White House briefing that while omicron may result in less severe symptoms compared with the other variants, its increased transmissibility is still a danger, especially among unvaccinated populations.  ""The risk of severe disease from any circulating variant, including omicron, is much, much higher for the unvaccinated,"" he said.  An image shared on Instagram claimed that not getting vaccinated against the coronavirus makes a person ""100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.8% safe from COVID."" The claim appears to conflate the total survival rate of the virus in the world with an individual’s chance of survival. The COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be safe and effective in reducing a person’s risk of infection and hospitalization from the virus. Positive cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been fueled by the unvaccinated. This trend has continued even as omicron has spread. The claim does contain an element of truth. By not getting vaccinated against COVID-19, a person does have a 100% chance of being safe from adverse reactions associated with those vaccines. However, developing a serious adverse reaction is rare. And serious health effects related to COVID-19 infection are more common.

No, vaccines are not why flights have been canceled
","Are vaccines to blame for the cancellations of thousands of flights around the world?  In short, no.   A Facebook user posted a video of a vaccine critic speaking at a conservative conference about the use of vaccines by pilots, and wrote a caption: ""why the flights have been shut down worldwide."" The caption included the hashtag ""just say no"" along with an emoji of a needle.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Thousands of flights have been canceled in the United States and around the world in recent weeks, but not because COVID-19 vaccines are making pilots sick. Airlines report that COVID-19 infections among their staff members and wintry weather are to blame.  SkyWest, which canceled hundreds of flights over the December holidays, told USA Today that its cancellations were the result of bad weather and an increase in coronavirus cases and quarantines among its crew members.  USA Today reported on Dec. 27 that Southwest blamed its cancellations on weather challenges, and Delta said its cancellations were due to a combination of weather and the virus.  JetBlue told the Washington Post, in an article published on Dec. 29, that its operations were affected by rising coronavirus caseloads, and that it was reducing its schedule through the first two weeks of January. And despite the claim in the video caption that the cancellations are linked to vaccines, there’s nothing in the actual video itself that supports the claim.  The video is from a broadcast of Real America’s Voice, and was filmed in Phoenix, Ariz. It appears to have been recorded on Dec. 20, 2021, in a Turning Point USA conference event involving pilots. In it, Leigh Dundas, a lawyer who works with America’s Frontline Doctors, which has spread misinformation about the virus, recounted what she said were adverse reactions from the COVID-19 vaccines and their impacts on commercial airline pilots. She relayed information from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a database maintained by the federal government that contains unconfirmed reports of adverse events following vaccination —  data that is frequently misused by vaccine critics to spread misinformation.   She also mentioned cases of vaccinated pilots who became sick on the job. PolitiFact looked at a case in October — a claim that a vaccinated pilot died mid-flight and forced an emergency landing — and found no evidence of an emergency landing or a dead pilot. In November, USA Today fact-checked claims that vaccinated pilots were dying during flights and found them to be false.  The Federal Aviation Administration told USA Today that it had seen no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitation caused by any complications associated with the vaccines.   A Facebook post claimed that flights were shut down worldwide because pilots have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and have experienced severe negative reactions.  There is no evidence that flights are being canceled around the world because pilots have experienced adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines.

‘Christmas Carol’ character’s wages not the best comparison to today’s minimum wage worker
","In Charles Dickens’ 1843 classic ""A Christmas Carol,"" Ebenezer Scrooge’s poor, put-upon clerk Bob Cratchit certainly didn’t have the best working conditions. He labored long hours for a classic micromanager, who paid him a salary that made raising a family of six children difficult, especially with a tiny child with big medical problems.  One person on social media used the Cratchit character to try to make a point about the plight of Americans working for minimum wage today. A Facebook post on Dec. 19 shared a screenshot of a tweet by a user who wrote: ""Time for your annual reminder that, according to A Christmas Carol, Bob Cratchit makes 15 shillings a week. Adjusted for inflation, that's $530.27/wk, $27,574/yr, or $13.50/hr.  ""Most Americans on minimum wage earn less than a Dickensian allegory for destitution."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post by The Other 98% now includes a label that it is ""missing context"" and the caption notes that the post has been fact-checked by Lead Stories, which wrote that there was no evidence to support the claim. The author of the original tweet later admitted his claim was ""based on super-sloppy googling."" The federal minimum wage in the U.S. is $7.25 an hour and has not been raised since 2009. However, 30 states, plus three territories, have minimum wages higher than the federal level, the highest being $15.20 in the District of Columbia.  Many cities or counties also have minimum wages higher than the federal or state levels, including a high of $17.13 in Emeryville, Calif., and many employers are surpassing the required minimum as they face difficulty filling jobs during the pandemic, CNBC reported. We spoke with several experts about the poster’s claim, and the consensus is there is really no perfect way to make such a comparison.  ""There are various ways to calculate what 15 shillings in 1840 would be in English pounds today, and they don’t give the same answer,"" said George Boyer, the senior associate dean for academic affairs and professor of economics, and international and comparative labor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations ""Moreover, you then need to convert to U.S. currency, and the value of the dollar in terms of British pounds is far different from what it was in 1840. So 10 different people doing the calculation would get 10 different answers,"" he said. Vincent Geloso, an assistant professor of economics at George Mason University who specializes in the measurement of living standards now and in the past, said the post appears wrong on a ""great many levels,"" first of which is the ""numbers are just off."" But are the numbers even relevant? Cratchit is not exactly the ""allegory for destitution"" the post claims. He was a skilled worker that would have made much more than many workers in the Victorian era, they said. Geloso said the comparison is ""meaningless,"" arguing that Cratchit was paid well above the median Briton and that his annual income of 39 pounds was only a bit less than the U.K. average of 57 pounds in 1846.  He said that a ""well-known measure called welfare ratios, which estimate earnings divided by the cost of a basket of subsistence goods,"" show that Cratchit could buy more than six times that basket, far more than the poorest workers. ""Cratchit was thus well above the poverty line,"" Geloso wrote. Boyer also said the comparison in the post is off base. ""The key thing for Thompson and others to remember is that Cratchit’s occupation was clerk.  He was NOT one of the working poor. Saying that Cratchit’s wage was above today’s minimum wage is not a relevant calculation. He could have been a badly paid clerk and still made more than a member of the lower working class,"" Boyer said, adding that comparing the wages of day laborers in that era may have made a better choice. Gregory Clark, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, argued that Cratchit would be worse off than today’s minimum wage worker, saying, ""The tweet overestimates the hourly wage in 1843 in terms of purchasing power by about 8-fold."" Clark said Cratchit, as a relatively skilled worker in a time when 40% of men were illiterate, would have been well paid for that time, though he lived in a high-cost city. But, he said, his wages, based on a 60-hour work week, amount to a meager purchasing power of only $1.70 per hour in today’s U.S. dollars.  Samuel Williamson, co-founder and president of the economic data site MeasuringWorth and professor emeritus of economics at Miami University in Ohio, pointed us to two blog posts he wrote about Cratchit’s salary and what it would be worth today. In one, he writes that Cratchit was poorly paid for the job he had, but would have had a salary with a relative earnings value of $43,000 in U.S. dollars in 2020, or $21.44 per hour, based on a 40-hour work week, far more than the $13.50 cited in the tweet. In the other, he also calculated the same figure as Clark on the real wage value of 15 shillings, but said that value is ""computed using a retail consumer price index of a basket of goods and services"" and is ""unrealistic"" because ""the market baskets purchased by representative consumers have changed so much."" He said that the relative earnings value is a better comparison and wrote in another essay that most measures of worth are better than using the CPI. Experts we spoke with agree that the average work week in the Victorian era would be more than 40 hours, probably at least 60. Dividing Williamson’s $43,000 figure by 60 hours gets you to the original poster’s $13.50 figure. But the post seems to ignore the gains made by workers, said James Kincaid, a professor emeritus of English at the University of Southern California and editor of ""The Daily Charles Dickens: A Year in Quotes."" ""It seems to suggest that all the efforts of organized labor have done nothing more than maintain the status quo, and that's nonsense,"" said Kincaid, who said the average worker in that era worked 66 to 75 hours per week. Kincaid said there is no good way to determine what 15 shillings then would amount to in U.S. wages today. He added that ""Dickens knew what a barely-above-starvation wage would be for a worker like Cratchit with his family would be, as did his readers."" A Facebook post based on a tweet said that a Charles Dickens ""allegory for destitution"" made more than most American workers today do on a minimum wage salary. Cratchit’s earnings outperformed U.S. minimum-wage earners, but his experience was not a portrayal of a low-wage worker. Cratchit was making far more than the average worker in London during the Victorian era, experts say. The comparison between 1840s shillings and today’s dollars is problematic. One expert said Cratchit would be making $21.44 per hour in today’s dollars, assuming a 40-hour week. We rate this claim Half True.

Footage of aircraft firing missiles is from a video game, not Chinese airstrike

One commenter wrote, ""Really bad aim, all them projectiles not one hit, I’d invest in better weapons because these only work on missiles that go in straight lines."" Another said, ""Wonder how much all of those missed hits cost the Tax Payer’s."" And one person incorrectly claimed that turrets shown in the video ""are the defensive units of Israel, not Taiwan."" The misinterpretation of the video game footage comes on the heels of real-life tension between China and Taiwan. China’s air force has carried out repeated missions near Taiwan, an island that claims independence but that China claims as its own. In December, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the missions ""look like ‘rehearsals’ though he did not indicate that he expected Beijing actually to carry out such operations,"" Reuters reported. It’s not the first time we’ve seen gaming videos mischaracterized on social media as if they are actual war footage, including other misrepresentations of Arma 3 footage.  A Facebook video showed a military-type aircraft in flight, sometimes firing missiles, while artillery was fired at it from the ground. The caption in the video title read, ""See how the planes crashed again when China failed to launch air strikes near Taiwan #2.""  The video was footage from a live broadcast of a video game and did not show actual footage of airstrikes. The title of the video was changed as we started fact-checking it, but not before many of the thousands of people who viewed the footage commented as though they believed it to be real.

Democrats made early moves on high-speed internet access, but at local level, it’s not partisan

","The need for more Americans to have better high-speed internet access is a common refrain these days — and it’s a rare one that reaches across the aisle.  Republicans and Democrats alike — from the nation’s executive branch down to municipal officials — have taken swings at expanding access.  President George W. Bush called for all Americans to have high-speed internet by 2007. In 2010, President Barack Obama released a report with more than 200 recommendations to improve broadband. In 2019, President Donald Trump unveiled the $20 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, and in recent months President Joe Biden earmarked tens of billions of dollars for broadband expansion as part of his infrastructure bill.  In Wisconsin, where about a quarter of rural residents live without access to high-speed internet, the 2021-23 budget signed by Gov. Tony Evers set aside $129 million to grow a grant program that funds efforts to improve broadband services in regions that need them. The final budget ultimately was authored by GOP legislators, who backed the provision. (Evers had called for spending nearly $200 million on high-speed internet access in his proposed budget, which legislators discarded for other reasons.) In a Dec. 12, 2021 interview for Madison TV station WKOW’s Capital City Sunday program, state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-West Point, talked about how his party needs to do a better job reaching out to rural voters — and cited broadband as an example of issues where rural residents are not aware of Democratic efforts. Democrats, he said, have been pushing for more high-speed internet access for years: ""No matter where you live, that you should have access to high-speed internet — that was a Democratic thing.""  Is he right? In Wisconsin, did Democrats lead the charge to improve rural broadband?  When asked for backup for the claim, Erpenbach spokesperson Kelly Becker pointed to a bill introduced in 2001 by Democrats, including former state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, who later served in the state Senate and left her seat in 2020, and former Sen. Richard Grobschmidt, who died in 2016.  The bill would have required the now-dissolved state Department of Commerce to develop a map and database of broadband internet service providers in Wisconsin. It failed to pass during that session.  Becker argued Wisconsin Republicans did not act on broadband until 2003, when they proposed exempting broadband internet service from regulation by the Public Service Commission and local governments.  Barry Orton, professor emeritus of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the Republican position on broadband has historically been to deregulate the industry and allow the marketplace to decide who gets what services.  This, he said, ""has always left unprofitable rural markets with poor or no service.""  Democrats, meanwhile, have sought to fund broadband expansion for years, at least since the beginning of the Obama administration, Orton said.  Former Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle in 2010 announced the state would spend nearly $23 million in federal stimulus funds from Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to improve broadband access across the state’s 72 counties.  A year later, when Wisconsin had flipped Republican under former Gov. Scott Walker, state officials returned those stimulus funds to the federal government, saying there were too many strings attached.  Becker also pointed to a 2015 motion Erpenbach made as a member of the state’s Joint Finance Committee to make changes to the broadband expansion grants program, including expanding eligibility for the grants and creating a biennial general purpose revenue appropriation for making the grants. The motion failed 12-4 on a party line vote.  State Republicans, however, say their early focus on eliminating the sales tax on internet services predates Democrats’ push for broadband expansion.  A spokesperson for state Rep. Rob Summerfield, R-Bloomer — who along with state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, has called for better broadband infrastructure in Wisconsin — pointed to a 1999 bill aiming for a sales and use tax exemption for providing access to, or use of, the internet.  The bill was introduced in part by then-Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen, a Republican who represented Waukesha, said Alex Braaten, a research assistant for Summerfield.  Jensen had previously advocated for reducing or eliminating that sales tax, in part because he believed it would limit growth of the internet economy and slow development of e-commerce, according to a 1999 Milwaukee Business Journal article.  Braaten argued that, in doing so, Jensen sought to make the internet more affordable for Wisconsinites and ease the tax burden on small service providers so they could expand.  (In 2016, Congress passed legislation banning state and local governments from taxing access to the internet. Wisconsin, one of just a handful of states that still did so, was forced to phase out the tax beginning in summer 2020.)  It’s worth noting that experts say party doesn’t matter much when it comes to the need for high-speed internet within local communities.  Doug Dawson, a nationally recognized internet consultant from North Carolina, told PolitiFact Wisconsin he couldn’t think of one example of political bias from the approximately 500 communities he’s worked with to improve broadband access.  ""There are almost no rural politicians opposed to getting better broadband — and most are active proponents,"" he wrote. ""I assume most such politicians are Republicans.""  Where the partisan divide begins to rear its head, he said, is the question of how to fund better broadband — ""and funding anything quickly becomes partisan.""  Our ruling Erpenbach claimed pushing for better high-speed internet access was ""a Democratic thing.""  Democrats pushed a broad variety of potential solutions and called for funding early, but Republicans did float bills that could address parts of the problem, albeit market-driven approaches that experts say would leave places that are most expensive to reach uncovered. Today, both sides agree on the need for better broadband — just not quite how to get there.  And at the local level, experts say advocating for improved internet access is a grassroots effort, not a political one.  We rate his claim Half True.

","A Dec. 22 Twitter post claimed that the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was caught on camera with an alarming message regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and children. The post used a video clip of Tedros speaking at a Dec. 20 WHO press briefing: ""So if (a COVID-19 booster) is going to be used, it’s better to focus on those groups who have risk of severe disease and death, rather than, as we see, some countries are using to give boosters to cil—children, which is not right."" The post claims that what Tedros really said was, ""The vaccines are being used to kill children."" The video was retweeted over 1,700 times, with many believing that the director general had just uncovered a plot to kill children.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts has advised that Pfizer/BionTech vaccine is suitable for use by people aged 12 years and above, and that the vaccine is safe for most people 18 and older.  In addition, WHO concluded that based on trials, the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweighed the risks for all age groups.  ""What occurred on Monday at the WHO press conference during his delivery of the word ""children"" is that he got stuck on the first syllable ""chil"" and it came out sounding like ""cil/kil,"" the World Health Organization said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""He then correctly pronounced the same syllable immediately after, with it coming out audibly as ""cil-children"". Any other interpretation of this is 100% incorrect."" WHO strongly promotes the use of vaccines to protect people from COVID-19, the spokesperson said. A video and transcript of the press briefing is available on the WHO’s website. The World Health Organization has consistently said that people more at risk from COVID-19 should receive the vaccine before children, who tend to have milder disease, according to WHO. PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous claims stating that COVID-19 vaccines have killed children. Many claims have cited the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System federal database as a source to prove that vaccines have killed hundreds of children. But VAERS reports aren’t verified for accuracy before being published. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have warned continuously that reports often ""lack details and sometimes can have information that contains errors."" That makes VAERS a breeding ground for misinformation.  RELATED VIDEO ""Nationally comprehensive vaccine safety monitoring systems administered by both FDA and CDC have found no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination is causing or contributing to deaths in children,"" a CDC spokesperson told PolitiFact in another fact check.

United Kingdom-based Full Fact also reported that these types of claims don’t have evidence to back them up. A Twitter post claimed the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the COVID-19 vaccines are being used to kill children.

Fentanyl deaths spike, but Facebook post overstates by how much
","A Facebook post warning about the dangers of the drug fentanyl makes a credible case about why Americans should be concerned about its spread, but in so doing, the post overstates a key statistic. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is part of the federal National Institutes of Health.  In 2019, PolitiFact West Virginia gave a Mostly True rating to the statement that ""just two weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl to kill every person in West Virginia 32 times over."" While fentanyl can be used as a prescription drug, it is increasingly being found in substances sold on the black market, which has led to a spike in overdose deaths. The opening paragraph of the Dec. 19 Facebook post said, ""It was announced this week that more people, aged 18-45, died of Fentanyl overdoses in 2020 than covid, car accidents, cancer, + suicide combined. Read. That. Again."" The part the post gets right is that fentanyl now ranks No. 1 on the list of biggest killers of 18-to-45 year olds in the United States, and by a wide margin. The calculations were made by the group Families Against Fentanyl, using data drawn from a mortality database maintained by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group looked at the past three years: April 2018 to April 2019; April 2019 to April 2020; and April 2020 to April 2021. The group’s calculation found that fentanyl was the biggest killer in that age group in all three years, and that the margin has been growing. In the year ending in April 2019, fentanyl overdose deaths outpaced suicides, the second-ranking cause of death in that age group that year, 23,556 to 21,195.  In the year ending in April 2020, fentanyl overdose deaths outpaced suicides, 37,087 to 21,441. But in the year ending April 2021, fentanyl overdose deaths outpaced the new No. 2 killer, automobile accidents, by the largest margin yet, 40,010 to 22,442. Where the post goes wrong is in the specifics of its comparison. In the year ending in April 2021, there were 21,335 deaths from the coronavirus in this age group, along with 22,442 from automobile accidents, 17,114 from cancer, and 21,678 from suicide. That adds up to 82,569 deaths, or more than twice the 40,010 deaths from fentanyl overdoses that year. The numbers are closer for the year ending in April 2020, but the combination of the four other causes was still about 1.8 times the number of fentanyl overdoses that year. The figures for the final two years in the analysis are considered preliminary and subject to revision by the CDC, but typically those changes are small, so the broad pattern is expected to hold. The post said that ""more people, aged 18-45, died of Fentanyl overdoses in 2020 than covid, car accidents, cancer, + suicide combined."" Fentanyl overdoses are indeed the No. 1 killer in that age group in the U.S., and by a growing margin, according to data compiled by an advocacy group from federal statistics. However, the post has overstated the differential between fentanyl overdoses and the other four causes of death.

Benefits from COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh the risks for teens
","A Texas cardiologist recently made a claim about the risk of myocarditis in teens from the COVID-19 vaccine, citing a study that health experts raised doubts about in September. He also floated a debunked claim that 45,000 Americans have died from the vaccine. Dr. Peter McCullough made the claims in an appearance on the ""DarkHorse Podcast; an article about his appearance, from the website Conservative Fighters, carried the headline: ""Top cardiologist: Study shows COVID vaccines are more dangerous than covid itself."" ""The most shocking thing in the Hoag analysis was that a child ages 12-17 is more likely to be hospitalized with myocarditis than taking your chances with COVID and ever getting hospitalized with COVID,"" McCullough claimed. The claim is not accurate. Public health experts say the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the risks for teens.  McCullough was referring to a study by Dr. Tracy Hoag and others posted to MedRxiv, a site where researchers post preliminary versions of scientific papers before they are peer reviewed. PolitiFact found that several doctors and researchers pointed out flaws in that study’s methodology. McCullough, president of the Cardio Renal Society of America and editor of the journal Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine, is a frequent Fox News guest and has a talk radio show called ""The McCullough Report"" on the America Out Loud network. His biography on the network’s website says he is ""among the world’s experts"" on the virus. However, McCullough has made several claims during the pandemic that have been debunked by fact-checkers, such as that healthy people under 50 don’t need the COVID-19 vaccine and that vaccines offered no protection against the delta variant.  Baylor Scott & White Health, the large Texas-based health system, cut ties with McCullough in February and got a temporary restraining order against him in September, accusing him of continuing to claim an affiliation with it in media interviews, a claim he denied, according to Medscape. McCullough’s claim that teens are more at risk from the vaccine due to myocarditis is not accurate. Health officials acknowledge there is a risk of the heart disorder but say it’s rare and that cases are generally mild.  Hospitalizations of teens due to COVID-19 infection remain low, compared with other age groups, CDC data shows, but the risk of illness or death due to the virus is greater than the risk from myocarditis, health experts say. Martha Sharan, a spokesperson for the CDC, said that cases of myocarditis after the COVID-19 vaccine are still being investigated. ""It shares some features with typical viral myocarditis in terms of the age and sex distribution, the presenting symptom of chest pain, and various lab values. However, myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccine has less occurrence of heart failure and has a milder acute clinical course,"" Sharan said.  She added that ""short-term outcomes of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccine are much better than those of typical viral myocarditis,"" and that studies of the long-term outcomes are continuing. When the vaccines first started coming out, doctors were seeing a small number of males in the 15-to-24 age group with symptoms of myocarditis, including chest pain, low-grade fever, and some changes in MRIs and EKGs, said Dr. Stuart Berger, chief of cardiology in the Department of Pediatrics at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. ""These were kids that got symptoms resolved over a very short period of time, probably 24 to 48 hours, so went home and were fine,"" Berger said.  Berger added that ""the incidence of that was much, much, much smaller than myocarditis in the general population that is not related to COVID."" Berger said people, even children, are at much higher risk of getting sick or dying from COVID-19 itself or from Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, which has been reported in many children who have had COVID-19. His recommendation to his patients? Get the vaccine. ""It's a no-brainer, to put it simply. Don't get COVID if there's a way to avoid it,"" Berger said. The American Academy of Pediatrics also continues to recommend that children be vaccinated against COVID-19 despite the rare risk of myocarditis. A spokesperson shared an article about a recent study from Denmark of 5 million residents that showed about 2 cases of myocarditis per 100,000 people after mRNA vaccines. The CDC’s Sharan pointed to a weekly morbidity and mortality report from June that concluded the benefits of COVID vaccination ""clearly outweighed the risks of myocarditis after vaccination."" The report showed that for males ages 12 to 29, there were between 39 and 47 cases of myocarditis expected per 1 million vaccine doses given. That compares with the prevention of 11,000 cases of COVID-19, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions and six deaths per one million doses in that same age range. Another CDC report narrows the data to males ages 12 through 17 and shows that for every 1 million vaccine doses, there were between 56 and 69 reports of myocarditis. However, it calculated that the COVID-19 vaccines prevented 5,700 cases, 215 hospitalizations, 71 ICU admissions and two deaths. As far as children ages 5-11, who began receiving the Pfizer vaccine on Oct. 29, the CDC told Reuters on Dec. 16 that there were eight mild cases of myocarditis reported in that group after more than 7 million doses of the vaccine were administered. According to CDC data, 771 children ages 18 and under have died of COVID in the U.S. and more than 32,000 people between the ages of 19 and 44 have died from the virus as of Dec. 15. Johns Hopkins data shows more than 800,000 Americans have died from the virus. In the podcast, McCullough also cited data from the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System to claim that 45,000 to 50,000 deaths had resulted from the COVID-19 vaccines. That’s not accurate. PolitiFact rated a similar claim of 45,000 deaths from the vaccine as Pants on Fire in July, and fact checkers at USA Today and Snopes rated them False. That claim was also made by America’s Frontline Doctors in a lawsuit in July that sought to stop authorization of the vaccines. McCullough provided a sworn declaration in that lawsuit. The 45,000 number came from an unidentified woman who didn’t share her method for calculating it, but based it on data from the VAERS, PolitiFact found. The CDC said on its website that VAERS received 10,483 reports of death after vaccines through Dec. 13. It adds that the FDA requires any health provider to report deaths after vaccines to VAERS, but that it ""does not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem."" The CDC’s search engine for VAERS requires that users read and acknowledge a disclaimer that says, among other things, ""The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines."" But anyone with a computer can search the data, download it, sort through the numbers and interpret them as they wish. Sharan said there is no indication that COVID-19 vaccines are leading to fatalities, except for nine confirmed deaths related to blood-clot issues in people who received the vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen.  ""To date, CDC has not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunization that would indicate that COVID vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths, outside of the nine confirmed deaths following the Janssen vaccine,"" Sharan wrote in an email. Those nine deaths were from complications of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, she said, or a combination of blood clots and low platelet count. As a result, the CDC recommended on Dec. 16 that people get the Pfizer or Moderna shots instead of Johnson & Johnson’s. We reached out to McCullough via email but he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. McCullough claimed that teens are at greater risk of being hospitalized with myocarditis from the COVID-19 vaccine than because of COVID-19 itself. There have been nine confirmed deaths related to the vaccine and those came from a rare blood clot disorder tied to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Post-vaccine deaths reported to VAERS do not mean they were caused by the vaccine. There is a rare risk of myocarditis from the vaccines in children and teens, but the benefits of the vaccine vastly outweigh the risks, multiple health authorities say.

Fact-checking the state of endangered animals, extinctions
","A Facebook post says don’t listen to the warnings that polar bears, whales and koalas are in danger of extinction as a result of climate change. It claims that those species aren’t endangered, but actually on the rise. The Dec. 12 post shows a screenshot of a claim from Patrick Moore, who serves on the board of the CO2 Coalition, an advocacy group that claims to educate people about the benefits of carbon dioxide. Moore tweeted this claim in 2019: ""Polar bears have increased 400% in 45 years; whales are nearly fully recovered; extinctions are down 90% past century (IUCN). Koalas are doing fine. If we could ban wind turbines we could save 85,000 birds of prey/yr in US alone."" Moore describes himself as a Greenpeace co-founder; Greenpeace said in 2010 that Moore ""played a significant role in Greenpeace Canada"" years ago, but denied that he was a founding member.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Agence France Presse first fact-checked elements of the claim two years ago, calling it misleading. Experts we talked to agree that the statistical claims are unsupported.  Here we look at each part of the claim individually: It’s impossible to compare the global population of polar bears to 45 years ago, because scientific estimates for most of the world’s polar bear populations weren’t published until after the mid-1970s, said Andrew Derocher, professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada. ""Many of the 19 polar bear populations (e.g., east Greenland, Laptev Sea, Arctic Basin, Kara Sea) have never had a population estimate and lack trend data, so it is impossible to say what the global population was 45 years ago or for that matter, what the global population size is today,"" Derocher said.  Derocher pointed to data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Polar Bear Specialist Group, which published its first estimate in 1993. That year, IUCN’s global estimate of polar bears was 21,470 to 28,370. Its estimates were 22,000 to 27,000 in 1997, 21,500 to 25,000 in 2001, and 20,000 to 25,000 in 2005 and 2009. In July 2021, the global estimate was 26,000.  The threat to polar bear populations 50 years ago was unregulated commercial, sport and subsistence hunting, Derocher said. A 1973 international treaty called the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears blocked overhunting, Philip Newell, associate director of science defense at Climate Nexus, told PolitiFact.  Today, Derocher said, polar bears face another threat: global warming.  Experts differ on how much climate change has affected polar bears. Charles Greene, senior fellow at Friday Harbor Laboratories at the University of Washington, said the loss of ice in the Arctic Ocean has had some effect on polar bear populations, but not a major one so far. He pointed to two graphs published in 2014 that estimated their population — one showed a modest decline, while the other showed virtually no change. Still, both Greene and Derocher agreed there’s no evidence that polar bears have increased by 400%.  The practice of whaling decimated the whale population over the 20th century, said Greene. He pointed to figures from a pair of studies cited by Our World in Data, showing the whale population dwindled from an estimated 2.56 million in the 1890s to 879,412 by 2001.  While some countries, including Japan and Norway, still allow whale hunting, most have agreed to stop, Greene said. As a result of that and other international agreements, whale populations have recovered somewhat, but they’re nowhere near where they were when whaling was common. ""The thing that prevents them from recovering even faster is that even though we’re not intentionally whaling, we are unintentionally whaling by them getting hit by ships, by them getting entangled in fishing gear,"" said Greene. ""So for many species, blue whales, humpbacks in the Pacific, and right whales in the North Atlantic, those are the main sources of mortality now."" That could be enough to make right whales extinct within a few decades, Greene added. The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium reported that the whale species’ numbers had dropped to 336 in 2020, the lowest number in nearly 20 years. Moore’s tweet cites the IUCN as a source for his claim that extinctions have dropped 90%. But we found no evidence to support that number, On the contrary, groups tracking biodiversity point to rising threats of extinction over the past century. In 2019, the ​​Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services  said, ""the average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900.""  The IPBES also reported that since the 1600s, at least 680 vertebrate species have gone into extinction. More than 9% of all domesticated mammals used for food and agriculture became extinct in 2016. The IPBES count of endangered animals included 40% of amphibians, 33% of reef-forming corals, a third of all marine mammals, and more.  The IUCN reports that it has more than 142,500 species on its ""red list"" of threatened species, and more than 40,000 are in threat of extinction.  ""I couldn’t even begin to find anything that would suggest that extinctions have gone down,"" Greene told PolitiFact. ""It didn’t take me very long to go and pull out very recent papers from top tier journals that demonstrate that it’s a totally bogus claim.""  In 2016, the IUCN declared that koalas, which are native to Australia, were on the decline and categorized them as vulnerable. The group listed several threats, including residential and commercial development, logging and wood harvesting, and more.  An IUCN  fact sheet notes that koalas are affected by dangers including elevated CO2 levels in the plants they eat, predatory animals, vehicles, droughts and bushfires, diseases and habitat destruction.   AFP reported in its 2019 fact-check that the exact number of koalas was contested by different experts. But they did agree that koalas were not, in fact, fine. Birds do have deadly encounters with wind turbines. According to a June 2021 study published on the open-access journal Ecosphere, birds of prey with ""relatively higher potential of population-level impacts from wind turbine collisions included barn owl, ferruginous hawk, golden eagle, American kestrel, and red-tailed hawk."" However, wind turbines have a much smaller effect on birds of prey than other risk factors do. In response to a similar 2016 claim from candidate Donald Trump about ""hundreds and hundreds"" of eagles being killed by wind turbines, experts told us that the number of eagles killed was closer to 100, and that the birds could be easily saved with ""proper siting and mitigation measures.""  A 2020 article from Eletrek, a news site focused on sustainable energy and electric transportation, reported that while raptors can be killed by wind turbines, factors like agriculture, deforestation, fossil fuels, climate change, cats and windows have proven to be far more dangerous.  We didn’t find a basis for Moore’s claim that 85,000 raptors a year could be saved. We reached out to him for evidence for his claim in its entirety, but he did not return our query.  A Facebook post shared a 2019 claim that said polar bears’ populations had increased 400% in the last 45 years, whales were nearly fully recovered, that koalas were doing fine, and extinctions fell 90% in the past century. There are issues with each part of the claim. Experts said scientific estimates about the number of polar bears weren’t published until after the mid-1970s, so it’s impossible to compare today’s population to 45 years ago. Global estimates point to a modest decline or virtually no change in polar bear populations in recent decades. There is no evidence that whale populations have nearly fully recovered under whaling restrictions, or even come close. Koalas have been listed as vulnerable since 2016. We found no evidence to support the claim that extinctions are down by 90% in the past century. There have been several reports that wind turbines do kill raptors, but not nearly as many birds as the claim suggests. Fossil fuels and climate change post a greater threat. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/dec/23/facebook-posts/fact-checking-state-endangered-animals-extinctions/

Did Pat McCrory support Black Lives Matter protests and condemn ‘Trump supporters?’
","A new ad by a conservative political action committee attempts to portray Republican U.S. Senate candidate Pat McCrory as someone who supports Black Lives Matter protesters and condemns Republicans. McCrory, the former governor of North Carolina, is one of several Republicans hoping to hold incumbent Richard Burr’s seat when he retires next year. Club for Growth Action, the Washington-based anti-tax group, is throwing its weight behind U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, R-NC. The group recently released a 30-second video ad that includes several audio clips of McCrory speaking on his radio show. Toward the end of the ad, its narrator suggests that McCrory defended the protestors and scolded ""Trump supporters."" Here’s a transcript, with quotations showing where the ad uses audio of McCrory. Pat McCrory called Romney ""a man of incredible courage.""  But on Trump?  ""Donald Trump is destroying democracy."" ""If there was any fraud, I haven’t seen the evidence."" ""Donald Trump, get off the stage, let Joe Biden take over the number one position."" No wonder Biden loves McCrory. ""People rightfully protested for Black Lives Matter."" But Trump supporters? ""Riots by Republicans. Who in the hell do they think they are?"" We wondered: What was the full context of McCrory’s comments about Black Lives Matter and ""riots by Republicans?"" It turns out that the quote about Black Lives Matter is from one of McCrory’s rants condemning a ""mob"" mentality among all protestors. And to form the final line about Republicans, Club for Growth Action appears to have combined audio clips from different parts of one of McCrory’s radio show. Jordan Shaw, McCrory’s campaign spokesman, told PolitiFact NC that the former governor has condemned violence from both ends of the political spectrum on numerous occasions. ""In fact, when he was governor, he called the National Guard to deal with far-left protesters burning our cities,"" Shaw said in an email. ""His radio show from January 7th makes it clear he condemns the violence at the Capitol. He condemns violent protests no matter who it is, and he’s done so publicly on countless occasions with respect to BLM, Jan. 6, you name it."" The quote, ""people rightfully protested for Black Lives Matter"" comes from statements McCrory made on his Jan. 7 radio show, the day after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.  McCrory did compare Black Lives Matter protests and the protests at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, but he was not condemning one protest and defending another. His statement did not express support for Black Lives Matter, as it appears in this ad. Rather, he was talking about how a ""mob mentality"" can lead any protest to become violent. Referring to rioters on Jan. 6, McCrory said: ""I think a lot of those protestors didn't plan to get violent. … (But) when you follow the mob, you become part of the mob. I saw this during protests in Charlotte, where people rightfully protested for Black Lives Matter. But then they didn't stop other people from breaking the windows. They didn't defend the police. And the exact same thing happened yesterday in Washington, D.C. People who had a right to protest did not protest the violence and the breaking of laws — the taking over a hallowed institutional building. It’s inexcusable."" McCrory has previously distinguished between peaceful protestors and people who see protests as an opportunity to vandalize.  NBC’s ""Meet The Press"" featured McCrory as a commentator after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Protests had broken out across the country. McCrory said ""groups of anarchists"" that infiltrate protests can cause ""destruction and cause this massive call for the National Guard."" ""They'll hit and run. They'll break windows. They'll set fires. Then they'll run and even using social media, they'll maneuver around very well trained police officers who are trained to do riots,"" McCrory said on the May 31, 2020, show. ""It’s a very complex situation in which you’re dealing with people with legitimate protests, but you’re also dealing with people that are basic terrorists."" About a week later, McCrory tweeted that police officers weren’t getting enough credit for their work during the protests.  The final quote in the ad appears to be stitched together from a pair of sentence fragments from different parts of McCrory’s Jan. 7 episode and it distorts what he actually said. About three minutes into the episode, McCrory said this: ""I did a top five—a McCrory top five—about five weeks ago after the election ended and said some things that haven't happened since the election where Donald Trump was defeated. One thing I was proud of: no riots by Republicans.  ""Well, that ended yesterday. And it was disgusting. Violence and assaults against police officers trying to protect government property. Violence trying to get into the halls of our government of the United States of America. Gunfire. People being killed. There's no excuse for it. And I want to be consistent. I’m gonna speak against that violence and say there's no excuse no matter how mad you are."" While McCrory mentioned Republicans here, it’s clear that he’s calling out violence – not the fact that they were protesting.  The day prior, McCrory tweeted: ""Mob rule and violence was unacceptable in our cities across our country this past year and it is even more unacceptable today in our (nation’s) Capital."" The ""who in the hell do they think they are?"" audio comes from later in McCrory’s Jan. 7 show, around the seven-minute mark of the recording. McCrory did not condemn Republicans, specifically, as the ad suggests. He scolded rioters for assaulting police officers. ""To see protesters during this past year, and now yesterday at the U.S. Capitol, go into the chambers of the House of Representatives, which felt like an assault to those individuals, those representatives – that to me is an assault on our government.  And then to see police officers defending themselves and having to spray individuals who were attacking them, it’s inexcusable. Who in the hell do they think they are carrying an American flag and then assaulting a police officer?"" McCrory went on to say that even if he were protesting, he would have stopped to help police officers. The Club for Growth Action ad played audio clips of McCrory that made it seem like he was defending Black Lives Matter protesters, while condemning Trump supporters by saying, ""Riots by Republicans. Who in the hell do they think they are?"" The clip about the Black Lives Matter protests omits McCroy’s full comments, which reference violence during their protests.  The second quote was deceptively edited by pasting together using two sound bites. It’s accurate for the ad to point out that McCrory was upset with Trump supporters, but it was misleading for the ad-makers to exclude McCrory’s reasoning for condemning them: because those who rioted used violence against police officers.  This part of the ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/dec/22/club-growth/did-pat-mccrory-support-black-lives-matter-protest/

In a sealed room, would snake plants keep you alive? Study doesn’t say that
","Could a common houseplant keep you alive in a sealed room if you couldn’t open the windows?  A Facebook post claims that the snake plant can.   ""According to NASA's Clean Air Study, the snake plant is so effective in producing oxygen that if you were locked in a sealed room with no airflow, you would be able to survive with just 6-8 plants in it. NASA recommends 15 to 18 medium to large size plants for 1,800-square-foot home for optimum air quality.""   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  NASA did conduct a study, in partnership with a landscaping trade association, of how plants can solve indoor air pollution. But its study didn’t draw conclusions about whether plants could produce enough oxygen to keep people alive in a sealed room.  Other research has dismissed the idea of air-cleaning plants as impractical.  The study covered two years of data and was published in 1989. It was supported by a division of the NASA Office of Commercial Programs and the Associated Landscape Contractors of America. The landscaping group then used the study’s findings to promote the use of plants indoors.  Study authors looked at a dozen plants, and how they reduce the presence of several toxins: benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde. One of those plants was Sansevieria laurentii, also known as a snake plant or mother-in-law’s tongue.  The plants were placed in sealed Plexiglas chambers, which were contaminated by the toxins. Two chambers were 30-by-30-by-30-inch cubes, and two were twice the volume. Air samples were taken in timed intervals after the toxins were introduced.  The snake plant was shown to remove TCE, benzene and formaldehyde, though other plant varieties removed more of these toxins, according to the study. Researchers wrote that the plants, along with activated carbon filters, ""have demonstrated the potential for improving indoor air quality by removing trace organic pollutants from the air in energy-efficient buildings."" They said that fans that move air through  activated carbon filters should be included in any plan to reduce indoor air pollution with plants.  But the Facebook claim is about what would happen if a human was locked in a room with no airflow. The NASA study did not test how the introduction of humans into the chamber would change the results, and researchers acknowledged this. They wrote that scientists were looking into it, but as of the study’s publication in 1989, they said, research was limited: ""NASA studies at Stennis Space Center, private studies by Biosphere 2 in Arizona, and USSR studies in Siberia are beginning to present a clearer picture of what man can expect to experience when sealed inside facilities with plants and soil as his major means of life support."" We reached out to NASA several times about this claim. A spokesperson directed us to the clean air study, but attempts to obtain more information about it were unsuccessful.  Since the NASA study, other scientists have looked into the effects of plants on indoor air pollution.  In 1992, an official with the Indoor Air Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, wrote a critique of the NASA study, and said that scaling up the number of plants used in the study for use in a house — the author estimates 680 plants would be required in a typical house — makes using them impractical, and would cause other problems, such as increased humidity.     A study published by the American Society of Horticulture Science in 2009 found that snake plants were effective at reducing ozone in indoor environments, but that more study would be necessary to determine the number of plants required in an area. The study recommended inexpensive houseplants as a way to mitigate indoor air pollution in the developing world.   In 2019, a review of a dozen studies over 30 years was published by scientists at Drexel University, and their findings show that plants are not effective at cleaning the air.  ""Plants are great, but they don't actually clean indoor air quickly enough to have an effect on the air quality of your home or office environment,"" said Michael Waring, an associate professor of architectural and environmental engineering at Drexel.  Drexel researchers found that the natural air exchange that happens in buildings works faster than plants to remove volatile organic compounds. They also found that the number of plants required to remove such compounds makes it impractical to use them for this purpose. According to their calculations, it would take between 10 and 1,000 plants per square meter of floor space to compete with the air cleaning capacity of a few open windows or a building's air handling system. A Facebook post claims that according to a NASA study, six to eight snake plants could produce enough oxygen to keep humans alive in a room with no airflow.  We found no evidence to support that claim. A 1989 NASA study found that snake plants could remove certain toxins from small sealed spaces under certain conditions. But it did not examine whether snake plants would be able to keep humans alive in sealed rooms. Other researchers have questioned the NASA study’s findings and found that relying on plants is an impractical way of cleaning indoor air.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/dec/22/facebook-posts/sealed-room-would-snake-plants-keep-you-alive-stud/

Biden says that vaccinated people can’t spread COVID-19. That’s not what CDC says.
","As President Joe Biden heads toward his second year in office of leading the country through a pandemic, he faces the challenge of trying to convince millions of unvaccinated Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The Republican National Committee said Biden has misled Americans about the effectiveness of the vaccine. The RNC tweeted a partial clip of an interview Biden gave to a Dayton, Ohio, TV station that aired Dec. 14. ""This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" Biden said in the full interview. ""The unvaccinated. Not the vaccinated, the unvaccinated. That’s the problem. Everybody talks about freedom and not to have a shot or have a test. Well guess what? How about patriotism? How about making sure that you’re vaccinated, so you do not spread the disease to anyone else."" We fact-checked a similar statement by Biden in October when he said people who are vaccinated for the coronavirus ""cannot spread it to you."" We found at the time that studies showed a vaccinated person was less likely to spread the virus, but the risk wasn’t zero. We rated Biden’s statement Half True. That was before the omicron variant was named a variant of concern by the World Health Organization. At the time, Tara C. Smith, a Kent State University epidemiologist, told us: ""Vaccination does significantly reduce transmission from vaccinated breakthrough cases but does not completely eliminate it."" A reader flagged Biden’s more recent remarks and asked us to look at his statement. Now that omicron has spread rapidly across the U.S. in December, we wanted to revisit the question: Can vaccinated people spread COVID-19?  We reached out again to experts to see if their understanding has changed about the role the vaccinated play in COVID-19’s transmission. We found that there is not enough data on how many people caught COVID-19 from an unvaccinated person vs. a vaccinated person in recent weeks, but scientists in general said that vaccinated people can also spread COVID-19. Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard, said Biden’s December ""statement is not accurate."" ""We knew that vaccinated people could become infected with delta and shed viable virus in large amounts,"" Hanage said. ""While data are emerging and not yet complete for omicron, this appears to be even more the case for that variant."" Biden’s emphasis on promoting vaccination is rooted in evidence that it helps protect people from serious cases, including hospitalization and death. However, we found that Biden again inaccurately characterized the vaccine when he suggested that a vaccinated individual can’t spread the virus. Any concerns experts had about the accuracy of Biden’s statement before omicron seemed to have been strengthened in the face of this new variant. We emailed spokespersons for the White House to ask for Biden’s evidence and did not hear back. Some early evidence out of South Africa provided hope that the omicron variant may cause a more mild disease than earlier variants, but many patients there were younger, making them less likely to develop severe illness to begin with. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the president, told reporters Dec. 17 that the seriousness of infection is ""still up in the air right now because there are a lot of confounding issues as to whether or not it is less severe."" Heather Scobie, an epidemiologist at the CDC, wrote in a Dec. 16 presentation that it’s not yet known how easily omicron spreads compared with delta. However, it is ""likely that vaccinated people with breakthrough infection or people infected without symptoms can spread the virus to others."" That statement was similar to one the CDC made in August. A page on the CDC’s website updated Dec. 20 said that the ""CDC expects that anyone with omicron infection can spread the virus to others, even if they are vaccinated or don’t have symptoms."" We read recent statements by Biden administration officials promoting vaccination, and none went as far as Biden to suggest that vaccination completely eliminated the chance of transmission. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters Dec. 17 that even vaccinated individuals should take precautions to reduce the spread. John P. Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine, said while we lack data on omicron vaccine breakthrough infections, with delta there's evidence that vaccinated people can spread infections to other people. ""That’s true on an anecdotal level (we all know such cases) and there are a few papers, mostly out of the U.K., on this point,"" Moore said. However, infection spread is less likely when the infected person is vaccinated, he added.  ""So, the vaccines work, but they are not perfect… I would expect that to be true also for omicron,"" Moore said. Biden would have been on firmer ground, Moore said, if he had said ""make sure you’re vaccinated, so you’re less likely to spread the disease to anyone else."" Biden is correct that COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the unvaccinated when we look at hospitalizations and deaths, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  However ""vaccinated people can shed virus and be contagious but generally shed virus in lower quantities and for a shorter amount of time."" Offit pointed to a study from Singapore which found that vaccinated individuals who caught COVID-19 ""had a more rapid decline in viral load, which has implications on secondary transmission and public health policy."" The study was done based on cases earlier this year before omicron emerged. Brooke Nichols, a health economist and infectious disease mathematical modeler at Boston University, said ""vaccinated individuals can definitely infect other people. There is enough data to support this."" ""While vaccinated individuals may be less infectious and infectious for a shorter duration of time they are by no means a dead-end host,"" Nichols said. ""When calling it a pandemic of the unvaccinated, though, it makes it sound as those vaccinated individuals aren’t substantially contributing to new cases — which they are (particularly now). Unvaccinated individuals do, however, continue to contribute disproportionately to hospitalizations and deaths."" However, Nichols added, ""I don’t think the data systems in place can tell us anything about the proportion of new infections that originated from a vaccinated or unvaccinated person."" We asked professors if we can draw conclusions from Cornell University, a campus that is having an outbreak even though 99% of the students are vaccinated. Is that a sign that vaccinated people are spreading the virus? ""Your statement is a reasonable inference from what’s happened on campus,"" Moore said, pointing to an article from the student newspaper about the spike of cases in December. ""I’m not saying that’s not happening, only that I’ve not yet seen formal studies on this topic — too soon."" Biden said Dec. 14 that people vaccinated for COVID-19 ""do not spread the disease to anyone else."" White House officials did not respond to our email asking for evidence, but Biden’s statement conflicts with information by the CDC that it is ""likely that vaccinated people with breakthrough infection or people infected without symptoms can spread the virus to others."" While the information from the CDC presentation was a couple of days after Biden spoke, it echoes what the CDC said in August about the potential for vaccinated people to transmit the virus. Experts told us that getting vaccinated protects individuals from severe cases including hospitalization and death and reduces the chance of transmission, but Biden went too far when he suggested that vaccination completely eliminates the chance of transmission. We rate this statement Mostly False.
