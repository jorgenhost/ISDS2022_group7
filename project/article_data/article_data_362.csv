Did Hillary Clinton win health care for 8 million children as first lady?
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is airing a new TV ad in Colorado that touts her battle-tested preparation for ""the toughest job in the world."" ""The world a president has to grapple with, sometimes you can't even imagine,"" a narrator says in the 30-second ad, which begins with images of protest in a foreign land, a war zone and a tornado churning near vehicles on a roadway. The ad says the former first lady, senator and secretary of state is ""the one who's proven she can get it done,"" ticking off a string of achievements. We’re focusing on a single claim, that one of the things Clinton got done was ""winning health care for 8 million children."" Clinton has often cited this achievement. During the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact rated one campaign ad as Half True because it implied she’d single-handedly ""stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would."" In another instance, we rated her comment True because she qualified her claim, saying she ""helped"" create the children’s health coverage program -- along with others. Let’s revisit the facts. It's correct that the Children’s Health Insurance Program -- known as CHIP -- provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, according to Medicaid. Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states.    The current ad gives Clinton credit for ""winning"" legislation that congressional lawmakers passed when she was first lady. Her campaign website has a more nuanced statement: ""As first lady, she refused to give up when Congress defeated health care reform. Instead, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which now provides health coverage to more than 8 million children. Senator Ted Kennedy said that if not for Hillary, the Children’s Health Insurance Program wouldn’t be in existence today."" The late-Sen. Kennedy received much of the credit for CHIP because the Massachusetts Democrat shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican co-sponsor. Yet, in 2007, Kennedy told the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a critical role. ""The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" Kennedy said. Nick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed. ""She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions,"" Littlefield told the Associated Press. ""But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it."" But the new Clinton ad has no qualifiers, stating ""she's the one who's proven she can get it done… winning health care for 8 million children."" Our ruling A Clinton campaign ad says one of her accomplishments was ""winning health care for 8 million children."" That statement is largely accurate. Clinton was key to creating the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for 8 million children. But the ad leaves out the contributions of others. Because of that caveat, we rate her statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809732CE40>],/factchecks/2016/feb/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-sanders-claim/

Hillary Clinton says she wants to return minimum wage to high of '$12 an hour in today's dollars'
","Calls to raise the minimum wage -- something that hasn’t been done in seven years -- are a staple of many Democratic campaigns. Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid is no exception. In a Feb. 12 Medium post, Clinton wrote, ""As president, I will work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it’s ever been  —  $12 an hour in today’s dollars  —  and support state and local efforts to go even further."" Here we’re checking if Clinton’s proposal to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour would bring the minimum wage ""back to the highest level it’s ever been."" We began by looking at the history of the inflation-adjusted minimum wage and found that the highest-ever inflation-adjusted value was $10.69 an hour in February 1968. The second-highest was $9.69 an hour in February 1967. You can see the data here and in the following graph.  So Clinton’s $12 minimum wage actually would go beyond restoring, or bringing back, the minimum wage to its highest level ever. It would be $1.31 an hour higher in purchasing power than the previous record -- or 12 percent higher. What’s going on?  When we asked the Clinton campaign for an explanation, they pointed to a paper by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This paper looked at how the minimum wage compared to the median wage at the time. According to the paper, in 1968, the minimum wage was about half as high as the median wage at the time -- 52.1 percent. By 2014, that had fallen to 37.1 percent, meaning that wages overall had risen while the minimum wage failed to keep up. Looking ahead to a proposed $12 minimum wage, the paper estimated that raising the minimum wage that high would bring the ratio back up to between 49.9 percent and 54.1 percent, or roughly what it was in 1968. And it found similar results when using a different benchmark -- the average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory production workers. Economists we checked with thought this was a credible standard for Clinton to use, and using this statistic supports her overall point. Indeed, Clinton would have been correct if she’d said she would work to raise the federal minimum wage back to where it was in comparison to the median wage at its historical record. But outside the economics department lounge, that’s a much bigger mouthful than saying she’d bring the minimum wage ""back to the highest level it’s ever been — $12 an hour in today’s dollars."" The problem for Clinton’s streamlined phrasing is that it oversimplifies in a way that could give readers a misleading impression. The term ""today’s dollars"" usually means ""inflation-adjusted,"" and using the inflation-adjusted minimum wage, she’s wrong that a $12 minimum wage has historical precedent. Our ruling Clinton said she will ""work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it’s ever been — $12 an hour in today’s dollars."" The minimum wage has never previously been ""$12 an hour in today’s dollars"" -- it’s gone as high as $10.69 an hour. However, Clinton has a point using other economic data. The data suggests that a $12 minimum wage would be similar to the 1968 wage when compared to median wages at the time. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A29B180>],/factchecks/2016/feb/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-wants-return-real-minimum/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Ted Cruz']","
Did Marco Rubio say in Spanish on Univision that he would not rescind Obama's DACA on Day One?
","Ted Cruz says Marco Rubio is so soft on illegal immigration that he even supports President Barack Obama’s program to allow some young people to remain in the United States. The two senators battling in the Republican presidential primary have fought over immigration policy since Rubio co-authored an immigration bill in 2013 and Cruz voted against it. Cruz’s criticism includes what Rubio has said about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- the program started under Obama in 2012 to give temporary legal status to people who were brought to the United States illegally as children. ""He went on Univision, and in Spanish he promised that he would not on the first day in office rescind President Obama's illegal executive action,"" Cruz told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Feb. 15. Rubio’s campaign pushed back by retweeting several tweets that accused Cruz of mischaracterizing Rubio’s position. Cruz made a similar attack during the Feb. 13 debate in South Carolina to which Rubio replied: ""Well, first of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish."" (Cruz told Fox News in 2012 that his Spanish was ""lousy."") So was something lost in translation here, or has Rubio sided with Obama on the policy? We decided to check the record on what Rubio said on Univision and elsewhere. Univision interview A spokesman for Cruz pointed to an article on the conservative website Breitbart about Rubio’s April 2015 interview with Jorge Ramos of Univision. Ramos asked Rubio if he was elected president if he would keep DACA, the program launched under Obama. Breitbart wrote that ""Rubio won’t reverse it himself if elected president"" despite the fact that Rubio said that it would have to ultimately end. ""I believe DACA is important,"" Rubio said, according to the initial English translation Breitbart used. ""It can’t be terminated from one moment to the next, because there are already people benefiting from it. But yes, it is going to have to end. It can’t be the permanent policy of the United States, and I don’t think that’s what they’re asking either. I think everyone prefers immigration reform."" The next day, Breitbart posted a second article based on the official Univision transcript and included comments by the Rubio campaign: ""Well, DACA is going to have to end at some point. I wouldn’t undo it immediately. The reason is that there are already people who have that permission, who are working, who are studying, and I don’t think it would be fair to cancel it suddenly. But I do think it is going to have to end. And, God willing, it’s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass."" In either translation, Rubio said DACA can’t be canceled suddenly but couldn’t be permanent policy. In an email interview with PolitiFact Florida, Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos pointed to part of the second Breitbart article that stated Rubio ""discussed immigration policy, affirming his longstanding objection"" to DACA and a similar program for their parents. Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips pointed to responses by the Rubio campaign and said, ""So Marco says it will have to end, but punts it to the legislative process.""   Burgos told PolitiFact Florida, ""On day one of a Rubio administration, DACA will start coming to an end by not allowing new applicants into the program and not allowing existing DACA permit holders to renew."" What Rubio has said more recently about DACA Rubio has commented about DACA several other times. He told reporters in February 2015 that ""eventually that program has to end. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States. What I'm not advocating is that we cancel it right now at this moment, because you already have people that have signed up for it. They're working, they're going to school. It would be deeply disruptive."" In November 2015, he said it had to end even if Congress did nothing. ""DACA is going to end and the ideal way for it to end is that it's replaced by a reform system that creates an alternative,"" Rubio said while in Manchester, N.H in November. ""But if it doesn't, it will end. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States."" One final note about Cruz’s statement: We’re not rating here whether DACA is illegal -- the future of the program is in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices are expected to review an expansion of DACA, as well as a similar program for their parents, this year based on a lawsuit initiated by Texas. Our ruling Cruz says that Rubio ""went on Univision, and in Spanish he promised that he would not on the first day in office rescind President Obama's illegal executive action."" That’s a reference to Rubio’s statement in an April 2015 interview about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Cruz is cherry-picking a portion of Rubio’s interview. Rubio said that he wouldn’t undo the program immediately because it would be disruptive, but he said that it would have to end eventually and could not be permanent policy. Initially, Rubio said that he hoped it would end after an immigration bill passed but then in November said it would end even if Congress fails to act. Cruz has created a misleading impression about Rubio’s statement by omitting his full comments. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809673FD40>],/factchecks/2016/feb/17/ted-cruz/did-marco-rubio-say-spanish-univision-he-would-not/
"['National', 'Iraq', 'Foreign Policy', 'Our Principles PAC']","
It's true: Donald Trump once supported impeaching George W. Bush
","South Carolina’s Republican primary has become a bit of a referendum on President George W. Bush. A few days after Donald Trump criticized Bush for the Iraq war and Sept. 11 attacks, the 43rd president stumped for his brother Jeb in the state that gave him a key victory when he ran for the nomination in 2000. Bush’s visit coincides with a Web ad attacking Trump from an anti-Trump super PAC called Our Principles. The ad plays clips of Trump’s interviews on CNN and at one point puts on the screen ""Trump supported impeachment of President Bush."" Along with that text and a photo of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump is heard saying, ""It just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing."" We checked to see if the ad makers engaged in artful editing. Did Trump really support impeaching Bush? Based on the CNN transcript from Oct. 15, 2008, Our Principles was faithful to the video. In fact, when host Wolf Blitzer pressed Trump, the real estate tycoon doubled down. Here is the exchange: Trump: ""I was surprised that she didn't do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush. It was almost -- it just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing."" Blitzer: ""Impeaching him?"" Trump: ""Absolutely, for the war, for the war."" Blitzer: ""Because of the conduct of the war."" Trump: ""Well, he lied. He got us into the war with lies. And, I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant. And they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And, yet, Bush got us into this horrible war with lies, by lying, by saying they had weapons of mass destruction, by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true."" That was in 2008. In 2016, Trump has been less enthusiastic about impeaching Bush. He was pressed on the point the day after Saturday’s GOP debate in South Carolina.  ABC News host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump twice on Feb. 14, 2015, if he still thought impeachment would be a ""wonderful thing."" The first time, Trump said, ""I didn’t endorse anything."" The second time, Trump said, ""I don’t even think about it. It’s past time. He was — he made a horrible mistake; we all make mistakes. His was a beauty. His was about as big a mistake as you can think of."" Trump himself did most of the work to bring George W. Bush and the Iraq War into the closing days before the South Carolina primary. During the Republican debate, he said his stance on the war was proof of his superior judgment ""I'm the only one on this stage that said, ‘Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq,’ "" Trump said. ""Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong."" (We rated that claim False.) And when ABC News moderator John Dickerson asked Trump whether he supported impeachment, Trump didn’t answer directly. Instead, he said, ""You do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction."" At a rally in Greenville, S.C., Monday, Trump refrained from calling George W. Bush a liar, saying only that the war was a ""big mistake."" Our ruling An ad by the super PAC Our Principles said Trump supported the impeachment of Bush. The evidence was in the ad itself, a video from an interview Trump gave to CNN in 2008. In that interview, Trump was asked if impeachment would have been a wonderful thing and he said ""absolutely."" Recently, Trump has backed away from his previous support for impeachment, saying ""it’s past time"" for that action. Still, the ad said he supported impeachment in the past, not that he supports it today.

Cruz wrongly says Trump's only Supreme Court pick is his sister, a 'hardcore pro-abortion liberal'
","Republican voters can’t count on Donald Trump to appoint a conservative Supreme Court justice, said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. With the unexpected passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative legend, Republicans are hoping to thwart President Barack Obama’s chance to nominate a liberal replacement in his final year. Their hope is that the next president will be a Republican who would pick a conservative appointee.   Trump, however, ""does not care about conservative justices on the court,"" Cruz said of his opponent, in a Feb. 14 interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week. ""You know, the one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton,"" Cruz said. ""She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge. And he said she would make a terrific justice."" We wondered, who is Trump’s sister, and has Trump said he only wants his sister on the court? Who is Trump’s sister? Trump’s older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in New Jersey. Cruz is correct that President Bill Clinton appointed Barry to this post in 1999. Prior to this position, Barry was a federal judge for the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. President Ronald Reagan nominated her for that post in 1983. Is Barry a ""hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge,"" as Cruz said? Barry isn't one for trumpeting her political views, and she has avoided talking to reporters. The New York Times wrote a profile of her in August, for example, but she declined an interview. So we’re limited in what we know about her politics. Trump himself said in a Feb. 15 press conference, ""I don’t even know what her views are."" We think Cruz is referring to the fact that Barry wrote the majority opinion in a 2000 panel ruling that found a New Jersey law banning partial-birth abortions to be unconstitutional. ""It is clear that the Act is unconstitutional because it creates an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion,"" Barry wrote. An interesting tidbit: Current Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative George W. Bush appointee, was also a Third Circuit judge at the time. He heard the partial-birth abortion case, too, and sided with Barry, arguing that the Supreme Court had ruled similar bans unconstitutional. So it seems a bit unfair to pin Barry as ""hardcore pro-abortion"" based on this case alone. We couldn’t find any other indications of Barry’s position on abortion. Trump addressed the issue in his book The America We Deserve, saying Barry declined to answer questions about her personal views on abortion at her 1999 Senate confirmation hearing. We were unable to locate a transcript of the hearing. Barry is a well-respected judge on the federal appeals court, which is where quite a few Supreme Court justices come from. But would Trump actually appoint her? He’s only kidding, he says. Trump did say his sister would make a ""phenomenal"" Supreme Court justice, but he was quick to say he wouldn’t appoint her. Back in August, Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin asked Trump if there was anyone he would consider for the court if the opportunity came up. Trump declined to name specific people. But then Halperin asked, ""How about your sister?"" ""I think she would be phenomenal,"" Trump said. ""I think she would be one of the best, but frankly I think she is — we'll have to rule that out now, at least temporarily."" And in an October interview with Fox, Trump added that Barry would probably decline the offer, as she is ""very happy where she is."" Minutes after Cruz’s This Week interview Feb. 14, Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he would nominate his sister. Trump said that he was just kidding back in his August Bloomberg interview. ""My sister, she also happens to have a little bit different views than me, but I said in that in a very joking manner,"" Trump said. ""But my sister obviously would not be the right person. It's a conflict of interest for me."" Cruz also said Trump has only suggested his sister as a potential nominee. That may have been accurate for a while, but at a Feb. 13 debate in South Carolina — the day before Cruz made this claim — Trump named two potential nominees, neither of whom are members of the Trump family. Trump suggested Diane Sykes, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and Bill Pryor, who sits on the 11th Circuit. Both are conservative George W. Bush appointees. Cruz was the only other candidate at the debate to float a name: Mike Luttig, a former federal judge for whom Cruz clerked in Virginia. A spokesman for Cruz's campaign emphasized that up until the debate, Trump hadn't named anyone but his sister as a potential Supreme Court pick Our ruling Cruz said of Trump, ""The one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton. She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge."" Cruz’s claim is misleading. Yes, Trump said his sister would make a good Supreme Court justice. But he said he wouldn’t appoint her, and he has named two other potential nominees. And yes, Clinton elevated Trump’s sister to the appeals court. But Cruz leaves out that Reagan appointed her to the federal bench in the first place. Trump’s sister did join in ruling a New Jersey ban on partial-birth abortions unconstitutional. It’s worth noting that Justice Alito — hardly a ""hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge"" — joined in that opinion. Cruz twisted and left out facts to make a faulty claim about Trump’s views on the Supreme Court. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096940C80>],/factchecks/2016/feb/16/ted-cruz/cruz-trump-thinks-his-sister-hardcore-pro-abortion/

Could North Korea missile strike the United States?
","North Korea’s Feb. 7 rocket launch scared some folks. Weapons experts saw it as a test for a potential missile strike on the United States. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement that it threatened ""not only the security of the Korean peninsula, but that of the region and the United States as well."" However, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, was more measured in his remarks on the rocket launch during the Fox News program Outnumbered on Feb. 8. ""China controls North Korea’s destiny, we should have some sanctions against, not just North Korea, but Chinese that do business with North Korea. And by the way, they’re not going to have a capability to reach the United States anytime real soon, but it is inevitable over time they will,"" McCain said when asked about what the United States should do in response to the launch. We wondered just how close North Korea is to reaching the United States via missile, so we put McCain’s statement through a fact-check. The technology is there The day after McCain made his claim, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Clapper said North Korea is ""committed to developing a long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United States,"" but he also noted that the system has not been ""flight-tested."" A January 2016 Congressional Research Service report on U.S.-North Korea relations also stated that North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear weapon on their KN-08, an intercontinental ballistic missile, ""and shoot it at the homeland."" McCain press aide Julie Tarallo pointed us to this when we asked about his comments. However, the report also notes that until North Korea tests the device, its nuclear capabilities will ""remain uncertain."" Missile experts we spoke with held largely the same views. Melissa Hanham is a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studies North Korean weapons. She agreed with McCain’s statement and said Americans shouldn’t be fearful because it takes North Korea days to prepare for a rocket launch. The estimated range of their rockets, at 10,000 km, puts Alaska, Hawaii and the western United States in range. But, they have never demonstrated all the capabilities needed to turn their present technology into a missile. ""Regardless, they are working toward this goal, and unless there is some appropriate intervention, they will achieve it,"" Hanham said. Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said McCain’s claim is ""generally accurate."" ""The imminence of the North Korean threat has been hyped for a long time; that being said, one successful KN-08 test would revolutionize perceptions of North Korea’s capabilities,"" Snyder said. As far as a timeline, Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, estimates that North Korea will not be able to reach the United States by missile until at least 2020 -- assuming a lack of intervention. Our ruling McCain said of North Korea’s missile program, ""They’re not going to have a capability to reach the United States anytime real soon, but it is inevitable over time they will."" His statement is a bit of a generalization, but he’s right. North Korea may have the missile technology -- and range -- to strike the United States, but it hasn’t been tested. Experts on missile technology agreed with McCain. We rate McCain’s claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971AD700>],/factchecks/2016/feb/16/john-mccain/could-north-korea-missile-strike-united-states/

Canadian website wrongly links whooping cough vaccine to Zika
","There are many unanswered questions about the connection between the Zika virus and microcephaly, a birth defect in which the baby’s head is much smaller than expected. Not every baby of an infected woman develops this syndrome, and the mechanism by which the virus might affect the fetus is uncertain. But moving around on the Internet is an entirely different take on the tie between Zika and microcephaly. It doesn’t exist, according to certain blogs, tweets and articles on conspiracy-leaning websites. The Canadian-based Centre for Research on Globalization, a group that advances ideas it feels the ""mainstream press"" ignores, had an article Feb. 4, 2016, from Dr. Gary Kohls that challenged the linkage theory and said the primary suspect is DTaP,  a common vaccination to prevent whooping cough (along with tetanus and diphtheria). ""In the whole week of reports that I heard or read about, not a single interviewer asked about – and not a single ‘expert’ or mainstream journalists ever mentioned the most likely triggering cause of the epidemic, and that is the neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic, aluminum that was in every DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated (early in 2015) by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women – and therefore into their fetuses,"" Kohls wrote. So is DTaP is the ""most likely triggering cause"" of microcephaly? Most of Kohls’ article describes why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pharmaceutical companies and researchers would care to blame the Zika virus rather than the vaccine, but its main point is the overlap of the microcephaly incidence and Brazil’s immunization campaign. Brazil did begin vaccinating pregnant women starting in late 2014. (Hat tip to Brazilian fact-checker Cristina Tardáguila at Lupa News.) However, according to the Brazilian Health Department press release, the vaccine they distributed was a version called Tdap. This was part of an international push to reduce whooping cough in infants. Inoculating mothers late in pregnancy allowed them to pass antibodies to their unborn children. For the rest of this fact-check, we look at Tdap. The Web article named the incorrect vaccine, but if there’s any merit to Kohls’ case -- and there isn’t -- it lies with the vaccine Brazil used. Kohl also wrote that ""there are 35 other countries across the globe that have confirmed cases of Zika virus illness, but none are having any microcephaly reports."" The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control does show about that number of countries and territories where Zika has been found, but in 13 of those places, there are few cases. Either no instances of Zika have been found in the past two months, or the number of cases was less than 10. So it’s a bit misleading to suggest that the absence of microcephaly disproves the link between the birth defect and the Zika virus. If we find more detailed statistics on the number of cases of Zika and microcephaly, we’ll update this item, but there’s a much bigger problem with Kohls’ statement.  Evidence on the safety of Tdap The weakest part of the argument that Tdap plays a role in microcephaly is that  pregnant women in the United States, and elsewhere, have been getting the vaccine and there is no hint of a connection to microcephaly. Elyse Kharbanda is a top national researcher on vaccine safety at HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research in Minneapolis. ""Our research has not shown any link between Tdap vaccination in pregnant women and microcephaly in their children,"" Kharbanda told us. Melissa Brower in the CDC press office reiterated that point. ""Our safety monitoring is continuous,"" Brower said. ""We have not observed any unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that would indicate a potential safety problem with maternal Tdap vaccination and microcephaly as a birth outcome."" A 2015 study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association included over 29,000 pregnant women in six states. It found no problems of any birth defects for any woman who was vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy. Another JAMA study looked at over 26,000 pregnant women in California and reached the same conclusion. Researchers at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program further affirm the safety of Tdap. Director and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases Buddy Creech said nothing shows any link between the vaccine and microcephaly or any other birth defect. Creech also noted that the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, between weeks 27 and 36. That timing is important. ""Most organ development and structural changes are occurring in the first trimester,"" Creech said. ""It’s after the period of most intense organ development, so it removes the question of whether a vaccine caused congenital heart disease, etc."" However, the CDC says in some cases, microcephaly can occur after the first trimester, so in theory, a vaccination could overlap with the onset of microcephaly. But that doesn’t change the rest of the research pattern. The United Kingdom launched a vaccination program in 2012, making Tdap available to about 700,000 pregnant women. Researchers looked at the impact on about 20,000 of them and found no increase in pregnancy risks. On a related note, the New England Journal of Medicine reports that the Zika virus was found in the brain tissue of an aborted fetus suffering from microcephaly. While this says nothing about the role of Tdap, it does directly link the Zika virus to a particular birth defect. We contacted the editors at the Centre for Research on Globalization and they said they forwarded our questions to Kohls. If we hear back, we’ll update this item. Our ruling An online article on the website of the Centre for Research of Globalization said the DTaP vaccine is the mostly likely cause of microcephaly in Brazil. First of all, Brazil used Tdap, a slightly different version of the vaccine. More important, not a bit of evidence supports the assertion that either variety lies behind microcephaly. Many thousands of pregnant women in the United States and around the world have been getting this vaccine for at least five years and multiple studies have found no ill effects on their babies. Not a single study has raised a red flag for any birth defect and certainly not microcephaly. In addition, administering the vaccine later in pregnancy reduces the likelihood that it will interfere with fetal development. The statement is inaccurate in every respect including naming the wrong version of the vaccine used in Brazil. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F8500>],/factchecks/2016/feb/16/centre-research-globalization/canadian-website-wrongly-links-whooping-cough-vacc/

Kasich: Medicaid spending rose twice as fast under Jeb Bush
","Every Republican presidential candidate opposes Obamacare, but Ohio Gov. John Kasich stands out for being the only one who took advantage of the program’s Medicaid expansion option. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wasn’t going to let that choice go unnoticed. Bush touted his opposition to expansion in Florida during a debate in South Carolina. ""The (Florida) governor was supportive of doing what John did,"" Bush said Feb. 13. ""So was the Florida Senate. A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion. I did, and it wasn't expanded there."" To which Kasich shot back, ""When Jeb was governor -- his first four years as governor -- his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine. Okay? It's just a fact."" We can’t resolve which man is more fiscally responsible, but we can compare Medicaid spending trends. A decade and a half separates the periods -- 1999-2003 for Florida and 2011-15 for Ohio -- but with due regard for the vast change in circumstances, the numbers can speak for themselves. Kasich’s campaign provided Medicaid spending numbers for both Ohio and Florida and we confirmed them with independent sources in both states. The spending amounts, in millions of dollars, include both federal and state contributions to Medicaid. Ohio 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Change overall $17,681 $18,401 $18,857 $20,859 $23,467 32.7% Yearly change 4.1% 2.5% 10.6% 12.5% Florida 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 $6,947 $7,764 $8,901 $10,220 $11,437 64.6% Yearly change 11.8% 14.6% 14.8% 11.9% (In millions of dollars) Source: Florida State University; State of Ohio  You can’t compare the amounts directly because inflation changes the value of the dollars across the decades. But in terms of growth, Medicaid spending did rise twice as quickly under Bush than it has more recently under Kasich. But we wouldn’t advise drawing simple conclusions from this. The factors behind the numbers Florida’s Medicaid budget did rise rapidly during Bush’s first term, largely due to more spending on long-term care. An Urban Institute report in 2002 said that as Bush took office, Florida had ""a full-blown crisis"" in nursing homes. ""Chronic staffing shortages led to an erosion in quality of care, which in turn led to lawsuits that resulted in extremely large awards for complainants and skyrocketing liability insurance rates for the industry,"" the report said. Larry Polivka now heads the Claude Pepper Center, a public policy analysis group at Florida State University. In the early 2000s, he served on an advisory committee set up to suggest ways to fix problems in the long-term care system. Bush adopted many of the recommendations, such as more nursing home staffing, and they were not cheap. ""Bush increased funding in the long-term care part of the budget very substantially,"" Polivka told us. A 2002 assessment by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department echoed Polivka’s point. ""In January 2001, Gov. Jeb Bush partly unveiled his ‘elder-friendly’ initiative, which called for significant increases in funding for nursing homes and nursing home quality of care reform,"" according to the report, which noted Bush signed the changes into law in May 2001. Polivka said the state has a higher proportion of senior citizens than other states and anything done with nursing homes and other long-term care services will have a substantial impact on spending. Polivka said it didn’t help that the state also went through a brief recession in 2001. Unemployment rose over 2 percentage points in 2002. When the economy goes down, more people turn to Medicaid. Still, Polivka said the main driver in Florida centered on nursing home care, community-based care and at-home care. In Ohio, 15 years later, the economy helped the state. Unemployment dropped by nearly half, from 9.2 percent down to 4.7 percent. That eased demand on Medicaid. But the state did many things directly to rein in Medicaid spending. Amy Rohling McGee, president of the Health Policy Institute of Ohio, told us that Kasich focused on chronic illnesses, like asthma, and long-term care. McGee said administration policies played a significant role in trimming the rise in Medicaid costs, but she also noted that other trends were at play. ""It’s hard to tease out what reduces health care spending growth,"" McGee said. ""It’s likely a combination of factors. Experts around the country noted that healthcare spending was rising at a slower pace in recent years. Part of that was a post-recession slow down. Part of it might have been the Affordable Care Act. But changes in Ohio also made a difference here."" Our ruling Kasich said that Florida’s Medicaid spending in the first four years of the Bush administration went up twice as quickly as they did during Kasich’s first four years in Ohio. The spending numbers bear that out. However, comparisons across very different states at very different times should be used with caution. Large national trends in health care inflation and the economy played a significant role in Medicaid spending in both states. Bush in Florida faced higher health care inflation and an economic slump. Ohio saw an easing of health care spending and an improving labor market. Still, budget and policy decisions by the two governors had an impact on Medicaid spending. The statement is accurate but it needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971AD100>],/factchecks/2016/feb/15/john-kasich/kasich-medicaid-spending-rose-twice-fast-under-jeb/
"['City Government', 'History', 'Texas', 'Sheri Gallo']","
Sheri Gallo incorrectly says majority of Austin City Council meetings run late, many past midnight
","Just after 10 p.m. during a January 2016 Austin City Council meeting, a council member suggested the governing body was too often meeting for way too long. That particular meeting had convened at 10:21 a.m. Jan. 28, according to city records, and members didn't adjourn until after 2 a.m. Jan. 29 (though they had a 90-minute dinner break). The length was mostly due to hours of public testimony about proposed regulation of the Uber and Lyft ridesharing services and proposed changes to how the city regulates rental properties. Council Member Sheri Gallo made her claim after falling on the losing end of a 10-1 council vote to extend the meeting. City code requires a council vote if a Thursday meeting needs to stretch past 10 p.m. Gallo declared: ""I think the majority of our meetings have extended past 10 p.m. … Many of our meetings have gone past midnight."" She added: ""I really think it's a disservice to our community, a disservice to our city staff, it's a disservice to the council members, … We just need to figure out another way to handle this so that our meetings are being completed at a reasonable hour."" It wouldn’t be a shock if the council has had at least a few extra-long meetings. Before voters moved to elect 10 council members from districts with only the mayor elected citywide, the previous council (consisting of six members and the mayor, all elected citywide) ordered a study of its meetings running late. A resulting December 2014 report from the city auditor, Corrie Stokes, said that from October 2013 through September 2014, council meetings had lasted an average of 9 hours, 31 minutes – three times longer than such meetings in comparable cities like San Antonio, Phoenix and Oklahoma City. Together, she reported, eight peer cities clocked in with average council meeting lengths of 3 hours, 24 minutes. The study also said Austin had been holding fewer council meetings than its peer cities with council members tackling more items per meeting. A vow not to go so late When Mayor Steve Adler was sworn in with the new council in January 2015, he vowed to end late-night meetings. ""You won’t have to be at City Hall at 3 a.m. just so your elected leaders can hear your voice,"" Adler said in his inauguration speech on Jan. 6, 2015. Part of Adler’s council-backed solution was to meet more frequently. A new 10-committee system, replacing six previous committees, launched in March 2015 with the goal of members vetting issues and hearing public testimony before items reached the full council. An October 2015 Austin American-Statesman analysis revealed the new council and its committees had spent 664 hours in meetings from January through September 2015; the previous council and its committees had spent 337 hours in public meetings during the comparable portion of 2014. Gallo’s backup We asked Gallo how she reached her conclusion about the majority of council meetings running past 10 p.m. By phone, she said her statement came from her recollection of how many times the council had voted to extend a meeting past 10 p.m. Meeting videos To our inquiry about meeting lengths, Thomas Grauzer, in the city clerk’s office, said we could gauge the length of council meetings over any time period by checking beginning and end times on city-posted meeting videos. From the videos on the city’s council meeting website, which includes transcripts of many city meetings, we determined that  from Gallo’s Jan. 6, 2015, swearing-in through Jan. 28, 2016, the council met one way or another more than 100 times -- counting regular meetings, work sessions, budget meetings, discussions and special called meetings. But we zeroed in on the council’s regular meetings, usually held on two or three Thursdays a month, mindful that historically those gatherings most often ran long. Upshot: Of the council’s 28 regular meetings from January 2015 through Jan. 28, 2016, the mayor banged a dozen --a little less than half -- to a close after 10 p.m., videos show. And of those late-nighters, five ended after midnight (only one of those occurring before July 2015). And what drove the late-nighters? Hotly contested topics, it appears, including changes to the city’s short-term rental ordinance, regulations for transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft, taxicab permitting and increasing the city’s homestead tax exemption. These divisive issues garner a lot of public testimony, where citizens sign up to speak for or against issues. The latest-running meeting of the new Council, on Nov. 12, 2015, extended until 2:25 a.m. The Jan. 28, 2016 trailed directly behind that, ending at 2:17 a.m., after nearly 200 people signed up to speak on short-term rentals, according to the city’s transcript.              SOURCE: Website, ""Austin City Council,"" City of Austin (accessed Feb. 3, 2016) Longtime observer David King, vice president of the Austin Neighborhoods Council, told us he’d been to almost every city council meeting since 2014 and had spoken as a private citizen on many issues through the years. By phone, King speculated that having 11 council members increased debate; more members mean more people piping up. ""I do think, too, that because we have this new 10-1 system, more people are showing up at the meetings,"" King said. ""And that’s a good thing.""   Gallo, informed that 12 of 28 meetings in her term have extended past 10 p.m., or less than a majority, said by email that's still too many. ""We made a promise to the citizens of Austin to eliminate late-night meetings,"" Gallo said. ""I think any meeting that lasts past 10 p.m. is one too many."" Our ruling Gallo said that since January 2015, the ""majority of our"" Austin City Council ""meetings have extended past 10 p.m."" and ""many of our meetings have gone past midnight."" There has, of late, been a pile-up of late-running meetings. Yet the big picture is that 12, or 43 percent, of the 28 council's major meetings since January 2015 ran past 10 p.m. with five, 18 percent, stretching past midnight. We rate this claim, which has an element of truth, Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Guns', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe says Virginia law bars private gun sellers from getting background checks
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe says Virginia’s law requiring background checks on prospective gun buyers would be substantially broadened under a bipartisan agreement he’s struck  with the General Assembly. Virginia now requires federally licensed dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to conduct computerized checks to see whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales between individuals are exempt and that, the governor says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands. McAuliffe, a Democrat, is backing legislation that would position state police at Virginia gun shows to conduct voluntary background checks on the private sales. ""Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one,"" McAuliffe said during a Feb. 3 interview with Mike Valerio of WWBT-TV in Richmond. ""We changed that law."" McAuliffe made a similar claim during a Feb. 1 interview on WJLA-TV in Washington. ""Even if the non-licensed dealer today wants to do a background check, he is prohibited by law,"" he said. Those claims and others by the governor were disputed in a full-page ad taken out in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Feb. 9 by Everytown for Gun Safety, a national gun control group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Everytown accuses McAuliffe, who promised in his 2013 campaign to seek background checks for all gun buyers, of backing weak reforms. The ad said ""voluntary background checks already exist"" for private sellers. So we decided to investigate whether the governor is right in saying that an unlicensed seller in Virginia - say, someone who wants to get rid of a rifle or a handgun he has at home - now is legally barred at a gun show from getting a background check on a potential buyer. Under state law, a person seeking to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer is required to fill out a form stating that he never has been convicted of a felony or adjudicated mentally incompetent and that he is not subject to a restraining order. The dealer forwards the information to the state police, which performs an ""instant background check"" and tells the dealer whether he can sell the gun to the customer. Virginia’s law allows only federally licensed dealers to contact the state police for the check. ""The private seller, they can’t even ask for a background check from the state police,"" Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, told us on the phone. But that doesn’t mean a private seller is without recourse. He still can ask a licensed dealer to conduct a background check on the potential buyer but, if the dealer is willing,  it becomes a complicated process. Under state law, licensed dealers can do background checks only for the purchase of firearms that are in their inventory. A private seller seeking a background check could  convey his gun on consignment to a dealer, said Corinne Geller, public relations manager for the state police. That’s not an unusual occurrence, according to David Hathcock, manager of Bob Moates Sports Shop in Chesterfield County, a licensed dealer of firearms. ""Most people want to make sure their guns to wind up in good hands,"" he told us, adding ""At any given time, I have 50 to 100 guns on consignment"" in the store. Moates, however, only does business from his store. And McAuliffe, in his comments, was specifically referring to private sellers at gun shows being barred from getting a background check. We spoke to three Virginia dealers on Feb. 14 who  had tables set up at The Nation’s Gun Show in Chantilly. They all told us the governor’s statement is wrong and they are occasionally approached by a private seller and a buyer seeking a check. The dealers said they’ll run the background check for a fee -- usually $25 to $35 -- to compensate for the trouble of putting the gun in their inventory and storing the information for a required 20 years. ""We do it all the time; it’s absolutely legal,"" said Brian Parrish, owner of Triune Shooting Sports in Warrenton. He told us he gets an average ""one or two"" such requests at every gun show. Sonny Condon, owner on Sonny’s Guns & Transfers in Richmond, said it’s rare when he gets such a request from a private seller, ""but it does happen."" Jerry Cochran, owner of Trader Jerry’s in Tazewell County, said he only recently became aware that he could run a background check for a private seller. ""I’ve done five of them in the last month,"" he said. McAuliffe’s measure would streamline the procedure by allowing a private seller to go straight to the state police at a gun show to request a background check. But, as before, neither the seller nor the buyer would be required legally to seek the check. McAuliffe warns that a private seller who bypasses the new system could face increased liability if a gun he sold was used in a crime. Philip Van Cleave, president of the pro-gun Virginia Citizens Defense League, said he thinks more private sellers will seek background checks if the legislation passes, ""but it’s not going to be earth-shaking."" The bill, we should note, sailed through the House of Delegates on a 96-3 vote on Feb. 10 and now is pending in the Senate. Our ruling McAuliffe says, ""Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed (gun) dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one."" The law requires only licensed dealers - those in the business of selling guns - to conduct background checks on a prospective buyer. As such, only licensed dealers are allowed to contact the state police to request the check. A private seller has no direct access to the background-check process. That doesn’t mean a private seller determined to get a background check is out in the cold. He can ask a gun dealer to conduct the check for him. But that’s a messy process that requires a lot of paperwork and the private seller to temporarily convey his gun to the dealer. So McAuliffe misspeaks when he says the law prohibits the private seller from getting a background check. But the law does make it very difficult for the private seller - who is under no obligation to seek a background check - to get one. We rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B02FC0>],/factchecks/2016/feb/15/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-virginia-law-bars-private-gun-selle/

Ted Cruz overstates Supreme Court nomination 'tradition'
","Republicans running for president say President Barack Obama should let the next president nominate someone to replace U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said on Meet the Press on Feb. 14 that it is a ""long tradition"" that a president in his final year in office should let his successor fill a spot on the nation’s highest court. Meet the Press Host Chuck Todd asked Cruz if the Senate had an obligation to at least consider a nominee from Obama. Cruz said ""not remotely."" ""It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year,"" Cruz said. ""There is a long tradition that you don't do this in an election year."" Cruz is correct in that it’s rare for a president to nominate and have confirmed a Supreme Court justice in an election year. But that’s more because of the rarity of filling Supreme Court slots than some ""long tradition."" The Senate’s list of Supreme Court nominees shows precious few nominees and confirmations in the years when America elects a president. President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated two people in 1968, his final year in office. One would have elevated sitting Justice Abe Fortas to the Chief Justice position vacated by Earl Warren. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson nominated Homer Thornberry in 1968 and was forced to withdraw that nomination, too. So neither Thornberry nor Fortas was nominated and confirmed in the same year. The next election-year nomination was in 1940, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt put forward Frank Murphy on Jan. 4, 1940. The Senate confirmed Murphy 12 days later on Jan. 16, 1940. That took place 76 years ago, not 80 as Cruz said, but it’s pretty close. Cruz chose his qualifying words carefully. By including both nominated and confirmed, he avoided the case of Justice Anthony Kennedy. President Ronald Reagan nominated Kennedy on Nov. 30, 1987, and the Senate confirmed him on Feb. 3, 1988. To be clear, presidents decide when to nominate, and the Senate decides when to confirm. Often, the administration gets a read on where the Senate stands before putting someone forward, but formally, the timing for the first step is up to the person in the Oval Office. The experts we reached did have an issue with Cruz’s use of the word ""tradition."" ""This is entirely a matter of circumstance,"" said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. ""Certainly not a norm or tradition by presidents refraining from nominating in a presidential election year or by senators refusing to consider such nominations."" In Cruz’s 80-year time frame, there were only two instances when vacancies coincided with presidential elections -- 1940 and 1968 as we just mentioned. Both times, the sitting presidents nominated a replacement. Going back further, there were opportunities in 1932, two in 1916, and one in 1912. In every one of those cases, the president nominated someone and the Senate voted to confirm. Editor Amy Howe wrote on SCOTUS Blog, ""The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election."" Russell Wheeler is an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center. Wheeler told us that in the post-WWII period, the limited opportunities for election-year nominations lies primarily with the justices who exercise the choice to step down. ""Justices rarely leave active service in an election year, because they know, at least in the modern era of contentious confirmation battles, that their colleagues will be short staffed because of the unlikelihood of an election-year confirmation of a successor,"" Wheeler said. ""Justices in the modern era rarely die in office."" Since the end of World War II, only four justices, including Scalia, died while serving. Wheeler said Scalia is the only justice who died in a presidential election year. Our ruling Cruz said there’s a long tradition stretching back 80 years of not nominating and confirming a Supreme Court justice in an election year. A Supreme Court justice hasn’t been both nominated and confirmed in a presidential election year since 1940, 76 years ago. But the notion that this is a ""long tradition,"" is misguided. The fact is, vacancies in an election year are rare, especially in Cruz’s time frame. As such, it’s hard to argue that there is any tradition in filling seats. Cruz’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809770AD00>],/factchecks/2016/feb/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-supreme-court-nomination-tradition/
"['National', 'Supreme Court', 'Marco Rubio']","
Do presidents stop nominating judges in final year?
","The sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has sparked a heated discussion over his replacement, raising the stakes in an already contentious presidential election. Given the opposition of congressional Republicans, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida suggested on NBC’s Meet the Press that there’s no need for President Barack Obama to even try making a nomination. ""But why not go through this process?"" host Chuck Todd asked. ""Because actually, it's not just for the Supreme Court, even for appellate courts, both parties have followed this precedent,"" Rubio responded. ""There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating, or you stop the advice and consent process."" Is it true that presidents ""stop nominating"" both Supreme Court and appellate court judges in their last year in office? We didn’t hear back from the Rubio campaign, but our research shows Rubio is overstating matters. Late-term SCOTUS picks Let’s first note that the scenario that Rubio is describing — a Supreme Court vacancy in the last year of a presidency — is pretty rare to begin with. Since 1900, it’s only happened once to a ""lame duck"" president, and twice more to presidents who lost re-election bids. All three times, the exiting president made nominations: • 1968: President Lyndon Johnson — who announced he would not run for re-election — nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas as Chief Justice and Homer Thornberry to fill Fortas’ vacancy. Fortas’ nomination failed, Thornberry withdrew his nomination and Chief Justice Earl Warren remained on the bench, delaying his retirement. (More on this later.) • 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo. Hoover lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. • 1912: President William Taft successfully nominated Mahlon Pitney to the Supreme Court. Taft lost to Woodrow Wilson. Three other presidents made successful Supreme Court nominations while running for re-election, but unlike Taft and Hoover, they won another term:   • 1956: Dwight Eisenhower made a recess appointment of William Brennan. • 1940: Franklin Delano Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy. • 1916: Woodrow Wilson nominated John Clarke and Louis Brandeis. Late-term lower court picks When it comes to the lower courts, Rubio is on even less firm ground, experts told us. ""He’s clearly wrong,"" said Russell Wheeler, a judicial expert with the Brookings Institution. Here’s a breakdown of the most recent examples of lower court nominations made in the last year of a presidency, courtesy of Wheeler: District Court nominations Court of Appeals nominations 2016 (Barack Obama) 4 4 2008 (George W. Bush) 26 6 2000 (Bill Clinton) 37 9 1988 (Ronald Reagan) 26 7 Confusion over judicial confirmations in the election years stems from the ""myth of the so-called ‘Thurmond Rule,’ "" said Wheeler. Named for former Sen. Strom Thurmond, who opposed Johnson’s 1968 Supreme Court nominations, the informal rule suggests that judicial nominations shouldn’t be confirmed in the months leading up to a president election. Though Wheeler and all the other experts we spoke with agreed that it becomes increasingly difficult to push through a nominee as the end of a presidency nears, the Thurmond Rule doesn’t actually hold up. For example, George W. Bush forwarded nominees to the Court of Appeals ""as late as September of his last year in office,"" said Lisa Holmes, a University of Vermont professor who specializes in judicial politics. And that month, the Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee ""shepherded through"" many of Bush’s nominations even though ""it did look very promising for President Obama"" at the time, said Sheldon Goldman, a University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor who specializes in the politics of judicial selection. The evidence against Rubio’s claim also multiplies if we expand the criteria to beyond lame-duck presidents. From 1947 to 2014, there have been 79 appellate court nominations and 416 District Court nominations in presidential election years, according to Sarah Binder, a George Washington University professor who studies the federal judiciary. In fact, there’s an example sitting on the Supreme Court right now that contradicts Rubio, pointed out Goldman. Justice Stephen Breyer was nominated by Jimmy Carter to the Court of Appeals in November of 1980, after Ronald Reagan won the White House. Our ruling Rubio said, ""There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating"" both Supreme Court justices and Court of Appeals judges. Rubio suggested that point is now. The chance for an outgoing president to make a Supreme Court nomination in his last year in office has only happened once in the past century, in 1968. But presidents do continue to nominate appellate judges in their final year. Out of the last four presidents who served two terms, all of them made nominations to the Court of Appeals (as well as the District Courts) in their last year. We rate Rubio’s claim False. Correction: Ronald Reagan's final full year in office was 1988. An earlier version of this fact-check listed the incorrect year.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097139540>],/factchecks/2016/feb/14/marco-rubio/do-presidents-stop-nominating-judges-final-year/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Criminal Justice', 'Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Negative Campaigning', 'Wisconsin', 'JoAnne Kloppenburg']","
One state Supreme Court candidate once backed a candidate he's now running against -- but how much?
","The first TV ad run by state Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg in the Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign criticizes Justice Rebecca Bradley, who was appointed to the high court by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Then the ad turns quickly to Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald, who is the third candidate in the Feb. 16, 2016 primary for Bradley’s seat. The two candidates who get the most votes will face off in the April 5, 2016 general election. ""Joe Donald,"" the narrator says in Kloppenburg’s ad, which was released Feb. 8, 2016, ""he supported Rebecca Bradley, Walker’s choice, twice."" At the same time, these words are shown on the screen: ""Donald twice supported Walker appointee Bradley,"" with the quote attributed to a blog.   Kloppenburg, who is running from the left, is associating Donald with the candidate who is clearly on the right. As we’ll see, Donald’s support for Bradley was explicit for one judicial post, but split for another. The candidates Kloppenburg, of Madison, ran for the Supreme Court once before, in 2011. Then an assistant state attorney general, she lost to Justice David Prosser in a race so close it went to a recount. Kloppenburg won election to the Madison-based District 4 Court of Appeals in 2012. Bradley, of the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa, was appointed to the Supreme Court by Walker in October 2015 after the death of Justice Patrick Crooks, and is now running for the seat for the first time. Bradley had also been appointed by Walker to the Milwaukee-based District 1 Court of Appeals in May 2015 and before that to the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in 2012. Donald, of Milwaukee, was appointed to the Milwaukee County bench in 1996 by GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson and has won election to the court four times, without opposition. He is also running for the high court for the first time. The Milwaukee County court is the link between Bradley and Donald. Given her incumbency and her position on the ideological scale, Bradley is expected to advance to the general election, which means the real race in the primary is between Kloppenburg and Donald. Kloppenburg’s evidence On Kloppenburg’s claim that Donald twice supported Bradley, let’s look at the instances cited by Kloppenburg’s campaign. Both were first reported by WisPolitics.com. 1. Donald specifically endorsed Bradley in 2013 in her first run for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. She had been appointed the year before by Walker to the seat, and defeated two challengers in the election. It is common for sitting judges to support one another in elections, something Donald’s campaign itself has said in explaining Donald’s backing of Bradley. Donald, though, has also said he got ""bamboozled,"" telling WisPolitics: ""I really thought (Bradley) was about being a trial court judge. It became apparent that it had nothing to do with it, that this was clearly a process to put her in place to put her on the Supreme Court."" 2. Donald gave his name as a reference when Bradley applied to fill the 2015 vacancy on the state appeals court -- but he also recommended that Walker choose another candidate. Bradley’s application letter to Walker lists Donald as one of four references, noting that Donald had previously served as presiding judge of the Milwaukee County Children’s Court. Bradley served there after being appointed to the Milwaukee court by Walker. Donald’s campaign acknowledges that Donald consented to Bradley listing him as a reference for her appeals court application. But the campaign also cites a letter Donald wrote to Walker in which Donald recommended that Walker choose Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Timothy Dugan for the slot. So, in contrast to the first instance, when Donald’s support for Bradley was unilateral, his support in the second instance was split. Our rating Kloppenburg says Donald twice ""supported"" Bradley. Donald explicitly endorsed Bradley in a 2013 election for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. When there was a vacancy on the state appeals court in 2015, Donald supported Bradley by allowing her to use him as a reference in her application, although he also recommended that the governor choose a different applicant for the post.

U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says incumbent Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a $525-billion tax hike on the middle class
","
Did U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who characterizes himself as a champion of the middle class, vote for a $525-billion tax increase on that group?

That's one assertion in a television ad by Republican challenger Barry Hinckley.

After raising an allegation about insider trading, which Whitehouse has strongly denied, the commercial says ""Whitehouse voted to raise taxes on middle-class families."" The phrase ""$525 billion tax increase on the middle class"" flashes on the screen.

The commercial offers no further information about what Hinckley is talking about, so we asked the Hinckley campaign for its backup.

Campaign manager Patrick Sweeney said the ad refers to the Affordable Care Act, the health care plan often known as Obamacare, which Whitehouse supported. PolitiFact has examined similar claims, including one in which Hinckley declared that the law will ""add trillions of dollars in debt,"" a claim we ruled False.

The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation, designed to expand health coverage, will generate $525 billion in revenue. A lower estimate by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation predicted it will bring in more than $437.8 billion. Sweeney said the ad is using the CBO estimate.

But there are a few significant facts the ad doesn't mention.

First, that's not money raised over one year. It's over 10 years, from 2010 through 2019 for legislation that is being gradually phased in. In 2019, annual revenue is expected to have risen to $88.2 billion.

Second, most of the money won't be coming from the middle class, as the ad states.

For example, a huge chunk of the revenue, $210 billion of the $437.8 billion in the Joint Committee estimate, comes from both a higher Medicare payroll tax to be paid by individuals earning more than $200,000 a year ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) and from a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income if your income is already high.

Those take effect in 2013 and are taxes that middle class families will not see.

Other taxes aren't geared to the middle class either, although all taxpayers may have to foot the bill indirectly as the extra costs are factored into the goods and services they buy.

They include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers (which will raise an estimated $27 billion); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion); and a fee on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion).

In addition, there's the excise tax on indoor tanning services (expected to raise $2.7 billion) and the stricter limit on deducting medical expenses on tax returns, which is expected to raise $15.2 billion. Both will have a more direct effect on the well-tanned or very-ill middle class.

One other element of the law that will affect the middle class is the provision of Obamacare known as the individual mandate. It requires people to pay an annual penalty if they don't buy health insurance. It takes effect in 2014, starting off at a minimum of $95 for an individual and rising to $695 per year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that controversial provision by characterizing it as a tax, not a penalty.

Is this a tax/penalty on the middle class?

The CBO, the source used by the Hinckley campaign, has estimated that by 2016, 55 percent of the money collected via the individual mandate will come from people with incomes in the top 20 percent, which is a family of four making roughly $120,000 or more.

So less than half the money will be coming from middle class Americans.

How much money is involved?

About $4 billion in 2016. The amount coming from the middle class and lower class: roughly $1.8 billion.

To put that in perspective, $1.8 billion is 3 percent of the $57 billion or so Obamacare will be raising from everyone in 2016.

Our ruling

Barry Hinckley said Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a ""$525 billion tax increase on the middle class.""

The ad doesn't say that it's really talking about Obamacare, and that the money is designed to help pay for health coverage for the uninsured, many of whom are in the middle class.

It also doesn't point out that the $525 billion is spread out over 10 years, through 2019. Most of it doesn't come from the middle class.  

And of the $4 billion the government expects to collect each year from people who choose not to purchase health insurance, less than half will come from the middle class.

The claim in the Hinckley ad is so ridiculously off base, we rate it Pants on Fire!

"['Abortion', 'Oregon', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Women', 'Democratic Party of Oregon']","
Did Matt Wand side with activists to limit access to abortions?
","
The Democratic Party of Oregon has sent a mailer in a heated east Multnomah County legislative race, criticizing incumbent Rep. Matt Wand, R-Troutdale, as a know-it-all who doesn’t trust women to make their own medical decisions.

""Wand wants to take away a woman’s right to make her own personal medical decisions,"" the mailer reads. ""Matt Wand thinks he knows better than women or their doctors. Matt Wand has sided with extreme anti-choice activists to restrict access to reproductive health care services.""

The mailer urges a vote for the Democrat in the race, Chris Gorsek, who is endorsed by Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon. We wanted to know whether Wand, who is endorsed by Oregon Right to Life, sided with activists ""to restrict access to reproductive health care services.""

The mailer doesn't mention the word abortion at all -- not once -- but the evidence cited for the claim is Senate Bill 901 from 2011. The legislation would have re-defined Planned Parenthood and other clinics that provide abortions as ""ambulatory surgical centers,"" subject to the same regulations as centers that do plastic surgery, spine surgery, vision laser surgery, and so on. The legislation would have applied to places that advertise as offering abortions, 10 or more in a month, 100 or more in a year.

Wand, a freshman, signed on to the bill, along with 11 state senators, all Republicans. The legislation was introduced in February and assigned to a committee in March, where it died. There was no hearing.

House Republicans, who suggested the fact check, and Oregon Right to Life, the anti-abortion group behind the legislation, say the bill was aimed at making abortions safer, not at restricting them. ""Terming SB901 as a ‘restriction to reproductive health service’ is pretty much over the top,"" said executive director Gayle Atteberry in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. Oregon Right to Life opposes abortion except in cases where the mother’s life is in immediate danger.

Planned Parenthood advocates, on the other hand, say that Atteberry’s characterization is highly misleading. Abortions are already safe, they say, and the bill is part of a national agenda to burden abortion clinics with structural regulations  -- for example, corridor and door width -- that have nothing to do with patient safety.

Jimmy Radosta, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, said the legislation would have required major renovation of its clinics. ""The only way to comply would be to tear down and start all over again,"" he said.

Clearly, the bill was aimed at clinics that offer abortion services, which are likely the first stops for women who lack insurance or a regular ob-gyn. Planned Parenthood also has contracts with insurers and provides abortions for physicians who contract with those insurance carriers.

But it’s important to note that the legislation would not have applied to all abortion providers.

Physicians could continue to offer both medical and surgical abortions at private medical offices, or at hospitals such as Oregon Health & Science University’s women’s health clinic. The legislation also would not have applied to the Lovejoy Surgicenter because the Northwest Portland facility is already an ""ambulatory surgical center."" Lovejoy is a significant provider and claims on its website that in calendar year 2008 the center performed 55 percent of the 7,100 abortions in the tri-county area.

We figured we should hear from Wand on why he supported the bill. He said he couldn’t recall who had brought the legislation to him, although it was probably one of the state senators. Wand said it made sense to consider regulating abortion clinics the same way as places that do ""face lifts and tummy tucks."" He said Democrats’ ""lying about my respect for women is pretty egregious.""

Trent Lutz, executive director of the Democratic Party of Oregon, noted in an e-mail that Wand has accepted campaign money and other assistance from Oregon Right to Life. ""SB 901 would have effectively shut down every provider in the state. We continue to believe that Matt Wand is out of touch and wrong on women's health,"" he said.
  
Whether Wand is out of touch is an opinion to which he and Democrats are entitled. We do, however, take issue with the assertion about the bill’s impact.

Anyone reading the mailer cold might assume that Wand is an extreme anti-abortionist who wants to take away a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions. Given the ""reproductive health care services"" language, maybe he’s even against contraception. But the bill wasn’t nearly as drastic as that.

The legislation focused on abortion, targeting clinics that provide them. But with abortions performed in a variety of places -- at private medical offices, at the women’s health center at Oregon Health & Science University, at Lovejoy Surgicenter -- the legislation would not have shut down every provider as Lutz claims.

Wand co-sponsored legislation that in all likelihood would have translated into fewer places for women to go; his stated motivation was safety, not necessarily a desire to restrict access. We realize that for some advocates, this issue isall or nothing; either you’re with us or against us, on both sides.

We take a middle road. The statement is partially accurate -- Wand did side with Oregon Right to Life on legislation that would have affected providers -- but it leaves out important details. The legislation did not target all providers and, in fact, would not have affected a significant provider in the metro area. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B3B040>],/factchecks/2012/nov/01/democratic-party-oregon/did-matt-wand-side-activists-limit-acc/

Adam Putnam: Obama campaign gives free cell phones to supporters
","
An A-team of Florida Republicans packed a Tampa stage Wednesday to welcome Mitt Romney and rally supporters in the final days of the presidential campaign.

Former Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio were in the lineup, as well as Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, who warmed up the crowd and encouraged voters to head to the polls early.

""Early vote now so that you can wave signs on election day next Tuesday,"" Putnam said. This is a team sport. This is a team sport. It's fully interactive. We can't just show up and cheer and slap a bumper sticker on the back of our car and think we're done. We've got to drag people to the polls. That's what they're doing. You don't have to offer them cell phones like they're doing.""

That line about cell phones caught our attention. We decided to investigate. Is the Obama campaign offering cell phones to get voters to the polls?

The ‘Obama phone’ myth

Way back in 2009, a reader asked us to check out a chain email declaring, ""TAX PAYER MONEY IS BEING REDISTRIBUTED TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS FOR FREE CELL PHONES.""

The email called the phones ""Obama phones,"" suggesting the program was an Obama administration creation. The phone program, the email said, threatened ""the very foundations that this country was built on,"" and ""the age old concepts of God, family, and hard work.""

We learned that there is, in fact, a government program that provides discounted phone service to low-income people, depending on where participants live, through Federal Communications Commission programs. Specifically, a program called Lifeline provides discounts on basic monthly phone service, according to the FCC website.

Eligible participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance, or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs.

Lifeline and programs like it have been around quite a while. Lifeline was created in 1985 and expanded in 2008 during the Bush administration to include cell phone service. An FCC spokeswoman told PolitiFact in 2009 that the 1996 Telecommunications Act required the FCC to create the Universal Service Fund, a pool of money subsidized by small charges on phone bills and redistributed to low-income service programs, as well as programs that bring telecommunications services to rural areas and schools.

In early 2012, the FCC implemented changes to Lifeline aimed at modernizing the program and eliminating fraud and waste. One goal: ensuring availability of broadband for all low-income Americans.

New life in the campaign

Debunking aside, the ""Obama phones"" myth re-emerged during the presidential race. In September, video of an unidentified woman protesting at a Romney rally in Cleveland made its way onto some conservative websites, including the Drudge Report. The woman claimed to have received a free ""Obama phone.""

""Everybody in Cleveland -- low, minority -- got Obama phones,"" she tells an interviewer. ""Keep Obama in president (sic). He gave us a phone. He’s gonna do more.""

The interviewer asks how Obama gave her a phone. Her response: ""You sign up if you on food stamps, you on Social Security, you got low income, you disability.""

Radio host Rush Limbaugh reacted by saying, ""She may not know who George Washington is or Abraham Lincoln, but she knows how to get an Obama phone.""

The Obama campaign also responded, posting a story on its Truth Team website swatting down the rumor and explaining the history of the phone program.

The ""he gave us a phone"" video has become an internet meme, yielding remixes and parodies galore. And earlier this month the group Tea Party Victory Fund released a political ad in Ohio featuring the woman’s rant.

Putnam’s response

We reached out to Putnam’s spokesman at the Florida Department of Agriculture, Sterling Ivey, for backup to the claim. Shortly after our inquiry, Ivey pointed us to Putnam’s Facebook page, where this note was posted:

""About those cell phones: I'd heard about the YouTube video, wasn't aware it was disclaimed. Won't happen again,"" Putnam wrote Wednesday afternoon.

Ivey added: ""I think it’s one of those myths that’s obviously grown a life of its own. He wasn’t aware there was a disproving of the statements in the video.""

Our ruling

Putnam told Romney supporters that the Obama campaign is offering cell phones to get its voters to the polls.

Internet chatter claiming that Obama gave cell phones to welfare recipients contained a tiny grain of truth: The federal government does have a program to subsidize phone service for low-income people. That program, though, existed long before Obama became president. 
Putnam then squeezed all reality out of the story, twisting it into an allegation of dirty campaigning. He has since acknowledged the statement was wrong -- but not before announcing it at a high-profile presidential campaign rally. We rate his statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809C34D780>],/factchecks/2012/oct/31/adam-putnam/putnam-obama-campaign-gives-free-cell-phones-suppo/
"['New Hampshire', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'House Majority PAC']","
Does supporting Ryan budget plan mean Charlie Bass wants seniors to pay more for heath care?
","
If there’s any doubt the role Nashua, NH will play in the upcoming election, look no further than Main Street.

A recent campaign television commercial attacking U.S. Rep Charlie Bass, R-NH, features men and women holding handwritten signs up and down Main Street, quoting Bass calling GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan’s Medicare plan ""A great statement of principle.""

The advertisement was put out by The House Majority PAC -- not to be confused with The New Hampshire House Republican Victory PAC.

The House Majority PAC is a committee ""designed help win back the House Majority for Democrats,"" according to its website, and calls Bass out for voting for Ryan’s plan to ""essentially end Medicare to give more tax breaks to millionaires.""

""Charlie Bass said, ‘I voted for Chairman Ryan’s plan because it is a great statement of principle,’"" the narrator states. ""Seniors would pay $6,400 a year more for health care so millionaires can pay less in taxes. That's Charlie Bass' great statement of principle.""

PolitiFact has heard similar claims about Ryan’s budget resolutions many times before. But we hadn’t examined whether those savings would go to bankroll tax cuts for millionaires.

Even looking at the health care question alone can get tricky because some earlier, related claims reference Ryan’s plan for 2012, which was proposed in 2011.

It is important to note the ""Principle"" ad revolves around a statement Bass made after he voted to support Ryan’s 2013 budget resolution, and cites a March 29, 2012 article in the Manchester Union Leader, although Bass did vote for Ryan’s plan in 2011.

The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan

PolitiFact has checked this claim through a President Barack Obama television advertisement that said Ryan’s plan could raise ""future retirees’ costs more than $6,000,"" noting that Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums, affecting people who today are under 55 only.

The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate. Ryan offered updated versions of the plan as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal, with two key differences from the original. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market -- the price of the second-cheapest plan.

So is the most recent Ryan plan also official policy for the Romney campaign? It appears to be. In an interview with a Green Bay, Wis., television station back on Aug. 15, Romney said, ""Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical.""

This history is important because of how opponent campaigns frame the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan in their ads.

The $6,400 question

Ads using the claim of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs cite a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here’s what the group said:

""In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare,"" center president Bob Greenstein wrote. ""CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double — from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater.""

The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400.

In an interview, Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that the numbers his group used came from CBO, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, and that the center’s role was just to take the CBO analysis and make it ""more understandable.""

In fact, different groups have made slightly different calculations of the out-of-pocket increase -- the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, tabulated the number to be $6,870 -- but the estimates we’ve seen are all in the same ballpark.

But the problem is the CBO analysis, and the others built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase, while still keeping spending lower than current projections. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange.

That means while the traditional Medicare offering — if it’s more expensive than the second-least expensive plan — could cost seniors more out-of-pocket, it’s unlikely to cost them as much as estimates for Ryan’s earlier plan.

""CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed,"" CBO wrote earlier this year.

The Obama campaign has said it would be happy to update its numbers if CBO or the Romney-Ryan campaign provided new data, but neither has. Peter Orszag, Obama’s former Office of Management and Budget director, recently wrote that ""if Ryan believes that changes to his plan since (the original plan was released) would result in any different conclusions, he should request that CBO publish an updated analysis.""

There is one clue that the number wouldn’t be close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan’s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare.

That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month — which adds up to about $800 a year.

Van de Water said one should specify which version of the Ryan plan they’re talking about if they’re going to speculate. But he did say that the Obama campaign’s decision to use the old numbers was defensible. ""It also seems reasonable to cite the most recent available analysis"" when Ryan has not provided enough detail to do a new one.

How about those millionaires

But what about the charge that Bass is supporting changes to Medicare so ""millionaires can pay less in taxes""?

For that portion of the claim, the House Majority PAC cited an April 2011 Wall Street Journal article about Ryan’s 2012 budget proposal, titled ""GOP Aim: Cut $4 Trillion."" They singled out this sentence: ""Conservative activists who are familiar with the Ryan plan said they expect it to call for a fundamental overhaul of the tax system, with a 25% top rate for both individuals and corporations, compared to the current 35% top rate.""

They also pointed to another Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report, published a year later, titled ""New Tax Cuts in Ryan Budget Would Give Millionaires $265,000 on Top of Bush Tax Cuts."" The report cites Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center findings that say people earning more than $1 million a year would receive an average of $265,000 apiece in new tax cuts under Ryan’s plan, on top of the $129,000 they would receive from the Ryan budget’s extension of President Bush’s tax cuts.

PolitiFact has found that there’s not a direct link between the proposed changes to Medicare and tax rates for the wealthy. They’re separate policy areas, and legislation affecting each area would typically be handled separately.

Nevertheless, choices about spending and taxes are not entirely unrelated, given the imbalance in the federal budget in recent years and the significant debt that is building up, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

PolitiFact asked her about the Democratic claims we’ve noticed this year in congressional races around the country, where ads claim that specific spending cuts ""pay for"" tax breaks for the wealthy.

""It’s a huge fight over priorities and semantics,"" she said. ""But it’s difficult to say that one is linked to the other.""

Still, she added, hard choices are ahead for the federal budget in terms of both taxes and spending. ""No one should be talking about any tax cuts or spending increases until we have a plan to get the budget under control,"" she said.

Our ruling:

PolitiFact gave President Obama a Half True for an ad that would have been more accurate if it specified it referred to a previous Ryan plan for Medicare, rather than the current one.

In The House Majority PAC’s case, it plays off a Bass quote about his support of the 2013 congressional budget plan, then uses calculations for the plan Ryan proposed the previous year.

Bass did vote for both Ryan plans, but the 2013 plan lacks enough details to truly determine how much more money seniors may have to pay for Medicare.

And where President Obama used the phrase ""could"" to cite cost increases by more than $6,000 -- giving his claim a little more wiggle room -- The House Majority PAC uses the phrase ""would,"" taking the $6,400 estimation a step further because it implies greater certainty.

On top of that, experts say it’s too difficult to determine how the Romney/Ryan proposed changes to Medicare have a direct link to the tax rates that would be set for the wealthy. We give them a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974978C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/31/house-majority-pac/does-supporting-ryan-budget-plan-mean-you-want-sen/
"['National', 'Financial Regulation', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says Mitt Romney would roll back banking regulations
","
In the final days before the election, the Obama campaign has put up an ad that is a sort of Cliff Notes for voters before they walk into the voting booth. It lists many of the points Obama has used against Mitt Romney throughout this contest.

It warns about the future of Medicare, support for education, tax breaks for the wealthiest, and banking regulation. On that last point, it says, ""Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations on the banks that crashed our economy.""

This fact-check examines that claim and tries to discern what Romney would do about keeping banks clear of the excesses that contributed to the financial crisis.

Romney has not spoken in detail about his financial regulation plans. Sifting through his website, interviews and his public comments, we see these core elements: 
• He would repeal Dodd-Frank, the wide-ranging law that aims to fix many of the lapses associated with the meltdown. Romney has said he would replace the law but has not gone much beyond that concept. 
• Romney supports the idea of regulations. ""Extensive regulation is appropriate in an industry that has such an impact on the overall economy,"" he said in an interview with Time. 
• Romney supports rules to ensure that banks have their own money at risk, as this promotes greater caution. ""You have to have rules for what kind of capital has to stand behind each kind of asset on Wall Street and banks,"" he said on 60 Minutes. This is part of current law. 
• He supports greater transparency for derivatives trading. He told a group of Americans in London, mainly bankers, that ""we do need to have greater transparency in the trading of derivatives, so we know what’s going on -– what kind of exposures various institutions have."" Derivatives as investment devices are not inherently bad but they helped hide the weaknesses of the home mortgage market and increased the exposure of many investors when the sector collapsed. Dodd-Frank has a detailed approach to shedding light on derivatives trading. 
• Romney opposes the current plan for orderly liquidations when banks fail. ""We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks,"" Romney said in the first presidential debate.  However, he has not said how he would change the current law. 
• Romney believes regulators should move faster to define the minimum standards for a home mortgage loan. 
The Obama campaign backs up its claim with a Boston Globe article from last spring. The article emphasizes that Romney says he would do away with Dodd-Frank without saying what would replace it. Since that time, Romney has said a bit more, captured in that list above, but not much more.

In May, one of Romney’s top economic advisers, Glenn Hubbard, said the public could expect more detailed proposals on several key fronts, including what to do if one of the biggest banks fails, consumer financial protections, and housing finance.  However, those proposals never appeared.

The only detail from Hubbard himself targeted the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That agency, created under Dodd-Frank, aims to stand between individuals and the marketing of unfair and deceptive financial services. Hubbard said the bureau might be moved or dismantled, with its functions passed along to existing agencies.

The lack of specifics from Romney has left many people reading the tea leaves. Kenneth Scott is professor of law and business at Stanford Law School. ""I very much doubt that if Romney won there would be a blanket repeal of Dodd-Frank, but there would be an effort at significant amendments,"" Scott said.

Some have looked to Congress for clues. A Bloomberg article described the changes Republicans have passed or introduced.  High on the list are looser rules governing the trade in derivatives, and especially the financial practice called ""swaps."" Swaps are basically insurance against the risk that a borrower won’t repay a loan. It gets more exotic, but that’s the central idea, and it’s very big business. Swaps delivered $7 billion in revenues to banks in the first quarter of 2012. Swaps played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis.

Bloomberg and other news organizations have listed other areas where Republicans have worked to ease financial regulations, such as reversing the Volker Rule, which limits banks on using customer deposits to invest in trades offered by an arm of the same bank.

Bloomberg offered this summary: Dodd-Frank would remain but it would be ""a revamped Dodd-Frank that would accommodate some of the most profitable and riskiest activities while preserving a patina of protection for investors and consumers.""

Still, the precise changes Romney would support are unknown. In addition, some would argue that whatever changes emerge would not increase the odds of another financial crisis. For example, Lawrence White, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, believes the current law on big banks makes risky behavior more likely.

""Repealing THAT part of Dodd-Frank would not ‘roll back regulation on the banks that crashed our economy,’ quite the contrary,"" White said.

We asked the Romney campaign for more specifics in several areas but received no further information.

Our ruling

The Obama ad says ""Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations"" on banks.

Romney has provided scant details on his plans, but he has said that he would push for changes. Romney has never suggested that tougher regulations are needed, and he has said many times that government regulates too much.  It is reasonable to conclude his plans would be more in line with current Republican initiatives than the present law passed by Democrats. That direction points toward fewer restrictions than are in place under Dodd-Frank. Certainly, Romney has said that the provisions for the largest banks should be replaced.

Conservative analysts would say that these changes would not put the financial system at greater risk.

However, the ad simply says Romney would roll back regulations on the institutions that contributed to the financial crisis. How much of a rollback is unclear, but Romney does support a lighter regulatory touch on banks, so we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973B6E80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/31/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-roll-back-banking-regulati/

Sherrod Brown says coal jobs and coal production both up in Ohio
","
There is a war on coal, Republicans are telling the public.

The story line took center stage during a mid-August campaign stop for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Belmont County. With coal miners standing behind him, Romney attacked the Obama administration saying the Democratic president was developing alternative energy at the expense of the coal industry and heavy-handed in regulating the energy resource.

Charges that Democrats have hurt the coal industry have spread to Ohio Senate's race, too. During a U.S. Senate debate held by the City Club of Cleveland on Oct. 16, a questioner asked incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown how he could support jobs and cheaper energy in Ohio while backing a president that has declared war on coal.

Brown fired back saying the ""war on coal"" rhetoric is empty.

""There is no war on coal. Period. There are more coal jobs and more coal produced in Ohio than there were five years ago, in spite of the talking points and the yard signs,"" he told the audience.

Has coal production and the number of coal mining jobs in Ohio really gone up during the time Obama has been in office? PoltiFact Ohio got out the pickaxes and started digging for facts.

First, we turned to Brown's campaign to find out the source of Brown's information.

Brown campaign spokesman Justin Barasky sent us some information from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources annual coal reports showing that production in 2010 was 28,364,000 tons compared to 22,283,072 tons in 2007. Those same ODNR-produced reports show the monthly employment average for coal mining jobs in Ohio in 2010 was 2,879, compared to a monthly average of 2,204 in 2007.

With the 2011 state coal report due out any day, ODNR spokeswoman Heidi Hetzel-Evans was able to tell us that the 2011 report will show that Ohio produced about 27,929,089 tons of coal--a slight drop from the 2010 data that Brown was basing his comment on. Coal mining jobs in Ohio in 2011 were up over the previous year with an average of 2,995 a month, and obviously, both are well ahead of 2007 figures.

PolitiFact Ohio also checked with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provided a second source of data with even more recent numbers. The EIA estimates coal production for every state on a weekly basis and the October 13 report showed Ohio coal production so far this year up about 1.9 percent over last year.

For the most recent 12 months, from October 13, 2011, to October 13, 2012, Ohio has produced about 28,456,000 tons of coal. That matches up fairly closely with the ODNR reports and certainly shows that there hasn't been any fall off in coal production in Ohio in recent months.

We also looked for a second source on the coal mining jobs numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps a Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages which tracks job numbers in specific industries. For Ohio, the census data showed an average of 2,570 coal mining jobs statewide in 2011.

That's almost 30 percent higher than 2007 when the bureau showed only 2,010 coal mining jobs in Ohio. Counted in those statistics are jobs related to the actual mining of coal as well as developing coal mining sites and preparing the coal such as cleaning and screening the coal to be sold.

So why has production of Ohio's high-sulfur coal increased in the last few years?

Coal industry analysts generally attribute the jump in coal production to an increase in exports to overseas markets such as China and India, which need coal for cheap energy and to use  in the steel-making process.

So after mining for facts what are we left with?

In defending the Democratic record on coal during a debate, Sherrod Brown said coal production and coal jobs in Ohio are up compared to five years ago. After consulting with state and federal statistics, it appears that jobs and coal production in Ohio have increased compared to 2007 levels by every measurement we could find.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Browns' statement rates True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E02900>],/factchecks/2012/oct/31/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-coal-jobs-and-coal-production-b/

Bill Young says he opposed $716 billion Medicare cut
","
U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, the Indian Shores Republican incumbent of 42 years, touts his credibility with seniors in a TV spot clearly aimed at the 65-plus crowd.

An ensemble of older men and women, and even former Gov. Jeb Bush, praise Young for being there for seniors.

""Florida seniors couldn’t have a bigger champion than Congressman Bill Young,"" Bush says.

Amid the endorsements are claims about Young’s record on Social Security, the Medicare prescription drug program, support for a balanced budget amendment, and, of course, Medicare.

""Young opposed $716-billion cut to Medicare,"" bold text shows.

Below that text is a citation: ""House Roll Call Vote 165 - 3/21/2010.""

It’s the House vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which Young voted against. Does that mean he rejected ""the $716 billion cut to Medicare?""

We also checked a dueling Medicare claim from his challenger, Democratic lawyer Jessica Ehrlich, over whether he voted for the Ryan budgets that ""end the current Medicare system.""

The $716 billion cut

You could say we’ve heard this line a time or two.

This attack line is a viral one in the political world, used by Mitt Romney against President Barack Obama, Rep. Connie Mack against Sen. Bill Nelson, and in many, many, many other races across the country.

It’s not a ""cut"" in the traditional sense. Medicare is an open-ended entitlement program with a growth problem that threatens its future viability. Both parties agree changes should be made.

Obama did not propose a cut to Medicare’s budget in his health care law. Rather, the law made several changes to slow the growth of Medicare costs. These changes primarily affected insurance companies and hospitals -- not beneficiaries.

The government, for example, will pay hospitals less if they have too many readmissions or fail to meet new benchmarks for care. The law also deals with Medicare Advantage, which is a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers started under President George W. Bush with the goal of reducing costs through marketplace competition. The plans have actually proven more expensive than traditional Medicare in recent years, so the health care law aims to reduce payments to private insurers as a way to rein in costs.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.

It’s worth pointing out Young could not have known he was specifically voting against $716 billion in Medicare ""cuts,"" as that had not been tabulated in time for the health care vote that happened two years earlier.

Still, it was known at the bill’s passage that there were major reductions in store for Medicare service providers, said economist Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at the international health foundation Project HOPE and Medicare director under President George H.W. Bush.

A tricky point for Young’s claim is that he also voted for the budget blueprint of Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- twice, actually. The budget is a congressional resolution that does not carry the force of law, and Ryan’s ideas have not been turned into detailed legislation.

Even so, Ryan has said his most recent budget factors in the same $716 billion in reductions in Medicare spending.

Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter made this point on Face the Nation in August, saying Ryan ""protected those cuts in his budget."" PolitiFact rated her statement True.

The Romney campaign responded to Cutter’s remark with a statement that Romney intended to repeal the health care law and end the Medicare ""raid."" Ryan said he factored the $716 billion savings in his budget it ""was already in the baseline,"" the Wall Street Journal reported. ""We would never have done it in the first place."" However, his budget assumed reversal of other Obama spending decisions, the Journal pointed out.

A month later, former President Bill Clinton reprised the attack in his Democratic National Convention speech, quipping, ""it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did."" We rated it True.

Ehrlich’s position

Ehrlich is in an interesting spot here. She, too, opposes this ""cut.""

Even though she supports the health care law, she told the Tampa Bay Times, ""I am against the $500 billion cuts to Medicare in both the Affordable Care Act and the Ryan budget. I also oppose the Independent Panel Advisory Board in the Affordable Care Act and would support legislation to overturn that provision.""

She has attacked Young for voting for the Ryan budgets that reshape how Medicare works.

When we asked her to elaborate on her position in an interview, she said she wanted to keep Medicare ""fully funded.""

""I think we have to maintain the integrity of the program, make sure that it’s fully funded, and not advocate for cutting until we look at the budget as a whole,"" she said.

She did not provide specifics for reducing the program’s spending. 
Young said she could not have had it both ways if she were a member of Congress at the time of the vote. 
""If you voted for the bill, you voted for the Medicare cut,"" he said.

Our ruling

Young’s ad says he voted against the controversial $716 billion Medicare cut.

What he voted against was the Affordable Care Act, which implements an estimated $716 billion reduction in payments to hospitals and private insurers in effort to reduce the program’s ever-increasing costs. He could not have known the amount would be $716 billion, as that estimate came two years after the health care vote. Meanwhile, the Republicans have their own plan for reducing future Medicare spending, by bring more private insurance companies into Medicare and offering voucher-like premium support.

The claim excludes several points. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E12740>],/factchecks/2012/oct/30/cw-bill-young/bill-young-says-he-opposed-716-billion-medicare-cu/
"['Medicare', 'Florida', 'Jessica Ehrlich']","
Jessica Ehrlich says Bill Young voted twice to ""end the current Medicare system""
","
U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young began his tenure in Congress in 1970, a streak that makes the 81-year-old from Indian Shores the longest-serving Republican in the U.S. House.

The first-time candidate challenging Young’s re-election does not want voters to forget it.

Democratic attorney Jessica Ehrlich, 38, sponsored a TV attack ad that she says is the first commercial challenging Young in 20 years.

It’s called ""1970.""

Narrator: ""Before the Tampa Bay Bucs, Nixon was president, disco was on the rise, and Bill Young was in Congress.""

Ehrlich: ""I'm Jessica Ehrlich, and Bill Young is a nice man, but after 42 years in Congress he's lost touch. Why else would he vote twice for the Ryan budget that ends the current Medicare system? Seniors pay thousands more each year, and the wealthy get more tax cuts.""

We’re not surprised to hear Ehrlich challenge Young’s record on Medicare, the health care program for seniors. The issue is of particular relevance to Young’s constituents in Congressional District 13th, about 22 percent of whom are senior citizens.

We’re also not surprised to hear she chose this line of attack. Democrats have sent grave warnings about Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and his budget proposals for the past couple years, heightening their attacks after Mitt Romney chose Ryan as his running mate.

Ehrlich’s message that Young voted for a budget ""that ends the current Medicare system"" is similar to attacks PolitiFact previously deemed too much of a stretch.

The Democrats’ rallying cry that Republicans voted to ""end Medicare"" was our 2011 ""Lie of the Year."" We’ve also heard the refined version that Republicans want to end Medicare ""as we know it."" We heard good arguments from experts who said his plan does not end Medicare ""as we know it"" and those who said it did, so we did not rate that claim.

Where does Ehrlich’s claim fall? Do the Ryan budgets end the current Medicare system?

Without question, Ryan’s vision would substantially change Medicare.

Medicare is a fast-growing program within the federal budget, and both parties agree that reform is necessary to preserve it.

The Democrats, led by President Barack Obama, want to keep Medicare largely the way it is but with more regulations and oversight of payments to doctors and hospitals. The Republicans want private insurers to be more involved and let the marketplace lower costs, and Ryan has led that charge as House Budget Committee chairman.

Ryan would leave Medicare in its current form for people who are 55 and older. Most attacks from Democrats omit this important detail.

It’s a different story for future beneficiaries. In short, they would receive government subsidies to buy their own plans.

""That is completely a different system than the one that we currently have,"" Ehrlich said in an interview. 
The charge isn’t accurate because Ryan’s new plan keeps traditional Medicare as an option, Young said in an interview. 
""It’s ridiculous to think that in a district like mine that a member of Congress would vote in a negative way on Social Security and Medicare,"" he said. 
PolitiFact rated Democratic critiques that Republicans want ""to turn Medicare into a voucher system"" Mostly True.

Ryan’s 2011 budget plan -- a resolution that does not carry the force of law -- would not have provided a traditional Medicare plan, leaving seniors to use their voucher-like credits on strictly private insurance plans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost seniors $6,400 in extra health care costs.

Ryan responded to criticism about his original plan by including a traditional Medicare plan in his more recent version. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange, among other adjustments to the original plan.

Ryan’s plan includes constraints on private insurers, including that they would have to cover services stipulated by the federal government, and poor and sicker people would get larger subsidies.

Romney has said he supports the Ryan plan’s goals and that his own plan for Medicare would be close to identical.

We fact-checkers don’t know if seniors would pay ""thousands more each year"" for health care, as Ehrlich claimed in the ad, because Ryan has not submitted the 2012 plan to CBO for analysis.

The Democrats warn that if Ryan’s plan doesn’t drive down prices as much as he hopes, beneficiaries would pay more or lose benefits. In another scenario, the government could increase the amount of credits to keep up with costs, but that erodes the goal of the government saving money.

Young voted for Ryan’s previous budget resolutions in 2011 and 2012.

Our ruling

A TV ad from Jessica Ehrlich claims Bill Young voted ""twice for the Ryan budget that ends the current Medicare system.""

Indeed, Young voted in favor of two Ryan budget blueprints that fundamentally change how Medicare works. Instead of the government paying for individual health services for seniors, seniors would receive a voucher-like credit toward the insurance plan of their choice, which includes a traditional Medicare option.

Some argue the Democrats, too, are ending the current Medicare system by moving it from an open-ended entitlement program to one that tries to rein in spending by controlling how much physicians and insurers are reimbursed.

The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. So we rate it Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097040D00>],/factchecks/2012/oct/30/jessica-ehrlich/jessica-ehrlich-says-bill-young-voted-twice-end-cu/

Barack Obama, critics clash on whether Planned Parenthood provides mammograms
","
In recent weeks, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have sparred over Romney’s promise to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

Romney has made his pledge several times, most recently in speaking to reporters in Ohio in mid-October, when he said, ""I think I’ve said time and again that I’m a pro-life candidate and I’ll be a pro-life president. The actions I’ll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget.""

On several occasions, Obama has countered that doing so would hamper women’s health services.

""When Gov. Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care -- they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings,"" Obama said during the second presidential debate on Oct. 17, 2012.

Obama reiterated the point during a campaign appearance a day later in in Manchester, N.H., saying, ""Gov. Romney said he’d end funding for Planned Parenthood, despite all the work it does to provide women with mammograms and breast cancer screenings.""

Obama even repeated it on NBC’s Tonight Show with Jay Leno, saying, ""You’ve got issues like Planned Parenthood, where that organization provides millions of women cervical-cancer screenings, mammograms, all kinds of basic health care.""

Planned Parenthood says that nearly 3 million people in the United States visit Planned Parenthood affiliate health centers every year, so Obama is correct on the scale of how many people use its health services. And he’s right about the group offering cervical cancer screenings (it provided 769,769 pap smears in 2010) and contraceptive services not including abortion (more than 3.7 million cases in the same year).

However, Planned Parenthood’s relationship with mammograms specifically, is a bit more complicated than Obama suggests.

As PolitiFact Georgia wrote earlier this year, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards denounced proposed federal cuts in February 2011 on HLN’s ""The Joy Behar Show,"" saying that millions of women in the country would lose access to health care, not to abortion services but to basic family planning services, such as mammograms and cancer screenings.

But Richards was immediately challenged on her statement by the California-based anti-abortion group Live Action, which secretly recorded phone conversations between an actress and employees at various Planned Parenthood clinics. The actress, supposedly seeking a mammogram, was told the service was not available and in some cases was referred elsewhere. Richards said her comments on Behar’s show were taken out of context.

So what exactly does Planned Parenthood do regarding mammograms?

The organization reported that in 2010, it provided 747,607 breast examinations. But the organization acknowledges that those involve physical examinations by medical professionals, not mammograms.

""Although Planned Parenthood health centers do not offer mammography, each affiliate must have a physician available who is able to evaluate patients identified with abnormal breast findings who have been referred by clinicians, either on-site or by referral, and each affiliate maintains a list of radiologists and breast disease specialists to whom Planned Parenthood patients can be referred,"" the group says.

A statement posted on Planned Parenthood’s website, dated Oct. 17, 2012, explained the group’s approach.

""Planned Parenthood helps women nationwide get access to mammograms, as part of the range of health care Planned Parenthood health centers provide to nearly three million people a year. Planned Parenthood doctors and nurses do this like any other primary care provider or ob-gyn does,"" the statement said, adding that ""women rely on Planned Parenthood for referrals for and financial help with mammograms and specialized diagnostic follow-up tests (like ultrasounds and biopsies) when indicated by age, history and/or clinical breast exam.""

The statement continued, ""Like the vast majority of primary care physicians and ob-gyns, Planned Parenthood doctors and nurses refer patients to other facilities for mammograms based on breast exams, age, or family history. For many women, Planned Parenthood is the only health care provider they will see all year, and thus the only way they will get a referral for a mammogram Planned Parenthood medical professionals have established relationships with local breast imaging centers and specialists. In some instances case management is done by the Planned Parenthood health center and in others the management is coordinated by the specialist.""

Our ruling

Obama said that ""there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care; they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.""

The critics have a point that Planned Parenthood does not actually provide mammograms; instead, the organization refers patients who need them offsite. Supporters of Planned Parenthood also have a point that the organization serves as an important link between some female patients and the mammograms a doctor determines they need.

On several occasions, Obama has oversimplified and exaggerated what Planned Parenthood does, but he’s also not entirely wrong that the group makes it possible for many women to get mammograms they need. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097069E40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/30/barack-obama/barack-obama-critics-clash-whether-planned-parenth/

Obama ad says Romney will make ‘catastrophic cuts to education’
","
With Election Day approaching, a new ad from Barack Obama implores voters to remember, in the solitude of the voting booth, what Mitt Romney plans for the country.

""In here, it’s just you,"" a narrators says against an image of a man voting. ""No ads, no debates, just you.

""So think about this: Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations on the banks that crashed our economy. Medicare: voucherized. Catastrophic cuts to education. Millionaires will get one of the largest tax cuts ever, while middle class families pay more.

""That’s what Mitt Romney wants to bring here,"" the narrator says against a photo of the White House. ""Remember that when you go here."" (Another voting booth shot.)

PolitiFact has examined numerous claims throughout the campaign about the potential effects of Romney tax plan and the budget constructed by his running mate, Paul Ryan, who’s also the chair of the budget committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. Here we’ll look specifically at the charge that Romney would make ""catastrophic cuts"" to education.

The Ryan budget
   
Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, first presented his budget in 2011. Versions of it have passed the House each of the last two years, but it has never passed the Democratic-controlled Senate. The 2013 proposal cuts $5.3 trillion from the federal ledger over the next decade by enacting major changes in entitlement programs and making steep reductions in discretionary domestic spending to bring down the public debt.
   
Ryan’s plan doesn’t say which programs would be cut or by how much, nor does it dictate that programs be cut across the board. But because the budget reduces federal spending so drastically -- from its current level of 12.5 percent of GDP down to 5.75 percent by 2030 -- experts say deep program cuts will be necessary. Any direct cuts to schools, though, would be implemented at the state and local level. Those are the government entities that collect taxes that fund individual school districts.

Where does Romney stand on the Ryan budget?
   
In March 2012, Romney said in Chicago, ""I’m very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. The following week, while campaigning in Wisconsin, he added, ""I think it’d be marvelous if the Senate were to pick up Paul Ryan’s budget and adopt it and pass it along to the President.""
   
More recently, since Ryan joined the ticket, Romney has said the two agree broadly. ""I’m sure there are places that my budget is different than his, but we’re on the same page,"" he said in August. The campaign has also emphasized the Romney will put together his own plan.
   
But on his website, Romney makes this promise about ""stopping the bleeding"" of federal spending: ""Pass the House Republican Budget proposal, rolling back President Obama’s government expansion by capping non-security discretionary spending below 2008 levels.""

On education

The Obama ad cites the Denver Post as its source for the ""catastrophic cuts"" to education claim. But that Oct. 19 story is actually an editorial endorsing Obama’s re-election. And the cuts are not specific to education.

""Romney's approach is one of tax cuts for all, drastic Medicare reform, increased defense spending, and what would be catastrophic cuts to other discretionary programs,"" the editorial said.

The campaign also pointed us to an analysis of Ryan’s budget by the White House Office of Management and Budget. The OMB generally presents reliable numbers, but it’s important to bear in mind that it’s part of the Obama administration. The report from March 2012 is headlined ""The Ryan-Republican Budget: The Consequences of Imbalance.""

The report criticizes the proposed spending cuts, and the overall lack of specificity.

""What would it all mean? The Budget doesn’t say. In fact, the Budget resolution includes a magic asterisk — or, in more technical parlance, an ‘allowance’— for $897 billion in unspecified cuts. But what could the resolution mean? Since the House has refused to specify what would be cut, we consider the impacts if the cuts are distributed equally across the Budget. The result would be that.""

So the analysis assumes across-the-board cuts, which -- again -- is not specified in Ryan’s budget. Under that assumption, OMB predicted that the Department of Education would be cut by more than $115 billion over a decade.

The fallout of that? According to the OMB: ""9.6 million students would see their Pell Grants fall by more than $1,000 in 2014, and, over the next decade, over one million students would lose support altogether. This would derail bipartisan education reforms and deeply undermine K-12 education and college opportunity.""

Romney’s position

We contacted the Romney campaign, which directed us to comments the former Massachusetts governor made in the first presidential debate on Oct. 3.

""I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm not planning on making changes there,"" Romney said.

On the specific issue of Pell grants for college students, Romney said at a Univision Forum in Miami on Sept. 19, ""We’re going to continue a Pell Grant program. … I think the Republican budget called for a Pell Grants being capped out at their current high level. My inclination would be to have them go with the rate of inflation."" 
But that stands in contrast with what Romney told donors at a private fundraiser in April. Then, he said he would at least restructure the federal education agency and make it smaller. 
""The Department of Education: I will either consolidate with another agency, or perhaps make it a heck of a lot smaller. I'm not going to get rid of it entirely,"" Romney said.

Our ruling

Obama’s ad said Romney would make ""catastrophic cuts to education.""

The statement assumes Romney would adopt the Ryan budget, a blueprint he has generally embraced. The Ryan budget does not specify any cuts to education funding, but we think it’s fair to expect significant reductions to any domestic program, given that lower spending is the goal of the Ryan proposal. And Romney is on the record as saying he would shrink the Department of Education.
   
The ad’s claim uses exaggeration to fill in the blanks of what Romney might do, but the Ryan budget and Romney's own words point toward cuts. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809738E740>],/factchecks/2012/oct/30/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-will-make-catastrophic-cuts-e/

Clint Eastwood says in ad that U.S. borrows $4B day, much 'from China’
","
In an ad from American Crossroads, Clint Eastwood tells the country it ""just couldn’t survive"" another four years of President Barack Obama: ""We borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China,"" he says.

The message, part of a $12.6 million ad barrage, is running in seven states, including Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia. 
Images of unemployed workers and foreign-marked shipping containers accompany Eastwood’s gravelly narration: 

It’s been more than a year since we’ve checked similar claims that the country borrows $4 billion a day — something we found Mostly True. We wondered: Is that still the case? And do we borrow ""much of it"" from China? 
We asked American Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio for evidence for the ad’s claim.

""I'm going to let you take a crack at that and get back to me,"" he said.

We sent him a brief roundup of what we had found so far. We didn’t hear back.

 How much we borrow

The federal government doesn’t literally borrow money every day, but through periodic bond auctions. So we assumed the ad used an average.

Here’s one way to do the math on $4 billion a day.

The total federal debt on the day the ad was released, according to the Treasury Department, was $16.2 trillion. On the day Obama took office, it was $10.6 trillion. That’s a gain of $5.6 trillion — about $4 billion a day.

There are a few nits to pick with this math. First, we’re not currently borrowing that much. Over the last year, the average has been about $3.4 billion a day, not $4 billion.

Second, that’s using a measure of the entire federal debt — including the big chunk we owe ourselves that’s held by government accounts such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

""Debt held by the public"" is the the amount the federal government has actually borrowed to finance deficits. And the amount added to the public debt since Obama took office averages about $3.7 billion a day, not $4 billion.

Still, this part of the claim is pretty close.

 ‘Much of it from China’

Then there’s the part about China. This is where the ad’s claim gets goofy.

If we assume Eastwood’s talking about what’s been added to the entire federal debt since Obama took office — the amount that averages $4 billion a day — here’s how much as of August China owns: 7.7 percent.

If someone told you that there were two pieces to our recent debt, one piece under 8 percent and one piece above 92 percent, then asked you which of those pieces represented ""much of it,"" what would you say? We’re guessing the non-Chinese piece.

Still, China is the No. 1 foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities. (About a third of our total debt is held by foreigners.)

So the main concern about U.S. public debt held by foreigners is mainly what might happen if they all stopped buying. It could drive up U.S. interest rates, said Wayne Morrison, a specialist in Asian trade and finance for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.

Does that give China some sort of leverage? Or what if they sold off their U.S. securities all at once, sparking some kind of financial crisis?

""Many economists argue that such a move is highly unlikely,"" Morrison told PolitiFact.

If China tried a big selloff, it would drive up supply of U.S. Treasuries and drive down their value — tanking the value of China’s own holdings.

 Our ruling

Eastwood, speaking in a recent American Crossroads ad, warns that, ""We borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China."" That amount is the rough daily average of all U.S. debt added since Obama took office, including the type the government owes itself. It’s not the current rate, which has been somewhat lower. And while China is the No. 1 foreign holder of U.S. securities, it purchased less than 10 percent of that debt. This claim is only partly accurate. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097481680>],/factchecks/2012/oct/30/clint-eastwood/clint-eastwood-says-ad-us-borrows-4-billion-day-mu/

Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin says she voted against Medicare Part D because it wasn't paid for
","
In the political war for a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat, a key battleground for Republican Tommy Thompson and Democrat Tammy Baldwin is Medicare Part D.

Thompson, who was President George W. Bush’s point man in getting Congress to approve Part D, touts the prescription drug program as an important benefit for senior citizens. And he chides Baldwin for voting against it.

In an Oct. 24, 2012, meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Baldwin explained why she voted no.

""I want you to know I support strongly Medicare Part D,"" the Madison congresswoman said, ""but I would have paid for it. And that's why I voted no, it was because it was unfunded.""

Baldwin has been portrayed in the campaign as anything but a fiscal hawk.

So, did she really cite the lack of a tax increase or other funding mechanism when she opposed the program?

The program and the vote

Medicare Part D is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans, and recipients choose the plan that's best for them. When the program was created in 2003, the government subsidy to help recipients buy their drugs was estimated to cost $394 billion over 10 years.

We’ve rated True a claim by Baldwin that the Part D law, ""adopted under Thompson’s watch,"" bars the government from negotiating for ""better prices"" on prescription drugs. Thompson’s was Bush’s health and human services secretary at the time.

We’ve also rated as Mostly False a Thompson claim that he ""had nothing to do"" with the clause in Part D that prevents the government from negotiating drug prices for Part D.

Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus did not respond to our requests for evidence that Baldwin voted against Part D because it was unfunded. But we found a half dozen statements made by Baldwin at the time, which make clear what her quarrel with the measure was when it passed.

June 22, 2002: In a statement on the House floor, a year before the initial House vote, Baldwin called the GOP’s Part D bill a ""sham,"" saying senior citizens ""need a comprehensive prescription drug benefit that has no gaps or gimmicks in coverage. They need real prescription drug coverage under Medicare.""

June 28, 2003: After the initial House vote, Baldwin said in a news article in The Capital Times of Madison that she voted against the bill because it would force senior citizens into health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations that, unlike Medicare, limit their choice of doctors.

July 21, 2003: Baldwin said in a news releases he voted against the bill because it  ""creates a gaping hole that fails to cover millions of seniors."" She also said there were concerns about the bill leading to the privatization of Medicare.

Nov. 21, 2003: In remarks on the House floor prior to the final House vote, Baldwin repeated several of her criticisms, noting the federal government is barred from negotiating drug prices under Part D.

Nov. 22, 2003: In an opinion piece for The Capital Times, Baldwin said the GOP bill ""offers a meager prescription drug benefit, does nothing to control the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs and begins to dismantle the entire Medicare program."" The same day, Baldwin voted against the bill that was signed into law; it passed, 220-215, largely along party lines.

Dec. 8, 2003: In a news release on the day Bush signed Medicare Part D, Baldwin made the same criticism she did in the opinion article.

In general, Democratic critics complained that expanding the role for private insurers would undermine traditional Medicare. There were also conservative critics, who said the bill didn’t do enough to contain Medicare costs.

So, Baldwin at the time cited a host of reasons for voting no -- that the measure  left some seniors without coverage, that it undermines traditional Medicare, that it does not control prescription drug costs, that the federal government is barred from negotiating drug prices.

But in the statements we found, there was nothing about the bill being ""unfunded,"" which Baldwin now says is the reason for her opposition.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Wisconsin', 'Tommy Thompson']","
Tommy Thompson says he ""had nothing to do with"" provision barring U.S. from negotiating Medicare prescription drug prices
","
Campaigning for the U.S. Senate, Republican Tommy Thompson called himself the ""mastermind"" of Medicare Part D, which he pushed while serving as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

On Oct. 18, 2012, in the second of three debates with Tammy Baldwin, Thompson again took credit for the program and criticized the Democratic congresswoman for voting against it.

But he rejected an accusation by Baldwin that he was responsible for one controversial provision.

A provision known as ""non-interference"" -- prohibiting the government from negotiating with drug makers over drug prices -- was first proposed in 1999 by Democrats, notably President Bill Clinton, Thompson claimed.

And Thompson said it was Congress that inserted a non-interference clause in the Medicare Part D legislation he pushed, which became law in 2003.

""I had nothing to do with it,"" Thompson said.

Baldwin shot back: ""You were the quarterback and the mastermind of Medicare Part D, but you had nothing to do with it?""

Baldwin has repeatedly attacked Thompson over the non-interference provision and did so again in the pair’s third and final debate a week later. She calls it a ""sweetheart deal"" for drug companies, saying the government can’t use its bargaining power to try and obtain lower drug prices -- although others counter that competition among private insurers in Part D has led to lower prices.

We’ve rated True a claim by Baldwin that the Part D law, ""adopted under Thompson’s watch,"" bars the government from negotiating for ""better prices"" on prescription drugs. At the time, six weeks before the second debate with Baldwin, Thompson’s campaign said nothing about the non-interference clause being the Democrats’  doing.

That’s a different claim.

Let’s check it out.

Thompson’s case

Medicare Part D is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. A key feature is that private insurance companies offer a variety of plans and beneficiaries choose the plan that's best for them. The government subsidizes the program but does not run it.

Medical Part D was created by the Medicare Modernization Act, which also made other changes to Medicare. It was proposed by President George W. Bush, and Thompson was the administration’s point man on lobbying Congress to create it.

When we asked for evidence to back Thompson’s claim that others were responsible for non-interference, his campaign did not respond. But Thompson expounded on his claim both in the second and third debates and in a meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters on the day of the second debate.

Thompson said non-interference was first introduced by Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders in a Medicare Part D proposal in 1999, which did not become law.

Thompson also maintained that when the Bush administration proposed Part D, it contained only general principles. He said non-interference became part of the law only after it was introduced by then-Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.

""I had nothing to do with it, never had a sweetheart deal with anybody,"" he told the Journal Sentinel.

The record

The Clinton Part D proposal did, as Thompson said, include a non-interference clause. But the language differs from that in the Medicare Part D that later became law under Bush.

Under the Clinton proposal, pharmacy benefit managers would have negotiated on behalf of the federal government with drug manufacturers, said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
But in Bush’s Part D, the government can’t negotiate at all, leaving negotiation up to the individual insurance plans.

Park agreed with Thompson that Bush’s Part D proposal was a set of principles and not legislation. But while Democrat Baucus was very involved in the Part D legislation, Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House, Park noted.

As for Thompson’s claim that he had ""nothing to do"" with the non-interference clause that ended up in the law, that didn’t wash with Park or other experts we interviewed.

""Any time Congress is involved in major legislation, the administration is heavily involved,"" said Park.

Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free market principles in health care, said the Bush administration clearly supported non-interference to promote competition among private insurers and keep the government out of setting drug prices.

""It’s really the key element to allowing this competitive marketplace to work,"" said Turner, who noted that Medicare Part D has cost less than was anticipated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Indeed, in 2007, when Democrats pushed legislation to repeal non-interference, Bush threatened a veto, arguing that competition among insurers was resulting in lower drug prices.

Our rating

Thompson said Democrats first proposed prohibiting the government from negotiating prices for prescription drugs in Medicare Part D and he ""had nothing to do with"" that provision in the final law.

Democrats did introduce a version of the so-called non-interference provision, but it didn’t go as far as the provision that became law under Bush. Moreover, Thompson was the point man on Medicare Part D for the Bush administration, which supported non-interference.

Mitt Romney says Obama's Chrysler deal undermined U.S. workers
","With Ohio’s 18 electoral votes very much in play, the Mitt Romney campaign aims to blunt one of Barack Obama’s key advantages in that state -- his rescue of the auto industry. The carmakers account for about one out of eight jobs there, and many Ohio assembly line workers are backing Obama for a second term.

The Romney campaign has produced a controversial ad that argues Romney would be better for the auto industry than Obama. In the ad, an announcer says, ""Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job."" Images of cars being crushed accompany those words.

The not-so-subtle message is that American workers have suffered from the Chrysler deal. In this fact check, we examine whether the sale of Chrysler came at the cost of American jobs.

How Fiat got Chrysler

By early 2008, it was clear that GM and Chrysler were teetering. Both firms had huge debts and high costs. The recession had slowed car sales to a trickle. Chrysler’s owner, Cerberus Capital Management, was hunting for a buyer and had been talking to Italian carmaker Fiat. In late 2008, President George W. Bush approved billion dollar loans to the companies to keep them afloat.

On Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama took the oath of office, Fiat announced it was interested in buying Chrysler. Obama created an auto task force and in March, the task force told Chrysler to cut a deal with Fiat or be cut off from further government loans. In early April, Chrysler filed for bankruptcy and at the same time, announced an alliance with Fiat.

By the end of April, the terms of the deal were complete and by June, it was finalized. Cerberus Capital had lost its stake, and Fiat held 20 percent of the new Chrysler and had full operational control.

Steve Rattner, chair of the president’s auto task force, said Fiat was essential to Chrysler’s survival.

""If we had been unable to strike this arrangement with Fiat, I believe that we would have allowed Chrysler to liquidate. So it was a great outcome for all concerned,"" Rattner said.

Aaron Bragman, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive, a financial research group, said the government couldn’t sell Chrysler because it never owned it. In fact, the auto industry and Chrysler were in such bad shape, this wasn’t a sale at all in the conventional sense.

""Fiat paid nothing for Chrysler,"" Bragman said, but ""they poured MASSIVE resources into the company, such as design help, executive staff and personnel, joint development, engine technology, all sorts of non-cash things that helped Chrysler recover considerably.""

Chrysler is now profitable. Laid-off union workers have been rehired, and the company is adding new personnel.

Fiat, Jeeps, and China

When Fiat got Chrysler, it got Jeep. Right before the ad came out, Romney told a crowd in Defiance, Ohio, that plans were afoot to shift the Jeep jobs in Ohio to China.

""I saw a story today that one of the great manufacturers in this state Jeep — now owned by the Italians — is thinking of moving all production to China,"" Romney said.

Romney had been working off an article from Bloomberg News about Fiat’s discussions to start making Jeeps again in China. The old Chrysler had assembly plants in China, but they had been idle since 2009.

Romney’s words drew an immediate and firm denial from Chrysler headquarters. ""Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China,"" the statement said. ""A careful and unbiased reading of the Bloomberg take would have saved unnecessary fantasies and extravagant comments.""

Bragman, the auto analyst, said Romney’s notion that expansion in China comes at a cost to American workers runs counter to the facts. Chrysler’s Toledo plant is running at full capacity, and its Detroit plant is at three shifts. Chrysler is building cars in the United States for sale here. The production of cars in China is a sign of Chrysler's growing strength in overseas markets. It would like to build Jeeps in China to sell in China. It is not outsourcing American auto jobs.

""I'm astonished that more people aren't thrilled by the fact that an American company on the brink of literal oblivion has come back strong enough to now once again be making and selling its products in the hottest auto market in the world,"" Bragman said. ""It is a phenomenal success story, quite frankly, and one that has sadly been bizarrely twisted out of shape for political expediency.""

Our ruling

The Romney campaign ad says Obama ""sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China"" at the cost of American jobs. The ad leaves the clear impression that Jeeps built in China come at the expense of American workers.

The ad miscasts the government’s role in Fiat’s acquisition of Chrysler, and it misrepresents the outcome. Chrysler’s owners had been trying to sell to Italy-based Fiat before Obama took office. The ad ignores the return of American jobs to Chrysler Jeep plants in the United States, and it presents the manufacture of Jeeps in China as a threat, rather than an opportunity to sell cars made in China to Chinese consumers. It strings together facts in a way that presents an wholly inaccurate picture.

U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says he voted for tougher laws against child abusers, domestic abusers, when he was a Rhode Island state representative
","
Republican Brendan Doherty has been mining U.S. Rep. David Cicilline’s legal and legislative resume recently, pointing out unsavory law clients Cicilline represented as a criminal defense lawyer and criticizing him for votes that he took during his eight years in the Rhode Island House of Representatives.

In an Oct. 9, 2012, news release, Doherty accused Cicilline, a freshman Democrat, of voting against two bills in the mid-1990s that would have imposed mandatory sentences for certain domestic violence and child abuse offenses. We examined Doherty’s claim and ruled it True.

Last week  the Cicilline campaign  decided two could play that game, releasing a television ad that labeled Doherty’s attacks ""outrageous.""

The ad cited anti-crime bills Cicilline supported in the legislature on behalf of women, the elderly and other victims of crimes, including cases of sexual abuse.

We decided to check Cicilline’s list, checking Journals of the Rhode Island House, state statutes, and our own news files. We found that the ad accurately cited the legislation and Cicilline’s votes.

The first involved crimes against the elderly.

In 1998, Cicilline was among a group of legislators who supported a bill called the Elderly Violence Protection Act. It established that particular crimes should be charged differently if they were committed against a victim older than 60.   

On July 14, 1998, he made a motion, which was approved, to add breaking and entering to that list.  He was the only one of the group of sponsors or seconders to discuss the act on the floor. It passed on a 69-3 vote and ultimately became law.
 
In the 2000 legislative session, Cicilline proposed legislation that would have created a crime of indecent solicitation of a child under 14 for the purpose of sexual molestation. It didn’t pass that year. But in 2004, two years after Cicilline had left the state House for the Providence mayor’s office, a similar bill was enacted, though it set the age at 18, rather than 14.

The next year Cicilline introduced a bill that would have eliminated the statute of limitations for lawsuits filed by victims of child sexual abuse. The existing law said someone so harmed had seven years to file a suit. The bill didn’t pass and the seven-year limit remains in effect today.

In 2002, he submitted a bill that would have prohibited anyone who has been the subject of a restraining order from owning firearms.

The existing law forbade people who had been convicted of a crime of violence, a felony or who were under home confinement from owning a gun. The bill didn’t pass.

Our ruling 
Cicilline campaign TV ad says Cicilline, as a state representative, voted for tougher anti-crime bills.

We verified that Cicilline supported the bills cited in the ad, though not all of them became law.

We find his statement True.

"['Economy', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine says Bill Clinton presided over ""biggest"" U.S. economic expansion since World War II
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen says he’s a better job creator than Tim Kaine, his Democrat opponent.

At just about every appearance, Allen accurately says that Virginia gained 300,000 jobs when he was governor from 1994 to 1998 and lost 100,000 when Kaine led the state from 2006 to 2010.

Kaine addressed that argument during an Oct. 18 debate, noting that he governed during a deep national recession. He told Allen, ""You were governor during the Clinton boom years, the biggest expansion of the American economy since World War II.""

Was there really record economic growth under Bill Clinton’s presidency from 1993 to 2001? We took a look.

Kaine’s campaign cited two sources to back the claim: a Forbes magazine ranking from 2004 and an historic chart of the nation’s annual gross domestic product -- the market value of all goods and services produced -- from 1945 to 2000.

Forbes created a scale to measure ""prosperity"" under the 10 presidents from Harry Truman through Clinton. It ranked them on six measures of economic performance: GDP growth, real disposable personal income, employment, unemployment, inflation and deficit reduction.

Clinton topped the overall ranking, averaging 3.2.

Lyndon B. Johnson came in second, averaging 3.7. He was followed, in order, by John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Truman, Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush, who ranked an average of 8.5.

Forbes’ prosperity scale certainly points to good economic years under Clinton. But economic growth, as defined by the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Modern Economics, is measured by changes in GDP.

So let’s look at the GDP chart Kaine’s campaign sent, which was adjusted for inflation by using 2005 real dollars. It showed GDP during Clinton’s terms grew from $8.5 trillion in 1993 to $11.2 trillion in 2000. The $2.7 trillion increase was by far the largest under any postwar president.

Here’s the ranking of postwar presidents based on GDP growth during their terms that is adjusted to 2005 dollars. We should note that the figures for Barack Obama are from 2009-2011 because annual GDP totals for 2012 are not available.

1. Clinton, 1993-2001, $2.7 trillion.
2. George W. Bush, 2001-2009, $1.7 trillion.
3. Reagan, 1981-1989, $1.6 trillion.
4. Johnson, 1963-1969, $741 billion.
5. Nixon, 1969-1974, $628 billion.
6. Eisenhower, 1953-1961, $484 billion.
7. Carter, 1977-1981, $461 billion.
8. George H.W. Bush, 1989-1993, $401 billion.
9. Obama, 2009-2012, $325 billion.
10. Kennedy, 1961-1963, $310 billion.
11. Ford, 1974-1977, $261 billion.
12. Truman, 1945-1943, $231 billion.   

But there are a few quirks to this method of cumulative comparison. With the exception of Truman -- who presided during a major reshuffling of the economy at the end of World War II -- the presidents at the top of the GDP list served two terms and those at the bottom served one term or less.

And among the two-term presidents, the comparison favors those who served 35 years or more after the war -- Clinton, George W. Bush and and Reagan -- over those who served in its near aftermath -- Truman and Eisenhower. That’s because the GDP, even when adjusted for inflation, has steadily grown and today is more than five times greater than it was at the end of World War II.

So, what’s the best way to compare economic expansion under presidents? Economists told us it’s best to measure the average annual rate of real GDP growth in constant dollars.

Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, ran the calculations for us, starting with the year each president entered office and ending with the year he left.

Here’s the ranking of postwar presidents by the annual rate of real GDP growth in inflation-adjusted dollars during their terms.

1. Johnson, 5.2 percent.
2. Kennedy, 4.2 percent.
3. Clinton, 3.9 percent.
4. Reagan, 3.4 percent
5. Carter, 3.2 percent.
6. Eisenhower, 2.9 percent.
7. Nixon, 2.8 percent.
8. Ford, 2.5 percent.
9. George H.W. Bush, 2.1 percent.
10. George W. Bush, 2 percent.
11. Truman, 1.2 percent.
12. Obama, 0.3 percent.

Our ruling

Kaine said that Clinton presided over ""the biggest expansion of the American economy since World War II.""

He backs his statement by offering a 2004 ""prosperity"" rating created by Forbes magazine that put Clinton at the top of postwar presidents. Kaine also cites the gross GDP growth, adjusted for inflation, over the administration of each president since 1945 -- a measure that favors recent two-term presidents.

A different picture emerges when we use a comparison measure preferred by economists that measures annual average growth in the GDP. Among postwar presidents, LBJ was tops in economic expansion, followed by Kennedy. Clinton was third.

There’s no doubt Clinton presided during a strong economic expansion, but not all indicators point to it being a postwar record. We rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Federal Budget', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Bill Nelson says Connie Mack kept changing his mind about Paul Ryan plan
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fort Myers, has had a tough time deciding how he felt about the Republican budget plan, says Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.

During a Senate debate on Oct. 17, Nelson attacked Mack for missing votes, specifically this year’s vote on a budget plan put forward by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that seeks to dramatically reduce future government spending.

""Now one of the votes you missed was the Paul Ryan plan,"" Nelson said during the debate. ""That was the second Paul Ryan plan. You were asked would you support it, since you missed it. You said yes. And then in a later interview, you said it was stupid and you would vote no. And then your folks corrected you, and you changed your position again, yes.""

We wanted to check to see if Nelson accurately summarized Mack’s changing responses to the Ryan plan after missing the vote on March 29, 2012. Ryan is now the Republicans' nominee for vice president.

Nelson’s campaign sent us a couple of news clips about Mack’s comments, and we found several other examples of Mack’s statements in news reports in Nexis and speeches on YouTube.

Background on Ryan’s plan

Ryan’s plan would bring about a major restructuring of several areas of government, include Medicare and Medicaid, in order to reduce future spending. It would also overhaul the tax code by setting two tax brackets. (Read more details in our previous fact-check.) Ryan is chairman of the House Budget Committee. In August, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney selected Ryan to be his running mate.

We will briefly note that in 2011, Mack voted on an earlier version of Ryan’s plan, and he voted yes.

Back then, Mack praised Ryan’s budget proposal and called it a ""good first step.""

""The Ryan proposal also lays out a blueprint to save Medicare, save Social Security, reform the job-stifling tax code, repair the welfare safety net, cut wasteful spending, and get the debt under control over the coming decades, but needs to go further to bring our national debt to a zero balance more quickly,"" Mack stated in an April 5, 2011, press release.

The 2012 Ryan plan

Now we fast-forward to 2012 -- Mack was busy campaigning in the GOP Senate primary, and the House was preparing to vote on a new version of Ryan’s plan.

On March 22, The Hill, a Washington-based newspaper that covers Congress, mentioned Mack’s name among those planning to vote in favor. 
But on March 29, Mack missed the vote. Mack spokesman David James told the Tampa Bay Times that Mack supported the Ryan budget but had other obligations.

On the same day he missed the vote, Mack spoke via Skype to a West Orlando tea party group and said his own Penny Plan would balance the budget faster than Ryan’s plan. But Mack didn’t say how he would have voted on the Ryan proposal.

""The Ryan budget, that doesn’t balance for 20 to 24 years. We can’t afford to wait that long. We have to be serious about you know balancing this budget. We can’t continue to raise the debt ceiling. ..."" Mack said, according to video posted by the American Bridge 21st Century Democratic PAC, a group that supports Nelson.

Mack calls the plan a ""joke"" but campaign says he would have voted for it

On April 4, the Miami Herald reported that Mack called the plan a ""joke"" during a March 31 Orlando tea party forum.

But a Mack spokesman said later that Mack didn’t mean to criticize the plan itself and would have voted for it.

""The vote was the 'joke,' as in the process being a joke, not the Ryan plan itself. And Connie said the vote was a joke,"" James said in an email to the Miami Herald at the time. ""He supports the Ryan plan but the process is a joke when the GOP House continues to do the right things and the liberal Senate under (Majority Leader Harry) Reid and (Florida Sen. Bill) Nelson continue to kill fiscally responsible measures.""

But the Herald wrote that Mack clearly criticized the plan itself.

""I was here in Florida campaigning,"" Mack said during the tea party forum, according to the conservative Florida Political Press. ""You know that budget was a joke, doesn’t balance the budget for years.""

POLITICO wrote on April 17 about Mack’s missed votes; their article stated that a Mack spokesman refused to say how Mack would have voted on the Ryan plan but said it ""has some brave proposals.""

Mack said he probably would have voted against it

On April 23, this fact-checker who also writes for the Naked Politics blog went to listen to Mack speak to the Broward Republican Executive Committee in Fort Lauderdale.

""Congressman Ryan had a plan,"" Mack said. ""There are a lot of good things in Congressman Ryan’s plan. The changes and reforms in the entitlement programs are necessary and way overdue. The only problem I have is that the budget still doesn't balance for 28 years. ... We can do better. We must do better.""

Mack called for combining Ryan’s ideas with his own Penny Plan to balance the budget faster.

In interviews with reporters after his speech, Mack said if he had been present for the vote he probably would have voted against Ryan's plan because of how long it takes to balance the budget.

On April 24, Mack was asked about the Ryan plan on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown.

""There are a lot of reforms that I think make sense,"" he said. ""But the fact that it won't balance for 28 years is bothersome to me.""

A May 13 Washington Post article quoted Mack as saying about the Ryan plan: ""I go back and forth. I probably would have voted no. There are a lot of reforms that I like. But I have a problem with the idea that this budget is not going to balance for 28 years.""

After Mack won the Republican Senate primary in August, the Daily Caller wrote that Mack told reporters: ""I haven’t always supported Paul Ryan’s budget. Frankly I think that we need to balance the budget a lot quicker than 28 years.""

But Mack said that he appreciated Ryan’s effort:

""The Democrats have no plans. They want to stick their heads in the sand when it comes to Medicare,"" he said, adding that Democrats ""want to simply lie to the people of Florida"" by saying that Republicans want to ""change Medicare as we know it.""

On Aug. 28, Chuck Todd on The Daily Rundown asked Mack about his comments about the Ryan budget and how he would have voted. ""What I said is that I would have, if I was there, I would have voted against it."" Todd asked why, and Mack replied: ""I think a lot of the reforms Ryan has put out are good reforms. But we need to balance our budget. And we need to do it not in 28 years but under 10 years. We can do it ... ""

Nelson said Mack called the Ryan plan ""stupid,"" but we didn’t find any example of Mack calling the plan ""stupid.""

Let’s recap Mack’s comments about the Ryan plan starting just before the missed March 29, 2012 vote:

March 22: The Hill lists Mack as planning to vote in favor of the Ryan plan.

March 29: Mack missed the vote but his spokesman said he would have voted for it. Mack criticizes the plan while speaking to a tea party group.

March 31: Mack called the Ryan plan a ""joke.""

April 4 Miami Herald article: Mack’s campaign said Mack meant the process was a joke and would have voted for it.

April 23: Mack said he probably would have voted against it.

May: Mack is quoted in the Washington Post saying, ""I go back and forth. I probably would have voted no.""

Aug. 28: Mack said on The Daily Rundown ""I would have voted against it.""

We asked the Mack campaign if his comments in August reflected his current position and if Mack disagreed with Nelson’s claim and did not get a response to that question.

Our ruling

Nelson said of the second Ryan plan, ""You were asked would you support it, since you missed it. You said yes. And then in a later interview, you said it was stupid and you would vote no. And then your folks corrected you, and you changed your position again, yes.""

If we start the timeline of Mack’s statements after he missed the vote March 29, we found Mack’s campaign said he would have voted yes, then he said it was a ""joke"", then his campaign said he meant the process was a joke and he would have voted yes. Then we find from late April through August Mack said a few times that he probably would have voted against it.

But there was some consistency in Mack’s message: He criticized the Ryan plan for taking too long to balance the budget and promoted his faster-acting Penny Plan instead. Nelson omitted this part of Mack’s message.

We didn’t find any time that Mack called the Ryan plan ""stupid,"" but he did call it a ""joke,"" which is similar.

We also found that Mack landed on the conclusion that he would have voted no, while Nelson’s claim ends with Mack deciding that he would have voted yes.

Nelson is right that Mack kept changing his message about how he would have voted. But he omitted that Mack was consistent in arguing that the Ryan plan moves too slowly to balance the budget.
