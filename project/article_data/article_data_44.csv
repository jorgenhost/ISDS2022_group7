Fact-checking disinformation about Louisville, a U-Haul and George Soros
","In the video, protesters wearing backpacks rush to the back of a U-Haul truck. They reach in and grab pre-made canvas signs bearing slogans like ""abolish the police"" and ""abolition now."" ""They got shields!"" someone yells. The clip is one of several that circulated on social media following the Sept. 23 news that two Louisville, Ky., police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor would not face charges in connection with her death. Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot six times in her home as police tried to issue a warrant in March. Protesters took to the streets almost immediately after the grand jury announced its decision not to charge the officers with Taylor’s death.  Two officers were shot and wounded in the ensuing violent demonstrations, and 127 people were arrested. Which leads us back to the video, which was filmed Sept. 23 near downtown Louisville.  Some onlookers claimed the clip showed activists linked to a billionaire philanthropist. ""The #ANTIFA UHAUL seen distributing shields, weapons & black bloc is registered to Holly Zoller of the Louisville KY Bail Project which is a George Soros funded initiative,"" a Sept. 23 Facebook post says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screenshot from Facebook) Similar versions of the post have been shared thousands of times, and ""U-Haul"" trended on Twitter the morning of Sept. 24. Fox News hosts amplified the claim on Twitter, TV and online, as did conservative outlets like the Gateway Pundit and National File. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy cited the footage in an interview with Fox News, during which he claimed protests against police brutality are ""planned, orchestrated events."" We wanted to take a closer look at the footage. Several videos of the same event show protesters taking signs from the back of a U-Haul, some of which bear a symbol associated with antifa, a broad coalition of left-wing activists. Zoller, who rented the truck, has done anti-fascist organizing in the past. But there is no evidence that the truck distributed weapons, or that the truck was connected to Soros. The truck depicted in the viral social media video distributed protest supplies like shields, signs and face masks. Some of the signs bore logos associated with antifa. There is no evidence that the truck contained weapons. Storyful, a social media intelligence agency, analyzed the video and reported Sept. 23 that it shows protesters unloading shields from a storage truck. That analysis is consistent with reports from journalists on the ground in Louisville. ""A parked U-Haul was waiting for the crowd up the street,"" tweeted Shelby Talcott, a reporter for the Daily Caller, from Louisville on Sept. 23. ""It contains supplies such as signs, shields, water etc. I’m not sure how people knew what it contained."" In the footage, one sign taken from the U-Haul shows three arrows pointing down. That’s the symbol of the Iron Front, a German paramilitary organization that formed in the 1930s to oppose extremists on the left and the right, such as the Nazi Party and the Communist Party of Germany. Interestingly, the Communist Party of Germany is the source of the term ""antifa."" It adopted the phrase ""Antifaschistische Aktion"" — ""anti-fascist action,"" in English — in 1932 as the Nazis were gaining power. So, historically speaking, the Iron Front would have opposed anti-fascist groups and vice versa. But today, American antifa activists have been known to brandish shields, flags and other paraphernalia emblazoned with the Iron Front symbol at protests across the country. Another angle of the protest in Louisville shows the banner head-on, alongside another sign bearing the anarchy symbol. Does that mean the U-Haul was driven by antifa organizers, or that it handed out weapons? Not necessarily. ""I haven’t seen any evidence for that specifically,"" said Brendan Gutenschwager, who shot the footage analyzed by Storyful, when asked about the claims in the Facebook post. ""Mostly just the wooden boards and signs handed out of there, some masks as well."" RELATED: What is antifa, and why is it all over my timeline? Since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May, we’ve fact-checked several claims about alleged antifa involvement in protests against police brutality. Time and again, we have found no evidence to support the notion that a loose coalition of activists is orchestrating violence.  ""We look at antifa as more of an ideology or a movement than an organization,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said during a House committee hearing Sept. 17. We reached out to the Louisville Metro Police Department and the FBI’s Louisville field office for more information. LMPD didn’t get back to us and the FBI declined to comment. For years, Soros has been falsely accused of funding and directing protests. This time is no different. The Facebook post cites ""research by @inteldotwav,"" a 15-month-old Twitter account that posts about ""protests, riots, and chaos."" It tweeted Sept. 23 that the U-Haul was rented by someone named Holly Zoller. Zoller is a bail disruptor for the Bail Project’s branch in Louisville whose bio says she ""has organized around anti-fascist movements"" in the past. The Bail Project is a national nonprofit organization that pays people’s bail ""to prevent incarceration and combat racial and economic disparities in the bail system."" Several social media posts and the National File story pointed to the fact that some of the Bail Project’s employees were previously Soros Justice Fellows as evidence that the organization is tied to the billionaire philanthropist.  We asked Storyful whether it had seen any evidence that Soros, whose Open Society Foundations fund many liberal advocacy groups — including those that are part of the Black Lives Matter movement — are connected to the U-Haul. It hadn’t.  The connection between Zoller and the U-Haul may have started on 4chan, where a user claimed to be able to look up rental information in the company's records. Similar claims spread on Twitter and Discord.  RELATED: No, George Soros is not a Nazi who funds antifa 4chan and Discord are fringe internet platforms where anonymous users are known to create and spread false information. One user, @inteldotwav, claimed to have evidence in the form of  a phone call that a group on Discord purportedly had with Zoller, during which she said she drove the U-Haul truck and dropped off supplies at the protest. We could not confirm the date of that call, nor whether the person on it was actually Zoller. But the Bail Project confirmed that Zoller rented the U-Haul truck depicted in the footage. ""Holly rented the truck in her personal capacity, during her time off, and did not use funds from The Bail Project,"" said Camilo Ramirez, director of communications for the Bail Project. ""I watched the video and saw painted signs and water, but of course some people are exploiting the clip to create misinformation and attack our organization."" Open Society Foundations does not fund the Bail Project. The nonprofit’s most recent tax filing shows that it received nearly $25 million in contributions and grants during the fiscal year ending June 2018. None of that money came from the Open Society Foundations, according to the philanthropy’s most recent tax filing and a list of its awarded grants. ""The Open Society Foundations supports the First Amendment right of every American to petition their government for redress of grievances through peaceful protest,"" said Laura Silber, the philanthropy’s chief communications officer. ""We abhor violence of any kind. We do not now nor have we ever funded ‘antifa.’"" A Facebook post says an antifa-operated U-Haul truck distributed ""shields, weapons & black bloc"" to protesters in Louisville and is linked to ""a George Soros-funded initiative."" A video shows protesters taking shields, signs and other supplies from the back of a U-Haul truck. Some of the signs bear a symbol associated with antifa activists. An eyewitness said he didn’t see any evidence that the truck contained weapons The claim that the U-Haul truck is linked to an organization funded by Soros appears to have originated on forums known for spreading online disinformation. There is no connection between the billionaire philanthropist and the truck. The post contains an element of truth but stretches the facts to make an unproven connection to Soros. We rate it Mostly False. UPDATE (Sept. 25, 2020): This fact-check has been updated to include a statement from the Bail Project and more information about Zoller.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097911680>],/factchecks/2020/sep/24/facebook-posts/fact-checking-disinformation-about-louisville-u-ha/

Trump ad distorts Biden’s record on Social Security and Medicare, policy for immigrants
","An ad seeking to sway Florida voters to President Donald Trump’s side claims that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has long attempted to take away benefits from Americans and now wants to give them to immigrants illegally in the country. The ad’s claims are inaccurate and misleading. ""Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades. ... Now, Biden is promising your benefits to illegal immigrants,"" says the narrator in the ad posted by Trump for Florida, an official Facebook page for Trump's reelection campaign. Here’s an overview of the inaccurate elements in the 30-second video posted Sept. 16. This is not a complete reflection of Biden’s record, which has changed over time. Starting in the 1970s, Biden called for an increase in monthly benefits, then for a one-year freeze, then floated raising the retirement age, then backed a change in how benefits would increase, and now calls for higher monthly checks for the oldest beneficiaries. In the 1980s and 1990s, Biden spoke in favor of freezes to Social Security as part of an effort to rein in all spending to reduce the deficit.  In a 1995 speech, Biden said: ""When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.""  The Trump ad features a clip of that 1995 speech, but it cut out the part where Biden said he meant freezing ""every single solitary thing in the government.""  Biden’s campaign told PolitiFact that throughout his career in Congress, Biden cast nearly 50 votes to increase Social Security benefits or block Republican plans to curtail benefits. As vice president during the Obama administration, Biden generally focused on protecting Social Security, and resisted moves to privatize Social Security. However, the administration in 2014, proposed changing how Social Security cost-of-living increases were calculated. The method, which the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found would have reduced benefits by 1% to 2% over the course of the average retirement, received push-back and was later dropped. Biden as a presidential candidate says action is ""urgently"" needed ""to make the program solvent and prevent cuts to American retirees."" The Trump ad cites as evidence for its claim a Jan. 13 article from The Intercept, headlined, ""Fact Check: Joe Biden Has Advocated Cutting Social Security for 40 Years."" The story said that Biden’s 2020 position to increase Social Security benefits is ""at odds with decades of his own advocacy."" It cited his stance in the 1980s and 1990s among evidence of his interest in practicing fiscal restraint. During the Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., similarly claimed that Biden ""has advocated cutting Social Security for 40 years."" Based on Biden’s nuanced record, we rated that Mostly False. This is not Biden’s promise. There is no evidence Biden seeks to deprive Americans of their Social Security and Medicare benefits and give them to immigrants who are violating immigration laws. Biden’s plans related to health care and seniors do not call for the elimination of Social Security benefits or Medicare for Americans. And Biden has not put forward a policy to entitle immigrants illegally in the country to Social Security benefits, or to give them access to Medicare, his campaign said. Biden favors allowing immigrants illegally in the country to buy health care plans under the Affordable Care Act marketplace, but without financial help from the government. This would not invalidate U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents’ ability to also buy health care plans in the exchange. The Trump ad cited May 10, 2019, Fox News reporting. That day, Fox News said Biden supported health care for immigrants illegally in the country. The story said that in response to a question on whether immigrants illegally in the country should ""should be entitled to federal benefits"" like Medicare or Medicaid, Biden said: ""Look, I think that anyone who is in a situation where they are in need of health care, regardless of whether they are documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they are cared for."" Video of that response doesn’t show Biden explicitly mentioning Medicare or Medicaid. Trump in July falsely claimed that under Biden’s policy, immigrants in the country illegally ""get welfare benefits. United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants."" Trump’s campaign did not respond to our queries, and neither did the White House. But a Trump campaign official told the Washington Post’s Fact Checker that Biden supported Obama-era programs that defer deportation for immigrants and make them eligible for Social Security. As the Washington Post pointed out, people receive Social Security benefits if they pay into the system, and immigrants wouldn’t be taking away ""your benefits,"" as the ad implied. A Trump campaign ad claimed, ""Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades. ... Now Biden’s promising your benefits to illegal immigrants."" It’s misleading to say that Biden for decades tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. His overall record is mixed. The ad also gives the wrong impression that Biden is trying to take benefits away from Americans and grant them to immigrants illegally in the country. That’s not Biden’s plan. Biden wants to allow immigrants illegally in the country to buy health insurance, without subsidies. That would not take away Ameicans ability to buy their own insurance.

Attack ad exaggerates Christy Smith votes to lay off teachers, raise her own pay
","A TV ad attacking California congressional candidate Christy Smith portrays the former school board member as being anti-teacher. ""When California faced a budget crisis,"" it says over menacing music, ""Smith voted to lay off teachers and then voted to increase her pay."" The ad is referring to votes that Smith cast more than six years ago during her nine-year tenure as a local school board member. However, the ad lacks context and tells only part of the story. Her votes ultimately led to the layoff of only one permanent teacher. Smith did vote once to raise the $250 monthly stipend of school board members by 5%. The ad is from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that works to elect Republicans to the House. Smith, a California assemblywoman elected in 2018, is running against Republican Rep. Mike Garcia on Nov. 3 for the 25th District congressional seat, north of Los Angeles.  Garcia, a former military pilot, defeated Smith in a special election for the seat in May. That election was held to replace Democrat Katie Hill after she resigned. The race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It is rated a tossup by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The ad alludes to May 2012, when California’s governor announced that the state budget deficit was $16 billion, much wider than the $9 billion that had been estimated four months earlier. State officials were preparing to make further budget cuts to schools and other programs. The ad cites three votes Smith took on the Newhall School Board, on which she served from 2009 until her election to the Assembly in 2018. Asked for evidence of the ad’s claims, the Congressional Leadership Fund provided PolitiFact with what appear to be screenshots of portions of the minutes from three Newhall School Board meetings. PolitiFact obtained the full minutes for those votes and related votes. May 2012: The board voted 5-0 to lay off 17 temporary elementary school teachers and two permanent physical education teachers. Within two months, the board took two more votes — both 5-0 with Smith in favor — resulting in all of the temporary teachers being rehired and one of the physical education teachers being brought back full time and the other part time. So, the total loss was one-half of a physical education teacher position. March 2013: The board voted 5-0 to notify 26 temporary teachers of possible layoffs; and voted 3-1-1, with Smith abstaining, to lay off one permanent music teacher. The minutes don't state why Smith abstained, but they say current and former students and parents expressed concern about the effect on the music program of losing the position. Sixteen temps were rehired three months later, with Smith joining in a 5-0 vote for the rehiring. Marc Winger, who was the Newhall superintendent at the time and is now Smith’s campaign treasurer, said California law requires school districts to issue notifications of possible layoffs and that such notifications, which can be rescinded without layoffs being done, are common when districts’ finances are uncertain early in the year. The Newhall district sent possible layoff notices to temps even though their contracts were only for one school year, ending June 30, he said. When Smith served, the only compensation Newhall school board members received was a monthly stipend, though they could also opt to purchase health insurance through the school district, Winger said. On Dec. 9, 2014, the board voted 5-0 to approve ""an allowable 5% increase to their current monthly stipend,"" the minutes said. No other details were given. Winger said the stipend before the vote was $250. The vote raised the stipend by $12.50 per month.  In response to a similar attack from the National Republican Congressional Committee, Smith’s campaign put out a statement in April from the president of the California Federation of Teachers that says the union is supporting her campaign. The campaign also cited awards Smith received from the California Teachers Association union in January. The Congressional Leadership Fund said: ""When California faced a budget crisis,"" Smith ""voted to lay off teachers and then voted to increase her pay."" Smith voted in 2012 to lay off 17 temporary elementary school teachers and two permanent physical education teachers. Within two months, however, she also voted in favor of rehiring all of the temporary teachers, and one of the physical education teachers. The second physical education teacher was brought back part time. A vote she took in 2013 was to notify temporary teachers of possible layoffs. Smith did vote in 2014 for a $12.50 increase in a monthly stipend for board members, their only compensation. The statement about Smith’s votes on teacher layoffs ignores the fact that Smith also voted to rehire all the teachers, ultimately only losing a half of a position. And the claim about Smith’s vote on pay leaves out the fact that the increase amounted to $12.50 per month, important clarifying information. Overall, the claim this ad makes is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Mostly False.

Harris highlights racial disparity in distribution of PPP loans but misstates Michigan stats
","While campaigning in Flint, Mich., and Detroit, Sen. Kamala Harris emphasized the importance of ensuring a high turnout among Black voters to help elect Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. During a Sept. 22 interview with the TV station WDIV, Harris, Biden's running mate, discussed the racial disparities revealed by the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing economic recession, which has hit Black-owned businesses particularly hard. ""I looked at the numbers in terms of the restaurants that received the benefit of the PPP in Michigan, and only one Black restaurant received it of the hundreds of others that received it,"" Harris claimed. ""You cannot deny fact, and where there are disparities, they need to be addressed,"" she said. Researchers say Black-owned businesses have been hit hard during the current recession and have confronted barriers to accessing aid under the Paycheck Protection Program, a federal coronavirus relief program that offers low-interest loans to businesses to help cover payroll and expenses like rent or mortgage payments. But Harris’ claim on the numbers is incorrect. It’s based on outdated and incomplete data. More current data shows at least 29 Black-owned restaurants in Michigan have received PPP loans. The campaign shared a Jul. 16 article published by the Detroit Free Press to back Sen. Harris’ claim. It reported that of the 785 Michigan restaurants that had received a PPP loan greater than $150,000, only one was listed as Black-owned. That was according to an analysis of PPP loan data from the Small Business Administration.  The article did not include the number of Black-owned restaurants in Michigan that received a loan under $150,000, and it noted that many PPP recipients did not report racial demographic information. The latest data show that the number of Black-owned restaurants receiving PPP loans of any size has increased since this analysis was conducted, though it still lags behind the number for white-owned restaurants. Updated data show that of the 6,778 Michigan restaurants that received a PPP loan as of Aug. 8, only 1,265, or about 19% reported racial demographic information. Of those, there were three Black-owned restaurants that received loans greater than $150,000, compared with 223 white-owned restaurants; and 26 Black-owned restaurants got loans under $150,000, compared with 804 white-owned restaurants. So among Michigan restaurants that received a PPP loan and reported racial information, about 2% were Black-owned and about 81% were white-owned. The vast majority of recipients did not report racial demographic information. That alone makes it impossible to say definitively, as Harris did, how many Black-owned restaurants have benefited from the program. Black-owned businesses have been hit hard by the coronavirus-induced economic recession, and they have faced barriers in accessing PPP loans. Among all types of businesses, those with Black owners have been twice as likely to close during the pandemic, according to a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ""These firms had weaker financial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and preexisting funding gaps prior to the pandemic,"" said Claire Kramer Mills, assistant vice president at the New York Fed. ""COVID-19 has exacerbated these issues, and businesses in the hardest-hit communities have witnessed huge disparities in access to federal relief funds and a higher rate of business closures."" While the study found businesses located in counties most impacted by Black business closures received PPP loans at a similar rate as businesses nationally, there was significant variation among the counties. In Wayne County, Mich., for instance, only 11.6% of firms received PPP loans, compared with 17.7% of businesses nationally. Researchers have identified other racial disparities in access to PPP loans. Research from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an association of community-based organizations championing fairness in banking, found evidence of lending discrimination based on the race of the applicant for a PPP loan. Small businesses in majority-white neighborhoods received PPP loans more quickly than in majority-Black neighborhoods, according to a report from the nonpartisan think tank Brookings that looks at the most recent loan data. Black-owned firms tend to lack strong relationships with banks, especially traditional banks that were initially relied upon to deliver PPP loans, and entered the current recession in a weaker financial position, which helps explain the high rate of closures among Black-owned businesses and barriers to support. ""Senator Harris is making the important point that during COVID-19, Black communities and small businesses have been disproportionately impacted,"" Ben Halle, Michigan communications director for the Biden-Harris campaign, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan.  Harris claimed that only one Black-owned restaurant in Michigan received a PPP loan. Her claim was based on old data and referred only to restaurant owners who reported racial demographic information and received loans greater than $150,000. According to the most recent SBA data, at least 29 self-identified Black-owned restaurants in Michigan have received a PPP loan, far fewer than the number of white-owned restaurants. And there’s other evidence of racial disparities in access to PPP loans nationwide. But the vast majority of loan applicants in Michigan did not provide racial data, making it impossible to determine how many Black-owned restaurants in the state benefited from the program. Harris’ claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"['Education', 'Michigan', 'Senate Majority PAC']","
James backs DeVos and school choice, but does he want to divert funding from public schools?
","A Facebook ad from the Senate Majority PAC — which helps elect Democratic candidates to the Senate — attacks Michigan Republican Senate candidate John James, claiming that he ""backed Betsy DeVos' agenda to take money away from public schools and give it to wealthy private schools instead."" DeVos has long been a proponent in Michigan of reducing federal involvement in education and promoting school choice. And as education secretary in the Trump administration, she has championed lower Education Department budgets and proposed increasing federal funding to support private school enrollment. Members of the DeVos family have contributed $800,000 to a Super PAC trying to unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Gary Peters. James, a Detroit-area businessman, has noted his support for DeVos and for school choice. But he hasn’t outlined a particular approach. Those who advocate for helping parents access alternatives to traditional public schools offer an array of proposals, from supporting charter schools, to government-funded vouchers to cover private school tuition costs, to tax credits that fund scholarships to help students attend private schools. While the ad suggests James backs the DeVos agenda, James has not specifically said whether he approves of her efforts to significantly cut funding for public education and increase federal support for private schools. He has not held elective office, or taken any public votes that would clarify his position. His campaign speeches and website lay out few specific policy positions, a fact that his critics have pointed out. And his campaign declined PolitiFact Michigan’s request for any details about his education policies that would rebut the PAC’s claim. That said, the Senate Majority PAC did not provide any clear evidence to back its claim that James supported DeVos’s ""agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead."" The PAC said it’s reasonable to conclude that based on his comments, James is fully behind DeVos’ policies. ""James is very on the record about supporting her, and she’s very on the record about her positions,"" Matt Corridoni from Senate Majority PAC wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan. ""Not being in office doesn’t excuse him from not taking a specific position on the policy itself — he’s a candidate who has embraced a platform,"" Corridoni added. During his unsuccessful 2018 campaign to unseat Michigan’s Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, James highlighted the need for education reform to address underperforming schools in Michigan. Education is listed among the policy priorities featured on James’ current campaign website, on which he calls for supporting ""all education options—public, charter, and private."" While James supports school choice, he has not made clear whether his vision for education reform includes cutting funding for public schools and providing increased federal support for private schools. Analyses by the nonpartisan Committee for Education Funding finds that during DeVos’ tenure as Education Secretary, she has consistently proposed slashing funding for public education and deploying federal dollars to expand school choice, including increasing federal support for private schools. Private schools do not receive federal funding directly. Instead the Education Department provides funding for school districts that fund services to students at private schools. The Trump administration’s budget requests have proposed reducing the Education Department’s spending, but increasing federal support for private schools through appropriations, a tax credit to fund scholarships to attend private schools and voucher programs that could be used for private schools. During a 2018 House Appropriations subcommittee hearing, DeVos defended the cuts proposed in the administration’s budget that year. ""President Trump is committed to reducing the federal footprint in education, and that is reflected in this budget,"" she said. But the administration’s proposals have faced stiff pushback from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Congress has consistently rejected cuts to the Education Department budget, and none of the Trump administration’s requests for  more federal support for private schools have been enacted. Trump has signed the spending bills into law anyway. This past spring, DeVos directed school districts to share federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act with private schools. Analysis from the nonpartisan Learning Policy Institute found that the school districts would direct an additional $1.3 billion to private schools under the department’s guidance. A federal judge ruled Sept. 4 that the department did not have the authority to do this, and the rule is no longer in effect. ""She’s headed in the right direction,"" James said of DeVos during his 2018 campaign, according to audio from a May 2018 campaign fundraiser shared with PolitiFact Michigan by Senate Majority PAC. ""By doing things to get more power back to the states and to parents, I truly believe that if we give parents the resources and the opportunity to decide what’s best for their children, they will make the best decision 100% of the time,"" James said. A few months later, James reiterated his support for DeVos and alternatives to traditional public schools. ""I think that the job Betsy DeVos is doing in the Department of Education I think is very, very good,"" according to audio from a fundraiser shared by the Democratic PAC. James also said, ""I totally support charter schools,"" according to a transcript of the recording provided by the Senate Majority PAC. James’ 2018 comments followed DeVos’ effort to cut funding for the Education Department that year and increase federal support for private schools, including a proposal for a $1 billion grant to fund school choice initiatives, in part through  scholarships to private schools. And in 2017, the Trump administration proposed spending $250 million to provide families with vouchers to use at private schools. While James has noted his support for DeVos and school choice, the Democratic PAC did not provide evidence that James specifically supports cutting funding for public schools and diverting that money to help parents send their children to private schools instead. The Senate Majority PAC claimed in a Facebook ad that James ""supported Betsy DeVos’ agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead."" During her tenure as education secretary, DeVos has sought funding cuts to public schools while increasing federal funding to help more children enroll in private schools. James has made comments supportive of DeVos’ school choice efforts broadly, but his campaign declined to offer details on his education policy proposals, and he has no legislative voting record to indicate where he stands. It may seem like James is benefiting from the lack of information he and his campaign have provided on his education platform. Nonetheless, the PAC did not provide conclusive evidence for its claim that he favors directing federal funding away from public schools to supporting private schools.

Joe Biden jobs ad uses pandemic to tar Donald Trump
","In a short video shared on social media, the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump’s handling of the economy. The video tracks across a graph of how many jobs were created under each president since Harry Truman. Only Trump is shown with a negative number.  In tweeting the video, Biden said, ""Donald Trump claimed he would be 'the greatest jobs president God ever created.' But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history."" Donald Trump claimed he would be ""the greatest jobs president God ever created.""But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. pic.twitter.com/uW10KJhMsV   We found that the historical comparison is missing a lot of context. The employment numbers for each president in the ad closely track with data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The chart below is color-coded by the president’s political party.) We’ve begun with Truman because Biden’s ad starts there, and also because statistics for his Depression-era predecessor, Franklin Roosevelt, are only annual averages and aren’t as precise.   This measure — and the decline in jobs under Trump — leaves out critical context about how long the president served and what was happening in the economic background. Biden’s ad lumps together two-term presidents with those who served for a shorter period. One of the presidents who hasn’t served two terms at this point is Trump. In addition, the endpoint for Trump’s number is fixed during a once-a-century pandemic that has devastated employment. The pandemic has also led to a lot of volatility in the employment picture, as workers are called back or kept away from work depending on variations in the virus’ impact in particular geographic areas. It’s impossible to know what the jobs picture will look like when the election is held, or when a president is sworn in on Jan. 20. For this type of comparison, small changes in the parameters can produce big differences in outcomes. For example, if you looked at the first three years of each president’s tenure, Trump fares a lot better.    This comparison is closer to being apples to apples than what Biden offered, but it still isn’t comprehensive. Another way to look at the numbers is to compare the presidents at the worst economic point in their presidency. This is the month that the National Bureau of Economic Research determines is the ""trough"" of a recession. (As noted in the chart, some presidents didn’t face recessions, or saw the trough hit during their successor’s tenure.)   In the comparison above, Trump fared the worst of any president, but he has plenty of company in negative territory, with Dwight Eisenhower, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama all experiencing job losses. Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush barely came out in positive territory. The biggest reason for the unusually large losses on Trump’s watch, of course, is the historically swift and severe nature of the recession caused by the coronavirus. The Biden campaign argues that Trump bears some responsibility for the pandemic’s severity, and as a result, for the depth of the recession.  Due in part to Trump’s policies, the campaign said, the United States became the global leader in coronavirus cases in late March and continues to lead the world today, with a daily death count more than three times as high as the European continent. They cited a June analysis by Moody’s that half of those who were laid off due to the virus would not have lost their jobs if the administration’s response had been more effective. Still, if Biden had been president when the virus hit instead, it’s doubtful he could have avoided a major employment shock. Asked in an August interview with ABC News whether he would shutter economic activity if scientists said it was necessary, Biden said, ""I would shut it down."" Ultimately, linking the state of the economy to a president’s policies is often exaggerated. While a president’s enactment of tax cuts or budgetary investments can certainly have an effect on the economy, other factors — such as oil shocks, new technologies or international events — have a big impact as well. ""These outcomes are more driven by lucky or unlucky timing than actual policy,"" said Steve Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""This is the sort of cheap politics that is absolutely standard for campaigns,"" said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""The reality is that policy is far less responsible for the good or bad things that happen on a president's watch than is generally believed. Jimmy Carter didn't cause the Iranian revolution and the huge surge in oil prices that followed, but he sure took the blame for it."" Biden said that Trump is ""the worst jobs president in recorded history."" The raw numbers show that Trump, as of now, is the only president since at least Truman to see an overall decline in jobs on their watch.  However, this comparison is less than meets the eye. The economy’s performance under Trump has been hampered by a pandemic that caused an unusually swift and severe recession, and the virus is still spreading. No president in Biden’s comparison experienced an equivalent blow. Any president who served during the 2020 pandemic almost certainly would have experienced a major hit to employment just like Trump did. We rate the statement Half True.

Cunningham half right about Tillis role in prescription drug efforts
","If a coronavirus vaccine is approved by the end of the year, Cal Cunningham says he would have valid reasons for questioning its safety. For one, government officials have offered mixed messaging on when a vaccine might be ready. (President Trump has suggested November, while others have said that’s unlikely.) Then, there’s the influence of big healthcare companies on Washington politicians.  In Monday’s U.S. Senate debate on WRAL, Cunningham accused incumbent Republican Thom Tillis of being a friend of ""big pharma."" And he pointed to Tillis’ record on pharmaceuticals as an example of ""corruption in Washington."" ""We can almost look no further than Senator Tillis taking over $400,000 from big pharma, and then even blocking his own party’s efforts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs,"" Cunningham said. (It’s at 23:45 of this video) It’s true that Tillis has received more than $400,000 from individuals and political committees tied to the pharmaceutical and health product industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Is it true that Tillis has blocked ""his own party’s efforts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs?"" Tillis has opposed some bills that aimed to reduce prescription drug prices. (In some cases, he has offered alternatives) However, it’s a stretch to suggest Tillis is responsible for stopping those bills from succeeding.  The Cunningham campaign pointed to a pair of bills sponsored by Republicans, the most significant of which is the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019. The bill was introduced by U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. The Washington Post referred to the legislation as ""the most viable drug pricing bill in Congress."" It’s probably the ""most comprehensive (drug pricing) package"" of the last few years, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Program on Medicare Policy. The bill aimed to put an inflation-based cap on some drug prices or require rebates from drug makers. ""It was interesting to see (price caps) included in Grassley’s legislation, considering the Republican belief"" in the free market, she told PolitiFact in a phone interview. Grassley told CNBC in January that there’s ""no other bill that can get the 60 votes required"" to pass the Senate. Grassley said he had support from President Trump and some Democrats in the Senate. The problem, he said, were the Senate Republicans. Tillis told The Hill last October that he had ""concerns"" about it, adding he had not made a final decision on how he would vote if the bill came to the floor. In December, Politico reported that Senate leader Mitch McConnell warned colleagues that a vote could expose Republicans to attacks on the campaign trail. At the time, Politico reported that Tillis opposed the bill, saying the need to put caps on drug prices is being ""driven by a lot of populist pressure."" In December, Tillis and five other Republican senators introduced a competing bill known as the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. Of Tillis, Cubanski said ""I think it’s notable that he’s one of the co-sponsors of the alternative legislation, which does not include this inflation cap provision."" WBTV reported that, around the same time Tillis introduced his bill, he received more than $20,000 in campaign contributions from political action committees tied to pharmaceutical companies.  In February, the Washington Post reported that McConnell had not scheduled a vote on the bill because it would divide his Republican caucus. As of the Tillis-Cunningham debate, the bill had still not come up for a vote. Asked about Grassley’s bill this week, campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said Tillis supports his alternative bill, but ""has had several conversations with Senator Grassley about how to find common ground while striking the balance of lowering drug prices and protecting innovation.""  Tillis is a top recipient of campaign contributions from people and PACs affiliated with the pharmaceutical industry. A Kaiser Health News analysis found that Tillis received more than $156,000 from political action committees tied to drug manufacturers in 2019, more than any other member of Congress. The Cunningham campaign also cited the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2018, known as the CREATES Act. Initial Republican co-sponsors included Grassley, as well as Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Mike Lee of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine. The legislation aimed to end ""shenanigans"" that delay competition from generic and biosimilar drugs, according to the American Journal of Managed Care. Tillis initially opposed the CREATES Act, but his office says he supported it after it was amended and included in an appropriations bill. In 2019, Bloomberg reported that Tillis and Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, worked together against efforts to crack down on patent abuses.  RealClearHealth, a right-leaning news site, reported that Tillis and Coons have sought to change patent law in ways that would ""lead to increased prescription drug prices, reduced access to life saving treatments and medications and de-incentivize research and development."" Cunningham says Tillis has a record of ""blocking his own party’s efforts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs."" It’s fair to say that, in a few instances, Tillis has opposed his own party’s efforts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. That includes Grassley’s bill, which experts see as a significant effort. But Tillis has also offered alternatives. And there’s not a lot of definitive proof that Tillis, alone, has halted legislation that would have otherwise passed. Cunningham’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Photo of Feinstein, Murkowski from 2018, not 2020

""While Murkowski wants the nomination postponed until after the election, since the Trump announcement of a nominee will not be made until the weekend — after Ginsburg has been buried — there is no indication of how she would vote on a nominee. And, oh yes, the President himself has said his list is made up of five women. With this in mind, Feinstein cornered Murkowski — literally physically."" Back in 2018, Murkowski voted against Kavanaugh. And on Sept. 20 of this year, the day before this blog post was published, Murkowski announced that she would not support filling Ginsburg’s seat before the presidential election.  ""For weeks, I have stated that I would not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to the election,"" she said in a statement. ""Sadly, what was then a hypothetical is now a reality, but my position has not changed.""  The photo in this blog post is authentic, though we don’t know what, exactly, was happening as Feinstein and Murkowski huddled together in 2018.

Romney quote about Merrick Garland, Supreme Court vote is paraphrased
","As Senate Republicans prepare to vote on a Supreme Court nominee to fill the vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, social media posts are putting words in the mouth of one of the chamber’s more moderate members. In 2016, Republican senators blocked the appointment of Judge Merrick Garland, whom former President Barack Obama nominated that March, to the Supreme Court because it was too close to the election. Now flash forward to 2020. After Ginsburg died Sept. 18, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said President Donald Trump’s nominee — which he is expected to announce Sept. 26 — ""will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate."" A Sept. 22 Instagram post says Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, has weighed in on that decision. (Screenshot from Instagram) ""The Merrick Garland decision wasn’t unfair & the notion that someone has to pay the price to make up for it is wrong,"" says a quote attributed to Romney in the post. ""This further proves my point that a post-RBG race has NOTHING to do with whether or not voters LIKE @realdonaldtrump anymore,"" wrote Lynne Patton, a longtime Donald Trump associate who works in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in a caption. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) Romney was the only Republican who voted in favor of convicting Trump of abuse of power in a February impeachment vote and has been reported as a potential swing vote in the Senate. So we wanted to check whether he actually said the quote cited in the Instagram post. The post is a paraphrase of comments that Romney made Sept. 22 after releasing a statement saying he’s in favor of voting on a nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy before Election Day. Here’s what Romney said in an interview with reporters when asked about the decision to block Garland’s nomination in 2016: ""I wasn't there. I think there's some perception on the part of some writers and others that gee, what happened with Merrick Garland was unfair. I don't agree with that. I don't know whether you think it was a good decision or not but it wasn't unfair because it was consistent with history, it was consistent with precedent. It was consistent with the Constitution. So the idea that the Merrick Garland decision was unfair and therefore it has to be made up by doing something, which also wouldn't make a lot of sense — which is saying to President Trump, ‘You can't get your nominee either’ — that just doesn't follow for me.  ""The Garland decision was consistent with history. The decision to proceed with the new nominee is also consistent with history and precedent. And that's where I come out."" Romney did say the decision to block Garland’s appointment to the Supreme Court ""wasn’t unfair"" and that he doesn’t agree with the notion that Republicans should abstain from confirming a new justice before Nov. 3. But he did not say the quote attributed to him in the Instagram post. The post is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

No, Biden doesn’t want to dissolve the stock market

""Biden wants to end Shareholder Capitalism.. that's your 401k..your pensions.. your retirement.. are you voting for that???"" wrote one user.  This Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Posts like this misinterpret the way economists define shareholder capitalism, and they take Biden’s comments out of context to give a misleading impression.  In urging an end to the ""era of shareholder capitalism,"" the Democratic nominee was talking about a change in the prevailing view that corporations should primarily seek to benefit their shareholders. He was saying that corporations should stop prioritizing shareholder value without regard for the well-being of their employees and communities.  Here’s what Biden said in context:  ""It’s way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism — the idea [that] the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders. That’s simply not true. It’s an absolute farce. They have responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country. That isn’t [a] new or radical notion. These are basic values and principles that helped build this nation in the first instance. Now the challenge is to take these fundamental values, and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead… ."" As the context makes clear, Biden was taking a position in a long-running ethical debate about the way corporations should behave. He wasn’t calling for the end of shareholding altogether, as the Facebook post suggests.  The economic theory that Biden was critiquing — shareholder capitalism — holds that corporations are accountable primarily to their shareholders. Economist Milton Friedman, a noted proponent of shareholder capitalism, summed up the theory this way: ""There is one and only one social responsibility of business — to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits."" Defenders of Friedman’s theory argue that it ultimately benefits employees and the community, because corporations focused principally on shareholder value have a vested interest in maintaining a loyal workforce and avoiding negative publicity. Critics believe it has led to widespread economic inequality by disproportionately benefiting shareholders at the expense of others involved in the company. They also contend that it has produced a self-serving corporate mindset, providing ethical justification for tax evasion, low wages for workers and practices that degrade the environment.  Like many other critics of shareholder capitalism, Biden believes in ""stakeholder"" capitalism, a  view of business ethics that is emerging as the norm in Europe and was popular in the U.S. in the 1950s and 60s. The stakeholder theory of capitalism holds that corporations should operate in ways that benefit all people who hold a ""stake"" in the company: customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders and local communities. Rather than maximizing short-term profits for the sake of shareholders, the theory holds, companies should strive to give back to their stakeholders to guarantee their long-term health. Biden’s claim that corporations ""have a responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country"" is a clear elaboration of classic stakeholder theory. The same view has been embraced by some segments of the U.S. business community. It’s inaccurate to say that ending the predominance of shareholder capitalism would get rid of people’s 401(k)s, pensions and retirement savings.  A Facebook post claimed that Biden ""wants to end Shareholder Capitalism.. that's your 401k..your pensions.. your retirement.. are you voting for that???"" Biden said the era of shareholder capitalism should end. But the full context of his remarks shows he was calling for corporations to stop maximizing short-term profits for shareholders over the well-being of their communities.

Democratic Party chairman blasts Chris Christie as only governor since World War II to not have his party win control of a legislative body
","
The Democrats claim Gov. Chris Christie's coattails aren’t strong enough to sweep Republicans into power.

That’s a departure from more than 50 years of history in New Jersey, a period where the party of every governor has seized control of at least one arm of the Legislature, according to the chairman of the state Democratic Party.

Before voters went to the polls for Tuesday’s election, Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) released a memo on Monday, calling Christie ""ineffective"" for his inability to drum up enough support to send more Republicans to Trenton.

""Governor Christie also remains the only Governor since World War II, among both Democrats and Republicans, who failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body over the course of his term,"" Wisniewski said. ""The last Governor who failed to have his party control at least one legislative body during his term was Governor Charles Edison, a Democrat, who served from 1941 to 1944.""

The election is over and the reins of the Legislature remain firmly in Democratic hands, as they have been since the Republican governor was first elected in November 2009.

But is Christie the only governor whose party hasn’t taken control of at least one legislative house in more than five decades?

PolitiFact New Jersey found Wisniewski’s statement is misleading. The Democrat is comparing a governor only midway through his first term with governors who served up to eight years in office. 
Wisniewski argued that his statement is accurate, because it’s based on the facts as they exist today.

""I don’t understand why that would be an issue. That’s factually accurate,"" Wisniewski told us. ""The facts speak for themselves.""

It’s true that since Edison left office in 1944, the party of the governor-elect or the incumbent governor has either gained control of at least one legislative body or maintained control of both houses.

However, the party of two governors -- including Republican Gov. Tom Kean -- didn’t win control of any legislative body until the governor’s second term.

Kean took office in 1982, when Democrats controlled both legislative houses. The GOP would not gain control of a legislative body until Kean won re-election in 1985, and Republicans secured the majority in the Assembly.

Democratic Gov. Robert Meyner began his tenure in 1954 at a time when Republicans controlled the Legislature. The GOP would maintain control throughout his first term and, when he won re-election in 1957, the Democrats took control of the Assembly.

The cases of Kean and Meyner prove the same point:

From when they were first elected to near the end of their second year in office -- the same point where Christie now stands -- Kean’s and Meyner’s parties had not won control of a legislative body.

""The jury is still out on Chris Christie,"" said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute. ""It’s unfair to make that comparison yet since he’s not out of office.""

Republicans could still assume control of a legislative house during Christie’s tenure, but the new legislative map approved in April makes that scenario nearly impossible, Murray said.

""The map favors everybody who’s already in office,"" Murray said.

Brigid Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University, also said Wisniewski’s comparison is inaccurate. The best measure is comparing governors’ first mid-term elections, she said.

""You can’t assess Governor Christie’s tenure when his term hasn’t yet been completed,"" Harrison said.

There’s another problem with Wisniewski’s statement -- it ignores cases where a sitting governor’s party lost control of a legislative body.

One of the most glaring examples of that dynamic occurred under former Democratic Gov. Jim Florio. When Florio was elected in 1989, the Democrats assumed majorities in both legislative houses. Two years later, the Democrats lost 31 seats as Republicans took control of the Legislature.

Our ruling

Wisniewski said in a memo that Christie ""remains the only Governor since World War II, among both Democrats and Republicans, who failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body over the course of his term.""

But that comparison is not valid. Christie has been in office for less than two years and we found two other governors since World War II whose parties had not won control of a legislative body at the same point in their terms.

We rate the statement False.

Wife's assets in company not a conflict of interest in casino vote, Josh Mandel says
","
Now that Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel has submitted his personal financial disclosure statement to the U.S. Senate, where he hopes to serve if he can win the election next year, the scope of his holdings are in focus.

Nearly all of his household wealth is his wife’s, and her assets -- worth anywhere from $1.95 million to more than $7 million in 2010 -- are held in a family trust that she will not control until later in life, the Republican candidate says.

Reporters and political operatives were eager to see the extent of Ilana Shafran Mandel’s assets, and not merely because of an interest in wealth. There is also a political and journalistic reason for poring over financial disclosure reports: They reveal the trip wires over which politicians can stumble.

Which brings us to Forest City Enterprises, the real estate development, management and investment firm headquartered in Cleveland. The company started as a lumber business, founded by siblings who emigrated from Poland. Mandel’s wife is the granddaughter of one of them, the late Fannye Shafran, whose maiden name, Ratner, is well known in Northeast Ohio.

Forest City went public in 1960, and as recently as last year, Ilana Shafran Mandel owned Forest City stock worth anywhere from $315,003 to $650,000, according to her husband’s disclosure statement. Exact amounts are impossible to ascertain because Senate financial disclosure forms only report values in ranges.

This information about Forest City is important because of a statement made by Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino when the financial disclosure report was distributed to reporters on Nov. 4:

""First, Josh has no interest whatsoever in Forest City Enterprises. Second, Forest City Enterprises is not a ‘family company.’ … Third, Ilana’s investment in Forest City Enterprises constitutes significantly less than 1 percent of the total issued and outstanding shares.""

It’s that last part that PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at. Why would this matter? Well, remember what we said about potential trip wires?

Prior to his sending in his financial disclosure statement, there had been whispers about a trip wire concerning Mandel and Forest City. Mandel’s political opponents, including former GOP Senate contender Kevin Coughlin, suggested the answer might be in this disclosure filing.

This was specifically what Coughlin was alluding to when he said in September on ""Capitol Square,"" an Ohio News Network public affairs program, that ""there may be some issues about interest in the family business, which is involved in development, involved in casino development -- and he cast a vote last June on casinos in Ohio.""

The vote, when Mandel served in the Ohio legislature, was to approve a wide set of rules governing casinos in Ohio. One of those casinos, opening in 2012, will operate for at least the first five years in the Higbee Building in downtown Cleveland. The building is owned by Forest City, which is leasing it to Rock Ohio Caesars Cleveland LLC. It is next to Forest City’s Tower City office, hotel and retail center.

In addition, Forest City in February sold 16 acresof downtown Cleveland land to the casino developer. This land, too, is next to Tower City, and it is for the casino’s second phase.

Let’s check the score: As a state legislator, Mandel voted to approve casino rules after Ohio voters passed a constitutional amendment allowing casino gambling. One of those casinos, opening next year, is buying and leasing property from Forest City Enterprises. And Mandel’s wife, the granddaughter of a Forest City founder, owns stock in Forest City, or at least did in 2010, as the new financial disclosure report shows.

Is there a problem here? Mandel, through Aquilino, says no. But anticipating questions,
Aquilino included his statement when giving the disclosure report to reporters. (He gave it to the press before the Senate even received it.) He said the implication of a conflict of interest in Mandel’s casino vote ""is legally incorrect and absurd.""

That’s the second piece of Mandel’s claim that PolitiFact Ohio took a look at.

PolitiFact Ohio is not qualified to pass legal judgment. But we verified two important points made by Aquilino, on behalf of the treasurer.

First, Forest City, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, had a market capitalization as of Nov. 7, 2011, of $2.35 billion, according to YCharts and MarketWatch, which track data on publicly traded companies.Market capitalization is a measure of the company’s value. You get it by multiplying the share price by the number of outstanding shares.  We do not know how many Forest City shares Ilana Shafran Mandel owns, but we know the maximum value in 2010 was $650,000.

That means, based on Forest City’s market capitalization, her stake in Forest City amounted to less than 0.03 percent in 2010. We can get somewhat higher figures by looking at Forest City’s stock price at various periods in 2010, but they still don’t even amount to a rounding error.

This percentage is important because of an advisory opinionissued in 1999 by the Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee. The opinion said that Ohio’s conflict-of-interest statute ""does not prohibit a member of the General Assembly from voting on legislation which specifically grants money to a company in which the member owns less than 5 percent of the issued and outstanding stock of the company.""

If that’s not clear enough, the opinion also put it this way: ""It would appear from this statute that where a public official owns less than 5 percent of the issued and outstanding stock, that amount is not considered substantial enough to cause a conflict of interest and therefore prohibit the official from participating.""

Call us obstinate, but we’ve known a few lawyers, and what if this opinion applied to only a very narrow set of circumstances or a specific legislative vote? So we called the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee and spoke with Pete Russell, the general counsel.

Nope, Russell said. That 5 percent threshold is generally the rule for when a member should abstain..

That’s not to say Ilana Shafran Mandel doesn’t own a healthy amount of Forest City stock.  And it isn’t to say that Democrats won’t look at her roughly half-a-million-dollar stake in Forest City and ask whether her husband should have abstained from voting, strictly on principle. We’re willing to bet on that.

But the Mandel campaign is accurate in describing her share of Forest City ownership as minor. And it is correct in citing the 1999 advisory opinion that would appear to apply to Mandel’s legislative vote.

On the Truth-O-Meter, that makes Mandel’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE3340>],/factchecks/2011/nov/10/josh-mandel/wifes-assets-company-not-conflict-interest-casino-/

Rick Santorum says unemployment for college grads is 4 to 5 percent but for non-college-educated it's well into double digits
","
During a Republican presidential debate in Michigan on Nov. 9, 2011, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania drew a striking contrast between the unemployment rates for Americans with bachelor’s degrees and those without. 
""The unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits in America,"" he said. ""It's 4 percent or 5 percent for people who have college degrees."" 
To check this, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment statistics. (One technical note for economic geeks -- we’re using the 25-and-over age group for our data rather than the 16-and-over age group used to calculate the familiar national unemployment rate. That’s because BLS data doesn’t provide educational attainment breakdowns for age brackets below 25.) 
Let’s look at the rate for college graduates first, since it’s more readily accessible. 
In October 2011, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Americans 25 years and older who had at least a bachelor’s degree was 4.4 percent. That rate was not unusual: In the 32 months since March 2008, the unemployment rate for college-educated Americans has remained within a fairly narrow band, between 4.3 percent and 5.1 percent. 
So on that claim, Santorum’s on the mark. 
Judging the other part of his claim -- that ""the unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits"" -- is trickier, because it depends on your definition of ""non-college-educated."" We see at least two plausible definitions -- those who have only a high school degree and never attended college at all, and those who attended college but did not earn a degree. 
Of these two categories, the data for the first is easier to provide, since BLS offers that information directly. The seaonally adjusted unemployment rate for high school graduates without any college experience and who are 25 years and older was 9.6 percent in October. The highest that number climbed since the onset of the most recent recession was 11.2 percent, in October 2009. 
Shifting to those who graduated high school and attended college but did not graduate, the numbers have to be extrapolated. So we did that and found that for this group, the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in October 2011. 
In other words, not only are both measures virtually identical, but they are also not -- as Santorum said -- ""well into the double digits."" Nor, during the period we looked at, were they ever well into the double digits for Americans with a high school diploma. 
To find an unemployment rate for 25-and-overs that can be described as ""well into the double digits,"" you have to get an even less-well-educated pool -- those without a high school degree. For high school dropouts 25 and over, the unemployment rate was 13.8 percent in October 2011. 
Our ruling 
Santorum was correct when he said that the unemployment rate is 4 percent or 5 percent for college graduates; it’s currently 4.4 percent. But he overstated his case when he said that ""the unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits in America."" While relatively high by historical standards, the actual numbers today are not in the double digits, much less well into them. On balance, we rate Santorum’s statement Half True.  
UPDATE: After this item appeared, a number of readers asked us to clarify the unemployment rates for people at various educational achievement levels, so we'll provide more detail here. If you take all people except those with a bachelor's degree  -- that is, the sum of high school dropouts, those with only a high school diploma, those with some college but no bachelor's degree, and those with an associate's degree -- the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent. Alternately, if you take people without any college experience -- that is, the sum of high school dropouts and those with only a high school diploma -- the unemployment rate was 10.6 percent. Since neither group was ""well into the double digits,"" as Santorum said, we see no reason to change our ruling.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974A3A00>],/factchecks/2011/nov/10/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-unemployment-college-grads-4-5-/
"['National', 'History', 'Poverty', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich says more Americans in poverty than at any time since the statistic was first calculated
","In a statement submitted in advance of the Nov. 9, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Michigan, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., decried the reach of poverty today. ""More Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago,"" he said. Although CNBC asked candidates to submit opening statements and posted them on its website, when the debate opened they ditched them. But we thought Gingrich's statement was worth checking. Gingrich has focused on poverty before, accusing President Barack Obama of being ""the most successful food stamp president in American history"" because ""47 million Americans are on food stamps."" (We rated this statement Half True.) We decided to check whether Gingrich is right in this new statement, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. Gingrich is right that the numbers go back more than half a century, to 1959, and that the absolute numbers of people in poverty in 2010 --  46.1 million -- is at its highest since the statistic has been recorded. However, Gingrich ignores population growth since 1959. Over that period, the U.S. population has increased by 73 percent. So today’s poverty rate -- that is, the percentage of people in poverty -- is 15.1 percent, compared to a high of 22.4 percent in 1959. Between 1959 and 1965, the poverty rate was higher every year than it is today. That paints a somewhat different picture than what Gingrich suggested. Still, the poverty rate in 2010 was higher than it’s been in every year for more than four decades save one -- 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent -- and that’s largely in tune with Gingrich’s larger point. A final note: Unlike his claim about food stamps, Gingrich was more oblique about the blame Obama bears for this statistic. But he does seem to blame the president. After saying that ""more Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago,"" Gingrich added, ""President Obama and his administration have tried to blame the persistent unemployment and economic stagnation on the severity of the recession they inherited. However, the historical record shows us that the deeper the recession the stronger the recovery. America should at worst be finishing the second year of a booming recovery by now."" It’s impossible to parcel out blame for the nation’s economic troubles in a scientific fashion, but we think that it’s unfair to place that much of the blame for high poverty on Obama. Our ruling Gingrich is right about the absolute number of Americans in poverty. A better understanding of the extent of poverty in the United States requires looking at the number of people in poverty as a percentage of the population. Measuring it that way, the current poverty rate is not the highest ever. Still, this rate is the second highest in more than four decades, which fits with Gingrich’s general point. However, we think Gingrich overstates the amount of blame Obama personally deserves for this statistic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/435851f0-ed97-4aab-bb33-a751e6f8c8b4",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2EB500>],/factchecks/2011/nov/10/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-more-americans-are-poverty-today-any/

Republicans, bloggers needle Obama for creating new tax on Christmas trees - true?
","
In Oregon, fresh cut Christmas trees are as cherished as hazelnuts and Hood strawberries: We grow a lot of them, so we own them. So it was with some astonishment that PolitiFact Oregon heard that President Barack Obama was trying to make it more expensive for people to buy holiday trees.

""Is President Obama 'the Grinch who taxed Christmas' trees?"" queried a headline on the Los Angeles Times website. A Republican congressman from Louisiana issued a press release, slamming the Democratic president for trying to ""sneak through this new tax on Christmas trees."" By the end of Nov. 9, 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation had logged more than 2,000 comments on its blog post, ""Obama Couldn’t Wait: His New Christmas Tree Tax.""

Locally, we spotted a Multnomah County GOP retweet of the Republican National Committee: ""Obama admin creates new tax on Christmas tree farms, fees get passed onto the consumer.""

What in the name of Rudolph and Frosty and the Polar Express was going on?

Oregon is the No. 1 grower of Christmas firs and pine, harvesting more than 7 million trees. (That’s twice the haul of No. 2 North Carolina.)  Was the president seriously imposing a new ""tax"" that might make our holidays a little less ho-ho-ho?

As it happens, a national fresh tree group had sought the 15-cent tree assessment to better promote its products. It’s a ""checkoff program""much like the ones already in place for beef (""it’s what’s for dinner"")and pork (""the other white meat"").

The Agriculture Department approved the idea. The Internet exploded. By the end of the day, the White House had decided to re-assess.  

Betty Malone, an Oregon tree farmer who heads up the Christmas Tree Promotion Now campaign, said she was stunned anyone would describe the tree fee as something dreamed up by the president.  

""It’s absurd. We’ve been working on this for three-and-a-half years. The industry has talked about this for 20 years,"" Malone said. ""This started long before Obama"" was in the White House.

To be fair, not everyone in the industry embraces the idea, although the National Christmas Tree Association reports the majority of responses to the proposed program were positive.

Would the fee be passed on to consumers? That’s unclear, said Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association. ""It doesn’t get automatically passed along, but somebody along the line has to cover it.""
   
Finally, there’s the question of whether the 15-cent assessment is actually a ""tax."" The federal government monitors the agricultural marketing board that administers the money, but the revenue doesn’t go to government. Rick Dungey, spokesman for the national tree association, insists it is not a tax. (He also says consumers should not see a difference in tree prices.)

In Oregon, at least, revenue has to go into the general treasury in order to be considered a tax. If the government doesn’t touch the money, even though government mandates it, the assessment is neither a tax nor a fee.

But we digress. We’re talking about the federal government. Let’s turn to federal sources, with the help of national PolitiFact.

""It certainly doesn't smell or quack like a tax,"" said Robert Litan, the vice president for Research and Policy at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and a former associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton.

On the other hand, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the Cato Institute, says ""a coercive levy is a tax.""  
We also checked with Stephen Bell, communications director for U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the Louisiana congressman who vowed to block Obama’s sneaky tree tax, and Sean Spicer, an RNC spokesman. It didn’t matter to either of them that industry had sought the assessment or that industry was denying it’s a tax.

""It doesn’t matter who asked for it,"" said Bell. ""It’s at the sole discretion of the Obama administration to impose a tax, and they decided to impose this 15-cent tree tax.""

This is a tax, added Spicer, because ""it’s not voluntary. It’s not a contribution to a cause.""

So, where does that leave us? Sources appear split on whether this truly is a tax and whether the cost would be passed along to consumers. As for the claim that Obama created this new tax, that suggests that he came up with the program -- when it’s clear the idea preceded his presidency and originated with the industry.

Those are pretty big facts to ignore. So we rate the claim Mostly False: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Progress Texas says battle flag of Confederacy never flew over Texas
","
Talk about opening with a bang: ""The Confederate battle flag never flew over Texas,"" Matt Glazer opens an opinion article posted online Oct. 20, 2011 by the Austin American-Statesman, ""but if Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson gets his way, you might soon see it on our license plates.""

Glazer is executive director of Progress Texas, a liberal education and advocacy group, which has urged the board overseeing the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to reject a request by the Texas division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and sponsored by Patterson, to permit license plates emblazoned with a red, white and blue flag design tracing to the Confederacy (see the proposed design here) including these words: ""Sons of Confederate Veterans.""

The image, sometimes called the rebel flag or Dukes of Hazzard flag, hearkens to the battle flag of the Confederacy’s Army of Northern Virginia, whose general was Robert E. Lee. An article on Texas flags in the Handbook of Texas Online describes the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia as a square having a red ground with a blue saltire, meaning diagonal cross, ""bordered with white and emblazoned with white five-pointed stars corresponding in number to that of the Confederate States.""

The flag’s look also has long been the identifying emblem of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.

So, that flag never flew over Texas?

To our inquiry, Glazer initially pointed out remarks by Austin lawyer Gary Bledsoe, president of the state NAACP conference, at the motor vehicle board’s Oct. 12, 2011, meeting. A news story in the American-Statesman quoted Bledsoe saying: ""This particular flag never flew over Texas."" And according to the agency’s video of his appearance, Bledsoe continued: ""Let me say that again; this particular flag never flew over Texas."" He urged the board not to consider the design, which he said has been adopted by hate groups to intimidate and offend others.

Up to three flags of the Confederate States of America may have flown over the Texas Capitol in the war’s four years, experts later told us, and while none of them was the flag of Lee’s army, two incorporated its look.

Houston lawyer Charles Spain Jr., author of the Handbook of Texas entry on flags that have flown over Texas, pointed us to a 1997 report by the Texas Historical Commission on the flags that flew over Texas in its unusual history as a republic and as part of Spain, Mexico, France, the Confederacy and the United States.

The commission report, which Glazer said he also leaned on for his claim, says the first flag of the Confederate States of America, which was in place for more than two years, included a red field with a white space extending horizontally through the center; the sought license plate design bears no resemblance.

The nation’s second flag, which flew from May 1863 to March 4, 1865, had a blank white field. But its ""hoist"" corner, the one at the top part closest to the flag pole, was the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, the article says. Toward the end of the war, the flag gave way to a third national flag keeping the battle flag imagery in its hoist corner while adding a red vertical bar down the flag’s white fly.

Put another way, then, a flag with a corner like the license plate design flew over Texas for about two years.

We realized, though, there’s another wrinkle. Battle flags, in themselves, would not have been lofted over government buildings. Battle flags were carried by groups of soldiers. For insight on this aspect, we contacted George Forgie, a University of Texas associate professor of history specializing in the Civil War. Forgie referred us to Jeff Hunt, director of the Texas Military Forces Museum at Austin’s Camp Mabry, who described battle flags as important military tools enabling generals to locate units and track movements on the field.

Hunt said, too, that versions of the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia were carried by Texas units during the war.

Indeed, Hunt said, a version of the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia was carried at the Battle of Palmetto Ranch, the last of the war, which occurred near Brownsville, Texas, on May 12-13, 1865, well after Lee surrendered. Hunt, who has written a book on the battle, said it took place even though both sides knew Lee’s Army had surrendered.

Glazer stuck by his published claim, saying it doesn’t make sense to focus on flags that only had the distinctive imagery in a corner which, he noted by email, is not the same as a flag in itself. Glazer also objected to ""expanding"" the definition of battle flags to include ""flags that ever flew ‘in’ Texas, or any altered flags. That would expand the definition of Texas flags to historic flags like the famous ‘Come and Take It’ flag, athletic flags raised by sports teams outside stadiums, fraternity and sorority flags, commercial flags from Fortune 500 companies and thousands of others I can't even think of.""

Our ruling

The group’s statement reflects the unchallenged fact that the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia did not fly over the Texas Capitol. However, the image on the requested license plate looks a lot like the most noticeable feature of the second and third national flags of the Confederacy, which did fly over Texas. Also, a version of the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia was carried by Texans in a Texas battle.

We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809773FA40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/09/progress-texas/progress-texas-says-battle-flag-behind-license-pla/

Rainbow/PUSH: Wealthy students get HOPE scholarship
","
When Occupy Atlanta took over Woodruff Park and shouted for more economic equality, veteran civil rights activist Joe Beasley did what activists are wont to do. He joined them.

The Southern regional director for the civil rights group Rainbow/PUSH Coalition spoke out for social justice. He defended the group when its occupation tried Mayor Kasim Reed’s patience. Reed kicked them out of the park, and Beasley faced arrest alongside them

But when Beasley called for Reed’s ouster over his treatment of protesters, Rainbow/PUSH headquarters told him to hush. It’s no time to take on Reed, they said in an Oct. 28 statement.

""In a state where both U.S. senators proudly voted against health care reform ... where hard-earned lottery dollars are doled out to the scion[s] of wealthy families, targeting Mayor Reed seems wasteful and naive,"" Rainbow/PUSH’s statement said.

Wait a second, we thought. What’s this about the scions of wealthy families getting lottery dollars? This makes Georgia sound like a bumbling Robin Hood, taking from the poor and giving to the rich.

We contacted Rainbow/PUSH for additional information, but it did not respond to our request.  

It was clear that the group was referring to the HOPE scholarship program, which uses lottery dollars to fund college and technical-school tuition for any student who meets certain academic standards, regardless of income. Lottery funds also support statewide pre-kindergarten programs.

At first, the state only gave HOPE scholarships to families that made less than $66,000. Legislators later nixed the limit because they wanted to use it to keep the best-performing students in state, regardless of income.   

Until recently, HOPE covered 100 percent of tuition at Georgia colleges for high school students graduating with a 3.0 grade-point average.

The state Legislature made it tougher to get the scholarship in March after the program ran into budget problems. Now, students with a 3.7 average and a 1200 SAT will get full tuition coverage. Those with lower grades will get less money.

Some critics have called the HOPE scholarship welfare for the affluent, claiming that the bulk of the dollars go to students who don’t need financial help. We talked to experts who have studied HOPE and similar broad-based statewide scholarship programs to check the accuracy of Rainbow/PUSH’s claim.

We found that while it’s likely that the children of some wealthy families received HOPE scholarship money, reality is not as Rainbow/PUSH described it.  

Researchers have found it’s reasonable to conclude that middle- and upper-income families reap a greater share of the benefits of HOPE. An investigation and resulting series of articles by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published in 2003 came to a similar conclusion.  

Other statewide merit scholarship programs have the same problem.   

""I’d say it’s pretty much settled,"" said Ross Rubenstein, a Syracuse University professor who has studied HOPE. ""Most of the benefits tend to flow to middle- and upper-income families.""

One reason is research consistently shows that children in higher-earning families tend to achieve more academic success. In addition, scholars have known for years that people with less education and lower income tend to spend a greater share of their money on lottery games.  

A 2002 study co-authored by Rubenstein estimated that households that made $25,000 or less or between $35,000 and $50,000 each year gave more to lottery funds than they received in college scholarships and other benefits. Research published by the National Tax Journal in 2001 suggests that the program widened the gap in college attendance between students from low- and high-income families.

Two University of Georgia professors found that HOPE scholarships are more likely to be awarded to counties with higher per-capita incomes, although lower-income families tend to spend a greater share of their money on the lottery.

One peculiar result is that HOPE scholarships may have boosted car sales, according to a study co-authored by University of Georgia professor David Mustard. His research found that county car registrations increased when their number of HOPE recipients attending state-system and private schools rose, so long as the county’s per-capita income was above the 75th percentile.

""Do the children of really wealthy families get HOPE? Probably yes,"" Mustard said. ""And really poor families do, too. But wealthy families do get it at higher rates.""  

But what researchers know about HOPE and income has its limits. The scholarship application does not ask students to disclose how much their families make, Mustard said, so scholars are unable to do more precise calculations.

It’s likely that children from upper-income families do receive HOPE scholarship money, as Rainbow/PUSH’s news release stated. But the group’s rhetoric is so strident that it confuses the issue.

Truth does underlie its statement. Middle- and upper- income families tend to receive more of the scholarship’s benefits, even though lower-income families tend to spend a greater share of their money buying the lottery tickets that fund HOPE.  

Still, it’s not fair to suggest that the program takes from the poor and gives to the rich, or the ""scion[s] of wealthy families,"" as Rainbow/PUSH said. Middle-income families are among the program’s greatest beneficiaries. Lower-income and poor families do receive a notable share of the scholarships.

Rainbow/PUSH is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition for Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809723FD80>],/factchecks/2011/nov/09/rainbowpush-coalition/rainbowpush-wealthy-students-get-hope-scholarship/

Rod Smith says 46 percent of Florida mortgages are underwater
","
Democratic Party chairman Rod Smith, a former prosecutor who lost his 2006 gubernatorial bid to Charlie Crist, roasted Republicans in his speech at the party's state convention on Oct. 29, 2011, for being out of touch with middle-class Americans, the St. Petersburg Times reported. He used the housing crisis as an example. 
""Think about it. When Republicans took over the leadership of Florida, most of you had never even heard the term 'underwater mortgage,'"" Smith said. ""Today 46 percent of all Floridians owe more on their home than it is worth. 
""It is in a moment of crisis like we are (in) that a political party can revive itself, reinvent itself into a force that can re-center this nation, this state,"" he said. ""Unlike the Republicans, we don't have some undying sworn oath that says we will keep supporting the same predatory practices that got us into this mess to start with. We're the only party situated where we can reach out and lead the entire nation."" 
We hear all the time about Florida's foreclosure problems and unemployment (10.6 percent in September). But Smith's figure for the number of underwater mortgages in this state is striking. Do nearly half of Floridians really owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth? 
Being underwater means a home owner owes more on their mortgage than the home is worth, and it's happened to many home owners since Florida's housing bubble went bust. Borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth sometimes opt to leave their homes and let the properties enter foreclosure. These ""strategic defaults"" contribute to foreclosures already clogging the courts, leading to even lower home prices. 
We already know from this fact-check that the national percentage of underwater homes is around 22 and 27 percent, depending upon which real estate data-mining company you ask. If Smith is right, Florida's figure would be almost twice the national average.  
We circled back to CoreLogic Inc. and Zillow.com, companies that analyze real estate data using county public records. 
CoreLogic's most recent report, spanning April to June 2011, found Florida's rate of underwater homes was third-highest in the country at 45.1 percent, trailing Nevada at 60 percent and Arizona at 49 percent. The next-highest state is Michigan at 36 percent. By CoreLogic's tally, the number of underwater homes in Florida as of June was about 1.97 million. 
Zillow.com typically does not typically measure states' overall rate of underwater homes, said spokeswoman Alison Paoli. The company did, however, have underwater data for Florida's metropolitan areas through the end of the third quarter ending in September. 
The breakdown gives us some perspective about the places in Florida most plagued by sinking home values. Metro areas with the highest rate of underwater homes include Jacksonville (59.8 percent), Port St. Lucie (57.8 percent), Melbourne (54.8 percent) and Sarasota (51 percent). (Information for Orlando is not available). The lowest-rate places? Those include Panama City (37.4 percent) and Gainesville (39.8 percent). 
Our ruling 
Rod Smith claimed that nearly half, or 46 percent, of Floridians owe more on their mortgages than the value of their homes. The most recent rate of underwater homes in Florida is 45.1 percent, behind only Nevada and Arizona. And that estimate is actually pretty conservative compared to what several metro areas are experiencing. Given the implications for our housing market, we suspect most Floridians are sorry that his claim checks out. 
What's not so clear is Smith's suggestion that Florida Republicans are somehow responsible for the ailing housing market.  While he doesn't explicitly blame Republicans for causing the housing bust, he does suggest it, and that's enough for us to downgrade his rating. The housing bubble was a national phenomenon, at the heart of which were national lenders, and other states are feeling our pain. So we rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4D6240>],/factchecks/2011/nov/08/rod-smith/rod-smith-says-46-percent-florida-mortgages-are-un/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Mitt Romney supports personhood amendments, wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade
","
In a Nov. 3, 2011, conference call with reporters, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. -- the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee -- took aim at Mitt Romney, the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary.

In the 11-minute conference call, Wasserman Schultz focused on Romney’s stance on abortion -- particularly on the notion that ""personhood"" begins at fertilization. The issue was in the news because of a ballot measure being considered by Mississippi voters on Nov. 8, 2011. The measure -- which, if passed, would be the first of its kind adopted in the nation -- asks, ""Should the term 'person' be defined to include every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the equivalent thereof?""

Supporters of abortion rights say the measure, if passed, would threaten not only abortion but also in vitro fertilization and some forms of contraception that act by preventing an already fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, thus causing a miscarriage.

Experts say the Mississippi measure conflicts with the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. In Roe, Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the majority that if the ""suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment."" For this reason, the Mississippi measure could provoke a reconsideration of the landmark -- and controversial -- decision.

After noting the Mississippi measure and similar proposals circulating in other states, including her home state of Florida, Wasserman Schultz said, ""We’re seeing this support for this dangerous approach from top leaders in the Republican Party, including Republican front-runner Mitt Romney.... Now Romney is committed to overturning Roe vs. Wade, and he supports such amendments that define a life as beginning at the moment of conception.""

We have already addressed the question of whether Romney changed his position on abortion -- we concluded rival candidate Jon Huntsman’s charge that Romney changed his stance on abortion was True. In this item, we’re only looking at Romney’s position as it stands today.

We didn’t hear back from the DNC, but we were able to collect a couple of statements that seem relevant to analyzing Wasserman Schultz’s comment.

• The Huckabee interview. In an Oct. 2, 2011, interview with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- a onetime Republican presidential candidate who now hosts a talk show on Fox News -- Huckabee asked Romney, ""Would you have supported the constitutional amendment that would have established the definition of life at conception?"" Romney answered, ""Absolutely."" 
According to a slightly longer excerpt of the conversation provided to PolitiFact by the campaign, it's unclear whether Huckabee and Romney are referring to a state constitutional amendment or a federal one.

• The Iowa town hall meeting. On Oct. 20, 2011, Romney held a town hall meeting at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. One audience member asked him, ""You were on Gov. Huckabee's show a few weeks ago, and one of the things that you folks talked about was that you would support a life-begins-at-conception amendment. Now, that would essentially mean banning most forms of birth control. Ninety-eight percent of American women, including me, use birth control. So could you help me understand why you oppose the use of birth control?""

Romney answered, ""Life begins at conception. Birth control prevents conception. My own view is this, and let me … clarify my view so that you understand that. What I believe is the right course with regards to abortion and life is that I would like to see the Supreme Court return this right to the states and let states create their own legislation with regards to life. That's my view. And states will make different decisions, which is their right to do so. And my view is I'm not out campaigning for an amendment of some kind. I am campaigning to see justices ultimately appointed to the Supreme Court that will follow the Constitution (and) return to the states the right to make this decision themselves.""

The exchange prompted a lengthy report on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show and gained traction on liberal blogs.

• What the Romney campaign says. In both a Nov. 3, 2011, New York Times blog post and a statement released to PolitiFact, the Romney campaign did not address his stance on personhood measures specifically. But the campaign told us that ""Mitt Romney is pro-life, and as he has said previously, he is supportive of efforts to ensure recognition that life begins at conception. He believes these matters should be left up to states to decide.""

We see two questions here:

First, do these comments support Wasserman Schultz's contention that Romney ""is committed to overturning Roe vs. Wade""?

And second, do these comments support Wasserman Schultz's claim that Romney ""supports such amendments that define a life as beginning at the moment of conception""?

The answer to the first question is pretty straightforward. The experts on bioethics and constitutional law whom we contacted agreed that Romney’s position -- that he ""would like to see the Supreme Court return this right to the states and let states create their own legislation with regards to life"" -- equated to seeing Roe vs. Wade overturned.

""If the states are free to define what a ‘person’ is under the Constitution, then one state might say that an embryo or fetus is a person, and another state could say only born infants are persons,"" said Paul A. Lombardo, a law professor at Georgia State University. ""That would certainly negate Roe vs. Wade.""

The second question is more complicated. We see at least two complicating issues.

First, the wording of personhood measures varies and may continue to do so if the movement expands across the country. While Wasserman Schultz referred to the Mississippi measure and the potential Florida measure earlier in the call, her statement here is structured more broadly. We interpret it to mean that Romney supports personhood measures generally.

""Romney may support some forms of personhood amendments but not others"" that are worded differently, said I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law School professor and co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics.

Second, experts say there is a difference -- a subtle, but potentially important one -- between Romney’s stated view and what the Mississippi measure says.

""Strictly speaking, what Romney says supports Wasserman-Schultz's claim,"" Christopher Tollefsen, a philosophy professor at the University of South Carolina and author of the 2008 book, Embryo: A Defense of Human Life. ""The wiggle room is that the Mississippi amendment goes beyond the claim that ‘life begins at conception’ to the claim that ‘personhood begins at conception.’ Romney might agree with the first and disagree with the second and not support the Mississippi amendment for that reason.""

Tollefsen explained that ""to say that something is a ‘person’ is to say that it has a particular kind of moral status -- the sort of thing you can't kill and that deserves the protection of the law. Some philosophers, such as Peter Singer, think that the embryo, or fetus, is a human being, but is not a ‘person’ -- that although it is a human being, it can still be killed, until it reaches, say, consciousness, or the ability to feel pain.""

Tollefsen added that this would be ""in some tension with Romney’s claim about the sanctity of life. If you think that ‘sanctity of life’ means you can't kill any human being and that the embryo is a human being, then effectively you do think that the embryo is a ‘person’ in the relevant sense.""

Romney could also take the position that he opposes the amendment on pragmatic grounds. ""He could object to the Mississippi amendment as being on a collision course with the Supreme Court in a context in which Mississippi was bound to lose,"" Tollefsen said. ""A lot of pro-lifers object to it for precisely this reason."" (Tollefson added that this explanation would disappear if Huckabee was asking about an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.)

Cohen agrees that Romney has some ""wiggle room"" on the issue.

""Romney says he believes life begins at conception, but he does not say the state should necessarily legislate to that effect,"" Cohen said. ""He could say he believes this as a moral, personal or religious matter, but not in terms of what individual states have the right to do, in part because of views about women or others' autonomy.""

Our ruling

Wasserman Schultz’s claim that Mitt Romney ""is committed to overturning Roe vs. Wade"" is well supported by his comments at the town hall, and Romney laid the groundwork for supporting personhood measures in his Huckabee interview. We think, however, that Wasserman Schultz makes too much of a blanket statement about his views on personhood measures. Our experts tell us that it’s possible for a politician who said what Romney has to oppose some personhood measures based on their wording. On balance, we rate Wasserman Schultz’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097573680>],/factchecks/2011/nov/08/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-mitt-romney-supports/
"['National', 'Energy', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Jon Huntsman']","
Jon Hunstman says U.S. is sending oil dollars to ""unstable and unfriendly regimes""
","
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. delivered a speech on energy policy at the University of New Hampshire that said the United States is ""drowning in energy resources"" and outlined a proposal to ""unshackle ourselves from the scourge of foreign oil.""

To make his case, the former U.S. ambassador to China and Singapore said the U.S. needs to end ""our heroin-like addiction to foreign oil"" and asserted that money flies out of the country to less-than-solid allies.

""Every year we send $300 billion – half our trade deficit – overseas for oil to unstable and unfriendly regimes,"" Huntsman said in the Nov. 1, 2011, speech.

""Three hundred billion dollars to our competitors and nations with whom we have nothing more than a transactional relationship. I want that money going to American energy suppliers, spent in American stores, saved in American banks and invested in American communities to create American jobs,"" he said.

With international trade and the loss of American jobs overseas a major concern, has Huntsman identified a real winner when it comes to spurring the U.S. economy? And do the numbers hold up?

The Huntsman campaign cited U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data that show that the U.S. trade deficit in 2010 was just over $500 billion. And the gap is getting worse, deepening by $40 billion through August 2011.

And, as Huntsman suggested, the U.S. imported $323 billion worth of energy-related petroleum products, including crude oil, in 2010, and had already spent $283 billion on the black gold overseas through August 2011.

But drill into the numbers and it gets a bit murkier -- two of the top oil exporters to the United States aren’t Persian Gulf monarchies; they are America’s next-door neighbors, Canada and Mexico.

Countries in the Western Hemisphere accounted for 49 percent of U.S. crude oil and petroleum product imports in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while 18 percent came from the Persian Gulf.

Canada supplied 25 percent, Saudi Arabia 12 percent, Nigeria 11 percent, Venezuela (a Western Hemisphere unfriendly) 10 percent and Mexico 9 percent last year. Crude oil import figures through August 2011 show Canada still in that 25 percent range, with Mexico now second, accounting for about 12.7 percent of the imported supply.

Saudi Arabia was third (11.9 percent), and the rest of the top 15 importers of crude oil were Nigeria, Venezuela, Iraq, Colombia, Angola, Ecuador, Russia, Brazil, Kuwait, Algeria, Congo and Oman.

Canada is hardly unstable or unfriendly, and Mexican President Felipe Calderon, while grappling with terrible drug violence, was elected in 2006 and has been a solid ally. Several of the other top importers might also be surprised to be considered anything but stable, friendly trading partners.

To give Huntsman credit, he did identify Canada later in his speech as a key and loyal supplier, as he came out in support of the Keystone pipeline, which would carry oil from Canadian oil sands into the U.S. ""Every barrel from a friend is one less from a foe,"" Huntsman said.

His speech also called not just for more offshore domestic drilling and fracking (a method used to recover both oil and natural gas); he also spoke favorably of coal-to-liquid fuel, a new generation of nuclear power technology, and policies that would create a more level playing field for other potential transportation fuels, such as natural gas. Huntsman also supported ending various energy subsidies, outside of basic research, to give emerging technologies a chance to compete in the energy market.

Robert Kaufmann, chairman of Boston University’s Department of Geography and Environment, who follows world oil markets and global climate change, said it doesn’t particularly matter who supplies oil to the U.S., because it is a global market.

""Of course we have transactional relationships,"" Kaufmann said. ""Anyone who has ever run a business knows you don’t have to be best buddies with your customers -- that’s what capitalism is. It’s a series of transactional relationships.""

He also said the idea of making the U.S. self-sufficient in terms of oil -- though Huntsman didn’t go quite that far -- was impractical, both because of the high cost of investment for domestic production compared to the available global supply and the threat to the environment.

""Yes, there’s a lot of natural gas, but that’s not going to displace oil,"" Kaufmann added.

Our ruling

Huntsman was a little more nuanced than some of his ""drill, baby, drill"" Republican colleagues, and correct in identifying, as others have before him, the high cost of American dependence on foreign oil. But much of the oil the U.S. imports is from friendly nations, including Canada and Mexico, rather than ""unstable and unfriendly regimes."" We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097233580>],/factchecks/2011/nov/08/jon-huntsman/jon-hunstman-says-us-sending-oil-dollars-unstable-/

Retiring couples get $3 in Medicare benefits for each $1 paid in, Rob Portman says
","
The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, better known as the congressional ""super committee,"" has a deadline of Nov. 23 to come up with a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.

Democrats on the bipartisan, 12-member panel offered a proposal in late October that included about $400 billion in cuts to Medicare. While the plan had no chance of winning approval from the committee's Republicans, who have said they will not accept a package with tax increases, it underlined the point that any plan is certain to make cuts to federal entitlement programs, especially Medicare.

The super committee's co-chair, Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, noted in a hearing on Nov. 1 that President Obama had called Medicare and Medicaid ""the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin.""

More attention focused on health care in the hearing, which featured testimony by the co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles.

Sen. Rob Portman at one point described Medicare now as an unsustainable program.

""A couple retiring today will pay about $119,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes and receive about $357,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""So that's about 3 bucks in benefits for every dollar in taxes. If you multiply this by the 77 million retiring baby boomers, it's not hard to see why we have an unsustainable program."" 
PolitiFact Ohio knew the prospects for Medicare sustaining itself weren’t good, but we were surprised at the 3-to-1 ratio of benefits to taxes, particularly because of the popular belief among recipients that ""you earned it, you paid for it.""

We asked Portman's office for background.

They referred us to a study from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan public policy organization. Authored by fellow Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury Department official, the widely cited study was published early this year and subsequently updated.

It says a two-income couple in which both partners earned an average wage ($43,500 each in 2011) and retired in 2011 would pay $119,000 in Medicare taxes and receive $357,000 in benefits.

We looked more closely at the study and found that the ratio was even more skewed for a single-income couple.

""Over a wide range of scenarios, beneficiaries retiring at age 65 in 2011 can expect to receive dramatically more in total benefits than they have paid in dedicated taxes,"" it concluded. ""If only one member of the couple had worked, we calculate a six-fold difference between contributions and benefits since both spouses are eligible for Medicare yet only one has paid taxes.""

Looking at the bigger picture, the report said, ""It is no wonder these programs now account for one-third of all federal spending each year.""

The study, which was updated specifically to inform super committee discussions, concluded that ""changes to entitlement programs are inevitable as part of a sound fiscal policy."" It asserted that anything short of a comprehensive, overall view would merely be tinkering.

Its bottom line: ""Tax rates that have not kept pace with ever-rising benefit levels, increasing years of support, spiraling health costs, and fewer workers per retiree all imply that current and future generations of workers are going to have to do something to get these elderly benefit programs into order, either by paying higher taxes or receiving fewer benefits for themselves.""

We make no ruling on those difficult choices.

The difficult situation described by Portman is another matter. On the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976AF140>],/factchecks/2011/nov/08/rob-portman/retiring-couples-get-3-medicare-benefits-each-1-pa/
"['Georgia', 'Occupy Wall Street', 'Vincent Fort']","
Were Atlanta's tactics similar to Bull Connor?
","
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has spoken frequently about his goal of making this a city that is not too busy to love.

But some say the mayor has been downright mean to Occupy Atlanta movement supporters, some of whom were recently arrested by Atlanta police for refusing to leave a city park.

How mean? Some made comparisons between Reed, who is black, and one of the most infamous names from the civil rights era: Bull Connor.

Eugene ""Bull"" Connor, the public safety commissioner of Birmingham during those days, became best known for brutal tactics such as siccing dogs on civil rights demonstrators and spraying water from fire hoses at them. When the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a prominent civil rights leader, was taken by ambulance from one protest in Birmingham, Connor lamented, ""I wish they'd carried him away in a hearse.""

In Atlanta, the comparisons to Connor came fast when police arrested more than 50 Occupy Atlanta supporters late last month.

One unidentified man carried a cardboard sign that read ""Bull Connor Reed"" as former Atlanta City Councilman Derrick Boazman, an Occupy Atlanta supporter, was being interviewed by reporters after protesters were released from the city jail. Boazman was quoted in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article as saying that the city’s police chief, George Turner, ""sounds like Bull Connor.""

State Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, who is one of the most outspoken members of the Legislature, said of Reed -- whom Fort strongly supported in the 2009 mayor’s race -- ""if he wants to be like Bull Connor, then so be it.""

We focused on Fort since he was the most prominent elected official we found who made such a comparison about a historical figure whose tactics were so universally reviled. In a telephone interview, the senator criticized us for fact-checking what he called a ""rhetorical analogy.""

Still, Fort vigorously defended his comments, calling them ""an appropriate analogy.""

""The core issue is the same,"" said Fort, who has taught history at Clark Atlanta University and joined the Occupy Atlanta protests. ""An elected official using force to challenge people’s right to free speech.""

By force, Fort said he was referring to the arrests of the protesters.

""[Reed] has violated people’s First Amendment rights and civil rights,"" the senator added, ""and then taken credit for how well [the arrests] worked.""

Connor was a staunch segregationist who ordered water from fire hoses aimed at nonviolent demonstrators. Under his direction, the Birmingham police officers used violence against nonviolent demonstrators.

Reed, on the other hand, has publicly agreed with some of the concerns of the Occupy Atlanta demonstrators. And Reed signed an executive order that allowed them to camp in the park, even though city laws prohibit it. Some critics have accused the mayor of being soft with the demonstrators.

So were the mayor’s actions and tactics in removing Occupy Atlanta demonstrators from Woodruff Park comparable to what Connor did in the mid-1960s?

Reed said he sympathized with the Occupy Atlanta movement’s concerns about economic inequality and the inordinate influence they say big banks and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans have over the nation’s legislative policies. The mayor signed two executive orders over the course of several weeks in October that let the demonstrators stay in the park, suspending rules prohibiting anyone from being there from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Reed later ordered police to remove demonstrators from the park, citing public safety concerns. Shortly after midnight on Oct. 26, more than 50 people were arrested. No fire hoses or police dogs were used. No injuries were reported.

Last weekend, Atlanta police arrested about 20 Occupy Atlanta demonstrators. Some demonstrators claimed police used excessive force, saying in one case that a patrol officer on a motorcycle accelerated into a protester. Another Occupy Atlanta supporter told Channel 2 Action News that police grabbed her by her hair.

David Garrow, a historian whose work on the civil rights movement earned him a Pulitzer Prize, said there were no similarities between the actions of Reed and Connor. He called comparisons to Connor ""hilariously cheap rhetoric.""

""It’s the lowest level of ‘Yo Mammaing’ to insult another African-American in that way,"" Garrow said. ""It’s name-calling and nothing else.""

Yo Mammaing as in: ""Yo Mamma is so old, her memory is in black and white.""

Or, Yo Mamma is so mean to Occupy Atlanta protesters, she ...

Never mind.

John Giggie, who teaches a course on Southern African-American history at the University of Alabama, also did not find any similarities.

""Connor practiced racial hatred that seemed absolutely absent in this incident,"" Giggie told us. ""I think [Fort] is painting history with a very broad brush.""

Much of the anger toward the mayor from some Occupy Atlanta supporters is based in feelings of betrayal. Reed is mayor of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr’s hometown and has spoken reverently of the civil rights movement and its leaders.

The comparison in actions between Reed and an infamous figure such as Connor was too extreme to the experts we interviewed. Our rating: Pants On Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F6600>],/factchecks/2011/nov/08/vincent-fort/were-atlantas-tactics-similar-bull-connor/

Allen West says EPA wants to hire 230,000 workers at a cost of $21 billion
","The Environmental Protection Agency has been the source of a series of eye-popping but false claims including that the federal agency intends to regulate dust, that it treats spilled milk the same as oil spills and that it plans to implement what has been dubbed a ""cow tax.""

Here's the latest charge against the EPA: the agency wants to go on the mother of all hiring sprees.

U.S. Rep. Allen West, a Republican in South Florida, made the charge in a TV interview on Oct. 21, 2011.

""The objective of this administration, truly the objective of the liberal progressives, is to get more people wedded to government either by subsistence check or employment check,"" West said. ""When you hear an EPA that wants to hire 230,000 new government regulators that will cost the taxpayer $21 billion, when you have (U.S. Sen.) Harry Reid coming out and saying that we need to hire more people in the public sector over the private sector that's not how we are going to restore our economy. But that's how they would create a victim class, an entitlement class, a new welfare state that will be totally dependent upon them that will change national level elections hence and forever more.""

That's quite a want-ad for the EPA, which currently has about 18,000 employees and an annual budget of $8.7 billion. Does it really want to hire 230,000 new employees at a cost of $21 billion?

Supreme Court ruled greenhouse gas is a pollutant

The claim that the EPA wants to hire 230,000 new employees to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has been hotly debated among bloggers and media outlets. The story begins back in 2007, when the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gas emissions from cars are a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and ordered the EPA to determine whether they endanger human health. In 2009, the EPA determined that greenhouse gas emissions do endanger human health.

Under the Clean Air Act approved by Congress in 1970, if the EPA regulates a pollutant under one section of the Clean Air Act -- in this case, auto emissions -- it must regulate that pollutant under the permitting sections of the Clean Air Act. This meant that the EPA would have had to regulate greenhouse gasses from all sources that emit them above the level set in statute: 100 or 250 tons per year. (The threshold is different depending on which Clean Air Act permitting program is involved.) That would mean that millions of small sources not previously regulated under the Clean Air Act permitting programs -- such as restaurants, commercial bakeries and apartment buildings -- would also have to apply for permits from the EPA.

Since that would be a massive undertaking, the EPA sought to phase in implementation.

In January 2011, the EPA started with the largest businesses such as large power plants and oil refineries. That hasn't required more staff because the applicants are going through the same permitting process they have in the past -- with questions about an additional pollutant, greenhouse gases, tacked on.

Businesses that face additional EPA regulation have challenged the agency in court. The Coalition for Responsible Regulation is a plaintiff in the case -- the Los Angeles Times reported that the coalition's officers are the same as Quintana Minerals Resources, a large owner of coal reserves.

Media frenzy The Daily Caller, a right-leaning news website, published a Sept. 26 article that pulled quotes from the government's Sept. 16 court brief in the case.

The headline of the article was ""EPA: regulations would require 230,000 new employees, $21 billion"".

The article stated:

""The Environmental Protection Agency has said new greenhouse gas regulations, as proposed, may be 'absurd' in application and 'impossible to administer' by its self-imposed 2016 deadline. But the agency is still asking for taxpayers to shoulder the burden of up to 230,000 new bureaucrats — at a cost of $21 billion — to attempt to implement the rules.""

The article quoted part of the court brief which stated: ""Hiring the 230,000 full-time employees necessary to produce the 1.4 billion work hours required to address the actual increase in permitting functions would result in an increase in Title V administration costs of $21 billion per year.""

By the next day, Media Matters for America, a liberal group, disputed The Daily Caller's report and so did POLITICO, which quoted EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan who said that The Daily Caller's report was ""comically wrong.""

Government argues that full implementation would overwhelm system

We read portions of the court brief in which the federal government argues that the thresholds Congress established -- 100 or 250 tons per year -- ""pose significant implementation difficulties when applied to greenhouse gases...."" and ""would result in coverage of millions of additional sources, thereby presenting overwhelming regulatory burdens.""

These ""burdens would inundate"" the EPA and state permitting authorities resulting in billions of dollars in costs and years of delays for obtaining permits, the U.S. Department of Justice and EPA brief states. The government even calls this ""unmanageable burdens,"" which is why the EPA is using what they call a ""tailoring"" rule to phase in regulation.

The government calculated how many employees it would need -- and at what cost -- if it was required to implement monitoring greenhouse gas emissions without tailoring.

""Hiring the 230,000 full-time employees necessary to produce the 1.4 billion work hours required to address the actual increase in permitting functions would result in an increase in Title V administration costs of $21 billion per year."" Although The Daily Caller ended its quote here, the court brief continues with a key point: ""Based on this analysis, EPA found that applying the literal statutory thresholds (100/250 tpy) on January 2, 2011, would ""overwhelm the resources of permitting authorities and severely impair the functioning of the programs....""

So the 230,000 employees figure, and the $21 billion cost, is something that the federal government calculated for the purposes of illustrating that it doesn't want to hire that many people or pay that much and instead wants to phase in implementation.

That covers the current state of hiring, but what about in the future as the EPA expands its implementation?

The EPA states, starting on page 30 of the court brief, that by July 2012 the EPA will address various options to streamline the process.

""Thus, the Tailoring Rule is calculated to move toward eventual full compliance with the statutory threshold, unless, notwithstanding EPA’s significant efforts at further reducing the administrative burdens through streamlining and other actions, impossibility of full administrative implementation persists at that time,"" states the court brief on page 31.

We turned to Lisa Heinzerling, now a Georgetown Law professor who was involved in this issue when she worked in high-level positions at the EPA in 2009 and 2010, for an explanation of what the EPA is saying about its intentions by 2016.

""The agency recognizes that under the law as currently framed it has a legal obligation at some point to reach those thresholds so it needs be showing progress toward that goal,"" she said. ""'Moving toward' them is different than one day saying 'alright everyone is in and we need 200 and some thousand employees.' The agency is not saying that at all. The agency is saying it recognizes the need to move toward thresholds and also recognizes even with streamlining measures it will come up with in the next five years burdens may still be greater than the agency may be able to tolerably bear, then we will have to see.""

Kevin Bundy, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, currently one of the interveners on the government's side said:

""What EPA is saying -- in the context of the rule the agency is actually defending -- is that they'll continue to explore ways of 'moving toward' the statutory thresholds, while acknowledging that implementing the program at those thresholds may still be impossible. The rule envisions 'moving toward' the statutory thresholds by streamlining the permit process and by considering permanent exemptions for various categories of sources. 'Moving toward' does not mean 'achieving.' What Rep. West is supposedly afraid of -- EPA hiring 200,000+ additional regulators and so forth -- is exactly what the Tailoring Rule was designed to avoid.""

Bundy points to the EPA's 2010 greenhouse gas tailoring document which states that the EPA plans to propose ways to streamline implementation in future phases including permanently excluding certain small sources.

University of Miami law professor Charlton Copeland, who teaches administrative law, read the tailoring section of the court brief at PolitiFact's request. He said the government cites the hiring numbers to articulate why it wants to depart from a literal reading of the provision.

""I don't read that and get the sense what the EPA is gearing up for is a public works program on its own...,"" Copeland said. ""They keep saying it's 'absurd' or 'impossible.' When I see 'absurd' or 'impossible' they are referencing both to the amount of personnel it would take and the kind of slow down it would impose on the permitting process.""

Gilfillan, the EPA spokesman, said that the EPA won't be hiring 230,000 extra workers now or in 2016 even if the court rules that the EPA can't tailor. The 230,000 workers referenced in the court brief would be a combination of state and federal employees since the EPA handles permitting for some states while it delegates it in others.

Any such massive expansion of the EPA would require Congress to provide the extra money to the EPA -- a highly unlikely scenario. And the ""EPA has no authority to control hiring decisions in state agencies,"" said Robert Glicksman, an environmental law professor at George Washington University Law School, in an e-mail.

West responds and our ruling We asked West's office for an explanation. West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano sent us a link to a conservative blog that posted a Sept. 23 article from the Institute for Energy Research entitled ""EPA's absurd defense of its greenhouse gas actions,"" which includes some of the same points raised later by The Daily Caller.

Sachitano also sent us a quote from West:

""I am pleased the Environmental Protection Agency has recognized the absurdity of using the Clean Air Act, which was never the intention of Congress, to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide. I'm also pleased that the EPA filed on September 16th a brief with the court that will temporary not require them to hire 230,000 full time employees at a cost to the American Taxpayer of $21 billion.""

But on TV West said: ""When you hear an EPA wants to hire 230,000 new government regulators that will cost the taxpayer $21 billion..."" and cited that as an example of getting more people wedded to the government by employment check. West is suggesting that the federal government is bloated and will bloat even more since the EPA ""wants"" to hire 230,000 new employees at a cost of $21 billion. But the EPA made it clear in its brief that it doesn't want to hire all those folks. It's unclear how the EPA and the states would handle implementation if the courts rule that the EPA can't tailor. But it is clear that the EPA, and the states, wouldn't have the budgets to hire 230,000 more people.

Rick Perry says taxpayers spend half a trillion dollars a year on tax preparation
","
During the now-famous New Hampshire address by Rick Perry on Oct. 28, 2011 -- in which Perry’s animated banter went viral and drew satirical jabs from Saturday Night Live -- the Texas governor made a claim about how much Americans spend on preparing their taxes. 
""Everybody's got a slogan, right?"" Perry said. ""Mine's cut, balance and grow. Get that? Yes. Cut the size of this government and balance that budget and grow the economy, and it's pretty simple actually. Or you can stay in the old system that's out there. And then … the ones that want to stay in the old system, pay the lawyers, pay the accountants, all the money that's gone, or that. Think about it. You know, we spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation. Any accountants or tax lawyers out there -- I'm sorry, dude, but that's too much money, a half a trillion dollars."" 
A reader asked us to check whether it’s true that ""we spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation."" (It’s a popular topic across the ideological spectrum; President Barack Obama's administration has proposed simplified tax filing procedures, though the effort is rated Stalled on our Obameter.) 
We called the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to see if it tracked that figure, and it said it didn’t. We also looked at federal gross domestic product statistics and found that the industry breakdown does not specify tax preparation among its categories of professional services, making an estimate impossible. 
However, the Perry campaign provided us with a source: A 2005 paper by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax issues. 
The paper noted at least three burdens caused by the tax code: tax planning -- or efforts to limit one’s taxes; defending against tax audits and tax litigation; and tax compliance, which includes record-keeping, education about tax laws, form preparation and packaging and sending tax forms. 
The foundation decided to look only at the third category -- tax compliance -- for calendar year 2005. Its researchers concluded that the costs of compliance for individuals was 2.8 billion hours, or $110 billion; the cost for businesses was 3.1 billion hours or $148 billion; and the cost for nonprofits was 141 million hours or $6.8 billion. 
In all, that works out to upwards of 6 billion hours and $265 billion. 
If that were the final number, Perry’s estimate would be significantly off base. But there are a few additional points we need to make. 
First, the same paper projected that compliance costs would rise to $483 billion by 2015, or $406 billion adjusted for the 2005 value of the dollar. The $483 billion number is closer to Perry’s estimate -- and in fact, his staff said that that’s the number he was referring to during the New Hampshire speech. 
However, that figure is an exaggeration of today’s cost. Using the same study’s projections, the amount for 2011 should be $392 billion, or $354 billion in 2005 dollars -- well below Perry’s $500 billion figure. At the pace projected by the paper, it would take until 2016 (using regular dollars) or 2022 (using inflation-adjusted dollars) to reach Perry’s amount of $500 billion. That’s either five years or 11 years into the future -- assuming the estimate was correct in the first place and assuming nothing fundamental has changed the long-term arc since 2005. 
There’s another concern. Perry said that we spend ""half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation. Any accountants or tax lawyers out there -- I'm sorry, dude, but that's too much money, a half a trillion dollars."" This suggests that the costs we’re talking about are specifically those paid to accountants and lawyers. 
However, the amount calculated in the Tax Foundation study is broader. It includes time spent on internal bookkeeping and education about tax laws as well as money spent on postage and the like. In the Tax Foundation data, the costs strictly for ""form preparation"" -- the primary job of an accountant -- add up to 31 percent of individual tax compliance costs, 32 percent for businesses, 22 percent for nonprofits and 28 percent overall. 
Even if that percentage undercounts what taxpayers pay accountants, this would make Perry’s estimate even further off base. However, the decrease would be at least partially offset by adding in the cost of ""tax lawyers,"" in Perry’s words, whose costs are not included in the Tax Foundation study. 
All this makes clear that estimating the tax compliance burden on the United States is tricky business. Indeed, the Government Accountability Office came to that very conclusion in a 2005 report. 
""Estimating total compliance costs is difficult because neither the government nor taxpayers maintain regular accounts of these costs, and federal tax requirements often overlap with record-keeping and reporting that taxpayers do for other purposes,"" the GAO wrote. ""Although available estimates are uncertain, taken together, they suggest that total compliance costs are large. For example, combining the lowest available estimates for the personal and corporate income tax yields a total of $107 billion (roughly 1 percent of GDP) per year."" 
Other studies, GAO added, estimate costs as 1.5 times as large. 
We also checked in with Eric Toder, a fellow at the Urban Institute who has studied tax compliance costs. He estimated that current compliance costs for all individual filers is about $100 billion, plus nearly another $100 billion for small businesses, plus an undetermined amount for nonprofits and large businesses. Added together, this is likely a bit lower than the Tax Foundation’s projected 2011 figure of $392 billion and significantly lower than Perry’s $500 billion figure. 
Toder added that Perry’s tax proposal -- keeping the current system, but giving filers an option of paying a flat tax instead -- wouldn’t necessarily reduce compliance costs by much. 
""If you look at IRS data, you will find that ‘business’ taxpayers -- individuals who complete schedules C, E, or F -- spend a lot more time on their returns than non-business taxpayers,"" he said. ""Business returns are complex because it is hard to determine which expenses are business expenses (deductible) or personal expenses (non-deductible). For example, what share of the expenses of maintaining a car that is used for both business and personal reasons is deductible? None of those types of problems would be made easier by the Perry proposal."" 
Toder added that the biggest part of burden is record-keeping, ""which has nothing to do with the cost of completing forms, such as switching to a postcard"" -- a centerpiece of Perry’s plan. 
Our ruling 
Looking at the Tax Foundation report which Perry used -- as well as alternate analyses of the question -- it’s clear that $500 billion is a high estimate, at least as the numbers stand today. If you define this number narrowly -- to tax preparers and tax lawyers, the groups Perry named specifically -- Perry’s estimate is even further off base. 
Perry has a valid point to make -- that a whole lot of money is spent on tax preparation in the United States today. But he not only takes the highest estimate, he also uses a number projected into the future and makes it sound like that's what is being spent today. On balance, we rate Perry’s statement Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F6BC0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/07/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-taxpayers-spend-half-trillion-doll/

Workplace homicides more likely where guns allowed, anti-gun violence group says
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s support of concealed carry gave his critics, some of whom want to recall him from office in 2012, another reason to slam him.

On Oct. 30, 2011, two days before the concealed carrying of guns and other weapons became legal in Wisconsin, one visitor to a Facebook site that bashes Walker took a shot at the Republican governor and the law. She posted this statement from the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort Educational Fund:

""People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it.""

Concealed carry has drawn high interest from gun owners -- more than 80,000 application forms for permits were downloaded by 9 a.m. on the first day the law took effect -- and from people who fear more gun carrying will lead to more violence. So we decided to check WAVE’s statement.

In becoming the 49th state to legalize concealed carry, Wisconsin generally allows people age 21 and over to carry hidden handguns, stun guns, most knives and other weapons. But there are restrictions, including some that apply to workplaces.

Owners and occupants of property can prohibit concealed carry on or in the property. And employers can prohibit employees from carrying concealed weapons while on the job.

WAVE, which describes itself as the ""only statewide grassroots organization solely dedicated to reducing gun violence, injuries and deaths,"" has been pushing businesses to post signs prohibiting concealed carry on their premises. It has made the claim that people are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms to tens of thousands of people through its website, emails and direct mail, said executive director Jeri Bonavia.

The claim, she said, is based on a May 2005 article in the American Journal of Public Health, which publishes peer-reviewed scientific research.

The article was written by researchers from the University of North Carolina’s Department of Epidemiology and Injury Prevention Research Center. We also found an earlier article on the same study, which appeared in another research publication, the American Journal of Epidemiology.

The researchers examined 152 homicides that occurred in 143 workplaces in North Carolina from January 1994 through March 1998. They concluded that workplaces where guns were permitted ""were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a worker homicide relative to those where all weapons were prohibited.""

So, the researchers said workplaces that allowed guns were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a homicide. In contrast, WAVE said people are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms.

We asked Stephen Marshall, one of the researchers, whether WAVE’s wording was an accurate expression of what his study found; he simply reiterated the phrasing used in the study.

We put the same question to other researchers; some said they thought WAVE’s statement was an essentially accurate expression of what the study found, while others thought WAVE’s wording was problematic.

But there’s a more important question in terms of whether WAVE’s claim is accurate: Does the study’s major finding -- North Carolina workplaces that allowed guns were much more likely to be the site of a homicide -- apply to other states, including Wisconsin?

Marshall said one could not assume that the five-to-seven-times statistic from his study would be true for Wisconsin or any other place.

Other experts, however, gave a range of answers on whether the finding of the North Carolina study is applicable to Wisconsin workplaces.

Applicability unknown: Susan Gerberich, co-director of the Regional Injury Prevention Center at the University of Minnesota, said that because the study was limited to North Carolina, it is not known whether the increased risk of workplace homicide would be true in other places.

Corinne Peek-Assa, director of the University of Iowa Injury Prevention Research Center, said ""generalizing epidemiologic studies is never simple.""

And Mary Vriniotis, research specialist with the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, said: ""This study provides good evidence that workplaces allowing firearms increase the risk of workplace homicide,"" but ""it's hard to say whether the findings in Wisconsin would be the same.""

Applicability possible: Epidemiology professor Sabrina Walsh of the University of Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center said it is possible the higher workplace homicide risk found in North Carolina would be true in other states.

And Stephen Hargarten, director of the Medical College of Wisconsin Injury Research Center, said the North Carolina study should be cause for concern in Wisconsin that workplace homicides would occur more often in workplaces that allow guns than in those that don’t.

Applicability likely: Daniel Webster, co-director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research, said that although the five-to-seven times statistic found in the North Carolina wouldn’t automatically apply to other states, ""I don’t have any reason to think you’d have radically different findings"" if the North Carolina study were replicated in Wisconsin.

All the researchers said they were not aware of any other study like the one done in North Carolina.

Our conclusion

Citing a university study, the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort said: ""People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it.""

Some experts faulted WAVE -- though others didn’t -- for using different wording than the study itself, which said North Carolina workplaces that allowed guns were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a homicide.

Some experts said they could not conclude from the North Carolina study whether the higher likelihood of workplace homicide would be true in other places like Wisconsin. But other experts said the North Carolina study was proof that the workplace homicide rate in Wisconsin likely would be at least somewhat higher in workplaces that allow guns compared to workplaces that don’t.

In sum, WAVE’s statement is generally accurate, but leaves out important details, such as that the study applied only to North Carolina.

That’s our definition for Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C61E40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/07/wisconsin-anti-violence-effort-educational-fund/workplace-homicides-more-likely-where-guns-allowed/
"['New Jersey', 'Candidate Biography', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Carl Lewis']","
Olympic medalist Carl Lewis calls out state senator for taking away health care from residents
","
A prolonged legal battle kicked him off the ballot in Tuesday’s election, but former Democratic State Senate candidate Carl Lewis has taken aim at a Republican incumbent who ""took"" away health care from the public.

At a recent appearance in Willingboro, Burlington County, the nine-time Olympic gold medalist accused state Sen. Diane Allen (R-Burlington) of receiving taxpayer-funded health care, but stripping away coverage from her constituents. Allen is seeking reelection Tuesday against Democratic challenger Gail Cook.

""Your senator right now is dancing across the stage, just had...a cancer scare and you know what, guess what? Every single person in this room is paying for her health care. Did you know that? But she took yours,"" Lewis told the crowd.

Soon afterwards, Lewis added: ""So you’re paying for…her health care, and she took yours away.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Lewis is exaggerating Allen’s impact on health care in Burlington County.

Allen does receive state health benefits and, in July, she abstained from restoring $7.5 million in state funding for family planning services. But that cut only impacted a limited number of Burlington County residents and, across the state, many affected New Jerseyans have been able to receive services from other health centers.

Lewis spokesman Chris Walker confirmed the claim was in reference to the $7.5 million, and said Lewis would speak to us. But we never heard back.

First, let’s explain Allen’s health care coverage.

Allen is receiving health coverage for herself and her husband through the State Health Benefits Program, according to Bill Quinn, a state Treasury Department spokesman. Still, like other state employees, Allen must pay a percentage of her premium costs.

Now, let’s talk about whether Allen ""took"" away health care from Burlington County residents.

Nearly a year after Gov. Chris Christie eliminated $7.5 million for family planning services, the Democrat-controlled Legislature tried this past summer to restore the funding. Christie vetoed that spending, and the Democrats failed in July to get enough votes to override his veto.

Allen abstained from that vote -- counting her as a no -- but even if she voted yes, the Senate still would have been one vote shy of restoring the funding.

The funding cut made last year led to the closure of six of the state’s family planning centers, including two clinics in Burlington County. 
But according to county spokesman Ralph Shrom, those two locations served a combined total of about 1,500 patients in 2010. That’s less than 5 percent of the population of Willingboro, where Lewis made his remarks.

The patients formerly served at those clinics are referred to two federally qualified health centers in the county, Shrom said in an email. Shrom said: ""Those close to this situation would say it did leave people without care, and there are probably individuals who did not follow up on the referral or may have found the alternatives inconvenient.""

Shrom added, ""On the other side of the equation, those who did follow the referral advice now have a ‘medical home’ -- that is, they are now going to a clinic that can attend to all the health care needs of themselves and their families and seeing a doctor who can keep continuing records.""

Katherine Grant-Davis, president and CEO of the New Jersey Primary Care Association, which represents the federally qualified centers, said that in many cases across the state, former family planning patients have turned to the federally qualified centers.

""We are the safety net,"" Grant-Davis told us.

Allen said she would have liked the $7.5 million to remain in the state budget, but she abstained from the override vote because the state couldn’t afford it. The senator noted how she has been honored by different health organizations.

""I’ve worked very hard on making sure health care’s available for everybody,"" Allen said.

Our ruling

At a recent rally in Willingboro, Lewis accused Allen of receiving taxpayer-funded health care, while taking health care away from the public. Allen receives state health benefits, and she must contribute toward her premium costs.

But Lewis’ larger claim about her taking away health care is off base. The governor eliminated the funding for family planning services and a yes-vote from Allen wouldn’t have changed that.

Also, the funding cut has affected a fraction of her constituents and similar services are being offered at other health centers. We rate the statement Mostly False.
