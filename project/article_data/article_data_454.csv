Mitt Romney ad targets Obama auto bailouts for dealership closures
","
Some things are so implicit there’s no need to elaborate. Darkness follows sunset. Children like ice cream. The 2009 auto bailout was better for some people than for others. 

What is missing from that last statement is blame, but the campaign of Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has made that implicit as well as explicit thanks to speeches, op-eds and interviews. 

It was President Barack Obama’s fault, says Romney, that the government brokered a bailout and bankruptcy plan for General Motors and Chrysler that had the government picking winners and losers. The government should have stayed out, Romney says.

Which brings us to an Ohio-specific television commercial the Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee put on the air Wednesday. The short ad features Al Zarzour, a 61-year-old man from Lyndhurst who has spent decades in the auto industry. 

The ad doesn’t get this specific, but we know from coverage by The Plain Dealer and a telephone interview with Zarzour (who now is general manager of a Mitsubishi dealership) that he owned a Nissan dealership in Willoughby, sold it in 2006 and bought a Chevrolet dealership in Chardon. Both communities are in Greater Cleveland. What Zarzour says in the ad is, ""Grew up here in Lyndhurst (another suburban community), started 1972, selling cars.""

Then an announcer says: ""In 2009, under the Obama administration’s bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close.""

PolitiFact Ohio took a look a that claim.

Zarzour explains in the commercial that General Motors suspended his credit line, and how ""we had 30-some employees that were out of work. My wife and I were the last ones there. It was like the dream that we worked for, and that we worked so hard for, was gone.""

The ad’s message? 

It’s not exactly stated. But it is implicit: People like Zarzour, his family and his employees were harmed by the Obama auto bailout.

The bailout set the terms through which GM and Chrysler were to restructure. According to a White House fact sheet issued at the time, ""There are some dealers that GM has identified that will not continue with GM. It is expected that the terminated dealers will be offered an agreement to orderly wind down their operations over the next 18 months."" 

Kristen Dziczek, of the nonpartisan Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, says she recalls that there was a general agreement to cut the dealer base as part of White House-automaker discussions, but she doesn’t recall seeing official documents directing the extent of the cuts. But Alan Spitzer, a prominent Cleveland car dealer who helped lead the movement to save dealerships across the country, told us that GM and Chrysler had discussed closures in an earlier proposal to the Obama administration ""and the White House pushed them to be more aggressive.""

The White House told PolitiFact Ohio that the specific decisions on those cuts came from the auto makers themselves and that it merely noted that the U.S. auto makers had substantially more dealers (on a per capita or sale basis) than their foreign competitors. Yet a special audit in mid-2010 by a federal inspector general for the bailout program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, noted exactly what Spitzer said: The auto companies already planned to cut dealerships, but the White House’s auto team believed the pace would be insufficient and told GM to accelerate dealer closings. 
Many authorities say the auto bailout, however painful, was necessary. 

Obama’s auto team believed that when it came to dealers specifically, under-performers created a drag on GM’s brand and hurt the prospects of stronger dealers, who could boost the company’s incremental sales. It’s important to know that when GM first presented its plan to the White House , it proposed getting rid of 1,650 dealerships by 2014, itself a continuation of dealer ""right-sizing"" that had been occurring since 1970. About 30 percent of the cuts would come from phasing out the Saturn, Saab and Hummer brands. 

But with the White House’s prompting, GM stepped up the closure dates to the end of 2010 -- while dropping the number of planned dealership terminations to 1,454. It cut the number but stepped up the pace, a fact that has been overlooked by many critics.

Obama’s action ""saved nearly a million jobs,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday. Others have used a slightly higher figure.

Obama campaign spokesman Frank Benenati said in an email that there are now 2,200 more people employed in Ohio auto dealerships than when Obama entered office.

The Center for Automotive Research said in a 2010 report that the government-backed bankruptcy appeared to save 1.14 million jobs. But according to the special inspector general’s report, also in 2010, the Center for Automotive Research was critical of the closing of rural dealerships. It believed a customer would not drive 80 miles to another dealership to buy a Cadillac; the customer would find a closer store and buy a different car.

Whether the non-government bankruptcy solution proposed by Romney, and supported by many other Republicans, would have worked cannot be known, because the Obama auto rescue went forward.

Yet in a literal sense, the Romney ad’s statement is true. The Obama administration agreed to to provide loans to General Motors if GM, on the brink of failure, would restructure through bankruptcy. Part of the plan was for General Motors and Chrysler to downsize, at least temporarily, reduce their liabilities and change their way of doing business. Bankruptcy allowed GM to bypass state courts that could have made it harder to shed franchise agreements. 

The White House auto team pressed GM to act more quickly than it planned earlier, raising a possibility offered by the inspector general’s office: the number and speed of the terminations might not have been critical to GM’s viability. Yet even before the White House pressed it, GM was planning to cut dealership franchises.

The Greater Cleveland Automobile Dealers’ Association told us that in the 19-county area of Northeast Ohio alone, 18 GM dealers and 12 Chrysler dealers closed. Even dealerships that were profitable had to close so GM could reconfigure its sales markets.

Zarzour did not fight his dealership’s closing. ""With the bankruptcy that went down, it didn’t seem like a good decision to stay there and fight it,"" he said when we contacted him. His equipment was sold at auction and he accepted a settlement with GM, the specifics of which he did not wish to discuss. ""It wasn’t drastic,"" he said. 

The worst thing, he said, was having to put people out of work, watch the community lose a business that supported its schools and sports teams, and see his hopes of passing the business to his sons disappear.

We asked Lou Vitantonio, president of the Greater Cleveland Automobile Dealers’ Association, if the closings were necessary. ""Looking back, I don’t know if there’s a right or wrong decision,"" he said. ""But this is where were at at this point: We lost 30 dealerships in our region.""

Yet if GM and Chrysler had closed even more factories because of financial failure, another 50 dealerships might be out of business today, he said. 

We also asked Zarzour.

""That’s difficult for me to answer,"" he said. But he added, ""I don’t think it was done properly.""

So, back to the ad’s specific claim: ""In 2009, under the Obama administration’s bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close.""

""There’s no doubt"" that is an accurate statement, said Dino DiSanto, chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette, a Republican from Greater Cleveland who authored successful legislation allowing dealers to challenge their closings through arbitration. The full extent of those appeals are not yet known.

PolitiFact evaluates political claims on words that are stated, but it also considers the context in which the words are uttered. Otherwise, you would have ads like, well, like this one, all of them entirely true. 

It is true that auto dealerships in Ohio closed as part of the bailout of General Motors. But the clear implication of the statement is that those closures were solely a result of the bailouts and  might not have otherwise occurred. 

The statement on its surface is accurate, but that implication is not.

While it is impossible to say which dealerships might have closed and which might have survived, General Motors was already working on a closure plan. In fact, even before the White House auto team asked it to be more aggressive, it submitted plans to shutter 1,650 dealers by the end of 2014. As for the government’s involvement, including loans, GM said it did not have a lot of other options so it stepped up the pace.

In U.S. bankruptcy court filings, GM said it tried to find private investors but failed because lenders were not willing to take a risk on a damaged automaker amid a financial meltdown. Without funding, the company might have been forced to liquidate, selling off all its factories and equipment. 

That’s information that puts the claim into context.

When a statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important information needed to put the claim in context, it gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF54040>],/factchecks/2012/aug/02/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-ad-targets-obama-auto-bailouts-dealers/
"['Rhode Island', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Michael Riley']","
R.I. congressional candidate Michael Riley says the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the cost of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has doubled
","
Cost is one of the key objections critics raise when the topic is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

The issue came up July 26 during a debate on the public access program State of the State among Republican candidates for Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District seat. (It will begin airing Aug. 4.)

""I have a problem with almost every aspect of (Obamacare),"" said one of the candidates, Michael Riley. He said it would create too many new agencies and ""we also have skyrocketing health-care costs, even in the first two years of implementation. The CBO has already doubled its estimate for the cost (of Obamacare) so far, from roughly $800 billion to $1.7 trillion.""

The CBO is the Congressional Budget Office, the widely respected nonpartisan agency that generates estimates and reports about the effect that proposed laws will likely have on the federal budget.

We asked Riley’s campaign for his backup and, while we waited for their response, began our own research.

PolitiFact has checked similar claims and found them, to be kind, less than factual.

The CBO's initial estimate on March 2010 was that the gross cost from 2012 to 2019 would be $931 billion.

Its newer estimate from March 2012 put the gross cost at $1,762 billion, which is where the complaints about doubling originated. But that was for a different time frame -- from 2012 to 2022.

PolitiFact National found that if you compare the CBO figures for 2012-2019, a period covered by both reports, the estimate of the gross cost hadn't doubled, as Riley claimed. It had risen 8.6 percent, from $931 billion to $1.01 trillion.

The $1.7 trillion figure was so widely misused, the CBO issued a statement saying that its estimates had not shifted significantly. ""The projections for each given year have changed little, on net, since March 2010,"" the statement said.

But wait, as they say in the commercials, there's more.

The $1.7 trillion estimate doesn't include money saved from spending cuts, revenue from new taxes on the wealthy, penalties paid by individuals and workers who decide not to buy insurance, and other cost-saving measures included in the law.

When the CBO took all of that into account, which it did in a 2010 report, it concluded that the health-care law would actually save money, lowering the deficit by about $132 billion between 2012-2019.

In a 2011 update, it found that the projected deficit reduction had slipped to $119 billion, but it was still a net savings.

In July, before Riley made his statement, the CBO updated some of its estimates in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold most of the 2010 law. The CBO said the cost would be lower still, although the new projected savings would come from the fact that several states have vowed not to expand the eligibility requirements for Medicaid to help more uninsured people, invoking an exemption opened up by the Supreme Court ruling.

At the same time, the CBO estimated that if the Affordable Care Act were to be repealed, that would add $109 billion to federal budget deficits from 2013 to 2022.

Riley responded to our question by sending us a handful of links, most of them editorials from the conservative Washington Examiner that compared estimates from different time frames or disputed Obamacare supporters who say the cost estimates haven’t doubled. None mention the CBO's statement saying that the cost estimates have not changed appreciably over time.

Our ruling

Congressional candidate Michael Riley said the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the cost of Obamacare has doubled.

The CBO itself says that's not true and that its estimates, on a year-by-year basis, have not changed significantly.

Furthermore, the numbers cited by Riley are misleading because they represent only the gross costs of the health care law, not any savings. According to the CBO, the savings will actually reduce the deficit, although that estimate hasn’t been updated in two years.

Information debunking similar claims has been available for the last four months here, here, here and, most recently, here.

We rate his claim False.

Do Olympic medalists owe up to $9,000 to the IRS?
","With Americans paying close attention to the London Olympics, two leading figures in the conservative movement -- Grover Norquist and Marco Rubio -- have launched an effort to lighten the tax burden for athletes who win medals.

A July 31, 2012, blog post on the website of Norquist’s group, Americans for Tax Reform, had the headline, ""Win Olympic Gold, Pay the IRS: U.S. Olympic medal winners will owe up to $9,000 to the IRS.""

The ATR blog post continued, ""American medalists face a top income tax rate of 35 percent,"" ATR wrote. ""Under U.S. tax law, they must add the value of their Olympic medals and prizes to their taxable income. … At today’s commodity prices, the value of a gold medal is about $675. A silver medal is worth about $385 while a bronze medal is worth under $5. There are also cash prizes that accompany each medal: $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze."" These prizes are given by the U.S. Olympic Committee.

ATR went on to offer calculations of what medal winners might owe the IRS, using that 35 percent tax rate. A gold-medal winner would owe $8,986, while a silver-medal winner would owe $5,385 and a bronze winner would owe $3,502.

These calculations were widely noted in the blogosphere. The following day, Aug. 1, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., introduced the Olympic Tax Elimination Act, which would ""exempt U.S. Olympic medal winners from paying taxes on their hard-earned medals.""

Rubio’s news release said the U.S. tax code ""is a complicated and burdensome mess that too often punishes success, and the tax imposed on Olympic medal winners is a classic example of this madness. Athletes representing our nation overseas in the Olympics shouldn’t have to worry about an extra tax bill waiting for them back home."" (A new Olympics tax exemption might make the tax code more complicated, but we digress.)

After a reader notified us of this developing issue, we decided to fact-check ATR’s specific claim that ""U.S. Olympic medal winners will owe up to $9,000 to the IRS.""

We checked with accountants who specialize in representing athletes and they agreed that the bonus would almost certainly be taxable. Our experts diverged somewhat over whether and how the medal would be treated for tax purposes, but we’ll assume for the purposes of our analysis that it is subject to taxation.

We will also note that ATR said ""winners will owe up to $9,000"" -- a phrase that gives the group leeway for its estimates.

Still, the experts we spoke to suggested that a $9,000 tax payment was unrealistically high. For most athletes, the payment will be less, and possibly quite a bit less. Here’s why:

Business expenses

An athlete who wins a medal bonus would be free to deduct any unreimbursed expenses from the bonus, lowering -- or maybe even eliminating -- their tax hit. In fact, accountants say an athlete would be crazy not to.

""Anything used for the production of income is deductible,"" said Brad Bell, a partner with BGBC Partners LLP in Indianapolis who specializes in accounting for athletes.

Greg Shafer, an accountant in Colorado Springs, Colo., added that ""if they were my client and had to pay that kind of tax, I would say, ‘Well, what are your ordinary and necessary expenses?’ That could be travel, uniforms, cell phone use."" The U.S. Olympic Committee is based in Colorado Springs, and Shafer said he has provided accounting services to athletes. So expenses for gymnasts might include tumbling classes, payments to coaches and travel costs to international meets. Cyclists would pay for new bikes and maintenance. An Olympian fencer told Forbes.com that her expenses for equipment and competitions run around $20,000 per year.

Not every athlete earns as much as Michael Phelps

The way the U.S. tax system is constructed, income is taxed at higher rates the higher your income goes. So the full 35 percent rate (known as the marginal rate) only kicks in on income earned after you pass a threshold of about $380,000. Below that level, income is taxed at lower tax rates. So even someone earning well into the six figures will likely see an overall (or ""effective"") tax rate quite a bit lower than 35 percent -- even before you take into account exemptions and deductions. When we contacted ATR, Ryan Ellis, the group’s tax policy director, defended the calculations. He said that when you’re isolating a specific element of someone’s income, it’s actually more appropriate to use marginal tax rates rather than effective tax rates, because in the calculation, the medal is the essentially the last piece of income being considered, and thus gets taxed at the highest marginal income rate.

He added that while athletes may scrape by in low tax brackets in non-Olympic years, the Olympic year is the one in which they would have a reasonable shot of getting into a higher tax bracket -- if not 35 percent, then perhaps 33 percent or 28 percent, a rate that would still produce a high tax bill.

Still, while some world-class athletes come into the Olympics as international superstars with lucrative endorsement deals, many athletes earn less. Though the data is incomplete, we did find one study conducted by the Track & Field Athletes Association that found that about half of track and field athletes who ranked in the top 10 in the U.S. in their event made less than $15,000 annually from the sport in sponsorship, grants and prize money. About 20 percent of such athletes made more than $50,000 annually. And beyond marquee athletes such as sprinters, milers and distance runners it's toughest of all, the study found.

There’s anecdotal evidence as well. Marathoner Brian Sell, who made the 2008 U.S. Olympic team, told CNNMoney that it took years of struggle, including three years earning less than $25,000, before he made significant money from running. ""It's a small percentage of people who make a real living in this sport,"" he told CNNMoney. ""And if you didn't run well, you didn't get paid.""

An athlete earning the same $25,000 a year that Sell earned for three straight years would pay about 15 percent on gold medal winnings. That would be $3,851 -- before accounting for any allowable expenses.

We should also note that there is nothing special or ""extra"" about the taxes levied on income derived from Olympic victories. They are the same taxes laid on any kind of income, whether that’s from wages or lottery winnings.

Our ruling

Americans for Tax Reform is correct that gold medalists’ winnings are taxable, and it provides some leeway by saying that U.S. winners could be taxed up to $9,000.

Still, it’s not likely that anyone would pay that much per medal in taxes -- even if the winner was fortunate enough to have annual income well over $380,000 and refused to deduct any business expenses on their winnings. Any accountant worth their salt should be able to get the rate of tax on medal winnings much below $9,000, and maybe even to zero. We rate the statement Mostly False.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Taxes', 'Bill Clinton']","
It's typical for presidential candidates to release 10 or 11 years of returns, Clinton says
","
President Barack Obama’s campaign intends to keep the pressure on Mitt Romney to release more of his tax returns. The campaign released a Web ad Wednesday hammering that point and asking, ""When will he release his tax returns?""

Romney has provided his 2010 return and his preliminary return for 2011. He said he will release the final version for 2011, but no additional years.

Former President Bill Clinton said the usual standard is much higher. ""You know, it's typical, I think, that we all release 10, 11 years,"" Clinton said on NBC’s Today Show on July 13. ""I think Sen. McCain released over 20 years of tax returns."" The Obama campaign recently announced that Clinton would be given a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention.

We wanted to examine if the former president has it right. Is it customary to reveal a decade of tax returns?

The high-water mark for disclosure was set by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., in the 1996 election. He released 30 years of tax returns. Second place honors go to Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., for providing 20 years worth when he ran in 2004, although he had released 15 of those returns before he launched his presidential bid. (Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, had considerable wealth and released only a portion of her 2003 taxes.)

After that, there is a tie between Romney’s father, George Romney, in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992. Both men released 12 years of tax returns. Close on their heels is Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., with 10 when he was Kerry’s running mate.

Several candidates released anywhere from six to nine years of returns. In 2000, George W. Bush provided nine and Al Gore eight. In the 2008 primary, then Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., delivered seven, a move that was matched by Hillary Clinton about a month later. In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis released six years of returns.

There is a difference for incumbents and challengers. Ever since 1976, when Jimmy Carter became president, sitting presidents and vice presidents have released their taxes each year they are in office. By the time re-election rolls around, they have put at least four tax returns into the public record. Challengers generally match or exceed that.

Our colleagues at Factcheck.org looked at this and found that since 1980, only two general election candidates have revealed just two years of tax returns. One was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 2008 and the other is Mitt Romney (at least so far during this campaign).

For the record, in 1980, Ronald Reagan offered up just one return.

We should note here that Clinton was way off when he said McCain released 20 years of returns; McCain only released two. Similarly, Romney has said that Kerry released only two years of returns when Kerry had released many more than that.

But again, our fact-check here is intended to gauge what’s ""typical"" for presidential candidates. As our tally above indicates, though, there's a lot of variation in how many tax returns candidates released. Mathematically speaking, our tally shows the median number of tax returns released to be seven and a half. But individual candidates released anywhere from 30 to one.

Providing tax returns is often a campaign strategy, although whether disclosure becomes a significant issue will vary. In 2008, Obama wanted to put pressure on his primary rival, Hillary Clinton. To some extent it worked, because Clinton then had to explain why she and her husband were so wealthy. Romney’s father had something of the same idea when he revealed a dozen tax returns.

Our ruling

Clinton said most candidates release about 10 years of tax returns. That's more than the two years of returns Romney has released. 
Clinton is exaggerating a bit when he puts the ""typical"" number at 10. Over the decades, we found candidates released anywhere from 30 years of tax returns to one year. A majority of the recent candidates we surveyed did not in fact release a full 10 years of tax returns. 
On the other hand, a majority of recent candidates did release far more than two years of tax returns. So Romney lags behind most of the pack. 
Clinton’s statement is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9D6340>],/factchecks/2012/aug/01/bill-clinton/its-typical-presidential-candidates-release-10-or-/
"['Debt', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Florida', 'Crossroads GPS']","
Crossroads GPS pins $4 billion a day debt on Obama
","
Set to sorrowful music, a new ad from Crossroads GPS reels off a bunch of depressing claims about the economy.

Here’s part of the script:

""It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Over three years with crushing unemployment. American manufacturing shrinking again. President (Barack) Obama’s plan: Spend more. He’s added $4 billion in debt every day. The economy is slowing but our debt keeps growing. Tell him for real job growth cut the debt.""

Crossroads GPS is a conservative advocacy group; its ad has aired in Florida and other swing states.

That $4 billion in debt a day figure sounds pretty massive. We wanted to check if it was that high and if Obama is to blame.

A spokesman for Crossroads GPS pointed us to the total debt figure as of July 5 -- about a week before the ad launched -- so we will use that date as our starting point.

There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $11 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.8 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, and other funds and accounts.

To see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two dates.
On Jan. 20, 2009 -- the day Obama was sworn in as president -- the total debt was about $10.6 trillion and rose to about $15.9 trillion by July 5. The amount of time between those two dates was 1,262 days. That works out to about $4.16 billion a day.

We agree with the math. But is Obama solely to blame here?

Measuring blame

We contacted a few experts on the federal budget: Jason Peuquet of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan public policy think-tank; J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation, Gary Burtless of the centrist Brookings Institution and Joshua Gordon of the Concord Coalition which advocates reducing the debt.

No one placed the blame entirely on Obama.

The rising debt stems from several factors, including the 2009 stimulus and expansions of TARP, and the economic downturn that led to falling employment and wages and more spending on programs linked to poverty and unemployment, Peuquet said.

""Blame for the economic downturn can go toward many people, political parties, institutions, lenders, borrowers, and economic uncontrollables, etc. And it’s not just the president who was responsible for the legislative initiatives either – he had to work with Congress on those,"" Peuquet told PolitiFact.

Both parties share in the blame for the debt that is set to rise down the road as result of enacting expansions in entitlement programs and tax cuts, and for failing to reach an agreement on how to control rising debt.

The economic downturn explains most of the new debt and that began before Obama took office, Gordon said. The tax cuts that have lowered revenue and increased deficits over the last three years have had bipartisan support, as have nearly every spending bill over the last two years.

""So, it is impossible to attribute the debt to any single politician or party,"" Gordon told PolitiFact. ""Furthermore, the increase in debt tells you nothing about what legislative proposals by the candidates would do in the future -- and it is the future debt growth that matters most.""

Burtless said that most of the debt added under Obama would have happened even if he followed the tax and spending policies in effect when he took office. But Obama embraced policies that increased the public debt -- including signing the stimulus package and agreeing to other measures that held down taxes and increased unemployment benefits.

""However, I believe the overwhelming share of extra public debt accumulated since Jan. 2009 would also have been accumulated even if none of those new policies had been proposed or adopted,"" Burtless said. ""The reason is straightforward. The Bush administration was committed to a certain level of spending (for defense, non-defense discretionary, and mandatory non-defense programs) and to a particular schedule of income and payroll taxes. Those policies, if maintained by President Obama, would have produced sizeable annual deficits – deficits nearly as large as the ones we actually saw.""

But Obama is not off the hook here.

""Was not deficit spending the core feature of his economic stimulus plan? Has he objected to it in any way? Has he proposed changes in fiscal policy that would have materially altered the course? Each answer is obvious, and each leads to the same conclusion -- it is perfectly fair to argue that Obama is responsible for this debt increase,"" Foster told PolitiFact. ""Did he sign every bill that produced the debt? Of course not. But is it entirely consistent with his policy.""

Our ruling 
Crossroads GPS has its math correct what it says that Obama has ""added $4 billion in debt every day."" But the ad suggests that Obama is solely to blame. That’s not true, because other factors -- including the struggling economy he inherited and decisions made before he took office -- contributed to that debt.

Julián Castro says Milken Institute named San Antonio nation’s top-performing local economy
","
Second-term San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro did not shy from celebrating his hometown during his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention. 
Addressing the delegates assembled in Charlotte, N.C., Castro said that San Antonio residents recognize the value of investing in pre-Kindergarten and student college loans. ""We're investing in young minds today to be competitive in the global economy tomorow,"" Castro said. ""And it's paying off. Last year the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation's top-performing local economy."" 
Castro made the same claim in his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we’ve previously dipped into twice -- Julián Castro said his city’s investments in infrastructure and education paid off ""late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute.""

Indeed, we confirmed, San Antonio topped Milken’s 2011 list of the nation’s best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the 2007-09 recession.

The economic think tank’s annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for ""more than a decade,"" was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, Texas Tribune news story as ""a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs.""

Milken’s 2011 report on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there. Some measures are weighed across five-year spans, to flatten out extreme swings, and the most recent year, ""to capture recent momentum."" 
  
In recent years, the Tribune said, ""companies have flocked to San Antonio, making it an economic center rivaling Houston and Dallas."" In contrast to those cities, though, ""San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry.""

The Tribune story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain.

The San Antonio Express-News credited the city’s rise to reasons ""including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care"" in a Dec. 16, 2011, news story.

Texas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken’s 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth. Back in 2008, Austin was Texas’ only top-five city, but the state claimed most of those slots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The other chart-toppers for 2011 were No. 2, El Paso; No. 3, Fort Collins/Loveland, Colo.; and No. 5, Killeen/Temple/Fort Hood.

Texas’ rise in the ranks, the Express-News wrote, came partly because of downturns in other parts of the country. The story quoted research economist James Gaines of Texas A&M University’s Real Estate Center: ""Our growth rate and advancement isn't all that wonderful. We've managed to stay flat or have very small positives. But because everybody has so many negatives, we look so much better.""

A Philadelphia Inquirer columnist interviewed Milken’s chief research officer, Ross DeVol, and wrote Dec. 16, 2011 that ""Technology and energy explain why nine Texas cities placed in the top 25 of the 2011 Milken ranking.""

San Antonio hasn’t just been holding steady in the economic downturn; it’s been gaining ground, even compared to other Texas cities. Castro’s statement rates True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBA9EC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-milken-institute-named-san-anto/

DCCC claims Chinese prostitution money funding DesJarlais campaign
","
Fourth District Congressman Scott DesJarlais, a Jasper Republican who is expected to face Democratic state Sen. Eric Stewart on the November ballot, is already on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's target list in emailed press releases – many of them similar to criticism aimed at other Republican lawmakers elsewhere in the nation.

Perhaps the most striking recent example is a missive earlier this summer that seeks to link DesJarlais' campaign financing to Chinese prostitution money. Says the opening paragraph: ""Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Scott DesJarlais's (TN-04) Republican Majority.""

Almost identical news releases – except for the names – were used by the DCCC against Republican U.S. Reps. Jim Renacci in Ohio and Sean Duffy in Wisconsin. Our Politifact colleagues in Ohio and Wisconsin have sized up the DCCC claims and given them a ""Pants On Fire"" rating.

A Tennessee echo is in order.

The DCCC contention rests on billionaire casino operator Sheldon Adelson, who has given a lot of money to Republican campaign funds that are supporting DesJarlais and other GOP congressmen. Adelson, meanwhile, is facing a lawsuit from a former employee that includes allegations that Adelson approved of prostitution at a casino in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that is now part of China.

The DCCC release cites media reports on the lawsuit contentions and a comment by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that Adelson is ""injecting millions of dollars in Chinese 'foreign money' "" by contributing to Republican campaigns.

""What will Congressman Scott DesJarlais do when his Chinese prostitution money comes from billionaire Sheldon Adelson?"" said Jesse Ferguson of DCCC in the release. ""House Republicans like Congressman DesJarlais are fighting tirelessly to protect billionaires like Sheldon Adelson who make fortunes overseas and Adelson is now the largest single donor to Congressman DesJarlais's Republican Majority. It's past time for Congressman DesJarlais to reject the support of these groups funded by foreign money from a Chinese prostitution strategy.""

Here's what Politifact Ohio reported on the matter: ""The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn’t spent anything so far.

""Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle.

""A spokesman for the Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always ‘maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson’s character.’""

In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, Adelson said there’s not a ""shred of evidence"" to back his former employee’s charges, and ""says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the … claims even more preposterous."" Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.

Basically, then, the charge by a disgruntled former employee is adamantly denied by Adelson.
DCCC has nonetheless seized upon the questionable claim, extrapolated and exaggerated it to taint all of Adelson's political donations with prostitution earnings. If stopped there, perhaps this could arguably fall into the realm of standard political hyperbole.

But to carry that on down a convoluted line to Scott DesJarlais and talk about ""his Chinese prostitution money?""

Yep, that sounds like Pants On Fire to us, too.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA023C0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/01/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/desjarlais-taking-money-linked-chinese-prostitutio/

Club for Growth says Hovde has ‘no problem with raising taxes’
","
Trying to boost Republican Mark Neumann’s bid for U.S. Senate, a national conservative group is blasting away at Neumann rivals Tommy Thompson and Eric Hovde.

The message: Both are big taxers.

The national Club for Growth, which has endorsed Neumann, uses a widely aired TV ad to highlight nine instances of tax increases during Tommy Thompson’s 14 years as Wisconsin governor -- years marked, as we found in rating a Thompson claim Mostly True, by a decline in the overall tax burden.

The group had a much smaller record to comb through on Hovde, a banker and investment-fund manager and first-time candidate.

""In a national TV interview, Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes,"" the ad says. ""And Hovde supported tax-raising Gov. Jim Doyle. On taxes, Hovde’s like Thompson, only worse.""

The ad shows a smiling Hovde at the start of a 2009 TV appearance as a financial pundit on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box"" beneath the words: ""No Problem Raising Taxes.""

Hovde fired back with his own TV spot that calls the Neumann (actually Club for Growth’s) tax accusation ""false."" (The campaign acknowledges  Hovde gave $500 to Democrat Doyle’s re-election campaign in 2005. It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.)

So, did Hovde’s remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes?

We watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable show’s hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the group’s ad.

The background

Hovde’s March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama.  

Hovde said the country was in a ""depression,"" Obama’s stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into ""quasi-Socialist"" territory.

At the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice reported in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration.

Unprompted, he began: ""Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. I’ve been blessed in my life and I’ve been very fortunate. But some of the things that they’ve done are just insane.""

Then he referred to an Obama 2009 proposal to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000.

""Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I don’t need it, but a lot of other people do."" Hovde said. ""We’re in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?""

So, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had ""no problem with raising taxes."" He actually said: ""I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes.""

That’s a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession.

The timing is also important.

In 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected.

An candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother.

It’s also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts?

When asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovde’s personal tax bill to rise.

As a candidate in 2012, Hovde told Bice he was not referring to Obama’s so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race).

Hovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on ""carried interest"" -- the portion of a fund’s investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists.

In an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year.

But let’s look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012.

Hovde has pledged to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax.

So Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in people’s tax bills.

That leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue.

Hovde says he would vote to eliminate ""nearly all"" of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated.

And he told us he still favors eliminating the ""carried interest"" tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole.

Hovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions.

He told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates.

He said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed.

But does that constitute a tax increase?

Even conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reform’s widely publicized ""taxpayer protection pledge"" frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not.  A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has criticized the group’s pledge as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code.

PolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a Mitt Romney claim that Obama ""has raised taxes 19 times.""

Views differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases.

Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us it’s case by case -- some of these ""tax preferences"" are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise.

Given Hovde’s pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the ""carried interest"" provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group.

Our conclusion

The national Club for Growth used Hovde’s own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes.

Hovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. There’s no other way to read it.

But the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted.

In the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesn’t square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having ""no problem raising taxes.""

The Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression.

We think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim. Mostly False.

U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez claims there are no federal limits on the purchase of guns and ammunition
","
In the days following a mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez and some of his fellow Democrats called for strengthening the nation’s gun control laws.

At a July 24 news conference in Washington, D.C., Menendez pointed out how, under federal law, ""we do not have any limitation on the number of guns and bullets we can buy.""

PolitiFact New Jersey is not weighing in on whether there should be such federal restrictions. We are only fact-checking Menendez’s claim that none exist. 
We found that the senator's right that there is no federal law limiting the number of guns and bullets one can purchase at a given time. Three states, including New Jersey, have enacted their own restrictions on handgun sales. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and gun policy experts confirmed that the senator’s claim is accurate.

""It is correct that there are no limits in federal law to the amount of guns or ammunition a person can buy if he/she is not a proscribed possessor of firearms,"" said Daniel Webster, co-director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Federal law prohibits certain individuals from getting a gun or ammunition, such as someone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Also, there are certain reporting requirements under federal law for multiple gun sales.

For instance, licensed dealers must report to federal authorities if they sell more than one handgun to the same person within five consecutive business days. Also, licensed dealers in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas must report multiple sales of certain rifles during the same time period.

Referring to such federal reporting requirements, Jon Vernick, co-director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research, added in an e-mail: ""However, this form simply acts as a record of, not a limitation on, multiple purchases.""

The vast majority of states don’t limit the number of firearms that can be purchased, according to a state-by-state breakdown compiled by the California-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

New Jersey is one of three states that prohibit the sale of more than one handgun to an individual within a 30-day period, along with California and Maryland, according to the center. Each of those state laws allow for certain exemptions. Virginia repealed a similar law earlier this year.

""The Senator was (and will continue) to talk about the need for federal laws that limit the number of bullets and the number of firearms a person can purchase,"" Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said in an e-mail. ""He believes we need stronger laws nationally, not a patchwork of laws that vary in terms of strength state by state.""

Our ruling

Following the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado, Menendez claimed at a news conference that ""we do not have any limitation on the number of guns and bullets we can buy.""

Three states, including New Jersey, limit the number of handguns one can purchase in a 30-day period, but there are no limits under federal law on the purchase of firearms and ammunition. Federal regulations only mandate reporting multiple gun sales in certain cases.

"['Environment', 'Rhode Island', 'Climate Change', 'Weather', 'Michael J. Gardiner']","
Michael Gardiner says moratorium on jet flights after 9/11 caused temperature drop over U.S.
","In their first debate last month, three Republicans seeking Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District seat -- Michael J. Gardiner, Michael G. Riley and Kara D. Russo -- were discussing the role fossil fuels should play in a national energy strategy when the issue of climate change emerged.

When Russo questioned whether climate change even existed, considering there is ""so much . . . propaganda about global warming,"" Gardiner, a Providence lawyer, said human activity had ""clearly"" affected climate.

As an example, he pointed to the three days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when all commercial planes were grounded over the United States.

""We did see in 9/11, we did see I believe there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards, that there was an average temperature drop,"" he said.  ""So I think clearly there are man-made effects.""

We wondered whether Gardiner knew of some new research confirming the much-discussed theory in the 11 years since the attacks.

The theory caught wide attention a year after the attacks when University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Prof. David Travis and two colleagues published a study -- here’s a summary -- that found that the absence of jet vapor trails in the skies during the three-day flying hiatus had a climatological effect.

Travis and his colleagues had collected the daily high and low temperatures for those days from 4,000 weather stations across the country and compared the data with the same three-day period in each year from 1971 through 2000.

They determined that without contrails acting as artificial clouds trapping in heat (and to a lesser extent blocking the sun) the average daily temperature range over the continent had widened by about two degrees. In other words, the average low temperature dropped a bit while the average high temperature rose slightly.

Since then other studies have questioned whether the lack of contrails in the skies during those three days after the attacks actually played any role in the widened temperature variations that Travis reported. They have suggested that the temperature change Travis found might have been a coincidence -- the result of unusually clear weather during the period the jets were grounded.

When contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, Gardiner said he was relying on past news stories when he made his claim that the temperature had dropped while air flight was suspended.

After reading those news stories again, Gardiner acknowledged in an e-mail that he had misspoken during the candidates’ debate; Travis’ study showed a widened daily temperature range in both directions following the terrorist attacks -- not just a drop in temperature -- and, said Gardiner,  ""indeed there is controversy surrounding the observations . . . ""

Said Gardiner, ""I do a better job of illuminating a path for discussion and thought than 'nailing' a precise scientifically unassailable statement.""

Still, while Gardiner stated incorrectly what climatological event had occurred in the days after 9/11, his point for raising it was well-taken.

Gardiner’s underlying point that humans are affecting the climate is accepted by the vast majority of scientists. But he misstated the conclusions of a study that itself has been called into question. We rule his statement Mostly False.

Kelly Ayotte parrots debunked Romney talking point
","
Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, rumored to be one of Mitt Romney’s choice running mates for his 2012 presidential campaign, made her rounds on the National media circuit this weekend criticizing the President while touting the former Massachusetts governor, this time during CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday.

When host Candy Crowley highlighted Romney’s foreign faux pas while traveling abroad over the weekend, Ayotte was quick to shift the criticism onto President Barack Obama’s foreign policy speeches to show why she feels Romney would better serve as Commander in Chief.

""I can tell you that certainly, Mitt Romney is going to be strong on America's exceptionalism and strong foreign policy for America and he won't go around and apologize for America,"" Ayotte said. ""Think about it. The president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for our country, and he's actually made us weaker around the world as opposed to stronger, and Mitt Romney will stand strong with our allies.""

In the world of PolitiFact, Ayotte and Romney have campaign chemistry, at least when it comes to this claim; we’ve already fact checked Romney three times for saying Obama apologized for U.S. actions overseas. He’s earned a False and a Pants on Fire, not once, but twice.

The concept that Obama has traveled the world apologizing is popular among some conservative websites, and since Ayotte put the claim back in the public spotlight, PolitiFact New Hampshire felt it was time to bring it before the Truth-O-Meter, again.

What Obama said

Romney first made the accusation about Obama’s apologies abroad in his book titled, ""No Apology,"" and later said Obama issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City.

For starters, as PolitiFact looked over Obama's remarks, we have noticed that Obama never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: ""sorry."" Merriam-Webster defines an apology as ""an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret.""

PolitiFact read the Obama speeches Romney references and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together.

But Since Ayotte cited the Cairo speech specifically, we’ll focus on that one.

During a 6,000-word speech on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world in Cairo in 2009, Obama did get very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply ""move forward.""

Here are his exact remarks: ""In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.  Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians.  This history is well known.  Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.""

Obama also praised America, saying ""The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world.""

An Ayotte spokesman, reached Tuesday, stood by the claim that the president was apologetic, saying the President acknowledged what he considered to be several errors in U.S. foreign policy during his speech and then pledged to change course.

""President Obama is entitled to his opinion and Senator Ayotte is entitled to her opinion, which is that his address in Cairo amounted to an apology,"" Ayotte spokesman Jeff Grappone said.  ""There are numerous ways to apologize for American foreign policy without actually using the word ‘sorry.’ In this case, Senator Ayotte and President Obama have a fundamental difference of opinion, which she expressed.""

They cited several passages, including Obama’s comments about Iran, which they say amounted to the President apologizing for the United States. Here are the President’s statements from the speech they cited: 
• Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. 
• Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course. I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. 
• I know -- I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq. So let me be clear: No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other. 
• But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century -- and in too many Muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas. I'm emphasizing such investment within my own country. And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement. 
• More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. 
Did Obama apologize?

PolitiFact sent Obama's remarks from each of the speeches that Romney cited, including the Cairo speech, to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing.

• Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the website Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery.

Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said.

""Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect,"" she said. ""But a gesture of respect is not an apology.""

• Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing, which is not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower.""

""Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies,"" Gardiner said. ""It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership.""

• John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama was using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.

""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" Murphy said. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret.""

• Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it.

She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words ""sorry"" or ""regret."" ""I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there,"" Bloom said.

Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, PolitiFact has also compared Obama to his two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, in the earlier fact check.

Our ruling

While Obama's speeches have contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, those passages were typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries have erred as well. The same is true when zeroing in on Obama’s Cairo speech, when the President never included the words ""sorry,"" ""apologize,"" ""error,"" or even ""regret.""

It’s incorrect for Romney, and now Ayotte, to portray any of these speeches as apologies.

PolitiFact has regularly found Romney’s angle--that Obama’s trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries--to be a ridiculous charge. There’s a clear difference between changing policies and apologizing, and Obama didn’t do the latter. However, Romney charged that the President went on global apology tour, while Ayotte cited only one stop along that tour. Still, for parroting Romney’s repeatedly refuted claim, we give Ayotte a False.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says Walmart heirs own more wealth than bottom 40 percent of Americans
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, tweeted a startling statistic to his followers on July 22, 2012: ""Today the Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America.""

Sanders speaks and writes frequently about wealth distribution in the U.S., a hot-button issue among liberals and a rallying cry of the Occupy Wall Street Movement.

The Waltons, of course, are members of the proverbial 1 percent. But are they really sitting on that much wealth? We decided to check it out.

First, what is wealth?

In economics, wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth, and it’s defined as the value of assets minus liabilities. For someone in the middle class, that could encompass the value of their 401(k) or other retirement accounts, bank savings and personal assets such as jewelry or cars, minus what they owe on a home mortgage, credit cards and a car note.

It does not include income -- what people earn in wages. For that reason, someone who earns a good salary but has little savings and owes a lot of money on their house would have a negative net worth.

In fact, because so many Americans invest in real estate to buy a home, middle-class wealth has been one of the biggest casualties of the housing-driven recession.

From 2007 to 2010, typical families lost 39 percent of their wealth, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, done every three years. In 2007, the median family net worth was $126,400. In 2010, it was $77,300, according to the survey.

Where the Waltons fit in

Six members of the Walton family appear on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans. Christy Walton, widow of the late John Walton, leads the clan at No. 6 with a net worth of $25.3 billion as of March 2012. She is also the richest woman in the world for the seventh year in a row, according to Forbes. Here are the other five:

No. 9: Jim Walton, $23.7 billion
No. 10: Alice Walton, $23.3 billion
No. 11: S. Robson Walton, oldest son of Sam Walton, $23.1 billion
No. 103: Ann Walton Kroenke, $3.9 billion
No. 139: Nancy Walton Laurie, $3.4 billion

That’s a grand total of $102.7 billion for the whole family.

Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California-Berkeley, compared the Waltons’ cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Survey of Consumer Finances. (She used the Waltons’ wealth from 2010, which was valued at $89.5 billion.)

Allegretto found that in 2007, the wealth held by the six Waltons was equal to that of the bottom 30.5 percent of families in the U.S. In 2010, the Waltons’ share equaled the entire bottom 41.5 percent of families.

That 41.5 percent represents nearly 49 million families, notes Josh Bivens at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. While median family wealth fell by 38.8 percent, Bivens wrote, the wealth of the Walton family members rose from $73.3 billion in 2007 to $89.5 billion in 2010, or about 22 percent growth.

Other analysis

At Forbes, source of the richest 400 list, Tim Worstall wrote a response to the Waltons wealth claim. He did not dispute the accuracy of the statistic but offered some broader perspective.

""Wealth is always more unequally distributed than income,"" Worstall wrote. ""By the way, it isn’t even true that all of those households with zero or negative wealth are what we would call poor, either. It’s entirely possible to have no net assets while having a good income, even a high income. All you need to have is debts higher than your assets: something that will almost certainly be true of anyone with student debt and fresh out of college, for example.""

He added: ""If you’ve no debts and have $10 in your pocket you have more wealth than 25 percent of Americans.""

Bivens, for good measure, calculated the comparison of the Waltons vs. all Americans after removing households with a negative net worth -- those that drag down the overall average and make the Waltons’ advantage look greater. He found that the Walmart heirs’ $89.5 billion ""is still equal to the combined net worth of the bottom 33.2 million families (about 28.2 percent of the total).""

Our ruling

Sanders tweeted that ""the Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America.""

The statistic correctly compares the combined net worth of the bottom 41.5 percent of American families with the six Walton family members. We think the additional points -- that many people with a negative net worth are not necessarily poor and that percentages about wealth distribution can be deceiving -- are important and interesting. Nevertheless, Sanders’ claim is solid. We rate it True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC02E080>],/factchecks/2012/jul/31/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/
"['National', 'History', 'Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney said Reagan sent troops into conflict only once
","
Mitt Romney’s trip to Europe and Israel gave him the opportunity to talk about foreign affairs, a subject that has received relatively little attention so far in the campaign.

During the trip, Romney praised the military strategies of President Ronald Reagan. ""(He) was able to accomplish extraordinary purposes for our country,"" Romney said in an interview on Face the Nation. ""Without having to put our military forces into conflict. Only in one circumstance, which was in Grenada, did our forces go in a conflict setting. We were in a peacekeeping setting in Lebanon.""

The implication is that Reagan did not get American forces bogged down in protracted wars. But for this fact check we will focus on whether Romney had his history right. Under Reagan, did U.S. soldiers go into a conflict setting just once and does calling Lebanon a ""peacekeeping setting"" mean that conflict was any less of a threat? (We asked the Romney campaign about this but didn't hear back.)

For those who may have forgotten, the invasion of Grenada took place in late October 1983. About 5,000 troops subdued Grenadian and Cuban soldiers and laborers in about two days of fighting. The U.S. and six Caribbean nations were concerned about Cuba extending its reach in the region. Deaths included 19 Americans, 45 Grenadians and 59 Cubans.

The U.S. Navy’s History and Heritage Command has compiled a list of the use of U.S. forces abroad from 1798 to 1993. It makes no distinction between deployments into areas where there was open conflict and those that were more tranquil. During the Reagan administration, from 1981 to 1988, American forces were active on overseas missions 16 times in a total of 12 countries. Often, they played a support role, such as the AWACs electronic surveillance aircraft that provided intelligence to Saudi Arabian fighter jets as they shot down two Iranian fighter planes in 1984.

But on five or six occasions, U.S. forces took a more direct role. In 1986, the U.S. Navy and Air Force struck targets in Libya. While there was no long-term military engagement, two Air Force flyers died on that mission when their F-111 was hit over Libya.

In 1987 and 1988, U.S. Navy ships escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. They were fired upon, hit mines, or encountered some other military action six times. A mine strike nearly sank the USS Samuel Roberts.

""The crew heroically fought fires for five hours to save their ship,"" said Lance Janda, chair of the History Department at Cameron University. ""A number of crew members were seriously burned and injured.""

""One might quibble over the use of the word ‘conflict,’ "" Janda said. ""As I see it, any time U.S. forces are sent into a region where fighting is taking place, then I think it's fair to say those forces are at risk.""

Stephen Knott, professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, agrees. ""Reflagging Kuwaiti tankers was definitely inserting American forces into a ‘conflict setting’,"" Knott said. ""That is, the war between Iran and Iraq.""

Several historians and foreign policy specialists took issue with Romney calling the Lebanon mission a ‘peacekeeping setting.'

In 1982, the United States sent 1,200 troops as part of a U.N. effort to hold the Lebanese government together after the country was splintered by fighting among Christians and Muslims. Bruce Jentleson, professor of public policy and political science at Duke University, says the situation was anything but stable.

""As the Marine barracks bombing demonstrated,"" Jentleson told PolitiFact, ""there was plenty of danger."" A suicide truck bomber detonated explosives inside a Marine compound at the Beruit airport, killing 241 soldiers. It was the largest single-day loss of life for Marines since the World War II Battle of Iwo Jima.

Jentleson said that until that attack, the troop ""commitment was pretty open-ended. It only ended because of the bombing.""

Knott interviewed then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had tried to persuade Reagan against that deployment. Weinberger told Knott he said to Reagan, ""They’re in a position of extraordinary danger. They have no mission. They have no capability of carrying out a mission, and they’re terribly vulnerable.""

The consensus among the experts we reached is that under Reagan, the U.S. did avoid putting troops on the ground for extended periods of time. Government professor William Wohforth at Dartmouth College said Reagan ""was quite chary of actual military action with U.S. troops.""

However, the U.S. was very much engaged in other ways.

""In the cold war, the superpowers fought lots of proxy conflicts,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""Leading to huge loss of life from Central America to the Horn of Africa to Central and Southern Africa to Afghanistan."" Some of those conflicts, such as Afghanistan, began during the Carter administration.

O’Hanlon notes that the U.S. didn’t always follow through with money and efforts to stabilize those countries after the fighting stopped. He points to Afghanistan as a place where the U.S. likely paid a price for that policy when the country became a haven for al Qaeda.

Our ruling

Romney said the U.S. stayed out of conflict settings under Reagan, except once in Grenada. Romney put Lebanon in a separate category of ""a peacekeeping setting."" The record shows multiple military engagements and a large loss of life in Lebanon. Reagan was wary of the actual use of troops, but he did not stick to that as much as Romney suggests.

Romney may have been thinking of long-term deployments, but he spoke only of whether American soldiers were placed into conflict settings which did take place.

McCain often absent on children's issues
","The left-leaning advocacy group MoveOn.org has targeted Sen. John McCain in an e-mail list of ""10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't)."" The e-mail goes after him on issues from domestic policy to foreign policy to personal attributes. It urges recipients to forward the email to ""your friends, family and co-workers.""
 
Item five addresses children's issues. ""The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.""
 
It's true that McCain had the worst score — 10 percent — in the Senate from the Children's Defense Fund for 2007. But it's important to note that McCain's score was so low because he missed eight of 10 votes that the fund evaluates. On the two issues remaining, McCain voted for one (raising the minimum wage) and against one (expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, called SCHIP).
 
For the record, Sen. Barack Obama scored 60 percent, missing four of the critical 10 votes and siding with the group on the six votes he cast. Sen. Hillary Clinton scored 70 percent, missing three votes and agreeing with the group on the seven votes she cast.
 
MoveOn is correct that McCain voted against the children's health bill and defended President Bush's veto of the program. McCain, though, said he voted against the bill because it didn't contain adequate provisions for paying for the expansion.
 
""The American people have rebelled against out-of-control spending. If they can find a legitimate way to pay for it, I would consider it,"" he said.
 
So McCain may have scored better on the Children's Defense Fund scorecard if he had been there for more of the votes. (Though McCain's history with the group isn't that great, either. In 2006, his score was 10 percent and in 2005 it was 22 percent.) But MoveOn omits the caveat that his vote against SCHIP was based on spending concerns.
 
But these are minor points, and not enough to notch down the Truth-O-Meter too much. We find MoveOn's statement about McCain's rating and his stance on the children's health bill to be True.

McCain changed position on MLK Day
","
The left-leaning advocacy group MoveOn.org has created an e-mail warning voters against Sen. John McCain, listing 10 things it says people might not know about him.
 
""Please check out the list below, and then forward it to your friends, family, and coworkers,"" the e-mail says. ""We can't rely on the media to tell folks about the real John McCain — but if we all pass this along, we can reach as many people as CNN Headline News does on a good night.""
 
Item No. 1 is about Martin Luther King Jr.
 
""John McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Now he says his position has 'evolved,' yet he's continued to oppose key civil rights laws,"" the e-mail states.
 
It's true that as a congressman in 1983, McCain voted against making Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday. He was on the losing end of a 338 to 90 vote in the House of Representatives.
 
McCain no longer stands by that vote. On April 4, 2008 — the 40th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death — McCain said the vote was wrong in a speech he gave in Memphis, the city where King died.
 
""We can be slow as well to give greatness its due, a mistake I myself made long ago when I voted against a federal holiday in memory of Dr. King. I was wrong,"" he said, to loud reaction from the crowd. ""I was wrong, and eventually realized it in time to give full support — full support — for a state holiday in my home state of Arizona. I'd remind you that we can all be a little late sometimes in doing the right thing, and Dr. King understood this about his fellow Americans.""
 
So McCain did oppose the national holiday, even though he later supported the state holiday.
 
As for opposing key civil rights laws, McCain scores very low from two groups that rate Congress on issues involving civil rights law.
 
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights rates congressmen on their voting records. For the most recent 110th Congress, it rated senators on an array of votes on such things such as immigration, voting rights, education and the judiciary. McCain scored 22 percent on his votes, voting in favor of the conference's positions twice, on immigration issues. (Sen. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, scored 92 percent, while Sen. Barack Obama scored 100 percent. These percentages omit missed votes.)
 
The American Civil Liberties Union also rates McCain poorly, giving him a 17 percent rating for the 110th Congress and a 22 percent lifetime rating.
 
Some news stories have given a more nuanced account of McCain's history on civil rights and the black community. (See Politico's April 8, 2008, story on

John McCain and Arizona's black community

.) But MoveOn gets its facts right on McCain, MLK Day and the senator's voting record, so we rate this statement True.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Hillary Clinton']","
'Very well' in Mass. and Calif.
","Citing a mock election that Sen. Barack Obama won, a reporter for a student newspaper asked Sen. Hillary Clinton why her numbers aren't as strong with young voters.
 
""Well, I think they're getting better,"" Clinton said at the March 25, 2008, news conference in Greensburg, Pa. ""You know, I was very pleased at the reception that I've gotten here in Pennsylvania. And, you know, I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California.""
 
Clinton uses three big states whose primaries she won to prove her popularity with young people. Exit polls from those states show she competed well with Obama for voters under 30 years old in two of the three states:
 
• In California, she and Obama tied at 49 percent each.
 
• In Massachusetts, she won 49 percent. Obama won 48 percent.
 
• In Ohio, Clinton won 35 percent. Obama won 61 percent.
 
Clinton did better among the youngest voters — those under 25 — in California and Massachusetts, but fared worse in Ohio:
 
• In California, Clinton won 50 percent to Obama's 48 percent.
 
• In Massachusetts, she won 57 percent while Obama took 39 percent.
 
• In Ohio, Clinton won 29 percent compared to Obama's 70 percent.
 
Joe Lenski of Edison Media Research, the company that conducts the exit polls, said the sample sizes for the voters under 25 in the three states were only about 100 people each — too few to produce meaningful results.
 
""I wouldn't say (she did well) with that number because the sample size is too low,"" said Lenski, who is the executive vice president. ""But I'm a survey researcher, not a politician.""
 
The figures for voters under 30 are more reliable, he said, and agreed with Clinton's claim that she did well with young voters in Massachusetts and California, where she split the vote with Obama. Considering Clinton usually trails Obama by about 20 points among young voters, a tie is pretty good, Lenski said.
 
Exit poll patterns show her performing best among older voters, he added.
 
Lenski noted that Clinton won even more youth votes in Oklahoma and Arkansas — 60 percent and 56 percent under 30, respectively, he said — but may have passed over those examples because they're not big, core Democratic states like California and Massachusetts.
 
It has been a bit of conventional wisdom in this campaign that Obama is winning the youth vote, which is why we evaluated Clinton's claim of doing ""very well"" in that context. As Lenski said, splitting the under-30 vote with Obama in Massachusetts and California is a good record for Clinton, and we find that part of her claim to be true. But by including Ohio in her claim, where Clinton took less than half of the under-30 vote that Obama won, she has gone way too far, leading us to conclude that her overall claim to doing ""very well"" among young voters is Half True.

The fourth item on the list states, ""McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, 'I do not support

MoveOn is on solid ground here. McCain calls himself prolife. During the primaries in 2007, he asserted several times that he thought

""John McCain believes

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Nope, Obama was first in the Senate, too
","From the beginning of her presidential campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been answering for her vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, a vote that begat a war that has grown ever more unpopular. It hasn't helped that Sen. Barack Obama has been able criticize her vote with impunity because at the time of the vote he was in the Illinois state senate and rather famously gave a speech at a rally opposing an invasion.
 
At a campaign stop in Eugene, Ore., on April 5, 2008, Clinton was asked again by an audience member to explain her 2002 vote. Clinton responded by saying that Obama may have opposed the war prior to the invasion, but she was the first to criticize the war once he became a U.S. Senator in January 2005.
 
""When Sen. Obama came to the Senate, he and I have voted exactly the same except for one vote. And that happens to be the facts. We both voted against early deadlines. I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before he did. So I'm well aware that his entire campaign is premised on a speech he made in 2002, and I give him credit for that speech,"" she said.
 
Iraq has been a hot-button issue in the race for the Democratic nomination since the start. A whopping 91 percent percent of Democrats disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling Iraq, according to a March 2008 CBS News poll.
 
Indeed, we spent a lot of time earlier in the campaign documenting which

Democrats were against the war first or wanted the fastest withdrawal

.
 
Clinton cannot claim to have opposed the war before Obama, so by focusing on who spoke more critically of Iraq beginning with his arrival in the Senate, Clinton wants to reset the clock on this debate. It's a novel strategy, and we wondered if it might work, given that she has spoken out strongly against the Bush administration's war efforts in the years since her Iraq vote.
 
But a little research shows her new timeline doesn't work any better than the old one. Obama still is first.
 
And we're not the first to have done this. Clinton's remarks didn't sound right to Jake Tapper of ABC News, who

reported the remarks and debunked them earlier on his ""Political Punch"" blog

.
 
Obama took office on Jan. 3, 2005. One of his early assignments on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was to participate in a hearing to confirm Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State. On Jan. 18, Obama questioned Rice during the hearing about how quickly Iraqi troops were being trained and whether they truly were ready to defend their own country.
 
Obama said then that if success in Iraq is ""measured by whether Iraqis can secure their own circumstances, and if our best troops in the world are having trouble controlling the situation with 150,000 or so, it sounds like we've got a long way to go.
 
""And I think part of what the American people are going to need is some certainty, not an absolute timetable, but a little more certainty than is being provided, because right now, it appears to be an entirely open-ended commitment.""
 
Sounds like criticism to us.
 
Clinton, meanwhile, weighed in a week later with a statement on Rice's nomination, saying, ""In her role as National Security Advisor, Dr. Rice was a member of the team responsible for our flawed Iraq policy. She made several misleading statements about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in the lead up to the war.""
 
Clinton also said in the statement the she profoundly disagreed and deeply regretted how the war has been conducted.
 
Clinton might be showing moxie by trying to reframe the Iraq issue in a way that puts her on top, but the facts don't support it. On the statement that she criticized the war first after Obama became a senator, the Truth-O-Meter says False.

Clinton's trips not all puffery
","Sen. Hillary Clinton's talk on the campaign trail has at times inflated rather than clarified her accomplishments in matters of foreign policy. We found accuracy problems with her claims that she brought peace to Northern Ireland (Half True), that she helped negotiate open borders for Kosovo refugees (Barely True), and that she dodged sniper fire in Bosnia (Pants on Fire wrong). But after schedules for her days as first lady were released on March 19, 2008, former Clinton adviser-turned-foe Dick Morris said the schedules proved Clinton's foreign travel was not relevant experience. ""What's there, for us all to see, is one soft event after another, a schedule far more typical of such first ladies as Mamie Eisenhower or Lady Bird Johnson than of a future presidential candidate,"" he wrote in an opinion piece for the  New York Post  two days later. ""During her international travels, there was no serious diplomacy, just a virtually endless round of meetings with women, visiting arts-and-crafts centers, watching native industries and photo opportunities for the local media."" We analyzed all of Clinton's foreign trips as first lady from 1993-2001 and found that Morris goes too far when he says she did ""no serious diplomacy"" and filled her traveling days with puffery.    To start with, she regularly met with government officials. In March 1995, she met with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. A few days later she met with P.V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister of India. In Eastern Europe in July 1996, she met with President Ion Iliescu of Romania and President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic. In a tour of Central American countries in 1998, she announced major aid packages for hurricane relief and addressed the Congress of Guatemala. In Egypt in March 1999, she met with President Hosni Mubarak: The 15-minute courtesy call stretched to an hour, with Clinton expressing concern about the treatment of his country's 6-million to 10-million Coptic Christians, according to reports from the time. Yes, many of these meetings were brief, and we have no reason to think the first lady brokered agreements or executed new policies. But to say that the meetings did not constitute ""serious diplomacy"" is wrong. Her meetings were with heads of state — not just their spouses — and the American media covered them as legitimate news stories about America's ongoing foreign policy concerns. Morris is correct that Clinton met with many women. Virtually every trip has her meeting with some sort of women's group. But they weren't tea parties; they usually focused on significant social issues such as entrepreneurship, health care, human rights, education or child care. One of Clinton's most favored issues was clearly microcredit, an international movement with a goal of giving small loans to the poor, often to women to start their own, home-based businesses. Clinton visited microcredit programs regularly when she traveled overseas — the issue appears on her schedules more than 50 times. One of her earliest trips as first lady was a 1995 visit with Dr. Muhammad Yunus, a microcredit pioneer and founder of the Grameen Bank. Yunus went on to win the Nobel Prize in 2006. Morris' criticism that Clinton's travel was frivolous doesn't match up with what her schedules and news reports show. We found the truth of the matter to be somewhere between Clinton's bragging and Morris' put-downs. Meanwhile, we find his statement that the trips did not constitute any serious diplomacy to be False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB70740>],/factchecks/2008/apr/04/dick-morris/clintons-trips-not-all-puffery/

She was no emissary to the obscure
","Right before delivering a speech on Iraq policy at George Washington University on March 17, 2008, Hillary Clinton reflected on her days traveling as first lady. It was then that she said she remembered landing under sniper fire in Bosnia, a claim that's been widely debunked.

(Including by us: We called it a Pants on Fire fib.)

 
She also said, ""There was a saying around the White House that if a place was too small, too poor or too dangerous, the president couldn't go, so send the first lady, and that's where we went.""
 
We analyzed Clinton's international travel based on recently released White House schedules, interviews with traveling companions and scholars, as well as news reports from those trips. We found that Clinton went to many places that were large, wealthy and safe. We documented travel to 82 countries, and the top 10 list looks like an itinerary any travel agent could sell.
 
Our analysis showed that when Hillary Clinton traveled without her husband during the eight years she was first lady, she spent the most days in these countries:
 
Morocco	7
 
Austria	6
 
India	6
 
Italy	6
 
Switzerland	6
 
Turkey	6
 
Czech Republic	5
 
Egypt	5
 
Israel	5
 
Poland	5
 
They may not be the top NATO allies, but we can't consider any of these countries to meet the trifecta of small, poor and dangerous. Yes, she did go to places like Iceland (pretty small), Eritrea (poor) and Bosnia (arguably dangerous at the time she visited). But her travel itinerary is hardly a tour of the world's most obscure countries. Rather, her travels tended to emphasize stable allies of the United States, many of which are quite populous.

Saying 'no experience' is no fair
","Commenting on Sen. Barack Obama's proposal to leave a ""strike force"" of U.S. troops in the Middle East after a withdrawal from Iraq, Sen. John McCain belittled his potential rival for the White House, saying Obama had no expertise in the area of national security.
 
""I think somebody ought to ask what in the world (Obama's) talking about, especially since he has no experience or background at all in national security affairs,"" McCain said in an interview on MSNBC's

Morning Joe

program.
 
As a Vietnam war hero and senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has played a key role in most major debates on the war and the military, McCain might feel justified in delivering such a broad swipe. He's not the only candidate to go down this road; before bowing out of the race, former Democratic contender Joe Biden, the senior senator from Delaware, incorrectly said Obama hadn't passed any bills in the Senate.

We ruled that statement False.

 
McCain is exaggerating, too.
In his three years in the Senate, Obama has dealt with substantial issues such as nuclear proliferation as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and also participated in debates on the Senate floor and within the Democratic caucus on the war strategy, proposed timetables for troop withdrawals and the U.S. response to the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
 
That national security experience might not match up to McCain's lengthy resume, but it's arguably more than George W. Bush brought to the White House after he was elected president in 2000.
 
One of Obama's biggest legislative accomplishments in the national security arena came in 2006 when he helped write an exemption to the 1954 Atomic Energy Act allowing the United States to export to India civilian nuclear power technology, including nuclear fuel and reactors. The move was seen as cementing relations with an emerging power without endangering longstanding non-proliferation policies.
 
Bush, in signing the bill in December 2006, praised it for ""lay(ing) the foundation for a new strategic partnership between our two nations that will help ease India's demands for fossil fuels and ease pressure on global markets.""
 
In 2005, Obama and then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., toured a weapons destruction facility in the Ukraine where the United States was taking the lead in a three-year NATO program to destroy small arms, shoulder missile launchers and other supplies often sought by terrorists. The pair later collaborated on an effort to triple spending for programs to counter the spread of conventional weapons, but the bill never made it to a Senate vote.
 
In 2005, Obama also participated in a more parochial national security debate, arguing against the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's decision to move some operations at the Rock Island Arsenal in his home state of Illinois to military installations in Texas.
 
It's true that Obama's freshman rank and committee assignments didn't throw him in the middle of the national security fray, and it's true that his background is no match for McCain's. But to say he has absolutely no national security background or experience is an overstatement. For this reason we rule McCain's statement to be False.

times because former candidate Mitt Romney and various political groups have harped on the fact that McCain originally opposed the Bush tax cuts before supporting them.
 
McCain's camp could argue with the word ""billionaires"" because the Congressional Budget Office found the Bush tax cuts most benefited the top 1 percent of earners who had an average salary of $1.25-million. It goes without saying that billionaires are in the top 1 percent, too, but clearly most people in that tax bracket wouldn't fit that definition.
 
But it's also clear they aren't hurting, financially, either.
 
Clinton doesn't embellish at all when it comes to describing McCain's additional $100-billion corporate tax cut. She clearly is referring to his proposal to slice the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, as McCain has outlined on his campaign Web site. McCain's chief economic aide, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, told the

Wall Street Journal

it would cost $100-billion a year.
 
McCain's campaign estimates the entirety of its tax cuts would total $400-billion a year.
 
Clinton didn't mention that part, which causes us concern. Her statement suggests that McCain has only two ideas for helping the economy, and that's not true. Yes, she accurately describes those two elements of McCain's economic proposal, but she's wrong to suggest that's all McCain has in mind. For that, we give her a Half True.

Complete distortion of the Bible
","
The chain e-mail attacks on Sen. Barack Obama during this presidential race have been rampant and ruthless. He refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance (  False.)  He was sworn into the Senate on a Koran, not the Bible (  Pants on Fire wrong.)  His middle name is Mohammed and he's a ""covert"" Muslim (  Pants on Fire wrong.)  
But those allegations are dwarfed by a new chain e-mail that distorts the words of the Bible to suggest Obama is the Antichrist. 
The e-mail reads: ""According to The Book of Revelations the anti-christ is: The anti-christ will be a man, in his 40s, of MUSLIM descent, who will deceive the nations with persuasive language, and have a MASSIVE Christ-like appeal....the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace, and when he is in power, will destroy everything is it OBAMA??"" 
Like many other e-mails spreading falsehoods about the presidential candidates to thousands or even millions of people, this e-mail encourages its readers to pass it on: ""I STRONGLY URGE each one of you to repost this as many times as you can! Each opportunity that you have to send it to a friend or media outlet...do it! If you think I am crazy..Im sorry but I refuse to take a chance on the ""unknown"" candidate."" 
We feel silly even writing about this because many people consider it ridiculous on its face. But the e-mail was sent to us by many PolitiFact readers who wanted us to sort it out. And judging by 635,000 hits on a Google search for ""Obama + Antichrist,"" the suggestion certainly has spread. Among the thousands of postings is one blog —  ""Barack Obama the Antichrist?""  — devoted to exploring signs that Obama may be the Antichrist. 
And it's because of chain e-mails like this one that misunderstandings begin. 
To be clear: Nothing about this detailed allegation is true. 
Let's begin with the Book of Revelation (note the singular, which is accurate), the final book in the Bible's New Testament, which is 22 chapters long. Its sweeping apocalyptic language is laced with metaphors and symbols that challenge modern readers, but nowhere does it offer the kind of cookbook definition of the Antichrist proposed in this e-mail. 
To reach our findings, we read the Book of Revelation and interviewed two religious scholars. Here's what we found: 
• The word ""anti-christ"" does not appear in the Book of Revelation.  
""The word Antichrist is not used in the Book of Revelation so this is important to point out,"" said Dr. James D. Tabor, professor and chair of the religious studies department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. ""Everybody thinks the word is used."" 
That's a pretty big hole in this e-mail from the get-go. We didn't find the word in reading the text and our second scholar confirms this critical point. 
""First and foremost, the word Antichrist and a figure called the Antichrist never occurs in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament,"" said Dr. L. Michael White, professor of classics and religious studies at the University of Texas and director of the Institute for the Study of Antiquity and Christian Origins. 
Now, some people interpret characters in the Book of Revelation to be the Antichrist even though the text doesn't use this word. Specifically, in Chapter 13 there is a beast ""having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy"" that some consider to be an allusion to the Antichrist. 
""It's only in Chapter 13 and you could almost miss it,"" Tabor said. 
But among biblical scholars and historians, there is strong consensus that none of the strange, evil-sounding characters in the Book of Revelation actually represents the Antichrist. 
""It wasn't there in the Bible,"" White said. ""It emerges in the Middle Ages. It's something historians deal with."" 
Now the word Antichrist does appear a few times in other books of the Bible, specifically in First John and Second John. The description in First John, Chapter 4, verse 3 says: ""And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that  spirit  of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."" 
• There's no mention of a man of a certain age.  
The Book of Revelation talks of God, Jesus Christ, John, spirits, Jezebel, a beast like a calf, a beast like a flying eagle, elders, a great red dragon and many more animals and people. But nowhere does it describe ""a man, in his 40s,"" as the e-mail alleges. 
""As you notice, there's nothing about being age 40,"" Tabor said. ""This is completely wrong. The Book of Revelation doesn't say that. It says it's a male, so I guess they got that right. It says 'he,' 'he,' 'he.' "" 
• There's no mention of the word ""Muslim.""  
Considering the Bible was completed by the early second century, and the Islam religion wasn't founded until the early 600s, it's not surprising that the world Muslim (the name for Islam followers) does not appear in the Book of Revelation. 
So it's this part of the e-mail, where it says the Antichrist will be a man ""of Muslim descent,"" that our religious scholars find particularly ridiculous. 
By definition, the Antichrist is ""the polar opposite and ultimate enemy of Christ,"" according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. And because Muslims believe ""there is no god but God,"" they would have great difficulty with the idea of elevating a person to a divine status, White said. 
""A Muslim would be a monotheist and the last thing a Muslim would do is have anyone worship anyone other than God,"" Tabor said. 
Not to mention the fact that Obama is not a Muslim. 
White points to the specific descriptions of the Antichrist as evidence that the e-mail is drawing from a number of sources to create the image it wants to portray. 
""There is no part of that anywhere in the Bible, not in those forms,"" said White, who was a co-writer and historical consultant for the 1999 PBS documentary,  Apocalypse! Time, History, and Revolution.  ""That's all a jigsaw puzzle of bits and pieces all filtered through the kind of end-of-world scenarios we get in the theology that is the underpinning of the  Left Behind  novels."" 
White says this patchwork interpretation of the Bible is common in some groups trying to justify certain beliefs. 
""Of course, they never bothered to read the Scriptures carefully ... so it's kind of a system of interpretation. That if you start with that presupposition. ... it's all there you can just find it,"" White said. 
""That description (in the chain e-mail) never occurs anywhere in one place nor are the component parts really about the same situation. It's a cherry-picking through Scripture to get it all to fit together."" 
But fit together it doesn't. The claim in this e-mail is egregiously inaccurate, so we rule it Pants on Fire wrong.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDD5A40>],/factchecks/2008/apr/02/chain-email/complete-distortion-of-the-bible/
"['National', 'Iraq', 'Barack Obama']","
Yes, families pay more for Iraq war than cable
","The cost of the Iraq war has often been expressed in billions or trillions, numbers so big and abstract they remind us of Carl Sagan's description of the universe (""billions and billions of stars…"").
 
The candidates have cited alternative uses for the war money, saying it would have been better spent on health coverage for the uninsured (Sen. Hillary Clinton) or on more school teachers (Sen. Barack Obama).
 
In a speech on March 20, 2008, Obama took a different approach and emphasized the personal cost of the war.
 
""When Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month, you're paying a price for this war,"" he said in the speech in Charleston, W.Va.
 
At $100 per month, the war cost to each U.S. household would be more than cable TV (average bill: $58), but less than a car payment (average bill: $400-500).
 
We asked the Obama campaign about the source of the $100 figure and were told it came from

The Three Trillion Dollar War,

a new book by Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and Linda J. Bilmes, a former Commerce Department official from the Clinton administration who is now a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
 
The book says the monthly operating cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is about $16-billion.
 
""To think of it another way,"" the book says, ""roughly every American household is spending $138 per month on the current operating costs of the wars, with a little more than $100 per month going to Iraq alone.""
 
(Of course, Obama's simplified analysis does not reflect the variations in income tax levels. And you don't have to write a check for the war each month. The war costs are included in government spending that is paid for by taxes.)
 
There was no footnote for the $100 estimate, so we called Bilmes to ask how she had calculated it. She said they took the Bush administration's 2008 request for war funding – $196-billion – and divided it by 12 to get a monthly cost. That works out to $16-billlion for both wars and about $12-billion just for the Iraq portion.
 
Then, she and Stiglitz divided those figures by the number of U.S. households and came up with $138 for both wars and slightly more than $100 for Iraq alone, she said.
 
We double-checked the authors' sources and math, and found they were right.
 
Indeed, the Bush administration request for 2008 was $196-billion for both wars, with $159-billion going to Iraq, according to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. A recent Census Bureau report said there were 116-million households. So that works out to about $140 per month for both wars and about $114 for Iraq alone. (Our numbers are slightly higher than Bilmes and Stiglitz because we used the latest estimates from CRS and a newer and slighter higher count for households.)
 
To verify the Bilmes and Stiglitz calculation, we checked with Steven Kosiak, vice president for budget studies with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on defense issues. He said their methodology was correct and that the number ""sounds about right.""
 
Bilmes, a Democrat who is neutral in the presidental race, said Obama could have used an even higher figure if he had included other war costs that aren't in the Pentagon's $196-billion tab. These include disability payments, the cost of replacing war-fighting equipment and interest on the borrowed money.
 
By using the figure he did, Obama ""really was being conservative on this,"" Bilmes said. ""He's not overstating it in any way.""
 
And so we find Obama is right about the war's monthly cost. We find his claim to be True.

Distorted and unfair comparison
","Fighting perceptions that their candidate has a thin legislative record, supporters of Sen. Barack Obama say he has written and co-sponsored more bills in three years in the Senate than Democratic opponent Sen. Hillary Clinton has in her seven years.
 
A chain e-mail widely reproduced on Web blogs says Obama authored 890 bills and co-sponsored nearly 1,100 more, and contrasts that output with the record of Clinton, noting she got 20 mostly inconsequential bills passed during her first seven years in the chamber. The numbers use data retrieved on the Library of Congress' legislative search engine, Thomas (named for Thomas Jefferson and found

here

).
 
""An impressive record for someone who supposedly has no record, according to some who would prefer this comparison not be made public,"" the e-mail reads, concluding, ""He's not just a talker. He's a doer.""
 
But while you can obtain those search results with the right query, the e-mail is misleading for several reasons.
 
First, it compares apples to oranges by contrasting every bill and amendment to a bill that Obama sponsored or co-sponsored, regardless of whether each advanced or languished, to those measures Clinton sponsored or co-sponsored that were signed into law. That guarantees a low count for Clinton, because Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House for most of her seven years in the Senate. The e-mail does not reveal how many of Obama's legislative attempts never got considered.
 
Plus, including amendments in Obama's total but not in Clinton's total unfairly distorts the difference even more. Technically, amendments aren't really ""bills,"" as the e-mail calls them. But more to the point, amendments, in which lawmakers seek to change some narrow part of legislation, can be the best way for members of a minority party to play a role in the legislative process.
 
And then there's this: Experts say it's misleading to use the number of bills a lawmaker sponsors to gauge his or her ability to get things done, anyway. Most of the thousands of measures that senators and representatives introduce each year never get acted on, fond as politicians may be of talking about them. The number of bills they co-sponsor is even more insignificant, because in many of those cases the lawmakers are piggybacking on the efforts of a like-minded colleague who did most of the legwork.
 
""Introducing bills is a relatively cost-free activity because it doesn't involve much time or political capital,"" said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ""If you think about political capital and how it's used, you need some way of measuring whether this or that senator made a difference and influenced an outcome.""
 
A side-by-side tally of Clinton's and Obama's legislative output on Thomas shows Clinton has sponsored 635 bills and co-sponsored 2,441 more since she was elected in 2000, 54 of which became law. Obama has sponsored 272 and co-sponsored another 834 since he was elected in 2004, 16 of which became law.
 
So in an apples-to-apples comparison of bills written and co-sponsored, it's Clinton: 3,076; Obama: 1,106. Not quite the conclusion the e-mail sought to reach.
 
We don't need to rule on whether counting pieces of legislation is a legitimate way of measuring the effectiveness of lawmakers, though experts make clear that it's not. For us, it's enough to look at the facts in the e-mail, the actual numbers being used to make the comparison, and when we look we find manipulation and mistakes. We find a clear False.

"['National', 'Ethics', 'Bill Clinton']","
42.4 percent by our calculations
","In a March 16, 2008, interview with a group of college journalists, former President Bill Clinton stated that an inordinate amount of money distributed by Sen. Barack Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund, went to elected officials in states with early primaries.
 
It was a key point in Clinton's argument that Obama has not been true to his pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president.
 
Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates. Members use the committees to solidify relationships with other members of Congress who might later support them in a run for a leadership post within Congress or in a bid for higher office. Most politicians shelve their leadership PACs once they formally announce their candidacy for president.
 
But Obama didn't.
 
In the months after Obama announced his candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007, Hopefund distributed more than $400,000 to federal and state political candidates and parties.
 
Said Clinton: ""In the beginning, he spends 40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians. Those states constitute 3.7 percent of America's population, after he is a political candidate. And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups.
 
""Now, he can say that this is just a blind coincidence, although he admitted that his political action committee consulted with his campaign about how to spend that money out.""
 
A PolitiFact analysis of the political contributions made by Obama's Hopefund after Obama officially announced his candidacy found that $185,000 went to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina (the overwhelming majority went to Iowa, $95,500, and New Hampshire, $82,000). Another $251,000 went to candidates or state parties in 26 other states, according to a review of Hopefund disbursements listed at

Opensecrets.org.

 
That means 42.4 percent of Hopefund disbursements were spent in the four states. So Clinton is dead on there.
 
And Clinton rightly notes that these states constitute just 3.7 percent of America's population, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The implication is that the money was spent only to curry favor with politicians in early-voting states that could give Obama's campaign a boost.
 
""You are building your political clout, so you can call in favors in the future,"" said Paul Ryan, an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that specializes in analyzing campaign finance.
 
In December, the Clinton campaign called on Obama to close Hopefund and contended that the disbursements after Obama announced his candidacy violated election laws. Though no laws specifically require candidates to close their leadership PACs, Ryan said, it is a legal gray area and most politicians shelve them just to be sure. Obama and his staff maintained then that they did nothing improper.
 
The line was muddied some with a

Washington Post

story on Nov. 30, 2007, that quoted a campaign source acknowledging that Obama's presidential campaign was consulted by Hopefund officials about how to disburse its remaining funds.
 
One can argue whether leadership PAC disbursements to other candidates count as presidential campaigning, or whether the inordinate amounts of money going to states with early primaries proves it — we think they probably do.
 
But we're evaluating Clinton's statement about how much PAC money Obama spent in the early-primary states. And Clinton is pretty much on target when he says 43 percent went to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. We rate his claim True.

A small amount before he announced

","In a March 16, 2008, interview with a group of college journalists, the mtvU editorial board, former President Bill Clinton was asked why Sen. Hillary Clinton had not made a pledge not to accept campaign contributions from lobbyists, as Sen. Barack Obama has.
 
""He (Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee,"" Bill Clinton said. ""He said one thing and did another.""
 
Clinton is talking here about Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund. Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates.
 
All the other presidential candidates shut down their leadership PACs when they announced their candidacy, but Obama's PAC continued to distribute more than $400,000 to political candidates and parties after Obama entered the ring on Feb. 10, 2007.
 
""And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups,"" Clinton said.
 
Clinton is right, but some scale is in order.
 
According to an analysis for PolitiFact by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, of the $4.5-million raised by Obama's Hopefund, $16,500 came from lobbyists, and $125,000 from political action committees such as Lockheed Martin Employees' PAC, AT&T; Corp. PAC and Walt Disney Productions Employees. The biggest donors were lawyers and law firms, accounting for nearly a half-million dollars.
 
So Obama's leadership PAC did raise money from lobbyists and PACs, though it amounted to just a fraction of the total fundraising. Also notable is that the money was collected before Obama announced his presidential candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
 
PolitiFact has already weighed in on Obama's campaign pledge not to take money from lobbyists or PACs, finding that

while he has eschewed money from federally registered lobbyists, he has accepted thousands from people who work for lobbying firms.

We have also noted that Hillary Clinton has

raised more campaign donations from registered lobbyists than any other candidate.

 
Common sense suggests the distributions to candidates were meant to advance Obama's campaign, particularly when almost 43 percent of the money was spent on candidates in states with early primaries.

(See our related ruling on this point here).

 
One question is whether Obama's Hopefund distributions violate Obama's pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president. Because the contributions were made prior to the start of his campaign, we find they do not. Therefore it's a stretch for Clinton to say, ""He said one thing and did another.""
 
But we're checking Clinton's claim that ""(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee."" And Obama's leadership PAC did accept $16,000 from lobbyists, and another $125,000 from PACs, even though it was collected before Obama was an announced candidate. And nearly half of Hopefund's money was spent on key primary states during the campaign. So we rate Clinton's claim True.

He's in the race!
","Former U.S. Sen. Mike Gravel, 77, returned from oblivion to a momentary spot on the national stage when he announced March 26, 2008, that he had joined the Libertarian Party. But the central question of his candidacy — is it one? — remained.
 
Earlier that month he put a video on YouTube complaining that the site's YouChoose page no longer featured him. ""Apparently I've been relegated to a footnote at YouTube,"" Gravel says in the video. ""I'm one of three candidates in the presidential race, Obama, Hillary and myself. I am a candidate. I have not withdrawn.""
 
PolitiFact set out to confirm Gravel's status. We started by checking to see if Gravel was on the ballot in any of the upcoming Democratic nominating contests. Some state officials had no idea who we were asking about.
 
""Could you spell that?"" asked Bowen Greenwood, communications director for the secretary of state of Montana (primary, June 3). Greenwood went to check and came back with: ""The elections folks tell me they've never heard of him. I confess, I've never heard of him either.""
 
West Virginia (May 13) had not heard from him. Neither had South Dakota (June 3). Puerto Rico (June 1) was finalizing its candidate list, but didn't expect Gravel to be on it.
 
And in Guam (May 3), Tony Charfauros, chairman of the Democratic Party, said: ""Are you talking about Mike Gravel who used to be a candidate for president?""
 
Gravel told us he's on the ballot in North Carolina (May 6) and Oregon (May 20). Turns out he is confirmed for the North Carolina primary, but not Oregon.
 
Scott Moore, chief of communications for the Oregon secretary of state, told us they would have been happy to put Gravel on the ballot, but his campaign never filed the paperwork.
 
He's also not on the ballot in Pennsylvania (April 22), Indiana (May 6) or Kentucky (May 20).
 
Adding it all up, Gravel is on the ballot in just one of the 10 remaining contests.
 
We also determined that Gravel has zero delegates, virtually no fundraising and a campaign staff that amounts to ""the better part of about a half dozen people,"" according to deputy campaign manager Jon Kraus.
 
So, is Gravel still a candidate?
 
He is. Just not for the Democrats.
 
Gravel said he ""has pretty much had it"" with the Democrats and thinks they have cut their ties to him. Yet he's intent on being on the November ballot one way or another.
 
In fact, he hopes to seal the deal in Denver. But not at the Democratic convention.
 
At the Libertarian convention — May 22-26, 2008.
 
""Right now he's actively pursuing the Libertarian nomination,"" Kraus said.
 
Despite the fact that no one will believe us, we find Gravel is actively pursuing a presidential nomination in 2008, albeit with the Libertarians since he has exhausted his chances as a Democrat. So his statement, while possibly delusional, is totally True.

Video shows tarmac welcome, no snipers
","(Published March 25, 2008) During an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996. ""I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base."" But that's not what happened, as demonstrated by CBS News video that shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. The Washington Post  Factchecker  also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady. CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit,  wrote of her memories of the trip  : ""To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. "" Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. ""There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,"" she said. But she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia  Daily News  editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she ""misspoke,"" correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, ""So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation."" On the campaign trail, Clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience. The  Des Moines Register  reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, ""We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there."" Interestingly, Clinton's memoir  Living History  depicts an arrival that, though dangerous, included neither actual sniper fire nor running. It matches the CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's later retelling: ""Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.'"" We have questioned Clinton's previous remarks about her foreign policy experience. We found her statements that she  helped bring peace to Northern Ireland  and that she  stood up to the Chinese government on women's rights  to be Half True. We found her statement that she  negotiated open borders for Kosovars  to be Barely True. There's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. Yes, Clinton later acknowledged that she was mistaken, but it's hard to understand how she could err on something so significant as whether she did or didn't dodge sniper bullets. Quite simply, this kind of hyperbole deserves our harshest assessment. We rule Pants on Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB825B40>],/factchecks/2008/mar/25/hillary-clinton/video-shows-tarmac-welcome-no-snipers/

Dividends taxes won't crash the market
","A chain e-mail accuses Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of wanting sharp tax increases, while praising Sen. John McCain for holding the line. (

Click here to read the chain e-mail in its entirety

.)
 

The e-mail asserts that Clinton and Obama want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes, as well as raise tax rates for all income levels.

We'll look at dividends taxes here.
 
Dividends are payments that companies make to stockholders as a way of distributing profits. Before the Bush administration, dividends were taxed like normal income, with the rate for the wealthiest taxpayers reaching 39.6 percent. President Bush cut the tax rates on dividends to 15 percent, the same as capital gains taxes. Obama has said he will let the dividends tax cut expire so that dividends will be taxed at the same rate as normal income. We can't find an example of Clinton directly addressing the dividends tax, but she has spoken repeatedly about letting the Bush tax cuts expire for higher income taxpayers. Her campaign didn't respond to our questions.
 
Here's what the e-mail states:
 
 
""DIVIDEND TAX
 
MCCAIN
 
15% (no change)
 
OBAMA
 
39.6%
 
CLINTON
 
39.6%""
 
""How will this affect you?"" the e-mail asks. ""If you have any money invested in
stock market, IRA, mutual funds, college funds, life insurance, retirement accounts, or anything that pays or reinvests dividends, you will now be paying nearly 40% of the money earned on taxes if Obama or Clinton become president. The experts predict that 'Higher tax rates on dividends and capital gains would crash the stock market yet do absolutely nothing to cut the deficit.'""
 
The e-mail's explanation gets a few things wrong. Only taxpayers in the top bracket would pay 39.6 percent on dividends taxes. It's also unlikely that an increase in dividends taxes would crash the stockmarket.
 
""That's hyperbolic,"" said William Ahern, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, a progrowth tax policy think tank that opposes increases in dividends taxes.
 
Another tax policy expert also shot down the stock-market-crash scenario:
 
""Raising the dividend tax could cause some high income U.S. investors to move some of their wealth out of stocks, but all the analyses I have seen suggested the effect on the stock market would be small and would be swamped by changes in stock prices due to other causes,"" said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Urban Institute.
 
We find the e-mail gets its summary of the dividends tax only partially correct, though it is right that Obama specifically proposes an increase on the tax and Clinton has indicated she wants to let the Bush tax cuts expire for higher-income taxpayers. But Clinton hasn't staked out a specific change on the dividends tax and it's misleading for the e-mail to use one. And, the e-mail is wrong to suggest a change in the dividends tax would cause the stock market to crash. We rate its claims Barely True.
