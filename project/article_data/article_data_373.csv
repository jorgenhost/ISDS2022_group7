Bill Clinton mostly accurate on international unemployment comparison
","In his Democratic convention address, former President Bill Clinton took a shot at President Donald Trump’s economic record during the coronavirus pandemic, saying the 45th president has botched his handling of the twin health and economic crises. ""Donald Trump says we’re leading the world,"" Clinton said. ""Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple."" Using the most clear-cut multi-nation comparison — comparing January to June 2020 — Clinton is right. But it’s worth noting some differences in how countries address unemployment. We turned to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank whose members are advanced industrialized countries. The group collects economic statistics for all its members, including unemployment rates. We chose 20 countries for which data was available, including most of the countries in western Europe, plus Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Israel.  For consistency’s sake, we compared January to June because only two of the countries reported data for July.  As the following chart shows, the United States was among the few countries to show a dramatic increase in the unemployment rate between January and June. The U.S. is the peach-colored line with the steep climb; you can see each country highlighted if you hover over the list of countries at the bottom. The United States saw its unemployment rate increase from 3.6% to 11.1%. That works out to a little under 3.1 times higher in June than January. No other country saw such a big increase.  The only other nation that saw its unemployment rate more than double over that period was Canada, which saw its rate increase 2.2 times. Canada actually had a higher unemployment rate in June than the U.S. did, at 12.3%, but the scale of Canada’s increase was more modest than the United States’ because Canada had a higher rate to start, at 5.5%. Using U.S. data for February instead of January doesn’t change the picture much. The U.S. unemployment rate in February was 3.5%, making the increase through June about 3.2 times. There are a couple asterisks to Clinton’s statement. If you compare January to July, a month for which data isn’t available for most of the OECD nations, the increase in the United States was still substantial, but just short of three times higher. The unemployment rate rose from 3.6% in January to 10.2% in July, meaning an increase of 2.8 times. It’s also worth noting that the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen for three straight months, amid a zigzagging reopening and a volatile economy. So the unemployment rate is likely to bounce around a bit before it settles down. Finally, the OECD itself notes some differences across countries. Some nations have used more aggressive efforts than the United States to subsidize workers to remain on payrolls. And some countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not count ""temporarily"" laid-off workers as unemployed, while the United States does count such workers as unemployed. Clinton said the United States is ""the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple"" since the coronavirus pandemic began. That’s accurate for the broadest comparison — a 20-nation selection of OECD nations between January 2020 and June 2020. The rate in the U.S. was 3.1 times higher in June than in January. Only Canada came close, with the unemployment rate 2.2 times higher over that period. However, extending the U.S. data to July showed that the increase fell slightly below three times, and there are some complications in making cross-country comparisons. We rate the statement Mostly True. UPDATE, Aug. 20: This article has been updated with additional context about the complications of making cross-country comparisons of unemployment rates. The rating remains the same.",/factchecks/2020/aug/19/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-mostly-accurate-international-unemplo/

Donald Trump Jr. distorts Michigan data on dead voters
","There is scant evidence to support President Donald Trump’s warnings that mail-in voting is susceptible to widespread fraud. That hasn’t stopped those concerned about an expected record number of absentee votes in Michigan this November from looking for signs of fraud in recent elections. On Aug. 14, the Michigan Secretary of State’s office released preliminary data on the number of rejected ballots from the state’s Aug. 4 primary. In total, over 10,000 absentee ballots were rejected, including nearly 850 ballots cast by voters who died before Election Day. Some seized on the data to raise alarm, including the president’s son. The headline on an Aug. 15 Breitbart piece reads ""Michigan Rejects 846 Mailed Ballots ‘Because the Voter Was Dead.’"" Jason Miller, a senior strategist for the president’s re-election campaign, tweeted a link to the piece, which cited the state’s data as evidence that absentee voting is susceptible to voter fraud. Donald Trump Jr., in turn, shared Miller’s tweet, citing it as cause for concern that absentee voting may delegitimize election results. ""The media: NOTHING TO SEE HERE!!!,"" Trump wrote. ""It was only about 8% of the votes cast."" Given the importance of absentee voting in Michigan this year, we took a closer look at the Trump tweet. We found that it takes misleading information from the Breitbart piece and compounds it with an outright false claim. For one thing, the 846 rejected ballots were cast not by dead people but by living people who then died before Election Day. For another, those ballots — which were not counted in the final results — made up about 8% of the rejected ballots, not 8% of the votes cast. In fact, these ballots accounted for barely 0.03% of the total votes cast, and none were counted. We reached out to the Trump re-election campaign for a comment but didn’t hear back. Ballots rejected in Michigan’s primary  Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued the report on rejected ballots along with a call for legislation designed to reduce the number of ballots disqualified for late arrival or mismatched signatures. She said 10,694 ballots were rejected in Michigan’s Aug. 4 primary. Nearly 60% of them were rejected because they arrived late. Absentee ballots must be received by the voter’s clerk by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to be counted. The remaining rejected ballots were deemed ineligible for a range of reasons, including missing or mismatched signatures or voters who changed addresses. Of the rejected ballots, 846 had to be tossed because the voters were deceased. These were not instances of someone completing and mailing an absentee ballot by stealing the identity of a deceased voter.  Rather, as Benson’s Aug. 14 release notes, they were cast by eligible Michigan voters who died after casting their ballots but before Election Day. These ballots accounted for just under 8% of the rejected absentee ballots. But including absent and in-person voters, Michigan saw more than 2.5 million votes cast in the Aug. 4 primary. Based on the total of counted and uncounted votes, the number of ballots from deceased voters accounted for about 0.03% of votes cast, meaning Trump overstated it by a factor of more than 200. And none of them were counted toward the final results. So Trump’s math is incorrect. He used the wrong denominator to claim that these ballots made up 8% of the total ""votes cast"" when in reality, they accounted for a minuscule share of the total votes cast. It is typical to see a number of absentee votes deemed ineligible in an election because voters die after casting their ballot. In the November 2016 election, Michigan had to reject more than 1,780 absentee ballots because the voters died after they cast their votes. Rather than indicating instances of fraud, the rejected ballots show the state’s ability to detect and discount ineligible ballots. Benson’s biggest concern leading into November is that valid absentee ballots won’t count. The large number of rejected ballots reflects the need for reform ahead of November’s general election, she said. Benson supports an election reform bill in the Michigan Legislature that would allow mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrive within 48 hours after Election Day to be counted. She also supports a bill that would require clerks to contact voters if the signature on the absentee ballot does not match the signature on the voter registration. ""The data demonstrates that thousands of people who cast otherwise valid votes were not able to participate in last week’s election solely because the Legislature failed to act ahead of the primary,"" Benson said. Our ruling Donald Trump Jr. claimed that the 846 ballots that were rejected because the voter was dead accounted for ""8% of the votes cast."" These 846 ballots were not fraudulently cast by someone assuming the identity of a dead person. They were cast by living voters who died before Election Day. These ballots accounted for nearly 8% of the total number of rejected ballots in the state’s August primary. They accounted for about 0.03% of the total votes cast. None of the rejected ballots were counted toward the final results. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2020/aug/18/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-distorts-michigan-data-dead-voters/

‘We don’t want that,’ Trump says of New Zealand after country reported nine new COVID-19 cases
","Speaking in Minnesota ahead of the Democratic National Convention, President Donald Trump compared the ongoing surge of coronavirus cases in the U.S. to the situation in New Zealand, where the virus returned recently after more than 100 days of no community spread. ""When you look at the rest of the world ... now all the sudden, a lot of the places that they were using to hold up, they’re having a big surge,"" Trump said Aug. 17 in a speech at an airport in Mankato, Minn. ""They were holding up names of countries, and now they’re saying, ‘Whoops.’"" ""In fact, even New Zealand. You see what's going on in New Zealand?"" the president continued. ""They beat it. They beat it. It was like front page, they beat it, because they wanted to show me something. The problem is, big surge in New Zealand. It's terrible. We don't want that.""  New Zealand, an island nation of about 5 million people, saw the return of the virus’ community spread on Aug. 11 after months with no locally transmitted cases.  But on Aug. 17, the day of Trump’s remark, New Zealand had reported just nine new COVID-19 cases. The previous day, it reported 13 new cases, up from seven new cases on Aug. 15.  On Aug. 18, following Trump’s comment, New Zealand reported another 13 new cases. The new cases in recent days have caused alarm in New Zealand, where strict lockdown policies and travel restrictions aim to put a lid on the virus. The leadership has responded by postponing the country’s election and locking down Auckland, its largest city.  Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, said it’s a stretch for Trump to say New Zealand had ever ""beat"" the virus, since the pandemic was raging elsewhere and New Zealand has needed mitigation efforts to keep cases low. But New Zealand’s new cases are a far cry from the outbreak in the U.S., which has reported more than 50,000 new cases per day for most of August and July, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day average of new cases in the U.S. was 50,927 on Aug. 17. ""That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard in quite a while,"" Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University, said of Trump’s claim comparing the two nations. As of Aug. 18, New Zealand’s health ministry had recorded 1,643 confirmed and probable cases in total, along with 22 deaths. There are currently 90 active cases in the country. The U.S. leads the world in cumulative cases and deaths, by contrast. It has seen nearly 5.5 million cases and more than 171,000 deaths as of Aug. 18. That’s a quarter of the world’s known cases in a country that, with around 330 million people, represents about 4% of the global population. The disparity is wide even when you adjust for the size of both countries. According to the World Health Organization, the United States has 16,175 confirmed cases for every 1 million people. New Zealand has 268 confirmed cases per million people. RELATED: Donald Trump says US is at the top globally in COVID-19 fight. It isn’t.

Grid Operator Rejects Trump’s False Claim ‘Democrats’ Purposely Triggered Calif.'s Rolling Blackouts
","President Trump claimed in a tweet on Tuesday, without evidence, that ""In California, Democrats have intentionally implemented rolling blackouts.""  The state and much of the Western United States is in the middle of a searing heat wave. California’s grid operator called for utilities to initiate temporary blackouts on Friday and Saturday as the high demand for electricity outstripped supply. Additional blackouts are possible.  We set out to fact check the president’s questionable claim that politics was at play in deciding to call for the blackouts. California Power Grid Operator Rejects Trump’s Claim The state’s power grid is managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. It is a nonprofit public benefit corporation. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom nominates members to the organization’s board of governors.  But the decision to call for blackouts was made by a shift manager at CAISO’s control room, not by the board or the organization’s CEO, officials said on Tuesday.  ""There wasn’t any party affiliation or other kind of input into the decisions to shed load on Friday and Saturday night,"" Steve Berberich, the system operator’s CEO, told the media, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.  On Saturday evening, PG&E, which provides power to much of Northern and Central California, said 220,000 customers lost electricity. Outages were mostly in portions of the Central Coast and Central Valley, including Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Joaquin counties. Approximately the same number of customers lost power on Friday evening.  Severin Borenstein, who sits on CAISO’s board of governors, said calling for rolling blackouts is a last resort measure to avoid having ""the entire grid go down."" Politics, he said, had nothing to do with it.  ""I don't understand what the political motivation would be to have rolling blackouts,"" Borenstein told PolitiFact California. ""If anything it seems that this just gives Trump an opening to rail against renewable energy.  But in any case, there is no political link to the decision to implement rolling blackouts."" In his tweet on Tuesday, Trump not only charged Democrats in California for implementing the blackouts, he also alleged that ""Democrats are unable to keep up with energy demand … Meanwhile, I gave America energy independence in fact, so much energy we could never use it all. The Bernie/Biden/AOC Green New Deal plan would take California’s failed policies to every American!"" Why Was The Decision Made To Call For Blackouts In California?  On Monday, CAISO officials blamed a combination of factors for the rolling blackouts: Several days of triple digit temperatures across California and much of the West, lower output from renewable energy sources and a gas-powered plant going offline unexpectedly.  Borenstein, who directs the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, said CAISO warned the state’s utility regulator in January that greater energy capacity was needed. California added large amounts of renewable energy through solar and wind in recent decades. But those options, particularly solar, haven’t been enough to meet demand at night during this heat wave, Borenstein explained.  That’s because solar energy shuts off at night when many Californians are continuing to run air conditioning.  ""We have not built enough capacity,"" Borenstein said, adding that solar storage options are needed.  In a letter sent Monday to three independent agencies that oversee the state’s electrical grid and utility companies, Newsom said residents and officials did not receive proper warning of impending blackouts. The governor called the sudden shut-offs — the first rolling blackouts since 2001, which, in part, led to the recall of then-Gov. Gray Davis — ""unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation’s largest and most innovative state.""  At a press briefing later that day, Newsom took responsibility for the hasty blackouts, but made no suggestion that politics was at play in triggering them. ""We failed to predict and plan, and that’s simply unacceptable,"" he said. ""I am the governor. I am ultimately accountable and will ultimately take responsibility to … ensure this simply never happens again in the state of California."" Officials on Tuesday urged Californians to continue to conserve electricity to avoid additional rolling blackouts.  Our rating President Trump claimed ""In California, Democrats have intentionally implemented rolling blackouts.""  The state is in the middle of a prolonged and scorching heat wave. Its power grid operator, California Independent System Operator, called for private utilities to initiate temporary blackouts on Friday and Saturday when electricity demand outpaced supply.  Officials at CAISO said the motivation for the blackouts was to ensure California’s power grid didn’t collapse, and that politics was not a factor. Officials said neither the CEO nor board members, who are appointed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, called for the blackouts. Instead, the decision was made by a power grid shift manager. In the end, Trump offered no evidence to back up his provocative and questionable claim.  We rated it False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2020/aug/18/donald-trump/grid-operator-rejects-trumps-false-claim-democrats/

Donald Trump says US is at the top globally in COVID-19 fight. It isn’t.
","At an event in Oshkosh, Wis., President Donald Trump said the country was ""doing great"" in the fight against the coronavirus. ""We're coming back and our numbers are better than almost all countries,"" Trump said Aug. 17. When we asked the White House about the claim, the press office noted that by one measure, the United States is doing well. Looking at the percentage of confirmed cases that lead to death, the United States has a rate that’s about half that in Europe and the rest of the world.  But the source the White House cites, Oxford University’s Our World in Data project, says that ""During an outbreak of a pandemic the case fatality rate is a poor measure of the mortality risk of the disease.""  There are other ways to track the suffering and reach of the coronavirus and by those, the United States is not doing well. Measured against the size of the population, the United States has the 10th-highest death rate in the world. It’s doing better than the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Chile, but worse than France, Canada and Germany, to pick a few examples. Factoring in population size, the United States has one of the highest rates globally of people who have tested positive — 16,430 per million residents, which is lower than Chile, but higher than any other large country. Put another way, the virus is known to have infected a higher fraction of the population in the U.S. than in many other places. Trump often says that the United States finds more cases because it tests more than other nations. We’ve rated that claim False and Pants on Fire, depending on how he says it. Testing is a way to measure progress against the coronavirus, but the key indicator of progress is whether the percentage of tests that come back positive declines as more tests are done.  With a positivity rate of about 7%, the United States ranks in the middle of the pack, doing better than countries such as Mexico and Argentina, but worse than just about every country in Europe, as well as Canada and Australia. Trump said that the United States’ COVID-19 ""numbers are better than almost all countries."" The White House pointed to one number to back that up — the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases. But the source it cited said that wasn’t a good measure of the threat of the disease. By other yardsticks, the United States is doing worse than many countries, including many major developed economies. It has a higher death rate in relation to its population, the virus is known to have reached a larger share of the population, and the percentage of tests that come back positive is higher than in many other nations.

Ad Watch: Is the postmaster general a Republican donor with investments in USPS competitors?
","As new coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country, public health officials have advised Americans to consider voting by mail this fall. But funding for the U.S. Postal Service is up in the air, and the USPS has warned states that it can’t guarantee all mail-in ballots will be counted in time for the November election. The White House isn’t helping. In an Aug. 13 interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump said he opposed including additional funding for the Postal Service — which has lost billions of dollars during the pandemic — in new coronavirus bailout legislation.  Why? Because Democrats want to expand voting by mail. ""They want three and a half billion dollars for the mail-in votes,"" Trump said. ""They want $25 billion, billion, for the post office. Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots."" ""But if they don't get those two items that means you can't have universal mail-in voting because you, they're not equipped to have it."" RELATED: Postal service says its policy is to deliver even mail ballots lacking postage Trump’s comments upset Democrats, who said the president was trying to suppress the vote. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called lawmakers back early from their August recess to vote on legislation that would block the USPS from making operational changes. Trump has long derided the USPS as a waste of federal dollars. But an Aug. 12 ad from an anti-Trump political action committee claimed there may be ulterior motivations for the administration’s comments. ""This is Trump’s new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy,"" says a narrator in the ad, which was published by Really American on Twitter. ""A longtime Republican donor, DeJoy has given over $400,000 to Republicans just this year. Coincidentally, DeJoy and his wife have between $30 and $75 million in assets of direct competitors to the United States Postal Service.""  ""That’s right — they own the competition. The man Trump put in charge of our post office has the most to gain from its destruction."" NEW VIDEO: Trump didn't choose Louis Dejoy to run the Post Office. He chose him to destroy it. #TrumpKillsUSPS pic.twitter.com/OOhJNOSnit The ad has more than 4 million views on Twitter, and similar claims have circulated widely on social media, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. But are they accurate?  We reached out to the postmaster general’s office for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. We also haven’t heard back from Really American. So we dug into DeJoy’s financial records ourselves. We found that the postmaster general has donated more than $440,000 to Republican causes in 2020. DeJoy’s investments in USPS competitors are less certain, but government documents suggest he could own more than $75 million in assets. DeJoy was appointed postmaster general in May. Government documents show that he and his wife have tens of millions of dollars invested in companies that provide services similar to the USPS. DeJoy is the former chairman and CEO of New Breed Logistics, a contract logistics firm in North Carolina. The company helped the USPS process mail for more than 25 years. In 2014, DeJoy sold the company to XPO Logistics, Inc., for $615 million. XPO says it’s a ""top 10 global provider of transportation and logistics services"" and is valued at more than $7.5 billion.  As part of the 2014 deal, DeJoy joined the board of XPO and agreed to use $30 million of his proceeds to buy restricted stock in the company. That brings us to the low point of the range mentioned in Really American’s ad. But what about the rest of the purported assets? DeJoy is married to Aldona Wos, a former U.S. ambassador to Estonia who has been nominated to serve as ambassador to Canada. The Washington Post reported in June that DeJoy and Wos hold ""between $30.1 million and $75.3 million in assets in USPS competitors or contractors, according to Wos’ financial disclosure paperwork filed with the Office of Government Ethics."" A fact-check from USA Today estimated that the couple may have up to $75.8 million in assets. We requested Wos’ 85-page financial disclosure from the Office of Government Ethics to see for ourselves. Here’s a breakdown of Wos and DeJoy’s assets in logistics companies, as of 2019: XPO: $30.2-$75.5 million United Parcel Service: $115,002-$300,000 J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc.: $1,001-$15,000 Forward Air Corp.: $1,001-$15,000 Saia Inc.: $1,001-$15,000 The vast majority of DeJoy and Wos’ holdings are in XPO. However, whether or not XPO is a ""direct competitor"" to the USPS, as Really American claimed, is up for at least a little debate. A 2019 Securities and Exchange Commission filing indicates that, as of 2018, XPO’s ""peer group"" companies included UPS and J.B. Hunt. The Postal Service is not mentioned in the filing, but since XPO arranges more than 10 million last-mile deliveries per year, the company could benefit from a weakened USPS. Really American is correct to say that DeJoy has a financial interest in companies that provide services similar to the USPS. But is the postmaster general also a Republican donor, as the PAC claims? In a word: yes.  According to the Federal Election Commission, DeJoy has contributed more than $440,000 to Republican causes since January 2020. Those causes include the Trump Victory committee, the North Carolina Republican Party, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the (Rep. Kevin) McCarthy Victory Fund. RELATED: How to make sure your ballot is counted this fall In total, DeJoy has contributed more than $915,000 to Trump’s re-election campaign since February 2018, according to the FEC. Congressional Democrats questioned DeJoy’s political and business ties soon after he was appointed in May. CNN reported Aug. 14 that the USPS inspector general is investigating DeJoy for potential ethics conflicts and reviewing some of his policy changes, such as eliminating overtime and slowing some mail delivery. We reached out to the Louis DeJoy and Aldona Wos Family Foundation for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. In an ad, Really American said DeJoy ""gave $400,000 to Republicans just this year"" and has ""between $30 and $75 million in assets of direct competitors to the United States Postal Service."" Data from the Federal Election Commission and the Office of Government Ethics confirms those claims. DeJoy and Wos’ holdings in XPO and UPS alone amount to between $30.3 and $75.8 million, and DeJoy has contributed more than $440,000 to Republican causes since January 2020. Whether XPO is a ""direct competitor"" to the USPS is up for debate, but the company could benefit from a weaker Postal Service. Meanwhile, the USPS inspector general is investigating DeJoy for potential ethics conflicts. The Really American ad is accurate but needs clarification or additional information..

Michelle Obama right that 2 votes per precinct enabled Trump win in Michigan
","During her closing speech on the first night of the virtual Democratic convention, former First Lady Michelle Obama emphasized the high electoral stakes in November by pointing to the narrow margins that vaulted Donald Trump into the White House in 2016. ""In one of the states that determined the outcome, the winning margin averaged out to just two votes per precinct — two votes,"" Obama said. She’s referring to Michigan, and her math is accurate. In the 2016 election, Michigan — one of three crucial states that Trump flipped from the Democrats on his way to victory — had 4,810 precincts.  The final count in the presidential race had Trump with 2,279,543 votes in Michigan and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, with 2,268,839. That’s a winning margin for Trump of 10,704 votes.  Michigan has 83 counties, of which Clinton won only eight. Trump won as much as 74% of the vote in Missaukee County, about 50 miles southeast of Traverse City, where just 7,000 people voted. For her part, Clinton’s best performance was in Washtenaw County, which includes the university town of Ann Arbor, with almost 68% of the roughly 188,000 votes cast. But on average, dividing 10,704 votes by 4,810 precincts leaves 2.23 votes per precinct. As it happened, each of three third party candidates — Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Darrell L. Castle — also won more votes than Trump’s margin over Clinton. Overall, Obama won 20 counties in Michigan, while Clinton won only eight; she lost 12 counties Barack Obama had won in 2012 while he was winning the state as a whole. A crucial shift came in working-class Macomb County, which Obama won by four points but Trump won by 11. Trump’s margin of victory in Macomb County was easily enough to hand the state to Trump by itself.  Obama said, ""In one of the states that determined the outcome"" of the 2016 presidential race, ""the winning margin averaged out to just two votes per precinct — two votes.""

No, Joe Biden doesn’t want to ban fracking and kill the Wisconsin jobs the industry supports
","In a tight race for president, both Republicans and Democrats are pursuing every angle -- and every issue -- in their quest to win.  Fracking is one of the issues that has been picked up by Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and used against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California.  In an Aug. 12, 2020 email, Wisconsin Trump Victory claimed that by choosing Harris as his running mate, Biden is ""putting Wisconsin’s energy workers on notice.""  Trump Victory is a political group led jointly by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.  The email claims that Biden’s selection of Harris is ""a shot across the bow to 100,000 Wisconsinites facing unemployment due to their proposal to eliminate fracking.""  Fracking is a common -- but highly controversial -- technique used to access hard-to-reach oil and gas in rock formations.  Does Biden really support eliminating fracking entirely? And would the elimination of fracking impact 100,000 Wisconsin jobs?  Fracking is short for hydraulic fracturing, a type of drilling that’s used to access oil and natural gas trapped inside rock formations.  Using drills, several wells can be created a mile or more beneath the surface of the earth, and then a mixture of water, sand and other additives are pumped in at high pressure, creating fissures that are held open by the sand. Those small fissures are what allows the trapped gas or oil to flow out of the rock they were trapped in.  The practice, which is used to access resources in the eastern, western and southwestern areas of the country, is the reason that America is able to tap into oil reserves beneath the soil,  according to the American Petroleum Institute.  Although Wisconsin isn’t home to the oil or natural gas that is accessed by fracking, it is home to several sand mines, which produce the specific type of sand needed during the fracking process. Those mines generate jobs of all types, from the industrial workers to truck drivers to even those running the grocery stores in the towns near the mines.  In its email, Trump Victory points multiple times to the March 15, 2020 Democratic debate, in which Biden faced off against U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, then the lone remaining challenger. While talking about climate change, Sanders said that he wants to completely eliminate fracking in America to help with the climate change crisis, to which Biden responded that he does, too.  ""Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that,"" Sanders said.  ""No more, no new fracking,"" Biden said.  That statement was a deviation from Biden’s official position, in which he stated he did not want to outright ban the practice.  Following the debate, a Biden campaign representative clarified the position, saying Biden wants a ban only on new fracking activities on federal lands and waters, according to a PolitiFact item from June 2020, and another from July 2020.  For that reason, PolitiFact has rated claims that Biden wants to halt fracking Mostly False.  Thus, the Trump Victory email gets off to a bad start. The number of actual jobs related to the sand mining industry is actually much smaller than the 100,000 figure listed in the email.  According to the Job Center of Wisconsin, part of the state Department of Workforce Development, the number of all jobs in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction industry was 3,480 in 2019. Even that is a broader figure than just those tied to fracking specifically. But that number doesn’t include related jobs, like those in transportation, manufacturing, finance, healthcare and various other local businesses that are tied to mining.  To support that claim, the Trump Victory email links to a 2011 study by the American Petroleum Institute, which cites 103,300 as the number of direct, indirect and induced jobs provided by the oil and gas industry in Wisconsin.  But a more recent study -- from 2017 -- was available, showing an estimated 98,200 total jobs fueled by the gas and oil industry in the state.  The study breaks down the number this way:  35,000 in natural gas and oil 29,700 in services 10,000 in manufacturing 7,900 in wholesale and retail 3,300 in transportation and warehousing 900 in construction 11,400 in other jobs  Still, those figures are for all oil and gas-related jobs in the state. The number tied to fracking would be smaller, though it’s hard to pinpoint how much smaller. In any case, it’s a vast overstatement to say some 100,000 would face unemployment. So, on this point, Trump Victory uses an outdated report that is offpoint and overshoots the mark.
  Trump Victory said that by backing a ban on fracking, Biden would cost 100,000 Wisconsinites their jobs.  Biden does not support an outright fracking ban, though he did speak inaccurately about his stance on the issue in a March 2020 debate.  As far as the 100,000 jobs, that figure includes a far larger range of jobs than just those related to the fracking industry, taking into account other oil and gas figures.  We rate this claim False.

Viral ShadowGate video makes sweeping, unfounded claims
","Millie Weaver, a correspondent for Infowars, posted on her website on Aug. 3 that ""ShadowGate"" was coming soon.  Billed as perhaps the ""biggest whistleblowing event ever,"" the promised exposé, nearly an hour-and-a-half long, started spreading on social media about two weeks later.  Much in the vein of Infowars, which was created by Alex Jones and promotes conspiracy theories, this video makes sweeping claims about a supposed shadow government puppeteering civil society. But it provides no supporting evidence for its eye-opening claims.  ""What if I were to tell you that a small group of government contractors were hired by government officials to frame the Trump campaign, set him up for the Russia collusion investigation, provided witnesses for the impeachment hearings, and provided administrative support services to the Department of Justice during the Mueller investigation,"" Weaver says as the video starts. ""And what if it just so happened that this same group of government contractors are behind the fake news in mainstream media, influence operations on social media, and the civil unrest nationwide pushing the defund the police movement."" The referenced ""contractors"" form the ""military industrial complex,"" Weaver says. ""These contractors have used their connections, power and influence to create an unprecedented international criminal enterprise where blackmail is traded and people’s personal data is gold."" From there more allegations unfurl without evidence, including that:  - News pundits like Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" are assets for this shadow government. - Polls that showed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton winning the 2016 presidential election by a big margin were an attempt at ""hijacking reality"" to distract from ""the fact that she couldn’t walk, talk, climb stairs.""  - So-called ""Obama phones"" — described as free cell phones for low-income families — ""played a significant role in fostering"" unrest in Ferguson, Mo., after Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager was shot in 2014.  -The whistleblower who told federal officials that President Donald Trump solicited foreign interference from Ukraine in the 2020 election is a ""decoy."" (Here, the ShadowGate video shows several photos of the son of Democratic fundraiser George Soros, Alexander Soros, who has been frequently misidentified as the man some conservatives allege is the whistleblower.) This video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) One of the key tenets of PolitiFact is that the burden of proof is on the speaker. This video and its claims fall woefully short. The ShadowGate narrative hinges on the allegations of two ""whistleblowers,"" someone referred to by the first name of ""Tore,"" who is described as a linguist and intelligence contractor for the U.S. Navy, and Patrick Bergy, who is described as a ""PSYOP Program Developer"" in cyber security for the U.S. Army.  Neither the Navy nor the Army answered our questions about the video, including our efforts to verify their employment history. Though Tore is not given a last name in the video she appears to be Tore Maras-Lindeman, host of the radio show Tore Says who in 2018 announced she was running for mayor of Minot, N.D., with the slogan ""Make Minot Great Again.""    Bergy, meanwhile, recently suggested in a video posted on YouTube that Weaver had recently been arrested because of her work exposing the deep state. Actually, Weaver and her boyfriend were arrested on charges of robbery, tampering with evidence, obstructing justice and domestic violence, Fox News reported.  Davey Alba, a reporter for the New York Times covering disinformation, tweeted on Aug. 16 that an emergency legal fund for Weaver had raised more than $88,000. By Aug. 17, it was at more than $161,000. ""So many tactics are colliding with this piece of misinformation,"" Alba said about the ShadowGate video. ""To be clear: QAnon is largely behind the spread of this video.""  The QAnon conspiracy theory similarly swirls around secret hands, pitting the president against a ""deep state"" set on undermining him. Recent misinformation perpetuated by its believers wrongly claimed that the explosion at the port of Beirut was actually a bombing involving the Rothschild family, and that the online home goods retailer Wayfair was mixed up in a global child sex-trafficking ring. What’s also clear here: while the ShadowGate video makes incredible claims about the government, they amount to an unfounded conspiracy theory that recasts recent major news events — like Black Lives Matter demonstrations, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and news coverage that’s unflattering to the president — as the product of secret meddling by the U.S. government. The theory is baseless. Black Lives Matter protests arose from anger and grief over police killings of unarmed black men. Mueller didn’t find evidence that Trump knowingly conspired with the Kremlin.

Loretta Weinberg said House GOP budget would effectively double student loan interest rates
","
A Democratic lawmaker wants Gov. Chris Christie to use his time on the national stage to voice the concerns of New Jersey taxpayers.

And the Republican governor should start by campaigning against a GOP budget proposal, Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg said.

""The governor could begin by using his newfound national political prominence to urge his party to reject the budget proposal put forward by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and recently approved in the House of Representatives along partisan lines,"" Weinberg (D-Bergen) wrote in an opinion column published April 30 on NorthJersey.com.

""The Ryan budget would be devastating for the state and the nation,"" she said. ""It would curtail Pell grants for New Jersey scholars who would otherwise be unable to afford higher education, and it would effectively double the interest paid out on existing and future student loans.""

With the debate over student loan interest rates still raging, PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether Weinberg’s portrayal of the potential increase was accurate. Mostly, it’s not.

Let’s first note that PolitiFact National recently examined a similar claim by President Barack Obama’s campaign that ""Under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double."" PolitiFact National rated that False because the statement referred to Mitt Romney, who has said he opposes allowing the rate to double. In our case, we are looking at the more narrow claim about the Ryan budget.

The planned hike in rates stems from a law passed in 2007, when Democrats held the majority in Congress. That year, with bipartisan support, Congress passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which gradually reduced interest rates for federally subsidized Stafford loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent.

There are two types of Stafford loans: subsidized loans don’t accrue interest while a student is in school, but unsubsidized loans do.

The 2007 law only decreased interest rates for subsidized loans. But the law was temporary and if no legislative action is taken the rate returns to 6.8 percent on July 1.

That increase would only affect students taking out new loans. It would not impact existing loans, as Weinberg said.

Weinberg acknowledged her error, saying her point was ""not well articulated.""

""It does not affect existing loans, but it does affect existing students who may need new loans,"" she said.

So how does the House Republican budget proposal fit into this debate?

The Republican plan, which serves as a blueprint, does not address how to extend the lower rate. Obama’s budget request includes a one-year extension.

""The Ryan budget does not include any proposal to postpone the rate increase,"" said Jason Delisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation. But, he said, ""the House Republicans did pass a bill to prevent the rate increase from happening and the Ryan budget isn’t legislation. It’s not a law.""

The House passed a bill on April 27 that funds the rate extension with money for preventive health care programs from the new federal health care law. A spokesman for the House Budget Committee said that extension is ""fully compatible with the House-passed budget."" The White House threatened to veto the measure because of how it is funded.

Weinberg said the Republican bill ""passed in a way that’s going to make sure that it’s not really going to pass.""

Democratic proposals to pay for the extension include ending a payroll tax exemption for some business owners and ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies.

Our ruling

Weinberg said that the House Republicans budget proposal ""would effectively double the interest paid out on existing and future student loans.""

The Republican budget plan does not stop a planned increase in interest rates for federally subsidized undergraduate loans.

But the potential hike, which would only affect new loans -- not existing loans, is the result of an expiration date built into a 2007 law.

Those are ""critical facts that would give a different impression."" We rate Weinberg’s statement Mostly False.

Memphis Mayor A C Wharton says tax increase not for city government services
","
""It’s all about the schools,"" Memphis Mayor A C Wharton said the day before his administration made its first budget proposal to the City Council since Memphians, in another Wharton landslide, elected him to what is technically his first full four-year term as the city’s CEO.

Wharton said that while Memphians would be paying more in property taxes than they did for the 2011-12 fiscal year, it was because of the court-mandated funding of Memphis City Schools. He was asking for the City Council to set a total tax rate of $3.66 per $100 of assessed value, up from the current $3.19.

In practical terms, that means taxes on a $150,000 home would jump to $1,372.09 annually, up $176.25 from the current $1,195.84.

And yet, while Wharton freely acknowledges he’s asking for a tax increase, he claims core city government services would be funded with the same amount of property tax revenues in FY 2013 as they were in FY 2012.

""It's all about the schools,"" Wharton said. ""We will not ask for a tax increase to run city government. The budget I present will be clear. We'll operate city government on the same amount we used last year.""

Wharton explains the apparent contradiction -- taxpayers paying more taxes but funding the same amount of government -- by pointing to the $65 million the city is required to give to MCS for one final year. The city’s schools are being transferred to Shelby County after the 2012-13 school year, at which point the city’s court-ordered obligation to help MCS with its nearly $900 million budget will end.*

Wharton and his finance director, Roland McElrath, agreed to an interview to defend the mayor’s claims.

For the 2012 budget year, when the property tax rate was $3.19 per $100 of assessed value, the city allocated only 18 cents for the schools -- the remaining $3.01 was for the general fund that finances government. The city cobbled together the remainder of the approximately $74.2 million needed for its portion of school funding in other ways. For one example, the city generated $20 million through a refinancing of its debt service.

But for the 2013 budget year, Wharton wants a straightforward payment to schools to flow directly out of property taxes -- and since each penny of the tax rate generates $1 million in revenue, the city claims it is simply adding 0.47 to the 0.18 that was allocated for schools last year to get to 0.65. Add that 0.65 to the 3.01 and you get the 3.66 property tax rate Wharton proposes.  

Another way to think of it: Wharton is saying that the first 301 pennies on the tax rate for FY 2013 will go to fund city government with the remainder going to schools, just like the first 301 pennies on the tax rate for 2012 were allocated to fund city government with the remainder going to schools.

It’s important to note that the city draws revenues from many areas, including various other taxes and fees, but property taxes are by far the city’s single-largest source of revenues, representing around half the city’s budget.

Jim Strickland, the budget chairman for the City Council, is among those asking Wharton to find ways to cut government services to lessen the impact on taxpayers. Strickland believes the mayor should do more to lower taxes, saying ""this is the third tax increase he’s asked for"" since winning a special election in 2009 to finish out the final 27 months of Willie Herenton’s fifth term.

But he said Wharton’s framing of the issue is technically accurate, even if it essentially allows him to shift blame for the spike in taxes: ""In that direct quote, I’m pretty sure he’s right.""

McElrath and Wharton did acknowledge this -- their budget proposal calls for $22 million more in spending on those core non-schools government services. The budget proposal for FY 2013 calls for $628 million in spending on non-schools government services; current projections for FY 2012 show $606 million in spending on non-schools government services.

That reflects increases in spending in public safety, especially in the police division where the administration has every incentive to back police director Toney Armstrong in his second full year as chief. But Wharton said the budget also recommends serious cuts -- for instance, closing some libraries and a golf course and scaling back hours at some community centers and city pools. Wharton had the finance department send documents showing how spending trends in city government are all related to more money for public safety but less for everything else.

To Strickland, Wharton is masking his decision to increase spending and avoid some difficult cuts by telling taxpayers that 65 cents of the tax rate is going directly to schools.

""The point is, it doesn’t matter what you are asking for, it’s hitting the taxpayer in the same way,"" Strickland said. (EDITOR'S NOTE:  UPDATE: The original version of this story included a claim from Strickland that Wharton’s proposed tax rate would be the ""highest we’ve ever had."" We removed that quote because the administration’s budget shows that the overall tax rate for FY 1980 for Memphis was, in fact, 3.74 -- higher than Wharton's proposed 3.66 this year.)

Our ruling

Memphis’s mayor says that a property tax increase is not in fact a tax increase to fund core government services. Rather, it’s a one-time assessment to cover the city’s final year of court-ordered funding obligations for the city’s dissolving school system.

Wharton’s finance team was able to create a budget allocating the various revenues so that the amount of the property-tax rate going to fund general government services is the same for 2013 as it was in 2012. But because the budget shows overall government spending increasing by $22 million -- about 3.6 percent -- that bit of needed clarification means the  Truth-O-Meter dial points to Mostly True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Jobs', 'Transportation', 'Sheldon Whitehouse']","
Sheldon Whitehouse said $47 billion raised over 10 years by passage of the Buffett rule tax on millionaires could generate 611,000 jobs
","
The Buffett Rule, a proposal to force millionaires to pay federal taxes at a rate of least 30 percent, has turned into a hot-button issue, even if it stands little chance of passage.

Formally known as the ""Paying A Fair Share Act of 2012,"" it failed a test vote in the U.S. Senate on April 16 after Republicans blocked it.

When its chief sponsor, Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, spoke on the Senate floor about the projected $47 billion it would raise over 10 years, he suggested that the money could be used to rebuild roads and bridges and, in the process, underwrite jobs -- lots of jobs.

""The Senate Republican leader has described the bill as yet another proposal from the White House that won't create a single job or lower the price at the pump by a penny,"" Whitehouse said. ""Well, the minority leader is absolutely right that the aim of this bill is not to lower the unemployment rate or the price of gasoline. However, if you put the $47 billion in revenue into infrastructure you could create 611,000 infrastructure jobs, and a lot of good infrastructure as well.""

Earlier in the speech he made the same point: ""We could use the $47 billion on badly needed infrastructure projects and create 611,000 jobs nationwide.""

That's 13,000 jobs for every billion spent, or $76,923 per job. One of our readers pointed out that if you spread that over the 10 years that Whitehouse was talking about, that's only $7,692 per year, or a measly $148 per week, about half the federal poverty level. And that wouldn't include paying the costs of the building materials needed for an infrastructure project.

When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson directed us to two documents.

It turns out -- based on the first document, a May 2009 report by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) -- that the 13,000 ""jobs"" aren't jobs. Those are job-years. That's one job lasting one year, a distinction Whitehouse didn't make clear anywhere in his speech.

In that study, the CEA forecasts that spending $1 billion would create 10,870 jobs for one year at a cost of $92,000 for each of those one-year jobs. (We'll leave it up to others to decide whether that's a reasonable price to create a single job.)

The second document, a notice in the Federal Register from the U.S. Department of Transportation, says in a footnote that the CEA had revised its estimate, concluding that each billion spent on transportation infrastructure would create 13,000 one-year jobs.

So if $4.7 billion were raised per year by enactment of the Buffett Rule, that would be, on average, 61,100 jobs for that year. If those people continued to work on those infrastructure projects over the 10-year period, that would still be only 61,100 new jobs, not 611,000.

How reliable are these estimates?

PolitiFact Ohio looked at this issue on Oct. 26, 2011, when U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette claimed that $1 billion in infrastructure investment translates to 42,000 jobs. That statement was ruled Half True because the estimates were all over the map.

LaTourette was citing an old number, used by both Republicans and Democrats, from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration. The newer estimate was 27,800 jobs for every billion spent. Before the recession, a University of Massachusetts study said a billion dollars in infrastructure spending created 18,000 jobs.

We put out calls and e-mails to a lot of people asking about the reliability of these numbers, including the Council of Economic Advisers (via the White House), a former member of the council who worked there during the Bush administration, the Cato Institute and several universities. We only received two responses.

""This is guesswork at best,"" and different economists will find such analyses more plausible than others, said Laurence Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University who served as a senior economist on the CEA during the Reagan era. (He is also running for U.S. president as part of the Americans Elect campaign to nominate a candidate via the Internet.)

Arthur Mead, an economist at the University of Rhode Island, said, ""You're always going to get a difference of opinion"" on how many jobs will be generated if the government cycles money through the economy, known as the multiplier effect. ""Depending on how much labor is involved, the size of the multiplier will be different.""

And while liberal Democrat-leaning economists are more tempted to believe such investments will be a big boost to the economy because there are lots of people looking for work, conservative Republican-leaning economists might think the benefits will be less, fearing it will drive up wages and interest rates.

""Each side has an element of truth to it,"" Mead said. ""There's always going to be a difference in terms of how they look at it.""

Said Larson, the Whitehouse spokesman: ""As noted by the FHWA [Federal Highway Administration], these projections change over time. That's why we chose to use the most recent -- and the more conservative -- formula available, which is also the one used by the Obama administration.""

Our ruling

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said $47 billion raised by the Buffett Rule could finance 611,000 jobs for people rebuilding the nation's infrastructure.

But that's not really 611,000 jobs. It's job-years. It's the equivalent of 61,100 people employed full-time for just one year. To get to 611,000, you'd have to fire those 61,000 at the end of the year and then rehire another 61,000, and do that for a total of 10 years.

Because he didn't give it a clearer context, the 611,000 is misleading. When we think of a job, it's not working for just one year.

Also missing is the fact that these types of estimates -- even from reputable groups cited by both parties -- can vary widely.

To his credit, Whitehouse was citing an estimate that translates into fewer jobs than what other sources say. But the certainty of his statement is undercut by the mushiness of the underlying economic projections.

Ultimately, if everyone hired with this money stayed on the job for 10 years, Whitehouse would be off by a whopping 549,900 jobs.

For that reason, we rate his statement False.

Is it true that Charlie Hales in the private sector never billed a single hour to the city of Portland?
","
Charlie Hales was a Portland city commissioner in 2002 when he accepted a job offer from HDR to pitch streetcars around the country. He left in June of that year, without completing his term in office. 

His critics have complained about this for two reasons. One, Hales quit while in office. And two, he took a job with a company that conducted business with the city. It rarely looks good for an elected official to jump to a private company that makes money off that city’s taxpayers.  

One of Hales’ chief opponents, Eileen Brady, said she would propose an ordinance calling for a time-out period between elected officials leaving office and taking a job with a company that does business with the city.

Hales raised the word ""insinuendo"" in response. Here’s what he said:

""I took a position with a company where I then immediately proceeded to work all over the country in cities everywhere but Portland. I never billed a single hour of my time to the City of Portland in the last 10 years, so, no revolving door. I held myself to that standard for just the very reason and just the very concern that was just mentioned a minute ago. So I held myself to that highest ethical standard and never ever had a conflict of interest with my former employer, the city of Portland.""

We know that’s a long chunk to read. But the response is important in its entirety. Because we understand his response to mean that in the last decade Hales never conducted business with the city on behalf of his employer.

So we were surprised to learn that Hales and HDR bid on a contract in 2007, when the Portland Office of Transportation issued a bid for the Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan. HDR did not get the contract.

Hales’ office confirmed he was involved in trying to land the contract. They said he has helped submit bids on hundreds of projects across the country, and just this one in Portland in the time he's been away from City Hall.

""There is nothing unethical about responding to a request for proposals. No money changed hands, and the proposal was not accepted,"" Hales said through his campaign manager, Jessica Moskovitz.

Hales violated no ethics laws or rules by bidding on a city contract five years after leaving office. But his full-bodied explanation at the debate led us to believe he kept his distance from the city in order to hold himself to ""that highest ethical standard.""

There was no revolving door, because he didn’t get in. It’s true Hales has never billed the city for his work with HDR -- but it wasn’t for lack of trying. The statement contains an element of truth -- he never billed the city -- but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about Hales’ business relationship with the city.

Did the City of Portland agree to treat its water because a contractor said we should?
","
In response to a question about rising utility rates, State Rep. Jefferson Smith said at the debate that mayors should guard against boondoggles. PolitiFact Oregon totally agrees with Smith that boondoggles are bad. But our ears perked up at what he said next. 

""The most important principle, I think, for a mayor is to be on boondoggle watch,"" he said. ""Is to make sure that if somebody is trying to build a set of water treatment plants to cure us from cryptosporidium we don’t have, we don't say yes even if CH2M Hill wants us to.""

Last time we looked, the city did find cryptosporidium in our drinking water. Not a lot, but there were traces.

More importantly, we think, the City of Portland agreed to build a treatment plant to guard against cryptosporidium not because of a contractor but because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency demanded it. (We no longer have to build as of March.)

CH2M Hill, an engineering and construction company, certainly has been involved with the Water Bureau. The company would have gotten a piece of the contract for the UV treatment system we no longer have to build.

We asked Smith to comment. And he said of course he didn’t mean to imply that CH2M Hill was behind the treatment mandate; he knows it came from the federal government.

The broader point he was trying to make ""is the power behind these big projects can be immense"" and it can be far too easy for government to make decisions based on what powerful interest groups want rather than what’s important to the public.

Certainly, large companies have the power to cajole officials into making some projects more important than others. But that’s not what Smith said at the debate. To the casual listener, Smith said that we don’t have cryptosporidium but we’re building plants to treat for it because a corporation wants us to.

Could City of Portland have saved itself the cost of building the $138 million Powell Butte reservoir?
","
Portland’s tap water is a big deal. We’ve had impassioned debates over covering the open reservoirs that hold our drinking water at Mount Tabor and at Washington Park, which are lovely to look at but considered unsafe by the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency ordered the city to find a way to quit drinking from the uncovered reservoirs.  

In response, the Portland Water Bureau agreed to build underground water storage facilities elsewhere and to take open reservoir water offline. Asked about rising utility rates, Eileen Brady said she wouldn’t have spent money complying with the requirement:

""In the Water Bureau, I probably this year wouldn’t have worked to fund some of the projects that are going to invest in covering our reservoirs. For instance, the Powell Butte project that is going up. I think we started too early on that. We could have saved ourselves the cost.""

Could we have saved ourselves the cost? This is the kind of statement that perturbs Water Bureau officials, who argue they had to prepare to comply.

The city was required to have an EPA-approved reservoir replacement timeline by April 1, 2009 (that’s in the rule). In May 2011, the council approved an $80 million contract with a California company to build the tank. (This 2008 letter makes clear that the EPA was bent on compliance.)

Brady, a longtime advocate of leaving Portland’s water alone, says she would have pushed to halt money for the Powell Butte project. After all, her campaign says, look at U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY, who complained about the one-size-fits all nature of the mandate. The EPA agreed to review the rule.

But as we pointed out in a previous PolitiFact, Oregon is not New York and our pleas went nowhere.

Brady claims we could have saved ourselves the trouble. Maybe we could have, but that April 1, 2009, deadline was set in rule.

Does Charlie Hales want to give a 'sweeping break' to developers to build infill housing?
","
Asked about road maintenance at last week’s mayoral debate, state Rep. Jefferson Smith, brought up the very sexy phrase ""systems development charges"" and used the opportunity to criticize the third leading candidate in the mayoral race, former city Commissioner Charlie Hales.

Systems development charges are paid by developers -- of housing, new retail buildings, etc. -- to offset the effect of more people on roads, water, sewer and parks. The money goes toward infrastructure to handle more people.

""But one difference is is that I don’t agree with Mr. Hales that we should give a sweeping break to the developers to allow them to build that infill housing without paying for those very basics. So before we talk about spending new money, or even spending old money, let’s make sure we don’t give away the money we already have,"" Smith said.

Does Hales want to give ""a sweeping break"" to housing developers as Smith claims?

Apparently Hales does, but it’s not limited to housing developers. He’s called for a two-year moratorium on systems development charges, saying that they squash business, including the food cart operator looking for a solid building or the retailer who wants to move into bigger space. And yes, we need cheaper, more affordable homes in the city, his campaign says.

By limiting his comment to housing developers, who are unpopular in some circles, Smith was suggesting Hales has a cozy relationship with one group when his proposal is broader. Hales wants to grant this ""sweeping break"" to all developers, including the more sympathetic food cart operators. (In fact, Hales says these charges make no sense within the city, where infrastructure already exists.)

Hard to believe, but we have another fact check on systems development charges. After all, there was no way Charlie Hales was going to take criticism lightly on the wonky subject. Hales pointed out to Jefferson Smith that development charges have nothing to do with maintenance, which is what the question was about.

""Actually, Jefferson,"" Hales said, ""under state law, and it’s something you should know, systems development charges can only be spent on capital investment. They can’t be spent on maintenance. We have a maintenance problem. That’s a different pot of revenue. It’s not what systems development charges pays for.""

Smith argued that if we’re not collecting systems development charges to pay for capital construction related to growth then that money has to come out of the general fund that should be used to pay for maintenance.

Who’s right?

Smith is flatly inaccurate in suggesting the law has changed. (He and his campaign later clarified that he did not mean to suggest the law had changed.)

Barack Obama's ""Life of Julia"" tool says Mitt Romney would allow student loan rates to double
","
The Obama campaign has created Julia, a character on its website, to show the contrasts between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. 
""The Life of Julia"" is a Web cartoon that claims Julia would have a richer and more rewarding life under Obama than under Romney. 
The cartoon compares the candidates' impact on Julia at a dozen points in her life. For this item, we're checking the claim about Julia at age 25. 
""Under President Obama: After graduation, Julia's federal student loans are more manageable since President Obama capped income-based federal student loan payments and kept interest rates low. She makes her payments on time every month, keeping her on track to repay her student loans."" 
""Under Mitt Romney: Under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double, affecting Julia and 7.4 million other students."" 
That surprised us because we recalled Romney and House Republican leaders saying recently that they did not want the rates to double. So we looked into the claim. 
What’s at stake 
First, some background on the student loan issue. 
As PolitiFact Ohio noted recently, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (H.R. 2669) was passed by Congress in 2007. The law gradually reduced the interest rate on federally subsidized loans to undergraduate student borrowers from 6.8 percent in July 2006 to 3.4 percent in July 2011. 
Advanced by a newly Democratic-majority Congress, the law had bipartisan support. Democrats were joined by 77 House Republicans and 35 Senate Republicans. The bill was signed by President George W. Bush. 
The law expires in July and if no action is taken, the interest rate will return to 6.8 percent. That would affect more than 7 million borrowers, and add $1,000 a year to the repayment cost of the average loan, according to Education Secretary Arne Duncan. 
Obama's budget proposal for fiscal 2013 included money to extend the lower rate, though only for one year. Romney, Ryan and House Republican leaders would also keep it at 3.4 percent, although they want to pay for it by repealing a portion of the Democratic health care law. 
Romney’s position on the loan issue 
During a campaign of sharp disagreements, the student loan rate is a rare example of unity between Obama and Romney. 
At an April 23, 2012, campaign appearance near Philadelphia, Romney said, ""I support extending the temporary relief on interest rates for students"" given the ""extraordinarily poor conditions in the job market."" 
The Associated Press reported that Romney did not offer specifics on how the extension should be paid for or how long it should last, and as we will explain below, resolving these differences will not be easy. 
Still, the comments indicate that Julia's rates wouldn't rise under Romney as the cartoon suggests. 
Romney’s position on the Ryan budget 
But note that Obama campaign attempts to link Romney to the budget produced by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Democrats have made the Ryan budget a centerpiece of their attacks since it would likely lead to deep cuts in federal spending, including reductions in popular programs. 
The Obama campaign pointed us to two pieces of evidence to link Romney to Ryan’s budget. 
First, Romney said at a March campaign event in Chicago, ""I'm very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. It's a bold and exciting effort on his part and on the part of the Republicans, and it's very much consistent with what I put out earlier. ... I applaud it. It's an excellent piece of work and very much needed."" 
Second, the Obama campaign quotes Ryan saying on the March 25, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation that he expects Romney to implement his budget proposal if he wins the presidency. When CBS’ Norah O’Donnell asked Ryan, ""If Mitt Romney became president of the United States, you`re convinced he would follow through with a lot of the reductions that you make in this plan?"" Ryan twice said ""yes."" 
But these statements are hardly a slam-dunk that Romney has embraced the entire Ryan budget -- nor that it will be enacted. While Romney praised the proposal, he stopped short of promising to enact it. 
Then there’s the question of what the Ryan budget would actually do regarding student loans. 
What Ryan would do 
The Ryan budget is a blueprint, with significant discretion left for future congressional actions on the specifics about revenues and spending. Nowhere in the budget does it say, ""Allow the rates on student loans to double."" The budget could result in a doubling of rates (or perhaps a smaller increase) if that’s what Congress chooses to do in the future. However, Congress could choose to protect the lower interest rates and cut elsewhere instead. 
""Democrats are claiming that the House-passed budget doubled the rate because it did not directly address the question of how to extend it,"" said Conor Sweeney, a spokesman for the House Budget Committee, which Ryan chairs. ""This is not how a budget works. The budget sets overall targets and gives committees of jurisdiction broad latitude in meeting those targets."" 
As it happens, the brouhaha on the campaign trail over student loans prompted Republican leaders on April 27 to vote on a bill to stop the rate from doubling. The bill would continue the 3.4 percent rate and pay for it by repealing a provision of Obama’s health care law known as the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The bill passed by a 215-195 vote. The coalition in support was predominantly but not exclusively Republican; 13 Democrats voted for the GOP leadership-backed bill while 30 Republicans defected and voted against it. 
So both parties want to keep the rate the same. The sticking point is how to pay for it. Many Democrats, including the White House, are strongly opposed to repealing the health fund, which supports immunization, research, screenings and wellness education. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has labeled the money a ""slush fund,"" a characterization Republicans have long used for the program. PolitiFact rated the term as a Pants on Fire falsehood a year ago. 
Sweeney, the Ryan spokesman, said the bill that passed the House ""is fully compatible with our budget’s targets."" And Ryan himself voted for it. 
The parties are so polarized that it's not clear how they might compromise on the issue. Still, a majority of the House, including a large majority of Republicans, did go on record to support a bill that would keep the interest rate from doubling. 
Our ruling 
The Obama campaign claims that loan rates would double on Julia under Romney and the Ryan budget. But the evidence suggests otherwise. 
Romney opposes allowing the rates to double, and House Republicans -- including Ryan -- have voted to stop it from happening. Their approach to pay for the extension may not suit the White House, but it's inaccurate to say the rates would double. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2012/may/04/barack-obama/barack-obamas-life-julia-tool-says-mitt-romney-wou/
"['Gas Prices', 'Wisconsin', 'Eric Hovde']","
 Eric Hovde says economic policies are what’s making gas prices go higher
","
In late March 2012, gas prices in the Milwaukee area hit a record high, $4.20 a gallon, according to AAA Wisconsin.

While prices have come down, to about $3.83 a gallon, that milestone ignited a new round in the political blame game. We’ve heard some of these claims many times -- there’s not enough oil drilling, we’re too dependent on foreign oil, Obama is standing in the way of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. (PolitiFact’s National site has an entire section devoted to the topic.)

In Wisconsin, a radio ad  from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde tapped into the frustration that many motorists feel when they fill their tanks.

In the ad, Hovde says Obama and Congress are spending wildly, and ""this causes the Federal Reserve to crank up the presses printing more and more money.""

""So the United States dollar is being devalued resulting in the prices for our basic necessities like food and oil to rise,"" Hovde says. ""These failed economic policies are making gas prices higher while America’s economy is running on fumes.""

He elaborated in an April 24, 2012 appearance at the Milwaukee Press Club.

""What printing money does is it debases the currency and devalues the dollar,"" Hovde said. ""That is why oil prices are $100 a barrel, and why gas prices are over $4. … If we don’t stop the Fed from quantitative easing, you could be looking at, within a matter of years, I’m talking about six or eight or 10 dollars for a gallon of gas.""

Wow. Those are startling numbers.

""You can track this,"" Hovde said when asked for backup to his claim. ""It’s written extensively about. I’m not the only out there talking about this.""

For a deeper look at the first-time candidate’s claims, we dialed up some experts on oil and gasoline prices.

John Felmy, chief economist, American Petroleum Institute, a key oil industry trade group: Felmy said gasoline prices very closely follow the price of oil. There’s been a record level of demand for oil worldwide and some supply constraints, in part because Libya is currently not exporting oil.

""It’s a tight market, and there’s not a lot of excess capacity,"" Felmy said, adding that gasoline prices ""are driven more by overall supply and demand.""

He said that there was no question that a devalued dollar affected the price of oil, but he said it was more of an indirect factor: ""I go back to Econ 101 and the old supply and demand curves. I tend to believe it’s really the market fundamentals.""

To understand the cost of a price of a gallon of gas, divide the price of a barrel of crude oil by 42 gallons -- the amount that one barrel will produce. So, at $105 a barrel, that’s $2.50 a gallon. State and local taxes add, on average, 49 cents to that. Add in the cost to refine the oil into gas, storage, shipping and profits along the way, including for the gas stations, and you’re quite close to the pump price, API spokesman Bill Bush said.

Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst, Oil Price Information Service, which follows prices for groups, including AAA: ""Prices rose first because of higher crude prices -- U.S. domestic crude advanced to about $110 (a barrel) and overseas sweet crudes fetched a price as high as $130.""

The reasons behind the prices increases include ""growing consumption in emerging economies; money that has been parked (whether through passive investment or active speculation) in crude oil purchases; and worries about Iranian supply and other MENA (Middle East, North African) country issues.""

Kloza said that a weaker dollar ""exerts upward pressure on oil, since all oil transactions are priced in dollars.""

Pam Moen, spokeswoman for AAA Wisconsin: Many experts blamed rising tensions with Iran over that country’s nuclear program. ""If this were to escalate, there could be some disruption caused by Iran in the world’s oil supply,"" she said.

Prices in the Milwaukee market were also higher than the rest of the state because the area is required to used a most-expensive ""reformulated"" gasoline, she said. Also, supplies tend to tighten and prices go up in late winter as refineries switch from winter to summer fuel blends.

Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist for Mesirow Financial, a private financial services firm in Chicago, who frequently comments on the economy: There is ""no correlation between Fed actions and the price of gasoline.""

It’s simple supply and demand, PolitiFact Georgia wrote in 2011. Geopolitical forces on the other side of the world are a major price driver, as is the state of the global economy. Energy technology plays a role too.

""It’s really complex to explain to people how energy markets work. So in campaigns people are always looking for the bumper sticker,"" Jay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton and author of the book ""A Declaration of Energy Independence"" told PolitiFact Georgia.

Hovde said others have written extensively about the same link he is making, between the budget and monetary policies and gas prices. He did not point us to anything in particular.

We searched and didn’t find much evidence to substantiate this claim.

One oft-cited piece was a May 16, 2011 commentary produced by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives.

""In much the same way that one can use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to measure the cost of living, one can index the price of oil, an international commodity, to the value of the dollar (to) measure the impact of the dollar’s declining value on the price of oil.""

The paper concludes that if the value of the dollar remained unchanged since the Fed began using monetary policy in 2008,  ""the price of oil (Brent Crude) would be $17.04 per barrel less."" The paper applies the same logic to gas prices, concluding that the price of a gallon of gas is 56.5 cents higher than if the dollar had not declined.

The commentary, however, doesn’t take into account any of the factors cited by other experts that affect the price of oil -- rising Mideast tensions, greater demand from China, and so forth.

The committee’s staff report, was cited in numerous blogs and opinion pieces, including one published by the San Francisco Examiner on May 17, 2011 by the committee’s vice chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas.

Our rating

Hovde claimed that actions by Obama, Congress and the Fed’s monetary policy had devalued dollar led to higher gas prices.

The candidate uses a broad brush to describe the Federal Reserve’s actions in the wake of the financial market and housing meltdown. The value of the dollar factors into the equation, but as a secondary factor.

Obama has added more to national debt than the previous 43 presidents combined, chain e-mail states
","UPDATE: A more recent version of a similar claim is available here.  When it comes to increasing the national debt, President Barack Obama has done more than his 43 predecessors combined.

Well, at least that’s according to a chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey, echoing a claim made to varying degrees by different Republican officials in recent years. With the subject line ""A picture is worth 1,000 words,"" the chain e-mail features a graphic to make its case.

Above pictures of Presidents George Washington and George W. Bush, one side of the graphic reads ""Debt Added By The Previous 43 U.S. PRESIDENTS COMBINED --- 1789 through 2008."" Beneath the presidents’ photos is ""$6.3 TRILLION DOLLARS.""

On the other side of the graphic is a photo of a smiling Obama, beneath the words ""Debt Added By PRESIDENT OBAMA --- One Term!"" The amount listed below the photo is ""$6.5 TRILLION DOLLARS.""

A picture may be worth 1,000 words, but the wording of this chain e-mail makes for a largely inaccurate claim.

The main problem is the chain e-mail suggests that Obama already has ""added"" $6.5 trillion to the national debt. His administration is on track to add nearly that amount to one form of debt by October 2013, but the president has not added that much debt yet.

First, let’s explain the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.

The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare. On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, the debt held by the public -- as accrued by Obama’s predecessors -- stood at roughly $6.307 trillion and the total debt was about $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator. Since the amount listed for Obama's predecessors in the chain e-mail appears to be in reference to the $6.307 trillion in debt held by the public on Jan. 20, 2009, that's the starting point for our analysis. Next, we'll show how much both forms of debt had increased as of April 27, 2012 -- the last date available at the time we received the chain e-mail.

By that date, the debt held by the public was about $10.8 trillion and total debt had climbed to roughly $15.6 trillion.

So, under Obama’s watch, debt held by the public had increased by about $4.5 trillion, or roughly 72 percent. Total debt had increased by nearly $5 trillion, or about 47 percent.

By either form of debt, the amounts added during Obama’s administration were not greater than the levels on the day he took office.

Now, let’s explain one way that this chain e-mail could be considered accurate.

If we take into account administration projections for debt held by the public as of the end of fiscal year 2013, then the amount of that debt added would exceed the level from Jan. 20, 2009. Fiscal year 2013 is the last budget year to begin during Obama’s first term.

According to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, debt held by the public is estimated to be about $12.636 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2013, which concludes Sept. 30, 2013.

Based on that estimate, the amount of debt held by the public that was added during Obama’s tenure would be about $6.329 trillion, surpassing the amount as of his inauguration by about $22 billion.

In terms of total debt -- projected to increase to $17.5 trillion -- the amount added by the end of fiscal year 2013 would still not exceed the total amount on Jan. 20, 2009. Before we get to our ruling, it's worth noting that actions taken by both Presidents Bush and Obama have contributed to the debt increases over the last decade. Those factors include tax cuts enacted under Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which were started by the Bush administration, as well as the stimulus bill and another tax cut deal approved by Obama. Experts also have pointed to the weak economy as a contributing factor to the higher debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits.

Our ruling

A chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims that Obama has ""added"" $6.5 trillion to the national debt, while his 43 predecessors added $6.3 trillion combined.

But the chain e-mail is wrong to suggest the additional debt during Obama’s tenure already has exceeded the level of his predecessors. In terms of both debt held by the public and total debt, the Obama administration has added less debt than the amounts in place when he took office.

Still, the national debt is projected to keep increasing. The amount of added debt held by the public may exceed Obama’s predecessors by October 2013, according to White House projections.

""When housing and transportation costs are combined, Atlanta’s cost of living -- typically perceived as relatively low -- ranks as 7th worst out of 51 metros nationally,"" the ad said.  

Seventh-worst? And here we were, feeling smug about paying less for a mortgage on a three-bedroom house than our Yankee cousins shell out to rent a studio apartment.

Is this true?

If voters approve this tax hike July 31, it would raise an estimated $7.2 billion to build transportation projects across the region. About $1 billion would go to projects with a more local focus.  

Backers argue the transportation special local option sales tax, also known as T-SPLOST, would reduce congestion and bring jobs to town. Opponents think it would cost too much and pay for the wrong projects.

We fished around for data on Atlanta’s cost of living and found a new but widely used measure called the ""H+T Affordability Index."" Certain urban planners consider it to be a better measure of a town’s cost of living because it takes transportation into account.  

It’s published by the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a Chicago-based nonprofit that researches and promotes ""sustainable"" communities, or ones designed to provide a better quality of life, help the environment and be affordable.  

Its index is based, in part, on mathematical models.  

The U.S. Census Bureau tracks yearly costs for housing but not transportation. So the index uses mathematical models created with the help of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution to estimate transportation costs. The methodology was peer-reviewed and published by an academic journal in 2008.

The index has been well received. Last year, the planning agency for the Washington area used the H+T approach to study that region’s affordability, while the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it is building on the model to create its own affordability index.

In February, the Center for Neighborhood Technology released a ranking of annual transportation costs for the nation’s 51 metro areas with populations of 1 million and up.  

It found that if a typical American family moved to the New York City metro area, they’d spend nearly $10,160 per year on transportation. That’s the cheapest on the list.

The most expensive is Birmingham. If a typical family moved there, their costs would rise to $14,930.

Atlanta is eighth-highest, or one notch less expensive than Citizens for Transportation Mobility said in its ad. Yearly costs topped $14,300,

But this particular H+T ranking addresses transportation costs only -- not housing and transportation costs combined. The group, however, does have that information.
So we built our own list.

Incomes, the price of housing, the number of cars a household owns and other factors vary by metro area. This means that comparing dollar values for these expenses may shed little light on the true impact of these costs.

A better approach is to look at what percent of income a typical metro household spends on housing and transportation.  

The H+T index calculates these percentages, so we ranked them for the nation’s 51 largest metro areas.

Our analysis found that metro Atlanta ranks as the 16th-most-expensive area in the country.

The typical metro Atlanta household spends more than 52 percent of its income on housing and transportation combined. This is higher than the national average, which is slightly more than 51 percent.

The Washington metro area was the cheapest at 43 percent. Households in the Miami area spend the most at 60 percent.

Some areas of metro Atlanta are vastly more affordable than others, according to the index. In parts of the Roswell area, households spend nearly 80 percent of their incomes on housing and transportation.

In parts of downtown Atlanta, that number plummets to 21 percent.

In short, Citizens for Transportation Mobility missed the mark. Its ad said that metro Atlanta is the seventh-most-expensive major metro area when you consider housing and transportation costs combined.

It’s not. Metro Atlanta is the 16th-most-expensive, according to H+T index data.  

Sixteen out of 51 isn’t great. And it reinforces the group’s overall point that transportation costs significantly add to the cost of living in metro Atlanta.

But it’s not as bad as Citizens for Transportation Mobility said.

Freshman Congressman Scott DesJarlais says U.S. has highest corporate tax rate in the world
","
Taxes are always good fodder for politicians, especially in an election year. This year is no exception.

U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais, R-Jasper, recently took President Barack Obama to task for invoking Ronald Reagan as part of his effort to persuade Congress to pass the so-called Buffett Rule, which would force the wealthiest Americans to pay a higher percentage of their income in federal taxes than middle-class families.

DesJarlais took issue with Obama’s claim that Reagan would have supported the Buffett Rule. But it was another part of DesJarlais’ statement that caught our attention.

""The United States already has the highest corporate tax rate in the world,"" the freshman congressman wrote in a blog post on his website on April 24, 2012.

We asked DesJarlais’ office to back up the claim. His spokesman, Robert Jameson, emailed us articles from CNN and the Heritage Foundation, both of which reported that the United States has achieved the dubious distinction of having the world’s highest corporate tax rate.

DesJarlais is not the first member of Congress to claim that the U.S. corporate tax rate is the world’s highest. Over the past year, our PolitiFact colleagues have looked into similar -- in some cases, identical -- claims made by President Barack Obama; U.S. Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; and, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.

Some of their findings are also pertinent to the DesJarlais claim and are repeated here.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the ""combined corporate income tax rate"" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services.

For 2010, the United States ranked second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point – 39.54 percent for Japan, 39.21 percent for the U.S. But PolitiFact noted at the time that Japan had recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations.

Japan’s reduced rate of 36.8 percent took effect on April 1, 2012. The U.S. rate stands at 39.2 percent, the world’s highest, when both federal and state rates are included.

But a little context is in order.

The OECD rate is the ""statutory rate"" – in other words, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting these factors produces a statistic called the ""effective tax rate.""

The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service looked into whether U.S. corporate taxes are the world’s highest and concluded that the answer depends, in part, on which taxes are being compared.

In a report released on March 31, 2011, the agency said that while the statutory tax rate is higher, the average effective tax rate is about the same as other countries, and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher.

The effective rate is determined by the ratio of taxes paid divided by profits. It captures the tax benefits that reduce the taxable income base relative to financial profits. The marginal rate is calculated from a projected investment project: it estimates the share of the pre-tax return that is paid on taxes.

Another issue that affects comparisons between U.S. and worldwide tax rates is whether tax rates are simple averages or whether they are weighted in some fashion to indicate their relative importance, the CRS study said.

""If tax rates are not weighted, then a small economy, such as Iceland, can have the same effect on the average of international rates as a large economy, such as Germany or Japan,"" the study said. ""In general, smaller countries tend to have lower tax rates and thus unweighted averages are lower than weighted averages in most cases.""

The study looked at corporate tax rates for the United States and the rest of the OECD. When weighted, the U.S. statutory rate was higher, 39.2 percent compared to 29.6 percent for other nations. But the effective rate was a little lower – 27.1 percent in the United States, 27.7 percent elsewhere. The marginal rate in the U.S. was slightly higher -- 23.6 percent, compared to 21.2 percent elsewhere.

When the U.S. was compared to the other 14 largest countries, the weighted effective rate was basically the same – 27.1 percent in the United States, 27.2 percent elsewhere.

Our ruling

There are different ways to compare worldwide tax rates. DesJarlais is right that the United States has the world’s highest corporate tax rate, at least among industrial countries, if one is referring to the statutory rate. But if the effective and marginal rates are considered, the answer is not quite that simple.

Bill Johnson says subsidies for the oil companies that Barack Obama has attacked don't exist
","
In addition to straining household budgets across the country, rising gas prices are causing America’s politicians to make statements that strain credibility.

At an April 17 news conference at the U.S. Capitol with other with conservative members of Congress, freshman GOP Rep. Bill Johnson of Marietta responded to President Barack Obama’s attacks on federal subsidies for oil companies with an attack of his own. After observing that Obama did not take care of this issue when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, Johnson went further.

""He didn’t do anything to try to stop those subsidies when he could have gotten it through,"" said Johnson. ""That’s because they don’t exist. This is political rhetoric. It is what you would expect coming from the White House and this president in a campaign year like this.""

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention.

We sought more information on Johnson’s claim that the subsidies attacked by Obama and numerous groups don’t exist. His office supplied a statement, in which he said ""a subsidy is a direct payment from the government to a company from the U.S. Treasury,"" which oil companies don’t receive. The tax code permits ""all companies and individuals to deduct certain business expenses, and oil companies are no different in this regard,"" Johnson said.

The same argument has been made by the American Petroleum Institute, as well as other GOP politicians.

Their argument basically rests on two points. First, oil industry tax breaks are no different from those received by other businesses. Secondly, it’s incorrect to classify those tax breaks as subsidies.

We’ll look at each one.

Obama’s proposed FY 2013 budget called for removing a handful of ""tax provisions that preferentially benefit fossil fuel production,"" and estimated that doing so would yield more than $4 billion a year.

Specifically, it called for repealing  tax provisions for ""expensing intangible drilling costs,"" a ""deduction for tertiary injectants,"" an ""exception to passive loss limitations for working interests in oil and natural gas properties, ""a percentage depletion for oil and natural gas wells,"" and a ""domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies."" It also called for increasing ""the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers to seven years."" Those seem directly targeted to the oil and gas industry, and not applicable to other businesses. When Obama’s budget was released, the American Petroleum Institute’s president said those provisions unfairly targeted his industry and would diminish job creation.

""Instead of advancing constructive pro-development policies, his budget plan calls for increased taxes on America’s oil and natural gas industry,"" API president Jack Gerard said Feb. 13.

The nonpartisan taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates the U.S. tax code currently contains about $5 billion in yearly tax breaks that are exclusive to the oil and gas industry, and says the industry also benefits from an extra $5.5 billion worth of general business tax provisions that companies in other industries also claim.

""The oil and gas industry often argues the tax breaks they take advantage of are available to every industry,"" the group’s vice president, Steve Ellis, said in an email. ""But obviously other industries can’t realistically claim the Intangible Drilling Costs tax credit (created in 1918) or the Expensing of Tertiary Injectants tax credit or the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit for blending ethanol into fuel.""

The American Petroleum Institute likens its drilling cost tax credit to research and development tax deductions available to other industries, and says the costs of the tertiary injectants put into older reservoirs to help continue production ""are expensed similar to materials and supplies because they are generally used up in the production process.""

As for the second point, Johnson and others say that a subsidy is a direct payment of money to a person or business by American taxpayers, and the term shouldn’t be applied to tax credits.

Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued that point in a December column in the conservative Washington Times, writing that oil companies receive ""business deductions"" rather than subsidies, and the two ""are as different as apples and oranges.""

""The semantically accurate way to describe legislation that would eliminate the manufacturing deduction or curtail the foreign tax credit for oil and gas companies is straightforward: the imposition of tax discrimination, not the removal of federal subsidies,"" Hufbauer wrote. ""Because most Americans agree that tax discrimination is bad policy - Uncle Sam shouldn’t be picking winners and losers through the tax code -- accurate language would diminish these proposals.""

Merriam Webster describes a subsidy as  ""a grant by a government to a private person or company to assist an enterprise deemed advantageous to the public."" Definition of the term ""subsidy"" became a focus of U.S. Senate debate in March, when legislators nixed Obama’s effort to end the disputed oil and gas industry tax breaks. Republicans argued the tax breaks weren’t subsidies. Democrats like Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown applied that term to the tax breaks under discussion.

While use of the word ""subsidy"" to describe tax credits for the energy industry seems most popular among Democrats, plenty of Republicans have used that phrasing, too.

When Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio claimed in January that federal, state and local governments have subsidized the production of the Chevrolet Volt ""to the tune of estimates between $50,000 and $250,000 per vehicle sold,"" his subsidy tally included tax breaks. When Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander delivered a February 15 speech to oppose federal tax breaks for wind power, he called them subsidies.

A March 2012 Congressional Budget Office report on federal financial support for energy development and production also refers to energy tax preferences as ""subsidies.""

Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, says tax breaks are subsidies because they subsidize the bottom line of recipients. He says government subsidies encourage taxpayer behavior that might not otherwise occur.

So where does that leave Johnson’s claim?

Both Democrats and Republicans have widely applied the term ""subsidy"" to tax breaks. We think it’s semantic hair-splitting to argue the term is being improperly applied. While it may not involve the sending of a U.S. Treasury check to a company, a tax break has the same practical impact, allowing a company to hold onto money it might otherwise pay in taxes.

Defenders of the oil industry tax breaks, like Hufbauer, may argue that ""Uncle Sam shouldn’t be picking winners and losers through the tax code,"" but that practice is undeniably widespread. A federal tax deduction for mortgage interest subsidizes homeownership. A recently expired ethanol tax credit subsidized corn growers. And the tax breaks that Obama targeted for things like ""drilling costs"" and ""tertiary injectants"" specifically subsidize the oil industry. If they did not, why would the industry’s trade association vigorously protest their proposed elimination?

We won’t address whether eliminating the oil industry tax breaks is good or bad policy. But the fact is those tax breaks do exist and they benefit the oil industry.

But Johnson arguing they are not subsidies amounts to semantic gymnastics that ignores usage commonplace among his colleagues in Washington.

Is Amanda Fritz saving water ratepayers $6 million every year?
","
Portland city Commissioner Amanda Fritz is running for re-election as a penny-pincher who has saved residents and ratepayers millions of dollars. Specifically, Fritz says in her first television commercial via a voice-over that ""she saved ratepayers $6 million a year in reduced water rate tax hikes."" 
That she is ""saving ratepayers $6 million a year"" is included in the Voters’ Pamphlet as well and on her campaign website, where she writes: ""That vote decreased the rate increase in 2010 by over 6 percent, saving ratepayers $6 million in 2010-11 and each year thereafter."" In The Oregonian’s Voter Guide, she writes she ""saved ratepayers $6 million per year starting 2009.""   

PolitiFact Oregon knows from a previous fact check that Fritz saved ratepayers $6 million in 2010-11. (It is inaccurate of Fritz to claim the savings started in 2009, but we’ll let that go. We have bigger fish to fry.) The question we have is whether it’s accurate to claim the savings into the future, which is what Fritz says. We’ll explain.

Once upon a time, in the not so distant past, the black-hearted U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered the fair City of Portland (and other municipalities) to protect drinking water from terrorists and cryptosporidium. Portland officials objected, claiming the city had the best drinking water in the world.

But their pleas fell on indifferent ears in Washington, D.C., and City Hall decided in 2009 to build a treatment plant to guard against cryptosporidium, an evil parasite that can make people very sick.

In all seriousness, with the feds breathing down their necks, Water Bureau officials recommended the council approve a $385 million direct filtration system. Commissioner Amanda Fritz, however, argued for a cheaper $100 million system that would zap cryptosporidium with ultraviolet rays.

We ruled Mostly True her 2011 statement that she persuaded City Council to save water ratepayers $500 million, because she did change the minds of commissioners ready to approve the more expensive system. (We knocked the ruling down from True because of details on construction costs)

That’s all fine and good. Except that in March of this year, the state, with authority from the feds, told the city it would not have to build a treatment system at all.

Despite the fact that we no longer have to build a plant, Fritz argues she can claim a $6 million savings every year into the future because she was responsible for lowering the baseline to start. ""The savings are carried over year after year,"" she wrote in an email, ""because the six percent wasn't added to the rate.""

We turned to David Hasson, the water bureau’s finance director. He said at most, she could have claimed the savings for at least a generation, had we built the UV treatment system. ""Of course it is all hypothetical, because we didn't build either one,"" he said.

And that’s the point.

We’re not building a system. And Fritz had nothing to do with that decision.

We give her credit for steering us to a less expensive option in 2009 and saving us money from 2010 through June 2012. But it stops there. Fritz cannot continue to claim credit for saving ratepayers money on something that they’re not buying.

Ad says stimulus tax credits funded traffic lights in China
","
Is our stimulus money paying for traffic lights on Chinese streets?

A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work.

""Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers,"" the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims.

Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to ""educating citizens about economic policy"" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012.

Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill:
  
Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. 
We’ve rated two claims from the ad, about stimulus tax credits supposedly funding a plant in Mexico (Pants on Fire) and paying for jobs in Finland (False).  In this fact-check, we’re examining if those tax credits included ""tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China.""

(We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.)

The ad said its source for the China claim was a Pittsburgh Tribune-Review article, ""Stimulus money pays for street, traffic lights made largely overseas.""

Traffic lights in China 
As the ad’s narrator talks about China, the words, ""Stimulus money pays for street, traffic lights …"" ""in China …"" appear on the screen, over an image of a traffic light that’s slowly layered with the deep red and yellow of the Chinese flag.

The ad was clearly suggesting U.S.-funded lights on Chinese streets. It wasn’t until we pulled up the Tribune-Review article we realized the ad’s claim could be heard another way.

Oh! Lights built in China, for American streets.

But even that clarification didn’t get us to the complete story.

The Tribune-Review article, by Lou Kilzer, a reporter who has won Pulitzer prizes for investigative reporting and public service, digs into grant money — not tax credits, as the ad claimed — awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It says that tens of millions of stimulus dollars went to replace streetlights and traffic lights across the country with energy-efficient versions — ""made mostly in Asia.""

The reason? Certain components of those energy-efficient street and traffic lights, such as light-emitting diodes or LEDs, weren’t available in large enough quantities from U.S. manufacturers back in 2010, so the Energy Department issued a waiver to the Recovery Act’s ""Buy America"" provision for those parts.

The department found such components were manufactured ""almost exclusively in China and Mexico.""

That was February 2010. The Energy Department withdrew its waiver eight months later after at least one manufacturer of LED lights moved some work from Mexico back to the United States. Suddenly, enough parts would be available to satisfy stimulus grant recipients. They’re now once again subject to ""Buy America"" provisions.

But, back to those eight months — could tens of millions of dollars have gone toward building street lights in China?

That’s not clear. But it’s also not proven by the Tribune-Review story, which talks not just about China, but also about Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. (We suspect the admakers chose China to make it sound more outrageous.)

Meanwhile, the companies building the streetlights told the Tribune-Review that ""their products would be better labeled ‘assembled in America’ than ‘made in America.’""

One example: Leotek Electronics USA, based in California. It’s a subsidiary of Taiwanese companies, Kilzer reported. Leotek bought some of its LEDs from Philips Lumileds, an American subsidiary of a Dutch company. More than half of Philips’ manufacturing production capacity is based in China. Note the complex path to a finished streetlight, as described by Kilzer:

• Philips produced the first component, semiconductor wafers, at its San Jose, Calif., plant.
• It shipped the wafers to Singapore, where they were cut into chips and sent to Malaysia.
• Malaysian workers molded them into LED modules.
• Some of those LED packages went to Leotek in Taiwan to be put on circuit boards.
• Boards and streetlight housings got shipped to Leotek’s plant in Milpitas, Calif., where workers combined them with ‘U.S.- and non-U.S.-made components’ for assembly.

Kilzer said Leotek won more than a dozen stimulus street and traffic projects.

We found one such project, for the City of Palo Alto, which paid $355,281 from a stimulus grant to Leotek for LED streetlight fixtures. About 60 percent of its total grant of nearly $640,000 went toward fixtures, including others from GE Lighting and Genlyte Thomas Group. But more than 40 percent was spent on software and consulting services and installation.

So, did some stimulus money end up spent on parts made in China? Yes, according to Kilzer’s reporting and a now-withdrawn Energy Department waiver indicating the parts were available there when they weren’t widely manufactured in the United States.

Did it add up to tens of millions of dollars? Kilzer’s piece talks about that amount of money being spent ""to replace streetlights and traffic lights nationwide,"" and says the new, efficient lights would be made ""mostly in Asia"" — not just China.

It’s not clear whether Kilzer’s number also includes installation, consulting services and other non-fixture expenses — the kind of stuff that consumed 40 percent of Palo Alto’s grant. (We asked him, but didn’t hear back.) It is clear that the ""tens of millions"" reflects spending for American-assembled lights that included varying amounts of foreign-made components. But it's an exaggeration to say they were built in China.

None of this evidence supports the strong suggestion in the ad that Americans paid for streetlights on roads in China, or even that they paid to build streetlights in China. Instead, for less than a year, stimulus funds could be used to buy products that used components produced in other countries, including China.

Our ruling

We watched this ad and imagined Chinese street corners with shiny new American-funded traffic lights.

The reality is nearly the opposite: American cities, counties and states bought and installed new energy-efficient street and traffic lights with stimulus grants. Many of those lights contained foreign components, including some from China, but it’s simply not clear how much stimulus money went toward those parts during the eight months it was allowed.

The ad’s claim has a tiny sliver of truth, but it pairs words and images to create an altogether different impression. We’ll have to put the brakes on this traffic light claim, and rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-streetlights-c/
