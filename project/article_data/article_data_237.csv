Sen. Rob Portman says tax dollars went down the drain to buy Facebook fans
","Money can’t buy you love, as the Beatles sang, but money can buy you ""like."" Sen. Rob Portman thinks the price can be more than it’s worth. The  Ohio Republican made the point in his monthly statement for July ""highlighting Washington’s wasteful spending during a time of record debt and deficits."" This one, decrying ""tax dollars down the drain,"" said the U.S. State Department ""spent $630,000 to obtain 2 million Facebook 'Likes'."" ""With Washington running budget deficits of more than $1 trillion – or $10,000 per household – the Administration should not be wasting taxpayer dollars on frivolous items such as attempting to buy Facebook fans,"" Portman said. That clicked with PolitiFact Ohio. We wanted to know more. Portman said his source was a report by the U.S. State Department’s inspector general. Completed in May, the 57-page report was one in a periodic series examining policy implementation, resource management and management controls in the State Department's Bureau of International Information Programs. The report says the bureau launched digital diplomacy campaigns in 2011 and 2012 that started or expanded online activities in six foreign languages, and started or expanded English-language Facebook pages, Twitter feeds and blogs aimed at foreign audiences. ""The bureau spent about $630,000 on the two campaigns,"" the inspector general found, ""and succeeded in increasing the fans of the English Facebook pages from about 100,000 to more than 2 million for each page. Advertising also helped increase interest in the foreign language pages; by March 2013, they ranged from 68,000 to more than 450,000 fans. ""Many in the bureau criticize the advertising campaigns as 'buying fans' who may have once clicked on an ad or 'liked' a photo but have no real interest in the topic and have never engaged further,"" the report said. The inspector general found that the number of Facebook users who actually engaged with each page was relatively small, with only about 2 percent ""liking,"" sharing or commenting on any item within the previous week. And the report said that the bureau's target audience is older and more influential than the people likely to spend hours engaging on the social site. The campaign became less effective in 2012, the report said, when Facebook changed its mechanics, making the bureau's fan pages less prominent to users who did not engage with them. But engaging with fans might not be an improvement over trying to increase the number of them, the inspector general said: ""The bureau could reduce spending and increase strategic impact by focusing its advertising not on raising overall fan numbers or general engagement statistics but on accomplishing specific PD [public diplomacy] goals."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked about the report during a daily briefing with reporters on July 3. She said that the Bureau of International Information Programs had cut its spending on Facebook ads, from $315,000 a year to $36,000 a year. ""Spending on online advertising has significantly decreased,"" she said. ""It’s now at $2,500 a month, and that still allows us to reach out and communicate with a wide range of individuals living overseas. And on June 27th, IIP also submitted to OIG (Office of the Inspector General) its strategy for implementing the report’s recommendations, and also provided an update on those that have already been met. IIP will implement the majority of OIG’s recommendations on or before the start of fiscal year 2014."" It is important to know that the inspector general's stinging report found that the Facebook campaign was being questioned in the bureau by November 2012, and that spending has been cut by almost 90 percent. But Portman's statement about the State Department spending for Facebook ""Likes"" is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F85E00>],/factchecks/2013/aug/01/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-tax-dollars-went-down-drain-b/

Cicilline says passing Senate-approved immigration bill would save $200 billion over ten years
","For many people, creating a path to citizenship for individuals who came into the United States illegally seems counterproductive. But U. S. Rep. David Cicilline says that it makes economic sense. During an appearance from Washington on the WPRI-TV program ""Newsmakers,"" which aired July 21, Cicilline said passing the bipartisan immigration bill already approved by the Senate would save the country billions. ""The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office, did an analysis and said that passing comprehensive immigration reform will reduce the federal deficit by $200 billion over the next decade,"" said Cicilline. Roughly $20 billion per year? When we inquired, Cicilline's office sent a link to the CBO report. It does indeed offer that as an estimate. The actual projected savings: $197 billion from 2014 to 2023. The legislation would increase the deficit in 2014 by $2.5 billion but beginning in 2015, as new income and payroll tax revenues from the new workers start accumulating, it would cut away at the deficit by an ever-increasing amount, according to the budget office, starting at $4.7 billion and shaving as much as $55.9 billion in the final year of the projection. The savings will come despite the government having to pay an additional $82 billion over 10 years for health insurance subsidies, $29 billion for Medicaid for adults and children, $6 billion more for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (commonly known as food stamps) and $5.1 billion more for unemployment insurance. Why the savings? Passage of the law would increase federal revenues by $459 billion from 2014 to 2023, the report said. ""That increase would stem largely from additional collections of income and payroll taxes, reflecting both an increase in the size of the U.S. labor force and changes in the legal status of some current workers."" The report estimates that passing the immigration proposal would increase the number of permanent U.S. residents by 10.4 million and the number of temporary workers and their dependents by 1.6 million. (There would also be 1.6 million fewer unauthorized residents.) During that time, none of the immigrants who entered the country illegally would be eligible for Social Security or Medicare. And after that? The CBO estimated that immigration reform would reduce the deficit by $700 billion from 2024 to 2033, but those longer-range projections are less certain. PolitiFact usually doesn't offer rulings on predictions such as the ones in the CBO report. But  we can say that Cicilline is correctly quoting the federal nonpartisan report. We rate the claim True.

Barack Obama says minimum wage pays less now than when Ronald Reagan was sworn in
","President Barack Obama has been talking a lot recently about the need to raise the minimum wage, particularly during a series of speeches on the economy. And when he does so, Obama almost always invokes President Ronald Reagan, an icon for conservatives. Obama said, ""We need to raise the minimum wage, because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office,"" Obama said in a speech at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., on July 24, 2013. Obama has used almost the same exact talking point on a number of other occasions, including a speech in Chattanooga, Tenn., and various position papers. We were curious about two things. Is Obama right on the statistics? And is Obama’s attempt to link Reagan to a policy of maintaining a generous minimum wage an accurate historical portrayal? We should start by noting that the minimum wage, as written into law, is higher now than it was  when Reagan took office in 1981 -- since 2009, it’s been $7.25 an hour, compared to $3.35 in 1981. However, Obama was clearly referring to the inflation-adjusted minimum-wage rate. Here’s a summary of changes in the inflation-adjusted minimum wage during Reagan’s tenure. We calculated it using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator.   Year Minimum wage Wage in 2013 dollars 1981 $3.35 $8.61 1982 $3.35 $8.11 1983 $3.35 $7.85 1984 $3.35 $7.53 1985 $3.35 $7.27 1986 $3.35 $7.14 1987 $3.35 $6.89 1988 $3.35 $6.61 1989 $3.35 $6.31 2013 $7.25 $7.25   So, Obama has a point when he says the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was higher when Reagan entered office than it is now. But that’s not the whole story. Over Reagan’s entire tenure, the minimum wage slowly eroded. In Reagan’s fifth year in office, it was almost identical to what it is today in terms of purchasing power. By Reagan’s sixth year as president, it dropped below today’s rate when adjusted for inflation. And by the time he left office, the minimum wage had fallen a full 13 percent below its level today. There’s a reason for this: Reagan never presided over a minimum wage increase during his term in office. In fact, he was the only president never to oversee a boost the minimum wage since it was signed into law in 1938 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Democratic presidents weren’t the only ones to back minimum-wage increases. The minimum wage went up three times during the brief presidency of Gerald Ford, and each of Reagan’s fellow Republicans presided over at least one increase, including George W. Bush in 2007 and 2008. Reagan was the only exception. Our ruling When Obama said the minimum wage is ""lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office,"" he offered a carefully worded statement that is accurate when considering inflation. However, his invocation of Reagan rings hollow, since the late president was hardly a model for Obama’s approach to the minimum wage. Reagan was the only president not to preside over an increase in the minimum wage, and by the end of his term, the wage was 13 percent lower than it is now. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809677BC00>],/factchecks/2013/jul/31/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-minimum-wage-pays-less-now-when-/

Gohmert charges Justice Department with telling employees to embrace gay marriage and homosexuality
","President Barack Obama’s administration ""has gone out of its way to thump Christians,"" a Texas U.S. House member said in a July 15, 2013, interview with Fox News. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, went on to say the nation’s top lawyers have been directed to embrace gay marriage, saying: ""It's also been true in the Department of Justice right now, directly under this president, his buddy, Eric Holder. There's a memo that directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality. And silence is considered to be disapproval,"" Gohmert said, according to CQ Transcriptions. The Justice Department required workers to embrace gay marriage and more? Employee group brochure To our email inquiry, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham pointed out a May 28, 2013, blog post by Todd Starnes, a Fox News commentator, headlined: ""DOJ Tells Employees to Verbally Affirm Homosexuality."" Starnes, citing Liberty Counsel, a law firm that says it’s dedicated to ""advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and the family,"" wrote that department employees were emailed a brochure,  ""LGBT Inclusion at Work: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Managers."" He wrote too that the brochure was created by DOJ Pride, an association of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender agency employees. The brochure lists about 20 ""do’s"" and ""don’ts"" running from appropriate language to dealing with offensive jokes to declaring one’s own sexual orientation and respecting someone who does so. Given Gohmert’s statement, we narrowed our focus to brochure references to gay marriage and to embracing homosexuality. Under the heading ""Use Inclusive Language,"" the brochure encourages recipients to ""use inclusive words like ‘partner,’ ‘significant other’ or ‘spouse’ rather than gender-specific terms like ‘husband’ and ‘wife.’"" Another section says: ""Do acknowledge important events in an LGBT employee’s life--e.g., same-sex marriage, birth of a child, illness of a spouse, or death of a partner’s parent--in the same way you would for a heterosexual employee."" A theme of the brochure is respect for an employee’s sexual orientation. A section titled ""Come Out"" says: ""Do let your employees know they’ll be treated with fairness and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, by ‘coming out’ as a straight ally."" Recipients are encouraged to display the brochure or a DOJ Pride sticker in clear view or request that their office receive follow-up training on gender identity in the workplace. Also: ""Do consider coming out of the closet if you are LGBT and not out at work. The presence of visible LGBT managers communicates that your office is open and accepting."" In another section, the brochure says that if an employee ""comes out to you,"" don’t ""judge or remain silent. Silence will be interpreted as disapproval. Do respond with interest and curiosity. Asking respectful questions will set a positive, supportive tone."" By telephone, Matt Barber, a Liberty Counsel attorney, told us the brochure was sent to agency employees on May 14, 2013. At our request, Barber emailed us what he described as a copy of that email with the name of the whistleblower worker who brought it to the firm’s attention redacted. One agency's distribution The ""To"" line of the email says, ""Global Distribution."" The email message, under the subject ""LGBT Pride Month,"" describes the attached brochure as complementing a planned LGBT Pride Month observance. The email expresses hope that the brochure, ""drafted with input from key department stakeholders,"" will be a useful tool ""as you work to create an office environment that is welcoming to, and supportive of, all employees, including LGBT employees."" The email closes with: ""This message has been authorized by Nelson A. Santos, Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Forensic Sciences."" By phone, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona told us Santos works for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Talamona initially told us that the publication was distributed to ""some employees"" by email with the department’s awareness. However, she said, it is not an agency policy or directive. Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson later emailed a statement that seemed to indicate the DEA official sent the brochure to many of that agency's workers. All told, its employees account for some 9,000 of the Justice Department’s 115,000 workers, Iverson said. Iverson's statement said ""DOJ Pride, an employee association, sent informational material, on its own behalf, to some DOJ employees. The material was clearly identified as a DOJ Pride product. We have also recently learned one component’s diversity official distributed the information via email to its employees on behalf of DOJ Pride. The single-page document was produced on a DOJ computer and involved limited use of a DOJ printer to make a few dozen copies, in line with the department’s de minimis use policy allowing employees to make minimal personal use of their DOJ computers when the cost to the government is negligible."" Barber said that while the brochure was authored by an employee group, not the department proper, ""it came under the auspices of the larger Department of Justice."" He added that the agency ""knows it would be unconstitutional to expressly compel department employees to openly embrace homosexuality and gay marriage."" The brochure, he said, delivers a compliance threat that is implied rather than explicit. Diversity policy More broadly, the department says online it has a diversity management policy: ""We work diligently to attract and retain a workforce that represents the range of personal and professional backgrounds, and experiences and perspectives that arise from differences of culture and circumstances. This includes persons of varying age, ethnicity, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, political affiliation, socioeconomic and family status, and geographic region."" As noted in a May 24, 2013, blog post by WND, a conservative Internet news organization, Holder aired support for diversity in a June 6, 2012, speech marking the agency’s LGBT Pride Month celebration. After mentioning efforts to combat school bullying and to help students who feel unsafe or victimized, Holder said: ""It is this same determination that guides the Justice Department’s internal efforts to create a more inclusive work environment, and to strengthen our mission to serve all Americans by attracting a diverse range of qualified individuals; and by providing the opportunities--and the support necessary--for every department employee to develop, to grow, and to thrive both personally and professionally."" Our ruling Gohmert said a Justice Department memo ""directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality."" The department promotes diversity. But there doesn't appear to be a department memo or mandate that employees openly support gay marriage or homosexuality. That said, a subset of workers received a brochure from an agency-sanctioned employee group encouraging managers to respect and support gay workers. We rate this claim, which has an element of truth, as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3B1B40>],/factchecks/2013/jul/31/louie-gohmert/gohmert-charges-justice-department-telling-employe/

Obama says Keystone XL would mean ""maybe 2,000 jobs""
","The Keystone XL pipeline that would carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Texas Gulf coast presents President Barack Obama with no easy choice. While officially, the final decision to block or approve it is in the hands of the State Department, politically, the plan pits two key Democratic constituencies against each other, environmentalists and organized labor. For the first group, extracting petroleum from Canadian tar sands is a climate change disaster. For the unions, the project means jobs. Fresh off a speech that underscored the need to restore America’s middle class, Obama talked about the steps that lie ahead for the 875-mile link between the Canadian border and a distribution hub in Nebraska. The central question, he said in an interview with the New York Times, is whether this would ""significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere."" As for jobs, the president went out of his way to downplay them. In the big picture, they were but a ""blip"", as the president put it. ""Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that’s true,"" Obama said. ""Any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in a economy of 150 million working people."" There’s been a running battle over jobs and the Keystone XL. We’ve checked claims that it would employ as many as 20,000 workers. We rated that False; even the company behind the pipeline backed away from that number. To be clear, there are all sorts of complications when it comes to predicting how many jobs a complex, two-year project will generate. There are the direct construction jobs; there’s indirect employment at companies that provide the materials and services related to the work; and then there’s the really indirect effect that comes when money is pumped into an economy and people buy food and pay rent and so on. But out of all the numbers bruited about, the president’s seemed particularly low. We asked the White House for evidence to support the claim. All they offered was a statement from spokesman Josh Earnest during a press briefing. ""There are a range of estimates out there about the economic impact of the pipeline,"" Earnest said. ""What the president is interested in doing is draining the politics out of this debate and evaluating this project on the merits."" During the New York Times interview, the president invited reporters to use the most realistic estimates. So we went to the State Department’s lengthy environmental impact statement on the project that came out in March. In that report, the lowest estimate for jobs directly tied to construction was 3,900 jobs a year. That number came after analysts wrestled with the stop-and-start nature of construction work and converted the jobs to a yearly estimate. ""Approximately 10,000 construction workers engaged for 4-to 8-month seasonal construction periods (approximately 5,000 to 6,000 per construction period) would be required to complete the proposed project. When expressed as average annual employment, this equates to approximately 3,900 jobs."" The analysis noted that 90 percent of those jobs would come from ""a unique national labor force that is highly specialized in pipeline construction techniques."" It also confirmed that there would be few long-term jobs, something on the order of 35. The largest jobs number in the State Department report is an annual average of 42,100, but that includes part-time jobs and folds in the ripple effects as spending moves through the economy, measured over two years. The further out from the immediate project the analysis moves, the less certain the results. The report said these jobs would amount to 0.02 percent of total American employment, adding some weight to the president’s characterization of the impact on the overall jobs picture. The North American Building Trades Union said it was disappointed with Obama’s words and pressed him to let the pipeline move forward. ""So that workers and their families can share in the economic recovery he is touting,"" said union president Sean McGarvey. ""The president should look to his own State Department’s findings that there will be meaningful job creation."" We looked at the website of the Sierra Club, one of the leading environmental groups opposed to the pipeline, and they used the State Department’s 3,900 annual number. The only place we found anything close to the president’s figure was at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations Global Labor Institute. Assistant director Lara Skinner co-wrote a report highly critical of the pipeline. Skinner argued that the 3,900 covered employment for two years and that it should be divided in half. ""That's where the 2,000 job figure comes from,"" Skinner said. However, if that is what the State Department had meant, the White House could have easily referred to it to support the president’s claim. Our ruling Obama said the Keystone XL pipeline might produce about 2,000 jobs during construction, based on the most reliable estimates. The White House provided no supporting evidence and the administration’s own State Department predicted that while the pipeline would produce few permanent jobs, the construction process itself would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A8D00>],/factchecks/2013/jul/31/barack-obama/obama-says-keystone-xl-would-mean-maybe-2000-jobs/
"['Georgia', 'Energy', 'Tom Fanning']","
Energy subsidies claim needs more context
","In recent months, the benefits of expanding the use of solar energy in Georgia have been picked apart by grass-roots activists and others like a good bowl of Brunswick stew. For example, PolitiFact Georgia recently examined a claim by one group that electricity rates are 40 percent higher in states that have required utility companies to use a certain amount of renewable energy such as solar power. We rated that claim Half True. Last month, the man who runs Georgia’s largest public utility offered up some statistics concerning federal government subsidies for renewable energies such as solar. His comments prompted us to measure their accuracy on the Truth-O-Meter. Government subsidies for renewable energies such as wind and solar are 100 times greater than those given to gas and coal, and 50 times greater than what the nuclear industry enjoys, Southern Co. CEO Tom Fanning said, according to one account. The Georgia Sierra Club disputed Fanning’s account and asked PolitiFact Georgia to determine whether he is correct. The debate on renewable energies took on added importance when the state’s Public Service Commission voted 3-2 on July 11 to require Georgia Power, which is owned by Southern Co., to commit to using a certain amount of solar in its long-term plan. A Southern Co. spokesman supplied us with information to back up Fanning’s claim, but others with expertise on energy subsidies say Fanning cherry-picked his data. The company supplied us with a chart from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that shows how much money the federal government gave out in subsidies for various sources of energy in 2010. The chart contained numbers that were similar to the most recent EIA data concerning energy subsidies. The energy source that received the largest amount of subsidies was biofuels, at about $7.7 billion. Much of the gasoline in the United States is blended with a biofuel -- ethanol. Biofuels are considered a renewable energy. Wind energy was a distant second, at just under $5 billion. Solar energy received slightly more than $1 billion, which was less than oil and gas ($2.8 billion), and coal ($1.35 billion). The subsidies for most renewable energies were greater than other sources, but not 100 times greater or even 50 times greater. These numbers, though, weren’t what Southern Co. focused on in its response to us. The chart, based on reports by two federal agencies, shows how much money various forms of energy received in subsidies in comparison with each barrel of energy consumed. That’s the better way to make a comparison, Southern Co. says. Here’s a breakdown: Solar        $59.60 Wind        $31.33 Biofuel        $10.46 Nuclear    $1.71 Coal        $0.38 Oil and gas    $0.27 According to these numbers, solar energy’s subsidy was nearly 157 times greater than coal. Wind was 116 times greater than oil and gas. Nuclear was six times greater than oil and gas. ""This data illustrates the disproportionate amount of federal subsidies renewables are receiving compared to other energy resources,"" Southern Co. spokesman Tim Leljedal said. Leljedal added: "" While we are continuing to expand our renewable energy resources in a manner that makes sense for customers, we recognize that the subsidization of wind and solar at current levels is not sustainable."" Elias Hinckley, an attorney who teaches energy policy at Georgetown University and has done work for Georgia Power, believes Fanning’s claim needs considerable context. Hinckley said comparing the support for newer energy resources such as solar and wind with coal and gas is akin to measuring the popularity of Coca-Cola in Atlanta against Pepsi. ""Comparing young technologies to old, established, regulatory-protected assets is silly if you're working on a unit of energy used basis -- the point of subsidies is (or at least should be) to create a fair playing field where an unnatural advantage exists,"" said Hinckley, a partner at Sullivan & Worcester LLP, based in Washington. Hinckley added: ""Coal, for example, has had the benefit of free emissions for a century (longer if we go beyond electric production to thermal/steam use), which has never been, and can't on a retroactive basis, be properly priced."" Mark Thurber, an author and scholar on the economics of energy, agreed that wind and solar receive more in government subsidies. But Thurber, an associate director of the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University, questioned the validity of such comparisons for some of the same reasons mentioned by Hinckley. We followed up with Southern Co. concerning the criticism. We also wondered whether Fanning’s comparison is fair since the federal government boosted subsidies for renewable energies in the 2009 economic stimulus package. Leljedal noted that no one disputes subsidies for renewable energies are higher than other forms of energy. Leljedal added: ""While the amount of subsidies can vary from year to year, that fact remains that subsidies are required to make renewable energy cost-competitive with other generation resources."" To sum up, Southern Co. CEO Tom Fanning claimed government subsidies for renewable energies such as wind and solar are 100 times greater than they are for older forms of energy such as coal and oil, and 50 times greater for nuclear energy. One chart backs up Fanning’s claim on solar and wind, but not nuclear. Another report does not. Some experts noted that renewable forms of energy haven’t been developed as long as others and need the help. Coal and natural gas have been receiving subsidies for far longer than solar energy, wind and nuclear energy, which is an important point. Fanning’s general point that renewable energies are getting substantially greater financial support from Uncle Sam at this point in time is on target. But the specific numbers he used aren’t entirely correct, and his claim needs some context to be fully understood.

'Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area,' says Dream Defenders
","Meet the Dream Defenders -- a group of young people camped out in front of the office of Gov. Rick Scott seeking to overturn Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law and draw attention to issues such as racial profiling and arrests of school children. The group has been attracting national attention in the wake of the July 13 acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighborhood watchman, in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012. Martin’s case has shined a spotlight on the intersection of race on the criminal justice system and school discipline. (Martin was serving an out-of-school suspension when he was shot while walking to his father’s home after buying Skittles and a drink.) On July 22, Florida’s Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Justice, Wansley Walters, met with the Dream Defenders to talk about how to keep children out of the criminal justice system. ""Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida,"" said Monique Gillum, one of the leaders of Dream Defenders during the meeting. ""It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area."" Arrest data on Florida students To back up her claim, Gillum pointed to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice report that states that 12,520 youth were arrested for school-related arrests during the 2011-12 year. (School-related includes arrests at school, the bus or bus stop, and school-sponsored events.) About two-thirds were for misdemeanors. The department pointed us to the same report to show that the number of youth school-related arrests have declined 48 percent since the 2004-05 school year. One reason for the decline is that the majority of Florida school districts have started using civil citations for non-violent misdemeanors. The citations include penalties such as community service. If the student complies, no arrest goes on their record. Being arrested at school can be traumatic. Even if the arrest doesn’t ultimately lead to a conviction, it can still hurt students because they may have to disclose it on job or college applications. The Miami-Dade school district, the largest in the state and the one where Martin was a student, was the first to implement civil citations -- and that could be why it had far fewer arrests than several smaller districts. (Walters was at the Miami-Dade County Juvenile Services Department at the time and led the effort to push for civil citations.) The report shows school-related arrests by sheer numbers and by rate per 1,000 students in counties in 2011-12. We will cite a few examples: Though the numbers of arrests statewide dropped in recent years after the state relaxed its ""zero tolerance"" policy, critics say schools have still gone too far in criminalizing typical youthful behavior. We found arrests for infractions such as throwing spitballs, hitting someone with a tootsie pop or even for repeatedly ""passing gas.""  (The 13-year-old boy busted for flatulence never went before a judge; the Martin County school district told us the case was ""diverted/dropped with no record for the student."") ""The vast majority of children being arrested in schools are not committing criminal acts,"" Walters told the Orlando Sentinel earlier this year. National comparison data lacking So the 12,000 figure isn’t in dispute. But comparing Florida’s school-related arrests to the rest of the nation was far more complicated. National ""data-keeping in this realm is indeed pretty awful,"" said Kevin G. Welner, professor and director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. That sentiment was echoed by multiple experts we interviewed. Also, Florida does a better job than most states at compiling the data. An expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center said the state has the most comprehensive data in the nation. The Dream Defenders sent us an article from Ebony, which stated, ""While Florida is not alone in turning to police to discipline young people, it has the distinction of being the nation’s leader in school-based arrests."" Ebony linked to a 2013 article in Color Lines, a magazine that focuses on issues pertaining to race. Its report stated: ""Last year, Florida produced the highest documented number of school-based arrests in the country — and that number was an improvement over previous years."" (One expert we interviewed noted the important qualifier in that sentence: documented. As we’ll see, little is documented in this area.) Gillum directed us to a 2011 report about Florida school arrests written by the Advancement Project, a national civil rights group, along with the ACLU in Florida and the NAACP. ""Florida still has the highest documented number of school-based referrals to law enforcement in the country,"" states the report. A footnote had this to say: ""Currently, this data is not collected nationwide. Many individual states report this information, but no other state reports as many school-based referrals to law enforcement as Florida."" We couldn't get a definitive answer from the group about how many states actually did report data. ""The report should have conveyed Florida’s data is the highest on record,"" Advancement Project spokeswoman Jennifer Farmer told PolitiFact Florida. ""It may not be the highest in the country but it's highest on record."" We found some data is collected at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. But that data appears to have significant gaps and inconsistencies. Daniel Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California, pointed out a few examples of questionable numbers, including Los Angeles, which had zero referrals or arrests in 2009. Broward County had 6,640 referrals to law enforcement, but 0 arrests, while Miami-Dade had 1,670 referrals to law enforcement and 10 arrests. No matter the ranking, ""Florida has a very serious issue with overly punitive discipline and over-reliance on law enforcement that harms children and adolescents in the state, and is especially harmful to children of color,"" Losen said. Our ruling Dream Defenders said, ""Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area."" The number about Florida is correct: There were 12,520 students arrested at schools in 2011-12, according to the state Department of Juvenile Justice. But the Dream Defenders failed to prove that the number makes Florida the nation’s leader in school-related arrests. This appears to be a case of the state getting a bad rap because of its rare decision to publish comprehensive data.    Multiple experts said that comprehensive data for state-by-state comparisons is lacking. That makes it difficult to declare Florida’s ranking for school-related arrests.

Are 90 million Americans not working or not looking for work?
","A reader recently asked us to check a claim that’s been widely repeated on conservative websites -- that 90 million Americans either aren’t working or aren’t looking for work. Over the past few months, the statistic has been cited by various conservative bloggers, pundits and news outlets. We thought we’d take a closer look. Here’s how the calculation is made, using Census Bureau population estimates and employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics: The total U.S. population age 16 and over is at least 243 million. Subtracting the nearly 156 million Americans in the labor force in June 2013 -- that is, those who were either working or looking for work -- leaves 87 million Americans, which is close to 90 million. However, the 90 million number is padded, since this number includes a lot of Americans who wouldn’t be expected to be working. Specifically: • People age 16 to 17, who likely are in high school: 9 million • People who are enrolled in either two- or four-year colleges: 21 million • People age 65 and older, who have reached retirement age: 40 million people That means 20 million people are of normal working age, not in college and not working. That’s less than one-quarter the amount repeatedly cited in the blogosphere. So the 90 million number is exaggerated. Even so, the idea that fewer people are joining the workforce is something that worries economists. All things being equal, economists like to see more people working because it helps economic growth (though not at the expense of dropping out of school, which can limit future employment opportunities and earnings potential). To gauge these trends, economists can calculate the labor force participation rate, which is the percentage of the population that is either working or looking for work, and they can calculate the employment to population ratio, which is the percentage of the 16-and-over population that is currently employed. Both statistics generally track each other, but not in lockstep. Here’s a summary of these statistics between the end of the last recession in June 2009 and the most recent month available, June 2013.   Statistic June 2009 June 2013 Change Employment level 142.2 million 144.1 million +1.9 million Civilian labor force 154.2 million 155.8 million +1.6 million Labor force participation rate 65.7 percent 63.5 percent -2.2 percentage points Employment to population ratio 60.6 percent 58.7 percent -1.9 percentage points   So the number of people employed and the number joining the labor force have both increased since the end of the last recession -- but, importantly, these gains haven’t kept pace with the rise in population. This decline actually started around 2000, but it intensified starting with the most recent recession. ""The trick is to determine how much of the drop represents the impact of a lagging economy, which is worrisome, and how much is due to non-worrisome factors, such as the aging of the adult population,"" Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact earlier this year. As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. And that’s been happening in a big way as the baby boomers age. Burtless has determined that the two employment ratios would have fallen in recent years just on the basis of aging, even if there had been no recession. But the age-related decline has been worsened by high unemployment rates during the recession. Most troubling, economists say, is the decline among the core working ages of 25 to 55. In addition, the tight job market has convinced more people to opt out of the labor market, perhaps by becoming students or stay-at-home parents. The key to describing the employment situation is to make sure you’re using the best possible statistics. ""It’s important not to downplay the seriousness of the decline, while still getting the numbers right,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Our ruling Bloggers and pundits have said that 90 million Americans either aren’t working or aren’t looking for work. That’s a real number, but it includes high schoolers, college students and retirement-age Americans, leaving perhaps 20 million a better approximation. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771ED00>],/factchecks/2013/jul/30/blog-posting/are-90-million-americans-not-working-or-looking-wo/

Sarah Palin says GOP banned mention of Ayers in '08
","Sarah Palin still speaks bitterly about 2008. The former Republican vice-presidential candidate spoke on Fox News recently about current matters such as the raid on the American diplomatic outpost in Libya and the IRS vetting of nonprofit applications when she turned back to the 2008 presidential campaign. ""I was banned from talking about Jeremiah Wright and Obama's friend, Bill Ayers, the character that he befriended and kicked off his political campaign in the guy's living room,"" Palin said. ""Couldn't talk about that."" Palin pointed a finger at who she thought was to blame. ""I was not allowed to talk about things like that because those elitists, those who are the brainiacs in the GOP machine running John McCain's campaign at the time, said that the media would eat us alive if we brought up these things."" For those who might not remember, Bill Ayers lived in Barack Obama’s Chicago neighborhood and was an early supporter when Obama first ran for the Illinois state Senate. What made Ayers interesting in 2008 was that in the 1960s, he was one of the founders of the Weather Underground, a group that was responsible for bombings at a New York City police station, the Capitol, and the Pentagon. There were no injuries. Obama’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, brought up Ayers during the primary, but the issue failed to gain much traction. When Palin said she was banned from mentioning Ayers, we at PolitiFact were a bit surprised. That’s because we fact-checked her claim about Ayers in early October 2008. We had video of Palin talking about him at a rally in Clearwater, Fla. Three days before, the New York Times had carried a front-page story about Obama and Ayers; Palin mentioned the story. ""He was a domestic terrorist,"" Palin said. ""And part of a group that, quote, ‘launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.’ Wow. ""And there’s even more to the story,"" Palin said. ""Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that’s less than truthful. His own top adviser said they were, quote, ‘certainly friendly.’ In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’ home. And they’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago."" Back then, we rated Palin’s statement Mostly True. Was this a case of Palin going rogue? Not likely. About a week later, McCain himself raised the shadow of Ayers briefly during his final debate with Obama. ""Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Sen. Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship,"" McCain said. The final proof that none of this was off-the-cuff and in fact was coming from those ""braniacs in the GOP machine"" as Palin put it, came in the form of robo-calls. On Oct. 18, 2008, the Washington Post reported that voters in Virginia, Ohio and Florida were picking up the phone and hearing this from the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee. ""Hello. I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home and killed Americans."" It’s possible that Palin had wanted to talk about Ayers earlier in the campaign. We reached out to her Political Action Committee for clarification but did not hear back. But her words on Fox News gave no indication of anything but a ban. Our ruling Palin said she was banned from talking about one-time domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, but the record shows the complete and utter opposite. Not only did Palin talk about Ayers, so did the man at the top of the ticket, as did a recorded message from the RNC that went out to voters in battleground states. When the public record and the candidate’s own words speak so strongly against a statement, we have little choice.

Immigration claim about second jobs doesn’t really work
","The U.S. Senate passed its version of an overhaul of U.S. immigration law late last month, and debate over the legislation has been nonstop. (The U.S. House plans to take up its immigration bill in the fall.) Georgia immigration attorney Charles Kuck discussed provisions of the bill during a forum at a northwest Georgia college last month. The bill would affect the entire nation, not just the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, he said. But it was Kuck’s comments about the E-Verify mandate, captured in The Rome News-Tribune, that caught our attention. ""When you want to get a second job, you’ll get what’s called a ‘tentative nonconfirmation’ that says somebody’s used this ID to work somewhere else,"" Kuck said. ""So you have to have government permission to get a second job."" We at PolitiFact Georgia have been known to moonlight outside our fact-checking assignments, so we decided to investigate Kuck’s claim about needing approval for more work. Kuck supports changing immigration law, is a board member of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials and is a frequent commentator on national news programs. He told us his statement was based on the experiences of two of his Atlanta-area clients. When they applied for second jobs and their personal information was run through the E-Verify system, they were told by their potential employers that the identifications associated with their Social Security numbers were being used elsewhere. In this case, the identifications were being used by the men at their first jobs, so there was no fraudulent activity. But the mandate could cause unintended consequences for all workers, Kuck said. The Senate immigration bill includes a provision mandating employers enroll in the federal E-Verify program within five years. Just what is E-Verify? E-Verify is a federal Internet-based system that allows employers to verify that their workers are authorized to work in the United States. The system compares information from a worker’s employment verification form with federal data records to confirm employment eligibility. When the information doesn’t match, potential workers receive a ""tentative nonconfirmation"" from the government, which they can contest within eight days. The system is meant to prevent ineligible people from getting jobs, and it can also catch fraudulent activity, including identity theft. Although not nationally mandated for private employers, some have voluntarily enrolled in the program for more than a decade. Georgia requires all but the smallest private employers to use the online work authorization program. Before the Senate bill’s passage, there was criticism about potential problems E-Verify could create for legal workers. Testimony in April 2011 by officials from the U.S. Government Accountability Office officials noted that agencies have improved the program but challenges remained. Based on a report of fiscal 2009 data, the government reduced the number of eligible employees not automatically confirmed by E-Verify from about 8 percent to 2.6 percent. Of that lower figure, slightly more than one out of every 10 of those people were determined to be work-eligible after they contested the ""tentative nonconfirmation"" ruling and fixed errors in their records. The remainder, or 189,000 people, were never able to resolve their problems. It was unclear whether they were notified by their employers of their right to contest the ruling, whether they independently decided not to contest it or whether they were not eligible to work. Statistics found on the federal E-Verify website show that the number of people not automatically confirmed to work has dropped to 1.35 percent. Nearly one in five of those people contested and fixed the initial ruling. The rest weren’t able to resolve their problems or didn’t contest the findings. Critics, such as Chris Calabrese of the American Civil Liberties Union, say that even with a relatively low error rate, E-Verify imposes a burden on those Americans who will be wrongfully denied an opportunity to earn a living. We checked with several immigration experts about the possible employment problems with the E-Verify system. In theory, Kuck’s argument appears to be correct, said Carolina Antonini, an immigration attorney and professor at Georgia State University. None of her clients has experienced issues similar to Kuck’s clients. It would probably depend on the circumstances, said John Feere, a legal policy analyst with the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter immigration controls. In terms of using E-Verify as a mechanism to prevent identity theft, ""it would make sense that if the government saw that I was taking on several other jobs, then the government would alert me,"" he said. ""Does it happen as soon as a person applies for a second job? I’m not sure."" Philip Wolgin, an immigration expert at the liberal Center for American Progress, said Kuck may be confusing another provision of the Senate bill that allows people to lock their own Social Security number to prevent identity theft. ""There is nothing in the (Senate) bill or in the E-Verify program that flags people who apply for multiple jobs as tentatively nonconfirmed,"" Wolgin said, ""and there is certainly nothing that forces people to ask the government for permission to work a second job."" So is Kuck correct that you would need government permission to get a second job? The Senate bill includes a mandate for all employers to begin using the electronic employment verification system E-Verify within four years. That system flags workers whose employee data doesn’t match federal documents. But program and independent data show that most workers are automatically confirmed in the E-Verify system. It is possible that an employee whose Social Security number, for example, being used for one job could be flagged when that same number is used to secure another job. But it would most likely occur with multiple uses of the same information. Kuck’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rated his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A490980>],/factchecks/2013/jul/30/charles-kuck/immigration-claim-about-second-jobs-doesnt-really-/

CNN's Don Lemon says more than 72 percent of African-American births are out of wedlock
","In the middle of a national conversation about race following the George Zimmerman acquittal, CNN anchor Don Lemon gave an on-air commentary that went viral on social media. The focus of the commentary was a five-point list of recommendations. ""Black people,"" Lemon said, ""if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing."" The No. 1 item on that list -- ""and probably the most important,"" he said -- had to do with out-of-wedlock births. ""Just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should,"" Lemon said. ""Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues."" Lemon’s commentary inspired a firestorm of criticism on social media -- the website Mediaite published a sampling -- and bloggers took aim at his conclusions. ""If Lemon really wanted to help the black community, he could start by adopting a deeper understanding of the history, sociology and psychology of his own people,"" wrote Washington Post blogger Rahiel Tesfamariam. ""Offering made-for-TV analysis about deeply complex social issues in the manner in which he did is irresponsible and lacks intellectual rigor."" We can’t check Lemon’s opinions, but we did want to take a look at the one verifiable fact he offered. Is it correct that ""more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock""? We turned to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes a report every year that includes a wealth of data about births in America. The most recent report, published in August 2012, is based on data from 2010. The report broke down statistics by ethnic groups. Here’s a summary   Racial or ethnic group Percent of births considered ""non-marital"" Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 17 percent Non-Hispanic whites 29 percent Hispanics 53 percent American Indian and Native Alaskans 66 percent Non-Hispanic blacks 73 percent   So Lemon is correct that ""more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock."" To make sure we weren’t missing something, we asked two population experts -- Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, and Douglas Massey, professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research -- and they agreed that the statistic is the best available. Lemon did overreach somewhat when he went on to say that the 72 percent ""out of wedlock"" figure ""means absent fathers."" The 72 percent figure refers to children who are born to women who are not married; it would, however, include unmarried couples in which the father is present. That said, the rate of African-American children living in single-parent homes is almost as high as the rate for non-marital births. The chart below summarizes 2011 Census Bureau data compiled by Kids Count, a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The group defined ""children in single-parent families"" as kids under 18 who live with their own single parent; it includes children living with a parent and a cohabiting adult, but it does not include children living with married step-parents.
  Racial or ethnic group Children in single-parent families Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 17 percent Non-Hispanic whites 25 percent Hispanics 42 percent American Indian and Native Alaskans 53 percent Non-Hispanic blacks 67 percent   We should note that this data doesn’t suggest that 67 percent of African-American children have no contact with their father (or a father figure), but rather that their father does not live in the same household with them. Our ruling Lemon said that ""more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock."" Federal data confirms that 73 percent of African-American births in 2010 were out of wedlock. Estimates for the percentage of African-American children growing up in single-parent households are slightly lower, at 67 percent. Finally, black children counted in these statistics may have contact outside the household with their biological father. But Lemon's statistic was accurate, and we rate his statement True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B8E4C0>],/factchecks/2013/jul/29/don-lemon/cnns-don-lemon-says-more-72-percent-african-americ/
"['Oregon', 'Oregon Catalyst']","
Was a bill condemning the I.R.S. scandal the only one not referred to a committee?
","Remember that IRS scandal a few months back? An investigation found that the Internal Revenue Service had been closely scrutinizing the tax status of several conservative groups. Naturally, Republicans were not happy with this news. Some tried to tie the scandal directly to the Obama Administration, though no such link has been found. The issue has mostly faded from the headlines, but it still continues to bubble up from time to time. It did so recently in a piece on the conservative blog Oregon Catalyst. The article, which has no listed author, notes that ""people all over Oregon and the United States have been deeply troubled by the growing scandal involving the Obama administration’s use of the Internal Revenue Service for political purposes. The notion that the IRS would be used to harass and intimidate conservative grassroots organizations is one that many find very offensive."" Now, whether the Obama administration specifically used the IRS for anything is still open to debate. More recently it has come out that groups with words like ""progressive"" in their names were also scrutinized. However, we’re not fact checking that this time around. What we’re looking at is something else altogether. During the 2013 legislative session, Oregon Republicans introduced a House Joint Memorial that asked Congress to ""take all appropriate action, including but not limited to further investigation of Internal Revenue Service actions and the drafting of any appropriate legislation, to rein in the powers of, and increase congressional oversight over"" the IRS. But HJM 20 -- which we’ll note is a non-binding, symbolic piece of legislation -- didn’t go anywhere. Oregon Catalyst was not happy about that: ""Unfortunately, HJM 20 was referred to the Speaker’s desk and stayed there until the session ended. It was never even assigned to a committee for consideration. In fact, it was the ONLY (emphasis theirs) bill not assigned to a House committee. ""Maybe (Speaker of the House) Tina Kotek should stop covering for the Obama administration’s rampant abuses of power and stand up for our constitutional rights. And House Republicans should absolutely re-introduce a similar piece of legislation in next February’s month-long session."" At PolitiFact Oregon, we love words like ""only"" ""most"" ""first"" -- superlatives in general. They’re typically easy to check. So leaving aside the motives of Kotek, a Democrat, we wondered if this really was the only bill not assigned to a House committee. The statement was easy enough to check. We went to the Oregon Legislature’s website and looked at a list of all the measures and bills and resolutions in the House and their histories. As it happens HJM 20 did have some company. Both House Bills 2010 and 2011 also died on the speaker’s desk. Both pieces of legislation were proposed by Republicans. House Bill 2010 concerned the Water Resources Department and House Bill 2011 addressed having public employees return wages from an administrative leave if the leave is determined to be the result of criminal conduct. We’re always curious at PolitiFact Oregon and flipped back a couple sessions to see if this has happened before. It turns out it’s exceedingly rare. In fact we could find no other such instance. One other fact worth noting: HJM 20 had its first reading to the full House on July 1, well after deadlines had passed to get legislation through a complicated committee and two-chamber process. In fact, at that point, most of the committees had likely stopped meeting altogether. Certainly it could have been given priority, but given that the Legislature adjourned a week later, it would have been a stretch. The other two bills mentioned above similarly did not get their first reading until July 1 or later. We asked Dan Lucas, the man behind Oregon Catalyst, to weigh in but he declined to comment. In an online post, Oregon Catalyst lambasted Kotek for not advancing HJM 20, saying it was the only bill not assigned to a committee. In fact, it was one of the three; rare but not unique.

"['Ohio', 'Bipartisanship', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio says he was once filibustered
","Whew. We almost lost the filibuster. We’re being facetious, of course, because most Americans go through life happily without knowing -- or necessarily needing to know -- the rules of the United States Senate.  But for those who care about the art of blocking nominees or killing legislation, today’s fact-check is for you. ""I was filibustered."" That statement comes not from Richard Cordray, the newly confirmed director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after a long filibuster (hang on, we’ll get to the definition), but from one of the U.S. senators who helped block him: Ohio’s Rob Portman. Portman, a Republican, made the statement to reporters during a conference call on July 11, when Cordray’s inability to get an up-or-down confirmation vote was coming to a head and Senate Democrats threatened to change the filibuster rules. As the Cordray matter came up, Portman reminded reporters, ""I was filibustered."" Really? We knew that Portman, then a House of Representatives member representing the Cincinnati area, had some difficulty when President George W. Bush nominated him to be the United States trade representative in 2005. But we did not recall anyone standing in the Senate well reading a phone book or ""War and Peace"" or speaking for hours to block Portman’s confirmation vote. Nor did we recall a long cloture fight -- a battle to win 60 votes, or a three-fifths majority, to end debate. These are what generally come to mind when the word ""filibuster"" (which comes from a Dutch word meaning ""pirate,"" according to the Senate) is used. In Portman’s case, there was no floor battle. Rather, several weeks after Portman’s March 17, 2005, nomination, a single Democratic senator, Evan Bayh of Indiana, told the chamber’s leaders that he thought Bush was way too lax with China’s trade abuses and so he was placing a ""hold"" on Portman’s nomination as Bush’s trade ambassador. Bayh said at the time that before he could let the nomination move forward, he wanted a vote on a bipartisan bill to impose duties on subsidized imports from China. He and other senators, including Republicans, saw China’s practices as a violation of international trade laws. ""I decided to take this step because I cannot sit idly by while American workers and companies continue to be victimized by foreign countries who violate our trade agreements with impunity,"" Bayh said at the time. A hold is one of the informal, gentlemanly traditions of the Senate. It works like this: Senator A says he will not confirm Nominee So-and-So because he is displeased with the nominee’s agency, has a problem with the president’s plans for that agency or thinks the nominee is ill-suited for the job. So he informs the majority leader that he is placing a hold on the nomination. And just like that, the Senate puts the nomination aside, like some unpleasant piece of business it just isn’t going to deal with. Sometimes members of the president’s own party will place holds, like when Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown put one on the nominee to head the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. because of concern over how Delphi Corp. retiree pensions were handled during the 2009 General Motors bankruptcy. President Obama ultimately used a recess appointment to get the nominee, Joshua Gotbaum, in office, and then the Senate agreed to confirm him with a regular vote. But in the case of Portman, it was a Democrat protesting a Republican. You might ask why senators from the Republican Party, who at the time comprised a majority, didn’t just demand a vote and override Bayh’s objection. But that’s just not the way the Senate normally does things. Besides, that would have almost certainly led to public debate and a cloture fight, which senators often have tried to avoid on cabinet nominations (present Senate climate excepted) because it takes up valuable floor time. Furthermore, Republicans had 55 seats in that particular Senate, and failure to get the 60 votes for cloture can be embarrassing to the nominee and the president, potentially weakening both politically. A hold can avoid all that while having the same effect of blocking the nominee -- and often doing so a lot more quietly. And that is exactly what happened in the case of Portman. The hold lasted barely two weeks. Portman, Bayh and others talked throughout this period and came to an understanding. Senate leaders agreed to hold a hearing on the China trade bill Bayh wanted. And Portman agreed that as trade ambassador, he would conduct a top-to-bottom review of China’s practices. Bayh dropped his hold. In the end, Portman was confirmed on a ""voice vote,"" in which senators said ""yea"" or ""nay"" without their individual votes being recorded.. So had Portman been filibustered? We went to the Congressional Research Service for a definition of filibuster, and this is what one of its recent reports (May 31, 2013) said: ""Filibustering includes any use of dilatory or obstructive tactics to block a measure by preventing it from coming to a vote."" In a report the next month (June 26, 2013), the Congressional Research Service said, ""Although a ‘hold’ has no formal procedural force under Senate Rules, it may represent an implicit threat to filibuster that may discourage the majority leader from bringing the matter to the floor."" That seemed broader than the Hollywood version of a filibuster. Take, for example, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" in which Jimmy Stewart’s character, the idealistic Sen. Jefferson Smith, held the floor by talking for 23 hours to halt Senate action. Bayh’s hold certainly was unlike Wendy Davis’s recent filibuster in Texas over that state’s abortion laws. The Texas state senator spoke for 11 straight hours, although she was ultimately unsuccessful in keeping Texas from passing tougher abortion restrictions. But Bayh’s hold and what are thought of as more traditional filibusters had one thing in common. That is, the Bayh-Portman standoff officially ended not only as a result of negotiations but also because Majority Leader Bill Frist soon said it was time to put this to a vote and move on. Frist filed a petition for cloture, which started the clock toward a 60-threshold vote. Portman’s Senate staff pointed this out to us, as did Sarah Binder, a Brookings Institution senior scholar and George Washington University political science professor. Binder has written extensively about filibusters and Senate stalling tactics. With a cloture vote looming to end the standoff, Bayh settled on the terms he wanted and dropped his opposition. A cloture vote, and the attendant debate leading up to it, was avoided. ""That filing of the cloture motion is decent evidence in this case of the majority leader treating Bayh's hold as a threatened filibuster,"" Binder said in an email. Just to make sure we understood the nuance of all this, we contacted another expert, University of Miami political scientist Gregory Koger. Koger is the author of ""Filibustering: A Political History of Obstruction in the House and Senate,"" and, like Binder, one of the nation’s experts on the filibuster and Senate rules. ""The short answer is yes,"" Koger said. ""I would consider a hold tantamount to a filibuster if it’s a threat of delay for strategic purposes."" That is, he would consider it a filibuster if the senator placing the hold wanted something -- in this case, tougher trade enforcement. ""If you’re using it so you can extract concessions, that to me is the same thing as a filibuster,"" Koger said. Bayh got concessions. He dropped the hold.

Associated Industries of Florida says insurance tax break created ""40,000 jobs in just the last four years""
","
Good news, opponents of job growth (whoever you are): Tallahassee lawmakers are out to make it harder and costlier to create jobs. 
That’s the thrust of a TV ad airing in Tampa Bay from the business-backed lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida. The group does not want the insurance industry to lose a tax break it has enjoyed for more than three decades. Here’s the transcript: 
""It's the working tax cut that creates jobs -- over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years. Major employers are moving to Florida and hiring. That's growth our economy needs. But now some in Tallahassee want to end it and make it harder and more expensive to create jobs. It doesn't make sense. Say no to Senate Bill 1832. Keep the working tax cut. Keep the jobs."" 
The ad ignores the real keywords of this debate, which are ""insurance companies"" and ""motor vehicle registration fees."" 
""Working tax cut"" is a euphemism for ""taxpayer-subsidized premium tax credit."" Since 1987, insurance companies use a 15 percent premium tax credit for Florida-based employees, excluding insurance agents. 
The Senate’s chief budget-writer, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, proposed eliminating the tax credit in exchange for rolling back the Legislature’s 2009 hike on motor vehicle registration fees, a move that will save vehicle owners $12 a year. 
We wondered what evidence AIF had to support its claim that this 26-year-old tax cut created 40,000 jobs in the last four years. 
Debunking the jobs number 
AIF’s public relations consultant, Bascom Communications and Consulting, directed us to 2009 and 2011 reports about the state’s insurance industry by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the 2012 report is not out yet). The reports run a year or two behind for job estimates for the industry. The 2011 annual report references 2010 jobs data, and the 2009 report includes 2007 jobs data. 
According to state reports, the insurance industry accounted for 144,184 jobs in Florida in 2007 and grew to 188,290 in 2010. Boom, AIF says, 44,106 new insurance jobs created. 
Not so fast. This picture of dramatic jobs growth is not supported by evidence. 
The state reports cited by AIF say their jobs data is backed up by two sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis, run by the U.S. Department of Commerce; and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, run by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
State insurance regulators were still collecting information about how it compiles its data by our deadline. It appears, though, that the dramatic jobs growth AIF is crowing about is the result of the state using two very different starting places to calculate job growth. 
Here's what most likely happened: 
The state's count for insurance jobs in 2007 (the 144,184 number) is backed by BEA jobs data for full- and part-time wage and salary employees, excluding proprietors and general partners. 
But the 2010 state number relied on a different calculation, one that includes proprietors and general partners. 
It's a significant difference. 
An apples-to-apples comparison of job growth -- whether or not you include proprietors and general partners -- shows that the state actually lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010. 
We'll say that again. If the state compared the same set of data -- either one -- they would have found that the state lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010. 
BLS data does not help, either. From December 2007 to December 2010, the industry gained 100 jobs, according to BLS. Not 40,000. 
Does the credit lead to jobs? 
Tax credits save businesses money. 
But is this one entirely responsible for an uptick in insurance jobs? 
""Extremely unlikely,""  said William Seyfried, Rollins College economics professor. ""General economic conditions and other factors would be expected to have a larger impact."" 
Florida should enact a premium tax break for every industry ""and just watch the jobs pour in,"" joked Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist. 
The business-backed research and advocacy group Florida TaxWatch created a brief report detailing its concerns with ending the tax credit, which the group said was created to encourage ""mobile jobs"" that are administrative or in call centers (our analysis does not get into whether the credit created the kind of jobs it was supposed to, though lobbyists ticked off a few recent examples of call centers opening in Tampa and other Florida cities recently). 
TaxWatch argued this tax cut, while not the primary reason companies come to Florida, may be the tie-breaker, and it offsets the insurance industry’s disproportionate tax burden compared to other industries. 
""While there has been no research attempting to show a direct correlation between the tax credit and growth of the insurance industry in Florida,"" the report states, ""it is hard to argue that Florida’s business climate is more attractive to insurers with the credit than without it."" 
AIF's own lobbyist, Brewster Bevis, said at an April 18 committee hearing on SB 1832, ""One of the reasons for the job creation and industry growth in the face of national economic uncertainty has been the attractiveness of Florida as a place to do business due to the premium tax cut that this bill would do away with."" 
Several insurance lobbyists at the meeting testified SB 1832 would increase the industry’s tax burden on top of what carriers will pay in additional taxes under the new national health care law. Several Republican senators were skeptical, saying the Legislature had historically worked to improve the business climate for the insurance industry and too many years had passed since the tax incentive was reviewed. 
Repealing the insurance tax credit would bring about $230 million to state coffers each year, which would pay for reducing motor vehicle fees, according to a committee analysis. 
""Not only will this bill rid our state of an antiquated government subsidy for the insurance industry, but, more importantly, it will keep money in the pockets of our hard-working taxpayers,"" said Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, in a statement. 
Our ruling 
AIF rolled out a big ad campaign to combat SB 1832, saying the insurance industry’s ""working tax cut"" created ""over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years."" 
The problem is the number, which is cherry-picked and wrong. 
And even if the jobs number was right -- and again, it's not -- experts say the tax cut would only be one factor in a company's decision to expand operations in Florida. 
We rate AIF's claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B8ED00>],/factchecks/2013/apr/19/associated-industries-florida/associated-industries-florida-says-insurance-tax-c/

Emory says Chick-fil-A decision not political
","
Emory University’s newspaper, The Emory Wheel, reported last month that the university will boot Chick-fil-A off campus this summer. 
The move comes after Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy last year angered supporters of same-sex marriage. David Furhman, the senior director of Emory’s Food Service Administration, told the Wheel that the decision to remove Chick-fil-A was not spurred by the Cathy controversy. It was, he said, based solely on student feedback from surveys and focus groups. 
""What we learned was that there was no great affinity or love for Chick-fil-A,"" Furhman said in a March 12 article in the Wheel. ""It was more of an affinity or love of the convenience, and what students also told us was that they didn’t really love Chick-fil-A."" 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Was Emory's decision triggered solely by focus-group feedback? 
And we wanted to know what that feedback included. 
The conflict began when Cathy discussed same-sex marriage in a July 2012 interview. 
""I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, 'We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'"" Cathy said. 
Critics called for boycotts. Supporters rallied to Cathy’s defense, organizing a ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day"" that packed eateries. 
Chick-fil-A, which began in metro Atlanta and is headquartered here, did not respond to an interview request. 
Emory groups, including gay rights organizations and the Student Government Association, formally requested the removal of Chick-fil-A after the controversy began. Senior Director and Dean of Campus Life Ajay Nair released a statement saying the university wouldn’t remove the eatery based on Cathy’s comments. 
But in February, the university and a student committee called FACE (Food Administration Committee Emory) said they were going to review all campus food venues, including Chick-fil-A. 
Furhman told the Wheel that the examination of the campus food venues where Chick-fil-A is located predated the controversy. But both student co-chairs of FACE contradicted that. They said the review plan began when Furhman joined Emory in January. 
PolitiFact contacted Furhman, who referred all inquiries to Campus Communications. He declined to answer our questions. 
Nair said in the Wheel: ""Through (dialogue over Chick-fil-A), we also learned that a re-visioning of dining at Emory could foster a separate, positive community change, while addressing students’ concerns around their dining experiences."" 
One student co-chair of the food committee, Karoline Porcello, told the Wheel the restaurant’s values were a contributing, but not deciding factor in its removal. In an email, Porcello clarified that those values referred to ""human development values"" such as physical well-being, not political values. 
After PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Campus Communications, Porcello said: ""We've received strict instructions by Emory to no longer comment on the issue."" 
Michael Sacks, another co-chair, said the removal was not political. 
""It’s kind of unfortunate that people very easily jump to the conclusion that Chick-fil-A’s political views were the reason we got rid of them, but that was not our intention at all,"" Sacks told WSB Radio. 
The process reviewed each venue according to six criteria, including consistency with the campus life department’s core values and survey data. 
The committee held open monthly meetings and focus groups with more than 30 volunteer attendees who answered FACE’s questions. In all three of the monthly meeting documents on the FACE website, Chick-fil-A was not mentioned. 
Sacks sent over three of the four focus groups’ minutes. He said that he was told that the last meeting ""did not present much opportunity for note-taking."" 
The three focus group minutes didn’t conclusively show a distaste for Chick-fil-A. Some attendees said they eat at Chick-fil-A often while others showed distaste for the venue. One document even said ""Keep Chick-fil-A"" in the summary box. 
Porcello said some focus group members wanted to remove Chick-fil-A for health reasons and that some said they only liked the convenience of the venue. The documents provided to PolitiFact Georgia didn’t confirm those claims. Porcello didn’t respond to requests to do so. 
In a March meeting, the food committee put three floor plans up for a vote. None of the plans included Chick-fil-A or Pizza Hut. Sacks said that decision was based on the focus groups. 
Ultimately, the redesign will replace Chick-fil-A with a pizza and pasta venue, expand Mexican food and salad areas and create a grab-and-go station and a coffee and bakery area. The committee chairs said the university will remove Pizza Hut as well. 
Dena Smith, Emory’s senior communication officer, sent PolitiFact a link to a March 12 Campus Life statement indicating that Emory would announce a final Chick-fil-A decision soon. She said Emory would consider FACE’s input, which does not include ""a chicken restaurant."" This statement was released the same day that the Wheel and WSB Radio published their stories about the venue’s closure. 
PolitiFact contacted 15 Emory political science professors for a comment. None wanted to weigh in on the controversy. 
Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint says that it is difficult to believe that the decision wasn’t political. He said that Emory’s role as  ""ground zero"" of the Chick-fil-A debate may have something to do with its defense. 
""I’m not saying that it isn’t true,"" Swint said, ""But I work on a college campus ... and I can tell you that Chick-fil-A is probably the most popular dining option (on my campus)."" 
Our conclusion: 
An Emory administrator said that a proposal to remove Chick-fil-A from a campus dining hall was not politically motivated but was instead based on focus groups. Campus officials have offered conflicting statements about Chick-fil-A’s future. 
PolitiFact rules require the person making the statement to provide the proof to back it up. Furhman and Emory failed to do so. 
There apparently was an objective process that reviewed all food vendors, but only incomplete documentation was provided. That documentation didn’t confirm any of the sources’ claims. And the final redesign plan doesn’t indicate the committee was concentrating on health concerns. It  wants to remove Chick-fil-A, but plans call for a proposed pizza and pasta joint and expanded Mexican food areas. Not exactly healthy alternatives. 
We rated the claim Half True.

She is also an editor at The Emory Wheel but took no part in the Chick-fil-A news coverage.)",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4ABDC0>],/factchecks/2013/apr/19/david-furhman/emory-says-chick-fil-decision-not-political/

Obama says bipartisan background check plan “outlawed any (gun) registry”
","
President Barack Obama accused the ""gun lobby and its allies"" of lying about a bipartisan background check proposal that failed Wednesday in the Senate. 
From the Rose Garden, he charged: 
""They claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn't matter."" 
The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. 
Did it, in fact, outlaw any gun registry? 
‘A path to a national gun registry’ 
The government requires background checks for gun sales by licensed firearms dealers — but not for sales between folks who aren’t in the business of selling guns. 
Manchin and Toomey’s amendment expanded the background check requirement to sales at gun shows and those advertised in publications and on the Web. But it didn’t go as far as the original bill, which required background checks for all gun transfers with limited exceptions. 
That compromise wasn’t enough to attract the 60-vote supermajority required to pass the amendment. It failed on a 54 to 46 vote. 
Opponents had, indeed, raised the specter of a national gun registry. 
""If your private gun transaction is covered by Toomey-Schumer-Manchin (and virtually all will be) ... you can assume you will be part of a national gun registry,"" wrote Michael Hammond of lobbying group Gun Owners of America. 
The existing background checks require filling out ATF Form 4473. That personal information is then run through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The government is supposed to destroy personally identifying information, but gun dealers are required to store the forms. 
The government is then allowed to inspect them in the course of criminal investigations or to ensure gun dealers keep the records they’re supposed to keep. 
So what did the Manchin-Toomey amendment say about a registry? 
First, it made reference to federal law that already bans creation of a federal registry. 
Since the mid 1980s, it’s been against federal law for information from background checks to be ""recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor that any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions be established."" 
That’s why, if you’re cleared to purchase a gun, the FBI is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. 
The Manchin-Toomey amendment doubled down on this ban, declaring: ""Congress supports and reaffirms the existing prohibition on a national firearms registry."" 
It also declared that nothing in the legislation should be construed to ""allow the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a federal firearms registry."" 
Later, it added these provisions: 
• ""The Attorney General shall be prohibited from seizing any records or other documents in the course of an inspection or examination authorized by this paragraph other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law."" 
• ""The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize the records of the ... acquisition or disposition of firearms, or any portion thereof."" 
• ""Any person who knowingly violates (the prohibition against consolidating or centralizing records) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.'' 
So, the amendment prohibited the centralizing of federal records — and added the threat of prison. 
But those protections didn’t reassure gun rights proponents. 
The National Rifle Association argues that gun control supporters believe expanding background checks is a precursor to gun confiscation. An Arizona gun group spokesman told us the federal government would illegally collect background check information submitted to the FBI. Sarah Palin, arguing against the Toomey-Manchin amendment, said it ""creates a path to a national gun registry"" since dealers store background check forms and the bill didn’t explicitly ban copying them, storing them in various locations (rather than centrally), or keeping a list of them. 
She didn’t mention that existing federal law — referenced by the bill — already prohibits ""any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions."" 
Our ruling 
Obama said opponents of compromise gun legislation ""claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text."" The Manchin-Toomey amendment referenced a registry ban already in federal law, then expanded it, prohibiting seizure of records, forbidding the attorney general from consolidating or centralizing records, and providing for fines and imprisonment for anyone who did consolidate or centralize records. We rate Obama’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFBDC0>],/factchecks/2013/apr/18/barack-obama/obama-says-bipartisan-background-check-plan-outlaw/

NRA says Manchin-Toomey would have criminalized some gun transfers between family, friends
","Not long after the Senate voted down a bipartisan effort to expand background checks on gun sales, the National Rifle Association released a statement hailing the proposal’s downfall as good news. ""This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution. As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools,"" the pro-gun rights group said on April 17, 2013. The amendment, offered by Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, would have required background checks for private sales at gun shows and on the Internet, two areas that are currently exempt from federal law. But it specifically exempted transactions between family members from the background check requirement. So we wondered what circumstances the NRA envisioned that could have ""criminalized certain private transfers of firearms."" What’s in the amendment The Manchin-Toomey amendment stopped short of language in a larger Senate bill on guns, which would have mandated criminal background checks on all sales between private parties with limited exceptions. Current law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers. So the Manchin-Toomey amendment attempted to find middle ground -- expanding the checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. ""As under current law, transfers between family, friends and neighbors do not require background checks. You can give or sell a gun to your brother, your neighbor, your co-worker without a background check. You can post a gun for sale on the cork bulletin board at your church or your job without a background check,"" a press release from the senators said. The amendment itself specifically said background checks wouldn’t be required of family members if ""the transfer is made between spouses, between parents or spouses of parents and their children or spouses of their children, between siblings or spouses of siblings, or between grandparents or spouses of grandparents and their grandchildren or spouses of their grandchildren, or between aunts or uncles or their spouses and their nieces or nephews or their spouses, or between first cousins, if the transferor does not know or have reasonable cause to believe that the transferee is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm under Federal, State, or local law."" ""It’d have to be pretty distant family"" for the background check rule to apply, said Chris Calabrese, legal counsel for the ACLU. As for friends buying and selling guns, no background check was required if the sale was not advertised online or in a publication. So how could such transfers be ""criminalized?"" The amendment required a background check for any advertised sale. So imagine these two circumstances overlapping. ""If I do an advertisement that I’m looking to sell a firearm and then my friend comes and says to me, ‘I’d like to buy a gun,’ then I’d have to do a background check,"" Calabrese said. Same goes for a gun sold to a friend or a family member at a gun show. Calabrese said the ACLU did not oppose the Manchin-Toomey amendment because it made clear what transactions were subject to background checks. ""We didn’t think anybody should inadvertently become a criminal. The criminal laws should be clear in who they apply to so people don’t have a problem understanding and following the law. We think this meets this standard,"" he said. John Frazer, a spokesman for the NRA, described some circumstances ""in which transfers among such people could have been subject to prosecution under the amendment."" He mentioned friends running into each other at a gun show, or someone posting a gun for sale on Facebook and receiving interest from a cousin. If a gun was sold in those circumstances without a background check, ""the transfer would be a crime."" Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun issues who favors more gun control, told PolitiFact that the amendment didn’t go so far as criminalizing private transfers. ""It simply subjected them to new procedural requirements,"" he said in an email. Our ruling The NRA said that the Manchin-Toomey amendment would have ""criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution."" The amendment specifically exempted family and friend transfers from the requirement to conduct a criminal background check. But it did extend the requirement to Internet and gun show sales. So only if a friend or family member purchased a gun in one of those settings would the background check requirement kick in. That’s a limited circumstance, to be sure. And as Wintemute argued, it was added a layer of paperwork but did not make familial gun transfers crimes. The NRA’s statement contained an element of truth but was otherwise a big stretch. We rate it Mostly False. Update: This report has been updated to include a comment we received from the NRA shortly after we  published.

Barack Obama says, 'The NRA used to support expanded background checks.'
","
After the Senate failed to advance an amendment that would expand federal requirements for background checks on gun purchasers, President Barack Obama took to the White House’s Rose Garden to denounce the vote, calling it ""a pretty shameful day for Washington."" 
Flanked by relatives of some of the slain children from Newtown, Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, Obama emphasized how broadly Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases. 
At one point, Obama invoked his gun-policy adversary, the National Rifle Association. ""Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks,"" he said. ""The current leader of the NRA"" -- referring to Wayne LaPierre -- ""used to support these background checks."" 
This echoed a similar claim we checked earlier this year. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on NBC’s Meet the Press that ""if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done."" 
We’ll recap what we found when checking the comment Bloomberg made. 
On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier. 
To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy. 
First on that list was this: 
""We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone,"" he said. ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances."" 
He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows, and keeping schools gun-free. 
There’s additional evidence, too. 
New York magazine, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled ""Be reasonable,"" the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, ""We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun."" 
We contacted the NRA for our previous story but did not receive a response. In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, ""The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work."" 
LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting. 
""I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working,"" he said. 
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, ""I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?"" 
LaPierre responded: ""I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law."" 
The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks. 
Our ruling 
In his Rose Garden comments, Obama said ""the NRA used to support expanded background checks."" He’s correct: In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it ""reasonable"" to conduct a background check ""for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone."" Subsequent statements by NRA officials acknowledge that the group’s position has since changed to opposition to more background checks. So we rate Obama’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C4F080>],/factchecks/2013/apr/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-nra-used-support-expanded-backgr/

Gabby Giffords says Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support expanding background checks
","
Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head while meeting with constituents on Jan. 8, 2011, has become a leading advocate for Americans who support tighter restrictions on guns. 
More than two years later, the Senate moved to consider an amendment that would have expanded background checks. But the amendment failed to win the necessary 60 votes to proceed to a final vote. 
The day after the vote, Giffords wrote an op-ed for the New York Times decrying that vote. 
In her op-ed, Giffords wrote, ""Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents — who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them."" 
Under current law, background checks are required in sales made by federally licensed gun dealers, but not for gun sales by private sellers. President Barack Obama wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which opposes universal background checks, argues that an expansion would fail to deter criminals. 
Here, we will check Giffords’ claim that polls show that Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support ""expanding background checks."" 
To do this, we will look at national survey data from media and academic polls taken in the month prior to Giffords’ column. Here’s a rundown of all such polls we could find that addressed an expansion of background checks: 
• Washington Post-ABC News poll, April 11-14, 2013: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 86 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. 
• CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, April 5-7, 2013: ""Some proposals would require a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony or has a mental health problem. Please tell me whether you would favor or oppose a background check for a prospective gun buyer under each of the following circumstances. ... If the buyer is trying to purchase a gun at a gun show."" Favor: 83 percent. Oppose: 17 percent. 
""If the buyer is trying to purchase a gun from another person who is not a gun dealer but owns one or more guns and wants to sell one of them."" Favor: 70 percent. Oppose: 29 percent. 
""If the buyer is purchasing a gun from a family member or receiving it as a gift."" Favor: 54 percent. Oppose: 45 percent. 
""Please tell me whether you would favor or oppose a background check for anyone who wants to buy ammunition for a gun."" Favor: 55 percent. Oppose: 44 percent. 
• Quinnipiac University poll, March 26-April 1, 2013. ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 91 percent. Oppose: 8 percent. 
• CBS News poll, March 20-24, 2013. ""Would you favor or oppose background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 90 percent. Oppose: 8 percent. 
Giffords’ claim is well-founded, in part because it’s not overly specific: In four polls over the prior month, between 83 percent and 91 percent of respondents said they would favor an expansion of the current background check regime. We think any reasonable person would conclude that those percentages qualify as ""overwhelming."" 
Giffords would have had more trouble finding support for her claim had she either set a numerical threshold or had she been more specific about the kind of background checks Americans are comfortable with. 
For instance, when Obama spoke shortly after the amendment’s failure in the Senate, he cited 90 percent support for an expansion of background checks not once but five times in fairly brief remarks. In the survey results we found, half of the polls crossed that threshold and half did not (though those that didn’t are fairly close). 
Meanwhile, the results of the CNN poll suggest that Americans do not support all possible expansions of background checks to the same extent. Checks at gun shows found 83 percent support, but private sales between a willing seller and a willing buyer garnered 70 percent backing, while checks for transfers to family members or for the purchase of ammunition only reached the mid 50-percent range. 
Our ruling 
In her op-ed, Giffords said polls show that Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support ""expanding background checks."" Four independent polls taken in the previous month showed that some sort of expansion of background checks earned the support of between 83 percent and 91 percent of respondents, a level of backing we think qualifies as ""overwhelming."" We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B3AC00>],/factchecks/2013/apr/18/gabrielle-giffords/gabby-giffords-says-americans-overwhelmingly-suppo/

Rep. John Duncan Jr. says 90 percent of felons grew up in fatherless households
","
A reader recently sent us a letter he received from his congressman, Rep. John Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., asking us to check a surprising claim. 
""Well over 90 percent of felony cases, all over the nation, are committed by defendants who grew up in father-absent households,"" Duncan wrote. 
Patrick Newton, a spokesman for Duncan, said the letter was based on the congressman's ""knowledge obtained from nearly eight years as a criminal court judge dealing with mostly felony cases."" 
The spokesman went on to say that on Duncan’s first day as a criminal court judge in Knoxville, Tenn., chief probation counselor Gary Tullock told him it was actually 98 percent, a figure Duncan lowered slightly in his letter. 
""Mr. Duncan then went on to preside over 10,000 cases in nearly eight years,"" the spokesman said.  ""In each case, he was given a report or information on the defendant’s background. Congressman Duncan says in well more than 90 percent of cases, the defendant was described as being from either a ‘fatherless home’ or a ‘broken home.’ He found Mr. Tullock’s comment to be true through his own experience as a judge, and he fully stands by his remark."" 
We should point out, however, that Tullock’s claim is based on data roughly 35 years old, while Duncan’s observations from his tenure as a judge are now a quarter-century old. That is inconsistent with Duncan’s use of the present-tense ""are committed"" in the constituent letter. In addition, even if these numbers were true for Knoxville, the statistics wouldn’t reflect conditions ""all over the nation,"" as Duncan said in the letter. 
And of course, PolitiFact always prefers to deal in hard data. So we took a look at the available research. 
The few studies that address this question aren’t a perfect match to Duncan’s wording, because the data we have often addresses individuals who are in jail or prison, rather than people who are facing a ""felony case."" Still, the data is close enough for us to make an educated assessment. 
First, we looked at data from the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, a sample of 7,000 inmates by the U.S. Justice Department. 
In 1996, almost 40 percent of the sampled inmates had lived with both parents, with just over 60 percent of inmates saying they grew up with only one parent, with grandparents or in another arrangement. The numbers were similar in 2002 -- 44 percent growing up with both parents and 56 percent growing up in other situations. 
These numbers suggest that there’s a strong link between growing up in a non-two-parent household and becoming an inmate, but at rates well below the 90 percent Duncan cited. 
Second, we looked at data from the Justice Department’s Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities. The 2004 survey asked inmates who were parents themselves about what kind of family arrangements they had while while growing up. In state prisons, 43 percent of the inmates said they grew up with both parents, while 57 percent said they grew up in other arrangements. The data was similar for federal prisons -- 45 percent with both parents and 55 percent in other arrangements. 
Once again, this suggests rates lower than 90 percent 
Finally, we looked at a study co-authored by Cynthia C. Harper of the University of California at San Francisco and Sara McLanahan, a professor at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs who has authored a wide range of studies about disadvantaged Americans. 
They found that once you control for other factors, such as family income, a child growing up in a mother-only household was almost twice as likely as a child growing up in a mother-father household to end up incarcerated. That would put the percentage somewhere around 60 percent, which is broadly in line with the other studies. 
Sixty percent is a significant number, but it is not as great as the 90 percent figure Duncan cited. 
When we contacted McLanahan, she said she was skeptical that the 90 percent figure was accurate. ""I cannot think of any data that would give this information,"" she said. 
Dewey Cornell, a clinical psychologist and professor of education at the University of Virginia, said that even if Duncan’s statistic were true, ""it would be misleading and incomplete,"" because it does not address how many people grew up in father-absent households and did not commit felonies. 
""We could point out that 99 percent of felony offenders drank milk as a child, too, but it is easy to see the fallacy here because we have no preconceptions about milk the way we do about father absence,"" he said. ""Father absence is surely an important concern, but it is only one of a number of risk factors for felony criminal behavior."" 
Our ruling 
The data we found supports Duncan’s impression that growing up in a fatherless home is one of the factors that contributes to eventual incarceration. But the quantitative research does not show the near-certain link between felonies and fatherlessness that Duncan portrays. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978B8100>],/factchecks/2013/apr/18/john-duncan/rep-john-duncan-jr-says-90-percent-felons-grew-fat/

Wendy Davis says Texas ranks 49th in what it is doing in per-pupil education spending
","
A state senator opposed to a proposal intended to enable some children to attend private schools with government aid asserted that Texas already has a hard time keeping pace with other states. 
Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, told Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, during an April 9, 2013, committee meeting that ""we in the state of Texas are 49th in the country in what we are doing to support our per-pupil investment in education in the state."" She added that she prefers to prioritize putting dollars into the public schools. 
A reader asked us to check that ranking. 
Senator cites newspaper report 
By email, Davis’ spokesman, Rick Svatora, told us she was referring to a report described in a Feb. 22, 2013, Dallas Morning News article stating that preliminary figures released by the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, indicate Texas schools are spending $8,400 per student this year. The national average is $11,455, the report said, putting Texas’ per-student expenditures below every state save Arizona and Nevada. 
So, compared to other states, Texas reportedly ranks 48th in per-student spending. Then again, the News’ story notes that the association’s analysis also considered spending in District of Columbia schools, a consideration leaving Texas 49th in per-student spending among 51 jurisdictions. 
The News’ story said the association’s comparisons, based on data furnished by state education agencies, are ""among the most reliable in the nation and are frequently cited by officials in Texas and other states. The NEA has been issuing its annual reports on public school spending since the early 1960s."" 
Education association report 
We turned to the association’s report, downloadable here, finding the figures cited by the newspaper in Summary Table K, ""Estimated Expenditures for Public Schools, 2012-13,"" which indicates that Texas this year is spending less per student in average daily attendance (the aggregate attendance of a school during a reporting period divided by the number of days school is in session that period) than all states but Arizona and Nevada. Elsewhere, the report says these expenses include salaries for school personnel, student transportation, school books and materials and energy costs. 
A wrinkle: Part of the report says that in making useful comparisons among states, a different way of counting students, fall enrollment, is preferred to average daily attendance because of its standardized definition. Based on fall enrollment, the report says, Texas is spending an estimated $7,886 per pupil, less than every state except Utah and Arizona, according to Table K. 
So, it looks like two states trail Texas in per-pupil spending, either way you count students. 
For each state, Table K also lists current estimated expenditures for other programs, meaning such expenses as summer school and adult education, which are not part of regular public elementary and secondary day-school programs, the report says. 
The table also shows spending by each state’s schools on interest on debt and capital outlays, which conservative observers such as the Texas Public Policy Foundation have said should always be taken into account when making state-by-state comparisons. 
Considering all education-related expenditures 
When we checked a similar Davis claim about Texas’ spending on education in 2011, a foundation spokesman pointed out a March 2010 report by the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute that reviewed 2008-09 budgets for districts in the nation’s five largest cities, including Houston, concluding that average per-pupil spending was 44 percent higher than was otherwise reported by public schools. Separately at the time, Frank Johnson, a statistician with the National Center for Education Statistics, told us the center doesn’t take into account capital outlays in estimating per-pupil spending because such costs can create false assumptions about what’s spent on instructional programs, school supplies and teachers. 
In the latest education association report, Table K’s last column presents each state’s total school spending, rolling in all subcategories. 
We wondered, then, how Texas stacks up by all expenditures per pupil. The report does not present such a calculation, so we made our own run, dividing the total spending for each state by the state’s average daily attendance, as shown in the report’s Summary Table D. And by this approach, it appears that more than $50 billion in total Texas school spending breaks out to nearly $11,090 per pupil, placing Texas 38th nationally, ahead of states including California, Georgia, Oklahoma and Arizona. 
By phone, a spokesman for the education association’s Texas affiliate, the Texas State Teachers Association, suggested it doesn’t make sense to roll in all expenditures because school districts have varied commitments to capital outlays and debt, while spending reflected in the presented per-pupil tallies are driven by legislative decisions about spending and finance formulas. 
Clay Robison followed up by email, saying that ""in many cases those expenditures pay to build football stadiums and other facilities, such as fine arts centers. I am not going to engage in the argument about football stadiums, but I don’t think it gives a fair comparison of how much states are spending on students. In other words, capital costs lump new classroom construction, which benefits all students, with expenditures that don’t apply to all students."" 
Robison pointed out that according to the report’s Table H-14, Texas spent $9,462 per pupil in 2010-11, which was before legislators cut education aid in the 2011 legislative session. This year, the association’s report suggests, such spending is down by more than $1,000 per pupil from 2010-11. 
Our ruling 
Davis said Texas ranks 49th in ""what we are doing to support our per-pupil investment in education in the state."" 
A report drawing on states’ figures estimates Texas is spending $7,886 or $8,400 per student this year, depending on how students are counted. Both ways, Texas ranks third to last among the states. Then again, folding in capital outlays, other education expenditures and interest on debt, total estimated spending in Texas of nearly $11,090 per pupil lands the state 38th among the states. 
But the senator focused on state investment which, unlike locally determined debt and capital outlays, are driven by legislative actions. Our sense is that this is the appropriate comparison, though Davis failed to clarify that Texas is 49th by this yardstick in comparison to other states plus Washington, D.C., which is not a state. Absent this clarification, her claim rates as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978B7940>],/factchecks/2013/apr/18/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-ranks-49th-what-it-doing-pu/

R.I. Treasurer Gina Raimondo repeats oft-quoted, but misleading, statistic in equal pay debate
","
In anticipation of Equal Pay Day on April 9, Rhode Island State Treasurer Gina Raimondo sent out a tweet declaring, ""Women make 77 cents for every dollar earned by men."" 
It sounds very unfair, and the statistic has become an oft-repeated rallying cry for wage equity. 
But PolitiFact has found, in several analyses, that the statistic is misleading. 
It's all about the context. 
The 77-cent figure comes from the U.S. Census Bureau. It's based on annual pay and it only includes men and women who work full time and year round -- about 67.8 percent of the total work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Thus, that estimate excludes one-third of the work force. 
The amount rises to 82 cents if you look at weekly wages, according to other BLS data. That estimate also includes teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers who are left out of the Census Bureau estimate if they are not working year-round or full time. That's up a penny from the previous year. 
The gap closes even more -- to 87 cents -- if you compare hourly wages for men and women. This comes from Table 9 of the BLS data and it includes part-time jobs, which are often filled by women. 
Going back to weekly wages, on Table 5 of that report, if you look at part-time work (less than 35 hours), women earned 5 cents more for every dollar earned by men. Women who worked 35 to 39 hours earned nearly 10 cents more than men. But as soon as the number of hours rose to 40 hours, women's earnings dropped to about 87 cents per dollar. 
The underlying concern here is that women are being paid less than men for doing the same job. Job-by-job data are harder to come by, but there is evidence that the gender difference is not as wide as the 77-cents-per-dollar statistic suggests. 
We went to Table 2 of that BLS report to look at specific occupations. In most cases, there were not enough data to make a gender comparison. But in the 113 instances where it was possible, women earned less than 77 cents on the dollar in 28 jobs and more than 77 cents in 85 jobs. In five jobs -- such as computer support specialists, medical scientists and stock clerks and order filers -- the average weekly wage for women was higher than for men. 
The U.S. Department of Labor looked at the question in a 2009 report. It noted that there are several work-related attributes of women and men that account for most of the wage gap. So its statistical analysis adjusted for the fact that women are more likely to work part-time (where the pay for everyone tends to be lower), leave the labor force for children or elder care, and gravitate toward ""family friendly"" occupations where compensation is more likely to be in the form of health insurance or other fringe benefits. 
It found that women earned 93-95 cents for every dollar earned by men. 
Raimondo's spokeswoman, Joy Fox, responded to our inquiry with an e-mail that said, in part, ""We are referring to the widely-used across-the-workforce number that is from the Census report."" She added, ""this has also been quoted by numerous respectable sources"" such as the American Association of University Women, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, the National Committee on Pay Equity and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. 
Our ruling 
Gina Raimondo said, ""Women make 77 cents for every dollar earned by men."" 
That's only true for one oft-cited statistic that does not, for example, look at part-time jobs where women tend to make more per week and does not address the crucial underlying question of whether women are getting equal pay for equal work. 
The gap shrinks -- sometimes considerably -- when complicating factors such as pay per hour or the decisions of women to leave the work force to raise children are considered. 
The 77-cent statistic has been widely cited by PolitiFact and other fact-checkers as oversimplified and misleading, yet it is still being used without qualification. 
On the other hand, other reliable measures of pay by gender also show that a significant gap persists, although not in all professions. 
Because Raimondo's statement leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

Did Ché Guevara write 'extensively' about the superiority of white Europeans? Rubio says yes
","
When rapper Jay-Z and his pop star wife Beyonce went to Cuba to celebrate their wedding anniversary in April, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., criticized the rapper’s choice of heroes. 
""Well, I won't rap it, but I'll say, first of all, I think Jay-Z needs to get informed,"" Rubio said during the April 14 interview on ABC News’ This Week. 
""One of his heroes is Ché Guevara. Ché Guevara was a racist. Ché Guevara was a racist that wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent. So he should inform himself on the guy that he's propping up."" 
It was a whirlwind day for Rubio as he taped seven interviews on Sunday news shows in anticipation of releasing immigration legislation with other senators. 
""You know, Jay-Z's a guy that wears the Ché Guevara t-shirt and he doesn't realize Ché Guevara was a racist,"" Rubio said on Meet the Press. ""Ché Guevara was a murderer and a killer. So look, (Jay-Z is) an entertainer, obviously. He's not in the middle of any public discourse here. But I think it's important to point out when people take stances like this that are absurd."" 
Clearly, Ché Guevara is a controversial figure, but we hadn’t heard before that he was a racist. We set out to fact-check whether he ""wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent."" 
Ché Guevara’s quotes about blacks 
Ernesto ""Ché"" Guevara was a Latin American guerrilla leader and Marxist revolutionary, and a major figure in the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro in the late 1950s. Although hailed in some circles as a legendary icon of rebellion, the Argentine-born doctor is also reviled by many Cubans for ruthlessly ordering the execution of more than 150 prisoners in Cuba without a fair trial. 
But was he a racist? Rubio spokesman Alex Conant sent us links to a few articles and book passages. 
The most compelling evidence was from The Motorcycle Diaries, a book based on diaries he kept while traveling through Latin America in the early 1950s. (The book was also made into a 2004 movie.) 
""The blacks, those magnificent examples of the African race who have maintained their racial purity thanks to their lack of an affinity with bathing, have seen their territory invaded by a new kind of slave: the Portuguese. And the two ancient races have now begun a hard life together, fraught with bickering and squabbles. Discrimination and poverty unite them in the daily fight for survival but their different ways of approaching life separate them completely: The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations."" 
Another comment came from Guevara’s writing about his time fighting with revolutionaries in the Congo and included this line: ""Given the prevailing lack of discipline, it would have been impossible to use Congolese machine-gunners to defend the base from air attack: they did not know how to handle their weapons and did not want to learn."" 
Finally, there’s this line after the revolution in 1959: ""We're going to do for blacks exactly what blacks did for the revolution. By which I mean: nothing."" 
Experts on Guevara’s words 
We interviewed two authors who wrote books about Guevara: Jon Lee Anderson, a staff writer for the New Yorker, who wrote Ché Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, and New York University professor Jorge Castañeda, author of Compañero: The Life and Death of Ché Guevara. We also interviewed multiple professors who are experts in Cuban or Latin American studies. 
There wasn’t a debate among the experts about Guevara’s quote calling blacks ""indolent."" But many said it had to be evaluated within the context of his life at the time. Several said that it was an exaggeration to suggest that Guevara wrote ""extensively"" about the superiority of whites. They pointed to other statements by Guevara that have either been misinterpreted or were clearly not racist. 
First, let’s start with the Motorcycle Diaries quote. 
Guevara wrote the passage in The Motorcycle Diaries about blacks being ""indolent"" after visiting workers’ slums in Caracas. His observations were ""stereotypical of white, especially Argentine, arrogance and condescension,"" Anderson wrote in his book. (Anderson called Rubio’s claim ""pure twaddle."") 
Castañeda said the diary entry reflected Argentinians ""who maybe have a tendency to see themselves very differently from the rest of Latin America. .. I think it is a stretch to call him a racist. ... There are so many other things to criticize Ché Guevara. That’s not one of them."" 
Mark Sawyer, a UCLA political science professor who called Rubio’s claim a ""gross exaggeration"", wrote that Guevara’s quote was from when he was 24 years old and ""reflects a Ché whose views evolved on the issue of race and who eventually saw black liberation as synonymous with ending oppression."" 
Sawyer dismissed Guevara’s remarks about fighters in the Congo lacking discipline as not racially motivated. Rather, the line is ""the same kinds of concerns he expressed about peasants wherever he went to help foment revolution,"" Sawyer wrote in a blog post. 
As for this quote -- ""We're going to do for blacks exactly what blacks did for the revolution. By which I mean: nothing"" -- some sources on the Internet claim it is from a 1959 speech or press conference, but we were unable to find an original source or context for the quote. 
Sawyer wrote in his blog that ""Ché is referring to the concept that he saw blacks as participating in the revolution not as blacks but as patriots. That is, the Revolution would be universal and color blind."" (Sawyer told PolitiFact that he was uncertain of the source of that Guevara quote.) 
Without an original source for context, we can’t independently verify this interpretation. 
Guevara’s comments on racial equality 
At least a couple of our experts pointed to a famous speech Guevara made at the University of Santa Clara in 1959 in which he called for greater representation in all parts of Cuban society. 
At workers rallies around that time, Guevara and Raul Castro talked about the need to ""advance the revolution’s anti-discrimination program,"" wrote Alejandro de la Fuente, a University of Pittsburgh history professor in his book A Nation for All: Race, Inequality and Politics in 20th Century Cuba. In the speech at Santa Clara, Guevara called for the university to ""paint itself with black, paint itself with mulatto"" students and teachers, Fuente wrote. 
In 1964, Guevara spoke before the United Nations and criticized ""racist"" intervention by the west in the Congo, Anderson wrote in his book. 
People who have studied Guevara said he was racially inclusive in his actions. 
""Blacks did do plenty for the revolution,"" said University of Texas Latin American history professor Jonathan Brown who has read declassified CIA reports on Guevara’s speeches in the early 1960s. 
Brown said Guevara had Afro Cuban troops who followed him into battle and stayed in his army after the victory. Guevara also had Afro Cuban bodyguards and other advisers, he said. 
Brown noted this even though he is not a fan of Guevara. ""His books and influences led a lot of young men to an early grave throughout Latin America,"" Brown told PolitiFact. 
Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska who teaches Latino politics, said that Guevara underwent a transformation from his early days in Argentina. 
""While there is evidence to support the claim that Ché made such statements, or harbored them in his mind as a young man, his role in the revolution was one where he openly espoused anti-racist, egalitarian ideals,"" Benjamin-Alvarado told PolitiFact in an email. 
Andy Gomez, a senior fellow University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies, said that being racist isn’t one of the top 10 descriptors he would use of Guevara. 
""There are other things he was better known for,"" he said. ""A strategist, a thinker, also very cold-blooded murder, which history has proven."" 
Jaime Suchlicki, the head of the University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American studies, said that it is ""absolutely true"" that Guevara was racist against blacks. Suchlicki noted several shortcomings of the Cuban revolution for blacks as outlined in a recent New York Times article. 
Our ruling 
Guevara has become an icon of rebellion, and he's also been reviled for ordering executions without trial. But did he write ""extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent,"" as Rubio said? 
Guevara’s words in The Motorcycle Diaries were highly critical of the blacks he came across in that Caracas neighborhood, and he placed them beneath Europeans. The experts we consulted said the remarks are real and would not have been unusual coming from a 24-year-old from Argentina at the time. 
Guevara’s quote about the Congo fighters lacking discipline could be interpreted as a criticism of their military readiness -- not a commentary on their race. We can’t fully evaluate the quote about blacks and the revolution without seeing it in full context. Experts said it was an exaggeration to suggest Guevara wrote ""extensively"" about racial superiority. 
Rubio’s comments gave the impression that Guevara wrote much more about the superiority of white Europeans over blacks than he did. And later in his life, Guevara made comments supporting racial equality. 
We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968AA440>],/factchecks/2013/apr/17/marco-rubio/did-che-guevara-write-extensively-about-superiorit/

David Dewhurst says Texas ‘school systems’ lose 45 days a year on testing
","
Talking about education reform on a Dallas-area talk show April 8, 2013, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst aired a number that PolitiFact Texas has studied before. 
Dewhurst said during the program, hosted by Mark Davis on KSKY-AM 660, that he wants to ""reduce this excessive number of days that our school systems lose every year, some 45 days on testing."" 
When Dewhurst spoke, the Texas Legislature was working on measures to reduce from 15 tests to five tests the number of end-of-course exams high school students must pass to graduate. The House passed such a proposal March 26, 2013; the Senate had yet to act. 
The 15 end-of-course tests were first administered in spring 2012. Students in elementary school and middle school also take tests under the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness program, which is gradually replacing the less rigorous Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills. 
Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine emailed us news and opinion articles from three Texas newspapers that gave the 45-day figure but did not explain its basis. We spoke to the authors of two items and a source from the third; nothing conclusive emerged. 
Last year, we examined a statement similar to Dewhurst’s when former state Sen. Ted Lyon said, ""Most schools spend 45 days out of the 180 days in a school year in some form of mandated testing."" 
In that Aug. 29, 2012, fact-check, we found that the state’s 2011-12 testing calendar showed 25 days plus flexible test periods for TAKS and STAAR, and we estimated that district-level ""benchmark"" tests might fall on another four to nine days. Not every school would take part in each test, though; elementaries, for example, would not be administering high-school exit tests. Overall, we concluded there was no evidence that most schools gave mandatory tests on 45 days, and rated Lyon’s statement False. 
Dewhurst referred to ""school systems,"" which we took to mean districts rather than individual schools. So we set out to check the current levels of state- and district-mandated testing. 
Our count of state-mandated exams on Texas’ 2012-13 and 2013-14 testing calendars, with assistance and explanations from Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe, suggests there are a minimum of 22 STAAR/TAKS test days and a maximum of 36 (if a district uses all the dates in the flexible ""windows,"" which are two-week spans during which districts schedule up to nine STAAR exams). 
At the district level, we had bits of evidence but no complete picture. In our 2012 fact-check, we learned that the Mesquite district, just east of Dallas, gave four ""benchmark"" tests in a year. Another 2012 fact-check had shown that the Austin school district gave (depending on grade level) four to nine benchmark tests. 
Do schools systems ""lose"" a day per test? STAAR exams take four hours, so one test wouldn’t occupy a whole school day, but two tests would take either a whole day or, of course, half of two days. 
Testing, however, can cause campus disruption outside of the exams themselves. Some campuses delay the start of school on test days, so the staff can focus on giving exams in the mornings. From readers, educators’ associations and others, we heard anecdotal reports of time spent on test preparation; regular classes moved, hushed or halted during tests; and teachers pulled from classes to help administer tests. 
So: What have we learned? Districts are required to conduct STAAR/TAKS testing on at least 22 days and at most 36 days. Adding in our guess of four to nine district-mandated test days brings that to a minimum of 26 days and a maximum of 46. If a district uses all 18 district-level test days permitted by state law, the maximum goes up to 54. 
Again, it’s important to note that no individual school is likely to conduct tests on all of those days, because only certain grades take certain tests. 
Similarly, individual students would not take every test. Ratcliffe helped us calculate that a student might face as few as two STAAR days -- a third-grader, who’s only tested in two subjects -- or, at the most, 15, in the unlikely event a 10th-grader failed five STAAR subjects last year, then fails five more this year and has to retake all 10. (About 70 percent of Texas high schoolers passed all five tests last year, Ratcliffe said.) 
On the other hand, STAAR and TAKS aren’t the only tests given, not by a long chalk. Exams that can be administered to cross-sections of the student body include the NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress), which is given to enable national comparisons of student performance in certain grades, and TELPAS (Texas English Language Proficiency Assessment System), given to chosen students to determine their knowledge of English.
  
Our ruling 
Dewhurst said that ""our school systems lose every year, some 45 days on testing."" 
The precise 45-day figure is widely cited without explanation or proof. Meantime, testing calendars and state law suggest that state-mandated plus district-required tests could -- might -- occupy parts of 22 to 54 days. School-level tests could affect more days, but Dewhurst (unlike Lyons) was speaking to districts, not individual schools. 
If a number is floated without direct factual backup, it’s hard for us to buy. Still, we see an element of truth to this statement: It’s inside the range of 22 to 54 days supported by test calendars and the law. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968BD080>],/factchecks/2013/apr/17/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-texas-school-systems-lose-45-d/

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took on a public relations role ahead of the release of a bill to overhaul immigration. Rubio appeared on seven Sunday talk shows -- a new record, by most accounts -- to promote the legislation and make a pre-emptive strike against conservative resistance. 
A possible flash point of that resistance: the notion that the bill would provide amnesty for the millions of immigrants living in the United States illegally. 
""This is not amnesty,"" Rubio said on Fox News Sunday on April 14, 2013. ""Amnesty is the forgiveness of something. Amnesty is anything that says do it illegally, it will be cheaper and easier."" 
We wondered if that’s true. Does the bill give amnesty or not? 
What’s in the bill 
Eight senators -- four Republicans, four Democrats -- unveiled the legislation April 17. It addresses lots of issues, including work visas and family reunification. But for this story we’re focused on illegal immigration. A detailed summary of the bill describes some of the hurdles that people here illegally would have to clear before becoming eligible to apply for permanent residency or eventually, citizenship. 
The bill would allow people to seek ""Registered Provisional Immigrant Status,"" by demonstrating residence in the United States prior to Dec. 31, 2011, having no felony convictions and not more than two misdemeanors and paying a $500 penalty plus back taxes. Another $500 would be required after six years. After 10 years under Registered Provisional Immigrant Status, a person could pay $1,000 and seek a green card using a new merit-based system. People brought here illegally as minors, known as ""Dreamers,"" and workers in an agricultural program would get green cards in five years, versus the 10 for everyone else who qualifies. 
New security measures would have to be under way before unauthorized immigrants could begin that process, however. The bill calls for $4.5 billion for a strategy that includes new surveillance equipment, fencing along the Mexican border and more customs agents. Employers would be required to check the legal status of employees through an electronic system known as E-Verify. 
What’s amnesty? 
One legal dictionary defines amnesty as ""a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out. ... The basis for amnesty is generally because the war or other conditions that made the acts criminal no longer exist or have faded in importance."" 
In modern American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program, both then and now. And its failure to stem the flow of illegal immigration is partly why ""amnesty"" is such a poisonous word today. 
For a comparison, consider this: the 1986 law granted legal status to any immigrant who had been in the country continuously since 1982, who paid a $185 fine and back taxes and who demonstrated ""good moral character."" After 18 months, if they learned to speak English, they could become eligible for a green card. 
So the new bill includes a criminal background check which the 1986 law did not, and it increases the time (to 10 years) and financial requirements (to $2,000) before immigrants could obtain a green card. 
Arguments pro and con 
We reached out to immigration experts on all sides for their take on Rubio’s statement. 
Frank Sharry, director of the pro-citizenship group America’s Voice, said he agrees with Rubio that the bill does not offer amnesty. 
""If you look at what the consequences are -- first of all you have to come forward and register, submit to a background check. You have to pay fines,"" he said. ""To me it’s kind of like people who are caught for speeding. If you get caught for speeding in many states, they say ‘okay, you have to pay a fine, take a class, lose your license for a while and you’ll be reinstated.’ No one calls that an amnesty."" 
Alex Nowrasteh, with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. 
""This bill includes numerous punishments for unauthorized immigrants who broke the laws, including paying fines and other legal sanctions,"" he said. ""If it was amnesty they would be legalized immediately with no punishment, no process. They would just be forgiven and handed a green card."" 
But Steven Camarota with Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration, argued that in practice most amnesties -- such as tax or parking ticket amnesties -- involve both a waiver and a penalty. Tax amnesties, for example, often allow delinquent taxpayers to pay back a defined amount, which may include reduced interest or penalties. So they may end up paying less than they would have under prosecution, but not nothing. 
In this case, Camarota said, ""Is the normal rule of law being suspended? The penalty for being in the U.S. illegally normally says you have to go back to your home country. This says you don’t."" 
""I don’t think the fact that it is an amnesty -- which I think it clearly is -- makes it a bad policy,"" he said. ""They’re just not calling it an amnesty because politically that makes it tougher."" 
Our ruling 
Rubio argues that the legislation outlining a 13-year pathway to legal status and eventually citizenship is not amnesty. 
He’s right that the bill does not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandates fines, background checks and waiting periods, and it’s tougher than its 1986 predecessor. But it also offers a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries.

"['Debt', 'Florida', 'Lenny Curry']","
RPOF chair Lenny Curry says Rick Scott cut state debt by $2 billion, Charlie Crist increased it by $5 billion
","
Gov. Rick Scott and his allies are eager to point out the ""stark contrast"" in Scott’s record with that of his predecessor and possible 2014 competitor, Charlie Crist. 
Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry compared the state debt under each governor in an April 15 interview with our Orlando TV partner, Central Florida News 13. Host Ybeth Bruzual asked Curry how Scott looks against Crist, who polls show would have a sizeable lead over Scott if he enters the governor’s race. 
""Look, they both have a record,"" Curry said. ""Rick Scott has a record right now of close to 300,000 jobs created on his watch. Rick Scott has paid down our debt in Florida by about $2 billion. Our unemployment rate is now in a three/four year low. Under Charlie Crist, we lost over 800,000 jobs. Unemployment went from about 3 percent to over 11 percent.  Charlie Crist's debt went up about $5 billion. The records couldn't be clearer."" 
Those are Scott’s recent talking points almost verbatim. PolitiFact Florida looked at state debt under both governors and examined what role governors have over it in a January fact-check. 
Like Scott, Curry makes a decent point about the debt’s rise and fall in recent years. But he’s not telling the whole story. Let’s review. 
Counting the debt 
There are different ways to count the debt, and there are different ways to assign responsibility for it. 
We determined the amount of debt Florida accumulated during the Crist years from the archives of the Division of Bond Finance, which publishes an annual report on the debt picture. We used the most recent Debt Affordability Report to show the total outstanding debt over recent fiscal years. 
2006: $23 billion 
2007: $24.1 billion 
2008: $24.3 billion 
2009: $26.4 billion 
2010: $28.2 billion 
2011: $27.7 billion 
2012: $26.2 billion    
Curry’s math works if you compare the fiscal year ending in 2006 with the one ending in 2010 (+$5.2 billion), and then 2010 with the 2012 fiscal year (-$2 billion). 
But some experts we consulted said the better way to compare debt between governors is by examining the budgets over which the governor actually had control to veto spending. 
Crist was elected in 2006 and took office in January 2007. That means the first budget he signed -- which included projects in need of bond financing -- covered the 2008 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2008. The last budget Crist signed was for the 2011 fiscal year, which ended six months into Scott’s tenure. 
So it’s more accurate to assess the growth of the debt under Crist from FY 2008 to FY 2011. This method produces an increase of $3.4 billion in debt, which is still large but not as big as the $5 billion Curry claimed. 
Now let’s look at Scott’s tenure. He took office in January 2011, so the first budget he signed covered the budget year running July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. Under this measure, Scott reduced the debt only $1.5 billion. 
Still, no one denies the total debt fell sharply with Scott, who is famously debt-averse. It’s short of his $2 billion talking point now, but it probably won’t be when we get an analysis of debt from the 2012-13 budget, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of tax research, in January. 
""He’s only had one year that’s been reflected, but certainly I think we’ll find that last year was a relatively low bonding year as well,"" Wenner said. 
What was going on? 
Even during the worst of Florida’s recession, Florida borrowed money for capital projects while maintaining its credit ratings with various agencies. 
""We’ve been very well managed financially even during the downturn,"" said Ben Watkins, executive director of the state’s Division of Bond Finance, in January. ""We’re very conservative."" 
The sharp decline in debt is due to the state’s discontinued borrowing for acquiring conservation land and the decline of the state’s largest borrowing program, called Public Education Capital Outlay, or PECO, for public school, college and university construction projects. The decades-old program is paid for by a tax on electric, gas and telecommunications services, a source that has shriveled over recent years as Floridians conserve energy and ditch landline phones. 
In 2012, there was no PECO borrowing because of a serious drop-off in collections from the tax. Higher ed advocates said the PECO shortfall signaled a ""crisis in infrastructure funding"" that would limit the state’s ability to educate college students. At the University of South Florida, for example, a new learning center has gone unfinished as it awaits more PECO money. 
In his first year, Scott vetoed $474 million in bonds, including dozens of improvement and  construction projects at state colleges and universities. Scott lowered debt issuance to $416 million, its lowest level since 1990 and significantly less than the $2 billion yearly average for the previous decade. 
Conversely, the rapid increase in debt after 2002 was driven mostly by the 2002 class-size amendment added to the Constitution by Florida voters that year. It required the Legislature to reduce class sizes by adding more classrooms. It cost the state $2.5 billion to build more class space, which included $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds, said David Jacobson, a spokesman for Moody’s Investors Service. That program is essentially over, he said, which contributes to the debt falling. 
As education commissioner, Crist said he supported the goal of reducing class size but was concerned with costs. 
Our ruling 
Curry is broadly correct: State debt increased under Crist and has decreased under Scott. 
But the numbers he uses are not accurate if you consider the budget years over which Crist could have exerted any control. Moreover, some bonds Florida issued were to pay for programs in the works before Crist took over, and the Legislature shares at least some of the blame for putting it in the budget. 
Finally, there was a spike in the debt after 2002 that was driven by a constitutional amendment to limit class sizes. Voters approved that measure, and the state government was required to put it into action. 
Consistent with our previous rating, we rate Curry’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4627C0>],/factchecks/2013/apr/17/lenny-curry/rpof-chair-lenny-curry-says-rick-scott-cut-state-d/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'MacIver Institute']","
MacIver Institute says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is more than halfway to goal of creating 250,000 private sector jobs
","
Gov. Scott Walker promised to create 250,000 private sector jobs by the end of his four-year term. With less than two years remaining, the governor’s opponents -- and supporters -- are paying increased attention to the count. 
That’s why an item posted April 9, 2013 by the MacIver Institute caught our attention. 
The Madison-based group, which publishes items supportive of conservative causes -- items that are often then cited by other conservatives -- included this headline: ""Gov. Scott Walker more than halfway to 250,000 jobs goal."" 
That’s a much larger number of jobs created under Walker than we’ve ever heard -- even from the governor himself. 
In December 2012, Walker said the state had created ""just under 100,000 jobs"" since he took office. We rated that statement Pants on Fire. 
Why? 
Walker had combined full and partial year data sets from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. His staff explained that he was using a ""raw number."" 
But state experts and the governor’s own staff have long said that while the quarterly census is more accurate than monthly measures, the census data should only be viewed in one-year blocks. That is, January to January, or July to July. In other words, you can’t combine partial years of census data with full years to create a running total, due to major seasonal fluctuations in the workforce. 
Here is what Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us when we asked about job numbers in the summer of 2012: ""Please don’t, as John Koskinen, an economist at DOR would say, compare February temperatures to July."" 
When we asked MacIver  to show us their math, spokesman Nick Novak responded: 
""We used Bureau of Labor Statistics QCEW figures for each month from January 2011 to September 2012 (the most recent month available).  To get to the number of 137,372, we simply subtracted the January 2011 jobs number from the September 2012 jobs number."" 
Novak provided a link to a BLS report that showed the two numbers. 
But, this isn’t just a simple math problem. MacIver made two critical errors in their calculations. 
Starting point 
Walker took office at the beginning of January 2011. MacIver used the number for the end of January 2011. To properly measure the governor’s promise, you need to start with the number of jobs that existed at the start of his term. That is a difference of 65,401 jobs.   
Here’s how it plays out the way the MacIver Institute calculated the numbers. 
January 2011 census number: 2,205,584 
September 2012 census number: 2,342,956 
Increase: 137,372. 
Here’s how it plays out with the December 2010 number. 
December 2010 census number: 2,270,985 
September 2012 census number: 2,342,956 
Increase: 71,971 
In summary: MacIver’s math nearly doubles Walker job count because it started counting one month later. In effect, they used a lower starting point, which makes the growth seem larger -- by 65,401 -- than it really is. 
And even that is a bad number. 
Apples to oranges 
There’s a second, more important -- and more familiar -- problem. Like Walker in December,  MacIver failed to line up a year-to-year comparison. It measured February temperatures against July. 
What’s more, the item itself notes that Koskinen, the state economist, told them they should not combine the data sets in this manner: 
While Koskinen called the numbers ""literally true"" the article goes on to note: ""Koskinen said economists typically use the same month from different years to avoid seasonal variations in employment."" 
Asked about this, Novak said: 
""In the article we account for the fact that this is not seasonally adjusted and that the chief economist from the Department of Revenue is wary of using data from different months when comparing data year over year."" 
But they didn’t apply any such disclaimer to their headline, or a very large graphic. 
The claim was retweeted by Madison-based conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna to her 7,114 followers and Milwaukee talker Charlie Sykes posted it on his Right Wisconsin subscription-based website. 
PolitiFact Wisconsin follows Walker’s jobs promise using the Walk-O-Meter, using a method created with guidance from both state and academic economists, including Koskinen. We combine full year census reports with less accurate monthly employment survey results, and show the results in a monthly graphic. Once full-year information becomes available, it is added in to get an ever-stronger number. 
As of February 2013, our latest estimate of the number of jobs created since Walker took office is 63,700. 
Our rating 
The MacIver Institute posted an item that says Wisconsin has 137,372 more private sector jobs than when Gov. Scott Walker first took office, meaning that Walker is more than halfway to his goal of 250,000 jobs. 
The jobs promise will be the No. 1 yardstick used to measure Walker’s performance as governor. 
But the conservative group’s number is wrong, two times over. 
MacIver started with the wrong month of data. That alone nearly doubled the number of jobs they claim were created under Walker. 
They compounded their error by combining full and partial years of data -- even though they (like the governor himself) were told not to do so.

"['Health Care', 'Public Health', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Nelson Wolff']","
Bexar County judge says uncompensated care provided by Texas hospitals drives up private insurance rates by $1,800
","
Bexar County’s top elected official gave a pocketbook reason for Texas to expand Medicaid as encouraged by the federal health care law known as Obamacare. 
Nelson Wolff, the county’s judge, prefaced his April 1, 2013, remarks by saying he had just received a root canal. ""Getting Medicaid expansion in Texas is more painful,"" Wolff said during a Capitol press conference with Democratic lawmakers and other advocates. Earlier that day, Gov. Rick Perry and other Republican leaders had reiterated their opposition to expanding Medicaid, which they termed a costly, broken program. 
Wolff, saying he was speaking for the state’s major public hospital districts, said that if Medicaid is expanded, ""it would cut down"" on emergency room visits, ""on unnecessary patients going there and help people that really, really do need it."" 
Wolff then said it’s estimated that some $1,800 is added to ""your private insurance rates"" due to uncompensated care given by ""hospitals throughout Texas,"" a figure we spotted in Patricia Kilday Hart’s April 2, 2013, Houston Chronicle column on the press conference. 
Is that so? 
Concern about such cost shifting is even written into the federal health care law, as noted by Hoover Institution fellow and Stanford University professor John F. Cogan and others in a 2011 paper. The 2010 law says ""the cost of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured was $43 billion in 2008. To pay for this cost, health care providers pass on the cost to private insurers, which pass on the cost to families. This cost-shifting increases family premiums by on average over $1,000 a year."" 
By email, Bexar County spokeswoman Laura Jesse told us the judge drew the $1,800 figure from a March 24, 2009, report from the Washington-based Center for American Progress, which says it was founded to ""provide long-term leadership and support to the progressive movement."" The report says that nationally in 2009, this cost-shift amounted to $1,100 per average family premium and $410 per average individual premium, with the Texas cost-shift being $1,800 per average family premium and $630 per average individual premium, according to a chart. 
Case closed? 
Not so fast, because research conflicts over the extent of cost-shifting. Also, there is uncertainty the amounts can be estimated state to state. 
Vicki Anderson of Austin, who helped write a January 2013 report commissioned by Texas Impact and Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, Inc. on projected local tax effects of expanding Medicaid, told us by email that pinning down the impact of uncompensated care on private insurance rates is challenging in part because such calculations inevitably start from varying amounts of spending attributed to uncompensated care, causing the estimated effect on private insurance premiums to vary as well. 
Nationally, PolitiFact colleagues have noted that the study cited by Wolff, which updated figures developed in a 2005 analysis commissioned by the liberal-leaning Families USA, has been contradicted by more recent analyses estimating such cost-shifting to be far less costly. 
Let’s look at the approach that delivered the figure aired by Wolff and then at the contradictory reports. 
For each state, the Center for American Progress said it assumed the same percentage increases in premiums due to such cost-shifting in 2009 that the Families USA report earlier estimated for 2005. The center then applied the percentages to the latest state-by-state premium data as reported by a federal panel, according to its report, also growing each resulting figure by the change in national private health expenditures as reported and tracked by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2006 to 2009. 
We didn’t find a copy of the 2005 report, but Families USA issued a 2009 report, ""Hidden Health Tax: Americans Pay a Premium,"" describing follow-up research it commissioned from Milliman, Inc., an actuarial consulting firm, that drew on federal data on medical spending to conclude that in 2008, uncompensated care costs drove up average private family insurance rates nationally by $1,017. The report says the methodology was similar, though not identical, to the one used for its 2005 study. 
The report did not present state-by-state figures. By phone, Families USA analyst Kathleen Stoll told us: ""I didn’t feel we could pin it down state by state."" 
A report appendix says the research assumed that the cost of all uncompensated care is shifted to the insured. But Stoll, elaborating, told us researchers reached the ""cost"" figure in its report in a couple steps. First, she said, the group estimated total charges to the uninsured not covered by the patients themselves or sources like charity care or federal aid sent to hospitals for that purpose. The resulting figure was then discounted by 49 percent to reflect the share of total charges that a hospital or other provider would need to shift to insured patients to ""operate at the same margins as they do when they set charges for services that are covered by insurance reimbursement,"" Stoll emailed. 
Studies that have led to considerably lower estimates of the impact of cost-sharing on private insurance rates do not assume the same level of pass-through costs. 
In an August 2008 Health Affairs article, noted in a February 2013 PolitiFact Ohio fact check, George Mason University professor Jack Hadley and others said that ""cost shifting as a result of uncompensated care probably has only a very small impact on private insurance premiums."" Specifically, the authors said, the amount potentially associated with cost shifting represents at most 1.7 percent of private health insurance costs. The analysis had no state-by-state cost-shift estimates. 
By telephone, Hadley told us the research drew on hospital spending on uncompensated care over 20 years and looks at how much privately insured patients were charged for care. He said private insurance costs were more likely to be affected by Medicare rates or the relative concentration of hospitals in communities than ups and downs in expenditures on uncompensated care. 
Summing up, Hadley said, it does not follow that family private insurance policies in Texas cost $1,800 more due to cost shifting, though he sees a public-relations appeal to such statements. The actual effect of cost-shifting might be $150 to $200 per private family policy, he said. In contrast, he said, most uncompensated care is paid for by government, meaning tax revenue. 
Informed of Hadley’s analysis, California consultant Peter Harbage, an author of the center report cited by Wolff, said by email that Hadley’s analysis counted certain expenditures, such as government aid for graduate medical education, as helping to cover the costs of the uninsured. Those assumptions are wrong, Harbage said, or at least not entirely correct. 
We were getting the picture: Different researchers started from conflicting assumptions, which are open to dispute. 
Earlier, in September 2009, PolitiFact identified major disagreement on the significance of cost-shifting and rated as Half True a claim by President Barack Obama that families were paying $900, on average, ""in higher premiums because of uncompensated care."" 
Obama’s claim echoed the Families USA studies. But in 2008, the respected Kaiser Family Foundation released a report questioning the methodology of the initial Families USA study and hypothesizing that cost-shifting is not that significant. 
Let's step back and explain what the experts are counting. They use federal data on medical expenditures to calculate the total amount spent on care for the uninsured. Then they subtract whatever the uninsured themselves paid for care, then what government and charities paid. The remainder of the cost is what people with insurance are paying for through higher premiums, according to Families USA. 
The Kaiser study documented fluctuations in private premiums over many years, and concluded that the data don't seem to correlate with costs for the uninsured. Rather, cost-shifting is ""more strongly related to fluctuations in payments by Medicare and Medicaid,"" Kaiser said. 
The Kaiser study also did not set a per-policy cost-shift figure the way the Families USA study did. Kaiser said instead that cost-shifting might account for 1.7 percent of all private premiums. 
So, who is right? PolitiFact in Washington reviewed the Families USA and Kaiser studies and did not see obvious problems or conflicts. Barring fresh evidence, the differences seemed to reflect genuine disagreement among experts about methodological approaches to a complex issue. 
By phone, Harbage told us the Kaiser researchers approached the cost-shifting analysis with two major differences from how Families USA tackled the topic.  Kaiser, he said, assumed more government spending on the uninsured, reducing the costs that could be shifted to private insurance rates, and also did not assume that every health care provider invariably maximizes profits, which Families USA did. 
""Smart people can come to different conclusions,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
Wolff said uncompensated health care costs absorbed by Texas hospitals are adding $1,800 a year to private insurance rates. 
His figure strikes us as worthy of skepticism partly because research on this topic seems to be driven by up-front assumptions--some of them fiercely debated. As troubling, the figure reflects 2009 estimates reached using a previous estimate of how much of such costs were passed through in 2005, nearly a decade ago. 
We found no post-2009 state-by-state estimates of the cost impact, while other analyses have found that although cost-shifting occurs, private insurance rates are not greatly affected.

Group takes on senator about corporate taxes
","
Mid-April, despite the warmer weather, is a dreaded time for many Georgians. 
It’s the worst of allergy season. Pollen, go away! It’s also time to settle up with Uncle Sam. 
Monday was the deadline to file income taxes. Against that backdrop, PolitiFact Georgia thought it’d be worthwhile to examine an often-repeated claim about corporate taxes that again made the rounds as April 15 approached. 
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was recently on the HBO late-night program ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" The senator and Wall Street Journal editorial board member Stephen Moore were debating whether the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. 
Moore: ""We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, senator."" 
Sanders: ""No we do not."" 
Moore: ""Yes we do. Thirty-five percent. The Tax Foundation says the United States of America has the highest corporate tax rate."" 
Sanders: ""And who funds the National (sic) Tax Foundation?"" 
Maher: ""Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!"" 
The Tax Foundation defended its research in a news release and an open letter to Sanders a few days later. ""Yes, Sen. Sanders,"" the headline read, ""We Really Do Have the Highest Corporate Tax Rate in the World."" 
The foundation posted nearly the same message on Twitter. 
The foundation said that as of April 2012 the United States had the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. The U.S. rate is 35 percent, but many say it’s even higher (39 percent) once you include other factors. Japan previously laid claim to that title, the foundation and other news organizations said, but it lowered its rate last year by a few percentage points. The decrease varies, depending on the news source, but all now put Japan below the U.S.A. 
Here’s the foundation’s 2012 list of the top three nations with the highest corporate tax rates, excluding Japan: 
United States     39.1 
France               34.4 
Belgium             34.0 
The foundation’s numbers include a weighed average of state corporate taxes. The Washington, D.C.-based, nonpartisan foundation celebrated its 75th anniversary last year. 
  
America’s high corporate tax rate was an issue during the 2012 presidential race. President Barack Obama proposed lowering the federal rate to 25 percent for manufacturers and to 28 percent for all other corporations. Republican nominee Mitt Romney wanted to lower the rate to 25 percent for all corporations. 
A major complaint about America’s tax system is it is too complicated. Examining corporate tax rates is complex. For example, Sanders said the U.S. may have the highest nominal tax rate, but it is not the highest effective tax rate. The effective tax rate takes into consideration deductions and exemptions. The foundation also discussed the effective tax rate in its letter to the senator. 
""Even when including all deductions and credits available to companies to lower their tax liabilities, the ‘effective’ tax rate of U.S. corporations is still among the very highest in the world. The most recent studies show a U.S. effective corporate tax rate of roughly 27 percent, compared to an average of 20 percent for other developed countries,"" the foundation wrote. 
A few larger corporations pay no net federal income tax at all, some research shows. 
PolitiFact Texas recently tackled the question when a Texas congressman said the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate in the world in a voter’s guide. The congressman, Michael McCaul, used information from the Tax Foundation to support his claim. PolitiFact Texas, citing the various reports about effective tax rates, gave the claim a Mostly True. 
We asked Tax Foundation spokesman Richard Morrison whether there was any additional information or context that might be useful for our research. Morrison said the information McCaul used appeared to be up to date. 

To sum up, the Tax Foundation said the United States has the highest corporate taxes in the world. The organization did mention the debate about where the U.S. stands if you consider effective rates. Some say that context lowers America’s standing from Numero Uno, but not by much. We rate this claim Mostly True.

GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions says gun prosecutions have declined under Barack Obama
","
As Congress debates whether to enact new restrictions on firearms, one argument often voiced by opponents is that the federal government should enforce existing gun laws rather than passing new ones, such as a bill now pending that would expand background checks to virtually all gun sales, including gun shows and online sales. 
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., made this argument on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on April 14, 2013. 
Guest host Jonathan Karl asked, ""But very quickly, are you going to be able to defeat the background checks?"" 
Sessions replied, ""I don't think it's going to pass. The president of the United States has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. I was a federal prosecutor. I prosecuted those. He needs to prosecute the laws that we have today. They've declined every year since President Bush left office."" 
We wondered whether that was accurate, so we looked at the data. 
First, we’ll note that we are focusing on the prosecutions arising from background checks, rather than the number of prosecutions of other types of gun crimes, because Sessions’ statement was made in response to a question about background checks. We’ll also ignore prosecutions by state officials, since Sessions’ statement referred to the presidential role, which oversees federal, not state, prosecutorial actions. (Under President Barack Obama, background check denial information has been made available to state and local law enforcement through the National Crime Information Center, the Justice Department said in a statement to PolitiFact.) 
Now, here’s some background on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The system, which began operating in 1998, is an automated system that enables a gun seller to instantly check a series of government databases to determine whether a potential purchaser is eligible to buy a gun under federal or state law. 
In recent years, the Justice Department has published annual reports on how many times this system has flagged an ineligible purchaser and whether they were prosecuted. Looking back at these individual reports makes it possible to chart the number of prosecutions over time. Here’s a summary: 
2005: 135 prosecutions 
2006: 112 prosecutions 
2007: 122 prosecutions 
2008: 105 prosecutions 
2009: 77 prosecutions 
2010: 44 prosecutions 
So it’s correct for Sessions to say that prosecutions have ""declined every year"" since President George W. Bush left office. Still, it’s worth pointing out two caveats. 
First, data has not yet been published for the final two years of Obama’s first term. (If history is any guide, the data for 2011 should be published in August 2013.) So the number of prosecutions might have gone up in 2011 and 2012, but we don’t know yet. 
Second, it’s worth noting that even though the raw numbers of prosecutions have declined in recent years, prosecutions consistently represented a tiny proportion of all flagged purchasers under both presidents. Here are the year-by-year totals: 
2005: prosecutions accounted for 0.20 percent of background check denials 
2006: prosecutions accounted for 0.15 percent of background check denials 
2007: prosecutions accounted for 0.16 percent of background check denials 
2008: prosecutions accounted for 0.13 percent of background check denials 
2009: prosecutions accounted for 0.11 percent of background check denials 
2010: prosecutions accounted for 0.06 percent of background check denials 
So the rates have been lower under Obama, but they were already exceedingly low under Bush -- always at or lower than two-tenths of a percent of all denials. 
When Sessions compared the numbers under Obama and Bush, he was effectively blaming Obama for forgoing prosecutions of these types of crimes. He’s right -- but only up to a point. 
The president, as the official in charge of the executive branch, does have the authority to order changes in prosecutorial priorities, and in a broad sense, most administrations do shift prosecutorial goals at the Justice Department based on their own assessment of what issues need heightened attention and enforcement. 
However, while the president can set the tone, any changes need to happen under the direction of the attorney general, and then filter down to the front-line Justice Department attorneys on the case. 
""The president and his staff can create the momentum and certainly set the agenda for the attorney general to follow,"" said Joshua Berman, currently a partner at the law firm Katten Muchin and a former federal prosecutor in the southern district of New York and in Washington. ""It would not be unheard of or improper for the president or the president’s staff to push the department or the attorney general to increase investigations and prosecutions of a particular kind of crime such as cybercrime or gun crimes. ... That being said, there is no way the president is micromanaging that effort."" 
Our ruling 
Sessions said that Obama ""has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. .. They've declined every year since President Bush left office."" That’s true -- but the data covers only the first two years of Obama’s term, and it didn’t nosedive under Obama since it was already a tiny percentage under Bush. Obama could order tougher prosecution of gun-denial cases, but like his predecessors, he or his appointees have determined that other crimes are more urgent and take precedence. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809724AD00>],/factchecks/2013/apr/16/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-says-gun-prosecutions-have-declined-/
