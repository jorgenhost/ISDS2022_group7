High court hopeful Lehrmann: Race will be Dems' 'top target'
","Angling to win Tuesday's runoff to be the Republican nominee for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court, Debra Lehrmann said in a recent mailer that the GOP must nominate a strong candidate in the general election because “this race will be the Democrats’ top target in November.”In a year with numerous statewide offices, including governor, up for grabs, we wondered whether a seat on the state’s highest civil court is really going to top Texas Democrats' priorities.First, a little background: Lehrmann, who has been a judge in Tarrant County for more than 20 years, and Rick Green, a lawyer and former Texas House member from Dripping Springs, were the top vote-getters among six candidates for the court’s Place 3 seat in the March 2 GOP primary. The runoff is happening because neither received more than half the vote.In response to our inquiry, Lehrmann’s campaign spokesman, Craig Murphy, quickly added a big ""if"" to the prediction in Lehrmann's mailer. Murphy said Democrats would zero in on the court race if Green wins the GOP runoff, because that would boost Democratic nominee Jim Sharp's chances of winning the seat.Green “would definitely be their No. 1 target if he managed to get the nomination,” Murphy said. Murphy said he's not the only one who thinks so, pointing us to political commentary from three publications: Texas Monthly, the Austin Chronicle and a pro-Democratic blog, the Burnt Orange Report.Two days after the party primaries, Texas Monthly's Paul Burka, a longtime observer of politics, wrote on his blog that “unexpected developments” could test his oft-repeated assertion that Democrats, aside from gubernatorial hopeful Bill White, do not have a chance of winning a statewide race this year. (Democrats haven’t won a statewide office since 1994.)Burka said two contests could prove him wrong. He called Railroad Commission nominee Jeff Weems the Democrats’ “best shot” and mentioned the Place 3 Supreme Court race as “another possibility,” adding that if Green wins the GOP runoff, Sharp, a Houston appellate judge, “might get a lot of backing from the state’s legal community.”On April 2, the Austin Chronicle's endorsement of Lehrmann in the runoff noted that ""serious Republicans and their political organizations"" might worry that a Green nomination makes ""a November Democratic victory much more likely."" Earlier, in a post-primary post, the Burnt Orange Report said that if Green wins the runoff, ""we've got to make sure folks pay close attention to this race now through November.""Why do Murphy and others consider Green a weak candidate?Murphy said one reason is that Green has been beaten by a Democrat before: In 2002, he lost his Texas House seat to Democratic challenger Patrick Rose. Other critics of Green's candidacy have focused on his lack of judicial experience and several episodes from his past, including the taping of an infomercial in the Capitol and his admitted swing at Rose outside a Hays County polling place in 2006.After the 2001 legislative session, Texas Monthly named Green one of the 10 worst legislators for what the magazine termed ""ethical pratfalls.""In a YouTube video titled ""Are the accusations true?"" and posted April 4, Green says the ethics issues have been dredged up to sink his candidacy, although he acknowledges hitting Rose and has apologized.We asked Sharp, who did not have a primary opponent, if his judicial race will be his party's top target, whether or not Green is his opponent. “I can tell you uncategorically that it is not,"" Sharp said.Sharp said the Texas Democratic Party “will not be persuaded by anything to do anything but what their agenda is, and the agenda is legislative seats” and the governorship -- an agenda that he said has not changed since at least 2004.Kirsten Gray, a spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, echoed that assessment. “The Texas Supreme Court races are certainly very important to Texas Democrats,” she said. “However, these races are not more important than the governor’s office, taking a majority of seats in the (Texas) House and winning other statewide offices.”Ed Sills, communications director for the Texas AFL-CIO, said that ""any Democrat would probably say the top target in November is the governor's office.""One sign of a party's priorities is how much money a candidate attracts. Sharp did not tell us precisely how much money he has raised this year, saying only that the amount is ""still in the four-figure range."" Meanwhile, Bill White, the Democratic Party's gubernatorial nominee, reported more than $2.2 million in political contributions gathered from Jan. 22 to Feb. 20.Still, the fact that the Democrats are fielding candidates for all three Supreme Court races this year represents an uptick of sorts. In 2006, the last time gubernatorial and Supreme Court candidates were on the same ballot, the Democrats put up only one contender in the five high court races: Bill Moody, a state district judge in El Paso who lost to incumbent Republican Don Willett.In the last 30-day reporting period before the general election that year, Moody spent $23,434 while Chris Bell, the Democratic nominee for governor, reported spending $2.9 million.Where does all this leave Lehrmann's statement?We didn't find anyone who agreed with Lehrmann that the Supreme Court seat would be the Democrats' top fall target -- or any other indicators, such as surging campaign donations. Besides, her campaign's explanation for the statement includes a caveat -- a Green runoff victory -- that was not spelled out in her mailer.We rate her speculative statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/11/debra-lehrmann/high-court-hopeful-lehrmann-race-will-be-dems-top-/

Karen Sage says jail time has been cut 50 percent for offenders in program focused on mental health
","Karen Sage of Austin, facing a Tuesday runoff with Mindy Montford of Austin for the Democratic nod for a judgeship, touts her experience as a prosecutor overseeing a new unit focused on defendants with mental illness. With no Republican opponent in November, the winner of the runoff will likely be a shoo-in for Travis County’s 299th state District Court judgeship. In a mailer sent to voters April 3, Sage celebrates the new program, saying that jail “time for non-violent, mentally ill offenders has been reduced by 50 percent.”We wondered if Sage’s statement—echoed in a TV ad she debuted Wednesday—reflects reality. Sage’s campaign initially referred us to Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney. Lehmberg confirmed that she asked Sage, an assistant district attorney, to helm the felony mental health unit, which was started in January 2009. Claire Dawson-Brown, the DA’s director of strategic prosecutions, said a magistrate started handling a special docket comprised of “mental health” defendants in late April 2009. To be in the program, Dawson-Brown said, defendants must usually be charged with a non-violent crime. They also must be diagnosed with major depression or considered bipolar, schizo-affective or schizophrenic, and seen as unstable in the jail. “It would be someone in a crisis situation,” she said, “or their mental illness is impairing their behavior.” Experts team to address the needs of the mental health inmates, Dawson-Brown said. She said participants get services they need in custody and when they return to the community. Besides Sage, who has a paralegal and a secretary, each defendant has an attorney familiar with mental health issues; she said the magistrate, a jail counselor and officials serving the local mental health and adult probation systems also play roles, with social workers sometimes getting involved. And how has the program affected jail stays? Sage said she reached her 50-percent reduction statement by comparing a baseline estimate that “mental health” inmates facing felony charges were averaging 106 days in jail before the program began to the 42-day average for participants in the program at the time she left the office in mid-December to run for judge. The decrease amounts to 60 percent. Dawson-Brown agreed that as of late 2008 and early 2009, the average Travis County jail stay for all its “mental health” defendants, including violent offenders, was 106 days. We pointed out that the baseline figure sweeps in the longer jail stays of individuals charged with violent crimes who aren’t automatically put in the new program, driving up the pre-program average and potentially skewing before and after comparisons. Dawson-Brown then gave us more detailed jail-stay information enabling an improved review of the change in average jail stays. Based on the new figures, we estimate that defendants who have been through the new program would have averaged 77 days in jail before the program began. The nitty gritty: We multiplied the number of affected defendants categorized by the level of felony they faced--ranging from first-degree felony charges to second- and third-degree felonies to state-jail felony charges--by the days that similarly charged defendants averaged in jail before the program began. Next, we totaled those defendant-days-in-jail and divided the total (19,432) by the number of defendants (253) to reach the pre-program estimate of an average of 77 days in jail. Through February, the magistrate had processed 253 defendants since the program’s start, according to Dawson-Brown, and they averaged 36 days in jail. Best we can tell, the average jail stay for defendants dropped by 41 days, or 53 percent.

Workman says Turner didn't vote in five consecutive GOP primaries
","
Republicans Paul Workman and Holly Turner haven't shied from negative campaigning as they vie to get their party's nod to represent a Texas House district covering southwestern Travis County. The winner of Tuesday's runoff will face Democratic Rep. Valinda Bolton in November. 
Workman has hammered Turner for being new to Austin and, of late, to partisan politics. In a TV ad that debuted April 3, the narrator says: ""Turner's record? She ... failed to vote in five straight Republican primaries."" 
Workman's blast could cause runoff voters to think twice about supporting someone who hasn't been up to her elbows in the GOP; many view voting in primaries as essential to being a partisan activist. That said, it's a small club: According to the Texas Secretary of State, only 17 percent of 13 million registered voters cast primary ballots in the governor's race in March. 
Has Turner has been missing in action in GOP primaries? 
Offering back-up for Workman's claim, Eric Bearse, a Workman consultant, said the campaign checked Turner's voting history since 1996, when she turned 18, in Travis, Tarrant, Guadalupe, Bexar, Comal and McLennan counties. Bearse said the campaign also searched for voting records attached to Turner's maiden name, White, and her name from her first marriage. 
Turner spokesman Craig Murphy countered that Turner voted in Travis County's March primary and the 2008 GOP primary in Tarrant County. He confirmed that she did not vote in the GOP's 2006 primary. 
Seeking independent verification of Turner's voting history, we called election officials in five counties where Murphy said she's lived — Travis, Tarrant, Bexar, Comal, and Guadalupe counties — plus McLennan County, where Turner attended Baylor University in Waco from 1995 through 1999. 
Murphy initially said Turner voted in three consecutive GOP primaries from 2000 to 2004, in Comal County. He said he didn't know if she voted in 1998, when she was registered in Guadalupe County. He said that since she was born in May 1978, she wasn't eligible to vote in the 1996 primary. 
Murphy also said Comal County destroys its voter records two years after someone cancels their registration there, so Workman would have no record of her voting history on which to base his claim. 
What we found: Monica Goodall, a supervisor for the Comal County tax assessor, said the office only destroys paper voting records; its electronic records remain intact. Through the electronic database, Goodall said, ""we can see that she is currently registered in Travis County, but it would also show us if she was ever registered somewhere else."" 
At our request, the office staff checked its records several times using Turner's different names. They didn't find any record that she'd registered or voted in Comal County. 
Jeff Smith of Austin, a Democratic political consultant whose clients have included Bolton, keeps records of Texas voter histories and came up with a slightly different result. He said Turner was registered in Comal County in March 2003, but was no longer registered as of November of that year. He said he found no record of Turner voting in a Comal County primary. 
What about Guadalupe County? 
Sylvia Marmolejo, a deputy clerk at that county's elections office, said Turner was twice registered there, in 1996-2001 and 2002-2006, but their records don't show she voted in any primaries. 
According to election officials in Bexar and McLennan counties, Turner didn't vote there, either. 
So, interviews indicate that Turner voted in the GOP primaries of 2008 and 2010, but didn't vote in the primaries of 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006 — five in a row. 
As we finalized this article, Murphy backed off some of his earlier claims about Turner's voting record. Murphy said Turner thought that when she lived in New Braunfels — which crosses county lines — she was a resident of Comal County when, in fact, she was living in Guadalupe County. ""I apologize for the rabbit chase on this,"" he said 
Murphy said: ""Holly Turner did not vote in the five primaries"" claimed by Workman.

Fiction touted as fact in anti-Obama e-mail
","This chain e-mail caught our attention after readers debated its validity on the PolitiFact Facebook page. It purports to be Obama's comments about veterans who opposed a proposal to change their health insurance.""Look, it's an all volunteer force,"" Obama complained. ""Nobody made these guys go to war. They had to have known and accepted the risks. Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice? It doesn't compute."" ""I thought these were people who were proud to sacrifice for their country,"" Obama continued. ""I wasn't asking for blood, just money. With the country facing the worst financial crisis in its history, I'd have thought that the patriotic thing to do would be to try to help reduce the nation's deficit. I guess I underestimated the selfishness of some of my fellow Americans."" The problem is Obama never said these words. They actually come from the humorist John Semmens, who writes satire on the news.Semmens wrote his report in March 2009 after the White House abandoned a plan to bill veterans' private insurers for their war-related injuries. It was intended as a cost-savings measure, to save the Veterans Administration $530 million a year. Veterans groups opposed the plan, and the White House scuttled the idea. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a press release on the matter on March 18, 2009:""The President demonstrated his deep commitment to veterans by proposing the largest increase in the VA budget in 30 years and calling VSO (Veterans Service Organizations) and MSO (Military Service Organizations) leaders into the White House for an unprecedented meeting to discuss various aspects of the budget proposal,"" Gibbs said. ""In considering the third party billing issue, the administration was seeking to maximize the resources available for veterans; however, the President listened to concerns raised by the VSOs that this might, under certain circumstances, affect veterans and their families' ability to access health care. Therefore, the President has instructed that its consideration be dropped. The President wants to continue a constructive partnership with the VSOs and MSOs and is grateful to those VSOs and MSOs who have worked in good faith with him on the budget proposal.""This chain e-mail is still going around even though our friends at the other fact-checking organizations -- Factcheck.org and Snopes-- have both already debunked it. It also contrasts sharply with Obama's actual attitude toward the troops. Look at this excerpt from recent remarks he made to troops in Afghanistan on March 28, 2010.""You are part of the finest military in the history of the world, and we are proud of you. And so I want you to know that everybody back home is proud of you. Everybody back home is grateful. And everybody understands the sacrifices that you have made and your families have made to keep America safe and to keep America secure in this vital mission,"" Obama said.""You've been there for us, tour after tour, year after year, at a time when too many American institutions have let us down, when too many institutions have put short-term gain in front of a commitment to duty and a commitment to what's right,"" he added. ""You've met your responsibilities, you've done your duty -- not just when it's easy. That's why you've inspired your fellow Americans. That's why you inspire me. That's why you've earned your place next to the very greatest of American generations. And all of you represent the virtues and the values that America so desperately needs right now: sacrifice and selflessness, honor and decency. That's why you're here today. That's what you represent.""The chain e-mail that purports to be Obama's comments on troops is maliciously false.

Frederica Wilson says she banned dirty dancing
","State Sen. Frederica Wilson, a Miami Gardens Democrat running for the congressional seat now held by Kendrick Meek, is making an unusual boast about her accomplishments as a school board member: She says she introduced a ban on ""dirty dancing.""Here is what she says on her campaign Web site: ""As a member of the Miami-Dade County School Board, Senator Wilson introduced reading labs and an African-American history curriculum into our schools, as well as a dirty-dancing ban in our community.""She reiterated that claim in a March 9, 2009 press release announcing her campaign and on her Facebook page -- so there's no doubt she's against kids engaging in nasty booty moves. Pelvic thrusts aren't usually mentioned in congressional campaigns, so we jumped at the chance to explore whether she truly had introduced a ban. First, some background on dirty dancing. To many, the phrase conjurs up memories of the 1987 movie starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Remember the story? Grey plays a good girl nicknamed ""Baby"" who is on a family vacation at a Catskills resort. She stumbles upon a room where the working-class crew -- including Johnny, a beer-swigging-shirt-unbuttoned dance instructor played by Swayze -- are grinding their scantily clad bodies wrapped around each other in Do You Love Me. Johnny teaches Baby to dance -- among other, ahem, lessons -- and they fall in love. She learns some choreographed dance moves that are more of the gaze-into-each-other's-eyes variety than the make-your-grandma-blush type. In one famous scene, he lifts her by her hips as she is dripping wet in a lake. A decade later, the Miami-Dade school board took up the topic. There was no mention of the movie in the articles we found about the mid 1990s discussions, but there was plenty of harrumphing about kids dancing in sexually suggestive ways.""I've seen it in little tiny elementary school children. I couldn't take it, "" Wilson said in a Nov. 19, 1995, Miami Herald article which stated that she asked school administrators to hold a meeting on the topic. ""I don't think it sets a good standard for our district. We cannot allow (the dancing kids) to degrade the school district or themselves."" In a 1997 op-ed, school board member Wilson said she was considering introducing a ban.""It has been called 'dirty dancing,' but it's really nothing more than simulated sexual intercourse. Outrageously, too many folks involved with Dade County's public schools -- including teachers, administrators, and parents who ought to know better -- call it 'cheerleading,' 'marching,' or other types of school-sponsored student performance. Whatever it's called, it's vulgar and degrading. It has no place in our schools, on our playgrounds, or in our students' lives. So, imagine my disgust and dismay when I marched in Dade's Martin Luther King Day Parade earlier this year and saw Dade high school cheerleaders bumping and grinding their way down Martin Luther King Boulevard."" In a July 1997 news article, she was quoted saying, ""I've seen horrendous behavior. I saw a band member bend over and a female majorette come from behind and simulate actual intercourse. I almost passed out, but people in the stands were applauding.""Rather than calling it a ""dirty dancing ban,"" it was known as ""Guideline 25B: Student dance performances and/or productions: Procedures for promoting and maintaining a safe learning environment.""The board's explanation of the rule said that cheerleading, dance and band performances at events, performances or educational settings ""are essential to the establishment and maintenance of an atmosphere that fosters cultural and artistic exchanges. However the board recognizes that certain modes of dance are inappropriate, unsuited for immature audiences and may offend the community's sense of propriety rather than foster appropriate conduct that is consistent with school board rules and state statutes."" School board documents said the rule prohibited performances that depicted ""actual or simulated sexual intercourse (normal or deviate), masturbation, excretory functions and actual lewd exhibition of genitalia."" It's clear from news coverage and school board minutes that Wilson was the driving force behind the ban. School board minutes for the July 9, 1997, meeting state that Wilson proposed the rulemaking. The motion passed unanimously. On Aug. 27, 1997, the school board voted again in favor of the proposal. But there's still a bit of exaggeration in her statement: Wilson described this as a ban ""in our community"" when it strictly related to school-related groups or performances. She told us that was a reasonable description because ""the dirty dancing ban was on school bands and majorettes in the community. We have a lot of parades -- the MLK parade, different half time shows at football games in the community. I witnessed it -- a lot of forward-thrusting of the pelvic bone."" Clearly Wilson introduced the dirty dancing ban approved by the school board in 1997 and we don't doubt that school activities now have less forward-thrusting of the pelvic bone. But her claim that the ban would apply ""in our community"" is a little misleading. Some people might think her ban applied to the entire county, not just the schools. So we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/09/frederica-wilson/wilson-banned-dirty-dancing/

Turner says Workman gave thousands to politicians and got millions in government contracts
","
Paul Workman and Holly Turner are jockeying for votes before their April 13 runoff to be the Republican nominee for the Texas House District 47 seat in southwestern Travis County, which includes part of Austin. 
Turner took the fight to TV March 31, debuting a hard-hitting ad that accuses Workman of donating to politicians and getting construction contracts. 
""Giving money to politicians has paid off for Paul Workman,"" a narrator says. ""Workman gave thousands to politicians and got millions in government construction projects."" 
To support this charge, Turner’s campaign sent over a list of projects handled by Workman Commercial Construction Services, which Workman founded. Turner’s spokesman, Craig Murphy, cited Workman’s contributions to several Williamson County officials: commissioners Ron Morrison ($250 in 2006), Lisa Birkman ($1,250 since 2004), and Valerie Covey ($500 total in 2006 and 2007) and County Judge Dan Gattis ($100 in 2010). 
Murphy also pointed to a real estate firm, T. Stacy & Associates, where Workman is director of development. Murphy noted the firm’s Web site lists the state of Texas among 40 featured clients. 
We also looked at Workman’s estimated $15,010 in political donations since 2000 to candidates for state office and political groups, according to records kept by the Texas Ethics Commission. Through this year, Workman has donated $9,740 to 20 individual candidates — about $1,500 to Democrats and $8,240 to Republicans. Overall, the Austin chapter of the Associated General Contractors PAC was Workman’s top recipient, fielding $2,790 in the period, followed by the Texas Building Branch Associated General Contractors PAC ($1,780), then-state Rep. Joe Nixon ($1,500) and Gov. Rick Perry ($1,390). 
Next, we reviewed 16 construction projects that Murphy cited on Workman Commercial’s Web site. Among them: Dripping Springs Elementary School, Lake Travis High School, Williamson County Regional Park, the Williamson County Justice Center, the Crowley Justice Center, the Boswell High School Dance and Cheer Center, the Irving Valley Ranch Library, Texas A&M University Langford Architecture building, and the Cypress Fairbanks-Leider, Bonham and Neff elementary schools. 
The Austin Business Journal reported in 1997 that Workman Commercial had earned $12.7 million doing work for the Austin Independent School District, and the American-Statesman reported in 2006 that Workman’s company had received about $14.5 million from Williamson County for various projects since 1998. 
Eric Bearse, Workman’s spokesman, said: ""Workman Commercial built two projects in Williamson County — a park and a courthouse. They were two separate projects, both bid publicly. And (in each case) they were the low bidder."" 
Connie Watson, a public information officer for Williamson County, confirmed that the contracts were let through competitive bidding, which Watson said the county requires for all construction and road projects. County commissioners ultimately award the contracts, based on a company’s bid, experience and other factors, she said. 
(We don’t know whether Workman donated to local school board members in school districts where he won contracts. Workman said he didn’t recall making any contributions, and we didn’t check board members’ finance reports, which are stored in each school district’s headquarters.) 
Additionally, Workman told us there was no connection between his political donations and his government contracts. In 1997, he told the Austin Business Journal that a contribution such as $250 to Commissioner Morrison ""does not influence a politician; it may just get us to the point where we could get a phone call answered if we need to see them about something."" 
Murphy, of Turner’s camp, told us: ""People don’t make contributions to local county commissioners for nothing. It’s in the law to have competitive bidding but that doesn’t stop people from doing their best to influence these decision-makers."" 
Murphy reminded us that Turner’s TV ad also says Workman admitted he donated to Democrats in order to benefit his business. According to Murphy, Workman said so during a Feb. 26 debate when another House candidate, David Sewell, asked about his contributions to Democratic candidates. (Investigating a separate claim in February, we found that Workman donated to Democratic candidates seven times — $1,500 total since 2000.) 
""Workman said he did not share values with those Democrats, he was making contributions to benefit his business,"" Murphy said. Sewell, who has since endorsed Workman, said he didn’t remember his question or Workman’s response. We could not confirm that the exchange took place. 
""We are not claiming he made bribes,"" said Murphy. ""Was there a quid pro quo? No way to know that."" 
We agree: There’s no way to know. 
It’s undisputed that Workman has contributed thousands to political candidates — both local and statewide — and that his company has handled government construction projects worth millions. 
But that doesn’t mean Workman’s donations ""paid off"" in contracts for his companies, and Turner offers no evidence of that.

Rep. Patrick McHenry claims early census returns are showing that conservatives are likely than liberals to return their census forms
","Rep. Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that oversees the census, says he's worried that disparaging comments about the census by some Republican leaders is translating to lagging conservative participation. And the result, he warned, could be a competitive advantage for Democrats.""Early census returns are showing that conservatives have been measurably less likely than liberals to return their census forms,"" McHenry wrote in an op-ed for the conservative Red State. ""Few things will make Nancy Pelosi happier than large numbers of conservatives failing to respond to the census,"" McHenry wrote. ""If we do not respond, we will not be counted, and if we are not counted, then we effectively will not exist. That would reduce conservatives’ power in elections, allow Democrats to draw more favorable congressional boundaries and help put more tax-hiking politicians in office.""McHenry said he is worried about ""blatant misinformation (about the census) coming from otherwise well-meaning conservatives. They are trying to do the right thing, but instead they are helping big government liberals by discouraging fellow conservatives from filling out their census forms.""McHenry didn't name names, but the census-bashers are well known.Back in June 2009, PolitiFact fact-checked two census claims made by Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.: that ACORN would be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public; and that the Constitution doesn't require people to give information beyond how many people are in their home. We rated both claims Pants on Fire!""Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked,"" Bachmann said then. ""And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that.""And on March 3, 2010, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, cast the lone vote in the House against a resolution to encourage participation in the 2010 census to ensure an accurate and complete count. (Bachmann, we note, voted for it). Explaining his vote, Paul said, it was ""for the simple, obvious reason that the census- like so many government programs- has grown far beyond what the framers of our Constitution intended. The invasive nature of the current census raises serious questions about how and why government will use the collected information. It also demonstrates how the federal bureaucracy consistently encourages citizens to think of themselves in terms of groups, rather than as individual Americans. The not so subtle implication is that each group, whether ethnic, religious, social, or geographic, should speak up and demand its 'fair share' of federal largesse.""Higher levels of mistrust in the census among Republicans was borne out in a Pew Research Center survey in mid-March that found nearly one in three Republicans did not think the Census Bureau would keep personal information confidential (slightly higher than the mistrust among Democrats). It also found that Republicans are more likely to believe the census will cost the government too much money; and that it will ask more than the government really needs to know. Still, we wondered if it was actually true that government distrust among some conservative Republicans really translated, as McHenry said, to early census returns showing that ""conservatives have been measurably less likely than liberals to return their census forms.""McHenry based that claim on a March 27, 2010, article in the Houston Chronicle which noted that conservative Texas was behind the national average in returning census forms and some of the lowest rates were in Texas’ most conservative counties.The article cites low return rates in Republican-dominated counties like Briscoe County in the Panhandle; King County, near Lubbock; Culberson County, near El Paso; and Newton County, in deep East Texas.It's true that, with a state participation rate of 56 percent as of April 6, 2010, the decidedly Republican Texas lagged behind the national average of 62 percent. Texas participation in returning the mail-in census forms also lagged behind the national average in 2000 too. And it's true that within Texas, all four of the counties mentioned in the Houston Chronicle article lagged well behind even the state average. But is that enough evidence to support McHenry's claim about an alleged national trend? Not according to several demographers we spoke to.First, all four of those counties are small. In 2008, King County had a whopping 202 registered voters. Together, the four counties comprise less than a tenth of 1 percent of the registered voters in Texas. Several census experts we spoke with said it would be a mistake to make any kind of conclusion about a state trend, let alone a national one, based on such a small sample. And we found that all four counties significantly trailed the state and national averages for returns in 2000 as well.""If they were low in 2000 and they are low now, it's not the effect of a new change,"" said Isaac W. Eberstein, a professor of sociology at Florida State University and director of the FSU's Center for Demography and Population Health.Eberstein also cautioned against concluding that because participation rates in those counties are low, and they are highly conservative, that means conservatives there are less likely to send the census back. In demographic circles, they talk about something called the ecological or aggregate fallacy, Eberstein said. The short version is that it's an error in interpreting statistical data to assume that everyone in a group -- in this case a county -- has all the same characteristics. In other words, it could be that conservatives in those counties are participating at average levels, but that liberals are not. Moreover, the counties appear to have been largely cherry-picked. We were easily able to locate numerous other counties in Texas that voted overwhelmingly in favor of Barack Obama in the 2008 election, but have participation rates similar to or lower than those four counties.At our request, Frances Deviney, senior research associate at the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Texas, prepared a spreadsheet that correlated voting records by Texas county in the 2008 presidential election with participation rates in the census so far. And contrary to the claim by McHenry, the statewide data showed that counties that had higher vote tallies for Republican John McCain have slightly higher participation rates in the census.""The short version is that what he's saying doesn't correlate with the data,"" Deviney said.Moreover, that Pew survey we mentioned earlier, while it did find partisan differences in attitudes about the census, it also found that a slightly higher percentage of Republicans (90 percent) than Democrats and independents (85 percent each) said they intend to participate in the census. And a slightly higher percentage of Republicans believe participating is a civic responsibility.""We are not seeing that there is any sign of a partisan difference in intention to participate,"" said Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center. ""Anti-government sentiment is not translating into the bottom line, according to our survey.""We also looked at the participation rates of various states across the country, and found numerous examples of historically red states that have participation rates above the national average, as well as some below. Demographers we spoke with said they couldn't discern any pattern indicating that states with higher percentages of Republicans were sending forms back at lower rates than Democratic ones. In fact, Bachmann's Minnesota has one of the highest participation rates.Citing the participation rates of four small counties in Texas to make a generalization about a national trend is ""reading more into selected information than is warranted,"" said demographer William O'Hare. ""I can't think of any evidence I've seen that there are such widespread concerns that Republicans are being under-counted in the 2010 Census.""Here's the thing about McHenry's statement: it seems plausible. There has been a good bit of media attention on anti-government sentiment and skepticism from some conservative leaders relating to the census. It seems intuitive, then, that that might lead to lower participation rates among some segment of the conservative population. But so far, we haven't found any objective evidence that that's happening to any great degree. For McHenry to make a conclusion about a national trend based on low participation rates in four small Texas counties is a stretch. Especially when one considers that these were low-participating counties in the last census too; and that there are lots of other low-participating counties in Texas that are not conservative. On top of that, the Pew survey shows that while Republicans may be more distrustful of the census, they are by and large planning to participate, even at slightly higher rates that Democrats. Also, an independent review of all the counties in Texas showed that not only is McHenry's claim unfounded, the opposite is more likely true -- as counties that voted for McCain over Obama in 2008 have had slightly higher participation rates. And while decidedly conservative Texas has lagged behind the national average, there are lots of red states performing above the national average as well. A spokeswoman from McHenry's office told us he was just trying to be proactive and encourage all Americans to be counted. It's hard to find fault with that. Still, we just don't find any evidence that his premise that conservatives have been less likely to return their census forms than liberals is true. We rule McHenry's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-early-census-returns-ar/
"['National', 'Census', 'Patrick McHenry']","
Rep. Patrick McHenry claims every census in history has asked for an individual’s race
","In an op-ed piece for the conservative website Red State on April 1, 2010, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Information Policy, Census and National Archives Subcommittee, sought to tamp down some of the misinformation being spread about the census by ""otherwise well-meaning conservatives"" and warned that failing to fully participate in the census could create a competitive advantage for Democrats.Specifically, McHenry attempted to allay the fear among some Republicans who distrust the government and view the census as overly prying. By law, the U.S. Census Bureau cannot share a person's personal information with anyone, including other federal agencies and law enforcement entities. All Census Bureau employees take an oath of nondisclosure and are sworn for life to protect the confidentiality of the data. The penalty for unlawful disclosure is a fine of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment of up to five years. Nonetheless, a Pew Research Center survey in mid-March found nearly one in three Republicans did not think the Census Bureau would keep personal information confidential (slightly higher than the mistrust among Democrats); and when asked if the census asks for more information than the government really needs, 61 percent of Republicans either responded ""yes"" or ""don't know,"" as opposed 47 percent of Democrats.In his posting on Red State, McHenry said ""the most private question on this year’s form asks for an individual’s race and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census conducted under then-President George Washington.""We decided to check that claim out, which was similar to one from Census Bureau director Robert M. Groves in a March 15, 2010, press release: ""It's one of the shortest forms in our lifetime with just 10 questions very much like the questions James Madison and Thomas Jefferson helped craft on the very first Census."" Conveniently, the U.S. Census Bureau keeps historical records online of all the questions asked in every census going back to the first one in 1790.If you follow the census questions asked through U.S. history, you can see how they reflect changing attitudes and understandings about race.Yes, the 1790 census and others in the early years of the survey addressed race, but it was hardly a matter of checking a box. Rather, the census asked about the number of free white males and females; the number of ""all other free persons"" and the number of slaves.By 1850, the Census asked about people's ""color."" According to the Census archives, this column was to be left blank if a person was white, marked ""B"" if a person was black, and marked ""M"" if a person was mulatto. A separate form listed slave inhabitants, the last census to do so. By 1870, the ""color"" options included ""W"" for white, ""B"" for black, ""M"" for mulatto, ""C"" for Chinese (a category which included all Asians), or ""I"" for American Indian. The question morphed into ""color or race"" in the mid-1900s, and then, finally to just ""race"" in 1970. In 1980, in addition to race, the Census began asking if a person was of Spanish or Hispanic origin or descent.It's fair to say that every census has addressed the issue of race in some fashion. But we think it's a bit of a stretch when McHenry says ""this year's asks for an individual’s race and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census."" In the 1790 Census (and several after it), a respondent was not simply asked their race. Rather, they were asked to list the number of white people, the number of ""other free persons"" and the number of slaves. In other words, it didn't ask for the race of non-whites. One could argue this reflects the common attitude about race at the time. But that's hardly the same as the 2010 version that simply asks a person's race. Prior to the Civil War the census was more concerned with whether someone was enslaved or not, and establishing whether someone was white. This is a very different conception from our modern idea of race. Post Civil War, the terminology changed (from ""color"" to ""race,"" for example) and the categories expanded over time. Certainly these are different standards when compared to today's measures. But again, one could argue that the questions comported with attitudes about race at those times, and the census has always asked descriptive questions that corrolate to race. So we rule McHenry's claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-every-census-history-ha/

Rubio tries to blame Crist for health care overhaul
","Marco Rubio is again trying to link Gov. Charlie Crist to President Barack Obama.Rubio, the former state House speaker and Republican frontrunner for the U.S. Senate, has played and replayed images of Crist hugging Obama when the two campaigned together in Florida on behalf of the federal stimulus.Now Rubio is trying to make a case that Crist, his rival in the Senate race, is to blame for the federal health care overhaul, too.""The path to ObamaCare becoming law all started with Charlie Crist supporting President Obama's $787 billion stimulus,"" Rubio's campaign said in a recent fundraising e-mail. ""Marco is the only candidate you can trust to repeal Obamacare.""We know that Charlie + Obama = manhug.And Obama + Congress = health care overhaul.But does Charlie + Obama + stimulus = Obamacare?To be honest, we started this analysis not sure how Rubio's statement could possibly be true. In fact, we wondered if the Rubio campaign aides would just scream 'Uncle"" and accept a Pants On Fire.They didn't.""The night Obamacare passed, on the floor of the House, Nancy Pelosi said, in essence, that Obamacare would not be possible without the stimulus,"" Rubio adviser Alberto Martinez told PolitiFact Florida. ""Charlie Crist was instrumental in providing the political support that Barack Obama needed to pass the stimulus.""That's a big logical leap, so let's explore the facts behind it.On the fine point about Speaker Pelosi, Martinez is correct that she referenced the stimulus in her health care speech.""We would not be here tonight for sure without the extraordinary leadership and vision of President Barack Obama. We thank him for his unwavering commitment to health care for all Americans,"" Pelosi said on March 21, 2010. ""This began over a year ago under his leadership in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act where we had very significant investments in science, technology, and innovation for health care reform. It continued in the president's budget a few months later, a budget which was a statement of our national values, which allocated resources that were part of our value system and in a way that stabilized our economy, created jobs, lowered taxes for the middle class and did so and reduced the deficit and did so in a way that had pillars of investment, including education and health care reform.""The Rubio campaign tried to make hay of the speech the following day, linking Pelosi's words to Crist in a press release. The campaign also posted a video of Pelosi's statement with the headline ""Pelosi: Road to ObamaCare began w/Crist-Obama Stimulus,"" and is now repeating the claim in the fundraising pitch.Charlie and the stimulusNo doubt about it, Crist supported, campaigned for and endorsed the federal stimulus bill.But was he instrumental in it passing?Crist campaigned for the stimulus bill with Obama in Fort Myers on Feb. 10, 2009. He made several national television appearances supporting the proposal, saying on Hardball with Chris Matthews, for instance: ""It's going to help (Floridians') children. It's going to help their traffic situation. It's going to help produce more jobs here in the Sunshine State. That's a perspective that I have to have as, in essence, the CEO of Florida. And that's why I support it.""We also know that Crist lobbied members of Florida's congressional delegation from both parties to support the stimulus package. The Miami Herald reported that Crist lobbied Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, along with Democratic Reps. Kathy Castor and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.But what good did all of that campaigning from a prominent national Republican do? How many votes did he affect in Congress? Was he the lynchpin?Not a whole lot. Not a whole lot. And no.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 passed the U.S. House 244-188, without the support of one Republican (which means no Republicans from Florida). It then passed the U.S. Senate 61-37, with just three Republican votes: Maine's two Republican senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter. (Specter's now a Democrat, by the way.)If you're truly keeping score, the conference report -- the congressional action that merges the House and Senate bills -- passed the House 246-183, again without a single GOP vote, and passed the Senate 60-38 with the votes of Collins, Snowe and Specter. We also checked the Congressional Record to see if members of Congress referenced Crist during floor debate on the stimulus. Crist's name was mentioned once, on Feb. 11, 2009, by Democratic U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton of Ohio. Sutton was talking about Crist's support of the stimulus and how Crist said it could save and create jobs in Florida.So there's nothing to confirm the Rubio campaign's claim that Crist was ""instrumental."" There's no evidence that Crist's support swayed a single vote. For the Florida delegation -- like all state delegations except Maine and Pennsylvania -- it was strictly a party-line vote. Indeed, Crist was more outlier than influencer, a rare Republican leader who spoke up but was roundly criticized in his party. Brendan Daly, a Pelosi spokesman, said that because no House Republicans supported the bill, that he ""does not think Crist was instrumental in passing it."" We asked Kate Kelly, a spokesman for Specter, if Crist's support had been a key factor for the Pennsylvania senator. She replied, ""Sen. Specter has never mentioned that as a reason he voted for the stimulus."" Charlie begat stimulus; stimulus begat health careNow, to the Rubio campaign's claim that the stimulus bill led to health care reform.The stimulus act passed in February 2009 did have health care-related proposals, including a plan to create electronic health care records and about $20 billion to help unemployed workers purchase health care through the employer-based COBRA system. But the stimulus hardly was the impetus for health care reform. And if you read Pelosi's statement again, that's not what she was saying.She was praising Obama and citing some of his accomplishments and notable proposals that included health care. But there's scant evidence of a causal link between the stimulus and health care reform that the Rubio campaign alleges. First, health care reform pre-dates the 2009 economic stimulus by years -- or even decades. Obama made it one of his key domestic policy promises during the 2008 campaign. And the roots of reform can be traced as far back as President Theodore Roosevelt (Obama frequently mentions that the nation has been trying to overhaul health care since then). And of course, the issue came up during the early 1990s when Hillary Clinton chaired the health care task force in the Clinton administration. Second, Rubio has failed to prove a causal connection between the two. It's not like the stimulus bill created some kind of legal foundation for health care reform -- it was a bill filled with tax cuts and spending to boost the economy. And it's not like it provided Obama with a huge surge of momentum. Indeed, more than a year lapsed between the final passage of the stimulus and the health care bill. John Rother, executive vice president of policy and strategy for the AARP, a group that closely followed the health care debate, said there's no link between the stimulus and health care bill.Rubio ""might be the only person in America who might make that claim,"" Rother said.Our rulingSo Rubio contends that ""The path to ObamaCare becoming law all started with Charlie Crist supporting President Obama’s $787 billion stimulus."" The logic is that Crist was instrumental in helping Obama deliver the stimulus, and that the health care reforms would not be possible without the stimulus.We find this wrong on both points. Crist, while a vocal supporter of the stimulus and one of the only major Republicans endorsing the spending plan, did little to sway votes in Congress and get the stimulus bill passed into law. And the stimulus, while it had a few health care provisions, had little to do with the health care bill that eventually was passed by Congress. The seeds for the health care bill were sewn during Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, not at a town hall and hug in Fort Myers.All this to say, our first instinct was right.

Rep. Patrick McHenry claims the 2010 census is shortest in modern history
","In a March 29, 2010, press release, Rep. Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that oversees the census, attempted to rally Republican participation in the 2010 census after he said early early returns of census forms showed Republican counties were lagging behind, perhaps due to discouragement from ""otherwise well-meaning conservatives.""Back in June 2009, for example, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., complained that ""the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that.""And on March 3, 2010, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, cast the lone vote in the House against a resolution to encourage participation in the 2010 census to ensure an accurate and complete count. Explaining his vote, Paul said, it was ""for the simple, obvious reason that the census, like so many government programs, has grown far beyond what the framers of our Constitution intended. The invasive nature of the current census raises serious questions about how and why government will use the collected information. It also demonstrates how the federal bureaucracy consistently encourages citizens to think of themselves in terms of groups, rather than as individual Americans.""McHenry worries that those kinds of comments might lead to lower Republican participation in the census, to the party's own detriment.A Pew Research Center survey in mid-March found nearly one in three Republicans did not think the Census Bureau would keep personal information confidential (slightly higher than the mistrust among Democrats); and when asked if the census asks for more information than the government really needs, 61 percent of Republicans either responded ""yes"" or ""don't know,"" as opposed 47 percent of Democrats. Seeking to allay some of those concerns, McHenry said, ""This census is also the shortest and least intrusive count in modern history.""""Conservatives need to know how important it is to fill out the census,"" stated McHenry stated. ""It is one of the only things our Constitution specifically asks of U.S. citizens and boycotting will just help liberals expand government even further.""In a separate item, we explored whether there is credible evidence Republican participation in filling out census forms is lagging behind that of Democrats. Here, we will tackle's McHenry's claim that the 2010 census is the shortest in modern history.The U.S. Census Bureau has long been touting the 2010 questionnaire as ""one of the shortest census forms in history,"" with just 10 questions that take about 10 minutes to complete.And here they are: 1. The number of people living in the residence2. Any additional people that might be living there as of April 1, 20103. Whether the residence is owned or rented4. Telephone number (in case the Census Bureau has follow-up questions)5. Name6. Sex7. Age and date of birth8. Whether of Hispanic origin9. Race10. Whether that person sometimes lives somewhere elseStill, note the ""one of the shortest,"" qualifier in the Census Bureau's statement. That's because the short form for the 2000 census had just 8 questions. So it was shorter. But in 2000, one out of six households would get a long form, which had 53 questions.For the 2010 count, the Census Bureau did away with the long form altogether.Now, instead of asking the more detailed social, economic and housing characteristics questions in the long form once a decade, the Census Bureau now asks them in the annual American Community Survey, which goes out to about 3 million addresses each year, explained U.S. Census Bureau spokeswoman Stacy Gimbel Vidal.In the decades prior to 2000, the short forms were all much longer than 10 questions. In 1990, for example, the survey posed seven population and seven housing questions. But samples of the population also got an additional 23 population questions and 19 housing questions. In 1980, the forms included 33 population questions and 7 housing questions (plus, a sampling got 23 more). We looked through an index of survey questions asked in each census through U.S. history and had to go back to 1840 before we found one shorter than 10 questions. But we don't think that counts as ""modern history."" For the record, in the very first census in 1790, assistant marshals listed the name of each head of household and then asked four questions. Now, ""name"" counts as one of the 10 questions, so the number of questions has essentially doubled (we also note that one of the questions now asks for your telephone number, to verify information, and back in 1790, the telephone was nearly 100 years away from being invented). We think McHenry can make a credible claim that this year's census is the shortest and least intrusive count in modern history. We'll dock him a bit because the short form of the 2000 census was technically shorter, with eight questions rather than 10. But in 2000, one in six got a long form census, which was much longer. And this year, everyone will get the 10-question form. We rate McHenry's claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-2010-census-shortest-mo/

Florida Chamber says education proposals won't cut teacher pay
","As the debate over proposed education reforms continues to ratchet up in Tallahassee, groups on both sides are taking to the airwaves.Groups supporting and opposing SB 6 and HB 7189, the Senate and House education bills, recently launched television spots to bolster their arguments. The Florida Chamber of Commerce, a main proponent of Republican-led legislation, is running 30-second advertisement that blames ""Tallahassee union lobbyists"" for misleading citizens about the education proposals.""Tallahassee union lobbyists have been paid a fortune to bash anyone in their way, now backing a shadow group against rewarding our best teachers,"" the ad begins, with images of men in dark suits and sunglasses talking in the background. ""Fact is these reforms will not cut one teacher's pay or cut one retirement benefit.""In this item, we're going to put the claim about teacher pay to the Truth-O-Meter.SB 6 and HB 7189 are identical education proposals being considered in the Legislature that would radically alter how teachers are evaluated and compensated. Under the plan -- which was first pushed by Senate Republicans -- teacher pay increases would be tied to student performance on end-of-course exams. Gone would be the standard calculations for years of service. Teachers are dug in against the proposal, saying that the changes would punish good teachers, take decisions out of the hands of school districts and require local schools to either further cut budgets or raise taxes.There has been much disagreement about what the education reforms would do to teachers and classrooms, and both sides are now touting myth vs. fact bulletins to help get out their message.Here's the myth vs. fact statements from the chamber. Here's an eerily similar myth vs. fact sheet from House Republicans (and by eerily similar, we mean pretty much identical).And here's the other side from the Florida Education Association.We've seen claims on the Internet and heard about talk among teachers that SB 6 and HB 7189 could mean a pay cut for educators. To examine that claim, let's compare the current system to the one legislators are considering.The current pay systemFlorida's 67 school districts set their own teacher pay scales. In most every case, they are based on two factors --- level of degree and years of experience.In Orange County, for example, a teacher with 10 years experience and a bacherlor's degree earns $41,720. In Pinellas, that same teacher earns $40,083. If the same teacher has a Master's degree, they earn $44,325 in Orange and $43,010 in Pinellas. Teachers can get paid extra for coaching sports or advising a club. The state also has bonuses available to high performing teachers.As a teacher gains experience or gets an advanced degree, their salary goes up.The proposed pay systemUnder the new system, teachers would no longer be slotted into a pay scale based on experience or degree. So those salary scales in Orange and Pinellas would disappear.For existing teachers, salaries would be frozen where they are.New teachers would start at one salary (regardless of education), and teachers transferring from another state would start at another salary (regardless of years of service). The exact salaries would be set by individual school districts.Starting in 2015, teacher raises would depend on their annual evaluations, and half of those evaluations would be calculated using student performance statistics.Are there pay cuts in the bill?We examined the bill and analyses of it prepared for state legislators to see if there is any pay cut. We found there were no such cuts mandated or suggested in the bill.The only thing that came close was how the bill would affect a teacher's potential earnings. Their ultimate salary in the future could vary depending on how they rank in the proposed new system.For example, while a teacher would expect to see small salary increases based on years of service under the current system, their salary could remain the same for several years under the reform plan. But it could also mean they would receive bigger raises faster.The performance pay raises are just that -- raises -- not bonuses, and stay a part of the a teacher's base compensation.It's also worth noting that starting salaries for new teachers could be cut, since that's a detail to be worked out by local school districts. But that wouldn't affect educators currently teaching in Florida's schools.None of this means, however, that pay cuts aren't possible. It just says that they aren't directly spelled out in the bills.School district administrators fear that the cost of implementing the reforms -- no one knows the final price tag -- will force districts to either raise taxes or slash budgets (we previously ruled that the bill represents an unfunded mandate for school districts). And if budgets have to be cut, salaries and benefits are an obvious target --- they make up 80 to 85 percent of a district's budget. Pinellas School board member Carol Cook said that the financial mandate imposed by SB 6/HB 7189 on top of other budget pressures could force Pinellas to reconsider small raisies it agreed to give teachers in 2010-11.""I’d like to turn over every stone before we do that. But there aren’t many stones left to turn over,” Cook told the St. Petersburg Times.Duval County superintendent Ed Pratt-Dannals told PolitiFact Florida that his district could face at least $42 million in unfunded mandates if the education reforms pass. He also notes that Duval County -- and all districts across Florida -- will lose millions of dollars in federal stimulus funding ""with no legislative plan for replacement.""While it's impossible to predict the future, we have to at least consider those claims in analyzing the Florida Chamber of Commerce ad.To recap: In its attempt to promote SB 6 and HB 7189, the Florida Chamber of Commerce notes that the education reforms tying teacher pay increases to student performance will not ""cut one teacher's pay."" The chamber is right that there's nothing in the education bills that cuts teachers' pay. But teacher salaries could fluctuate in the new performance pay system when compared with the system currently in place. And there is a fear among school district administrators that the cost to implement the SB 6/HB 7189 changes might result in less money to be directed to teacher salaries. As such, we rate the Florida Chamber of Commerce statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/07/florida-chamber-commerce/florida-chamber-says-education-proposals-wont-cut-/

Financial reform draws many lobbyists
","The Obama administration is pushing Democratic proposals to more heavily regulate Wall Street and the financial sector. In light of the 2008 financial crisis and the ongoing recession, some might think that would be easy to achieve.But that's not the case, said Lawrence Summers, one of President Barack Obama's top economic advisers.""I expect that reform is going to pass. It's not easy. You've got a million dollars being spent, per congressman, in lobbying expenses on this issue. (The) industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate working on this,"" Summers said, when asked about the prospects for financial reform on ABC News' This Week.The new regulations are still being formulated. A bill in the Senate would create a council to watch for systemic threats to the financial system, and it would allow the Federal Reserve to oversee different types of financial institutions, not just banks.We wanted to check Summers' statements that a million dollars was being spent per congressman, and that there were four lobbyists for every member of the House and Senate working on it.To analyze his statements, we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that has spent 25 years tracking money in politics. Much of their work involves the analysis of mandated disclosure documents for campaign finance and lobbying.The most recent documents cover the year 2009; the filings for the first quarter of 2010 are due April 20. The center analyzed spending on lobbyists by sector, with finance, insurance and real estate grouped into one category. For 2009, that sector's spending totaled just over $455 million. There are 435 members of U.S. House of Representatives, so that is more than $1 million per member. One could make an argument that senators are also technically members of Congress, but Summers said ""congressmen,"" which typically means House members.Summers also said that the industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate. The finance, insurance and real estate sector employed 2,597 lobbyists in 2009, according to the center. Add 100 senators to the 435 House members and you get 535; that's 4.85 lobbyists for every member of Congress.We must add a few cautions about these numbers. The insurance category includes a few health insurers, a group not likely to be lobbying on financial reform. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, for example, spent $14.3 million on lobbyists in 2009, and America's Health Insurance Plans spent $8.9 million. But other types of insurers would be interested in financial reform, because the legislation gives new authority to for the government to wind down failing companies that are not banks. Additionally, the financial sector lobbies on some issues that are not strictly related to financial regulations. The American Bankers Association, for example, used seven lobbyists in 2009 to influence a major appropriations bill, according to the center.Still, there's reason to think that the center's numbers come pretty close to the mark, said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics.""As soon as the Obama administration came into office, it was evident that something was going to happen,"" he said. ""This was a major issue last year and continues to be a major issue this year.""On taking office, Obama said one of his top priorities was new financial regulations, and legislators were working on them for much of 2009. The House of Representatives approved a bill on Dec. 11; the Senate has yet to vote on a bill.Though the financial sector faced significant setbacks during the crisis of fall 2008, the sector's spending on lobbying in 2009 kept pace with or exceeded spending in previous years, Levinthal said. Getting back to Summers' statement, he said, there is ""a million dollars being spent, per congressman, in lobbying expenses on this issue. (The) industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate working on this."" There may be cases in which the financial sector did not spend the entirety of its $455 million in lobbying money strictly on financial regulation during 2009, or examples when some of its 2,597 lobbyists did not work financial regulation. But it's clearly one of the industry's top issues. And the analysis here is based on public records and disclosures. So we rate Summers' statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/apr/07/lawrence-summers/financial-reform-draws-many-lobbyists/

Dockery says SB 6 would not allow teachers to return to work after raising their children
","One of the most contentious issues of the 2010 legislative session is a plan to overhaul teacher pay and tenure. Teachers statewide overwhelmingly oppose the legislation, known as SB 6, which has been buoyed by Republican leaders.Sen. Paula Dockery, a candidate for governor, was one of a few Republicans to vote against SB 6 when it passed the Senate last month. The House plans a vote soon. Dockery followed up her vote by writing an opinion column that ran in the Lakeland Ledger on April 3, 2010, and contained some explosive charges about what's wrong with the bill. Here's an excerpt:""SB 6 will destroy jobs. The bill makes it nearly impossible for someone not currently teaching to renew his or her teaching certificate. Teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children. They will have their certifications threatened if they are activated for military duty, or otherwise unavailable to teach, for longer than one school year."" (Read the whole column here.)It's a strong statement with broad implications. We chose to focus on the claim that ""teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children."" Could that be true?First, some basics about SB 6. Among other things, the bill would make it easier to fire teachers and base their pay on test scores rather than the current schedule based on years of service and degrees. Supporters say it would reward high-performing teachers and make it easier to get rid of underperforming teachers, while detractors say it will deter teachers from the profession.Teachers hired on or after July 1, 2010, would be placed on a one-year probationary contract during which time they could be fired and then later would be placed on subsequent contracts. Teachers hired before July 1, 2010, keep their jobs as long as they can show ""effective performance"" in four of the five years leading up to renewal.We contacted Dockery's campaign and Senate office to ask how she reached the conclusion that parents who leave their teaching jobs for some length of time could not later return to work. Her Senate spokeswoman, Rachel Perrin Rogers, referred us to a portion of SB 6 that states: ""Beginning with the 2014-2015 school year, the requirements for the renewal of a professional certificate shall include documentation of effective or highly effective performance as demonstrated under s. 1012.34 for at least 4 of the preceding 5 years before the renewal certification is sought.""""This is saying you can't renew your certificate if you haven't done what is outlined in this chapter,"" Rogers said. ""How can I renew it if I have taken time off?""But in the same section of the bill Rogers pointed us to, we found this: ""The State Board of Education shall adopt rules to define the process for documenting effective performance under this subsection, including equivalent options for individuals who have not been evaluated under s. 1012.34,"" which relates to evaluating teachers.That part indicates there is an exception -- although not clearly spelled out -- for teachers who don't get evaluated because they are on leave. Thomas Butler, spokesman for the state Department of Education, explained it this way: ""As currently written, the bill states that the State Board would have to adopt rules to define the process for documenting effective performance to meet renewal requirements, including for individuals who are not evaluated under 1012.34. As such, individuals who are on leave from the district and who would not have such an evaluation and, therefore, would be included in the rule.""So the state Board of Education would develop the rule with public input after the bill becomes law.We asked Butler to clarify how the law would apply to a mother who takes time off from teaching to raise children. ""When a mom takes time off she obviously won't be receiving evaluations,"" Butler told PolitiFact Florida. ""She is not going to have evaluations so it's implied she will fall under the state board rule that hasn't been developed."" Kathy Hebda, deputy chancellor for educator quality at the Department of Education, will oversee the rule writing. Hebda said the bill says the state board ""shall"" write the rule -- so it will definitely happen.""It's actually requiring the state board to adopt a rule to include an equivalent option for individuals who didn't get evaluated,"" she said. ""There are going to be a lot of people in that scenario including persons who decide to leave the classroom for a couple of years and come back. The state board is going to have to have a process to bring that person back in and let them renew the certificate.""That could include teachers who had worked at private schools or out of state, she said.Roberto Martinez, a member of the state board that will develop the rules, said he had not heard anything about this particular issue. However he said that if a rule needs to be written to address parents who want to return to teaching, that will be done. ""I'm not about to penalize a mom. ... I would encourage women to work and raise a family.""Critics of the bill say the language is not clear in terms of the effect on teachers who take leaves. State Rep. Marty Kiar, D-Davie, who has introduced amendments related to the bill, said in an interview that the issue of the effect on teachers who take leaves has not yet arisen in committee meetings.""I'm going to ask the questions on the floor tomorrow to the bill sponsor,"" he said on April 6. So, let's review. SB 6 clearly states that teachers must show ""effective or highly effective"" performance for four of the five preceeding years -- which clearly can't be done for teachers who want to return from a few years' leave. But the bill also directs the state Board of Education to adopt rules to document effective performance for teachers not evaluated. The state Department of Education says that clause means the state board will create a rule that will apply to teachers who have taken leave to take care of their children for example -- although SB 6 doesn't clearly spell out that scenario.Dockery said ""teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children."" We find there is a provision in SB 6 to prevent this scenario, but because the rules won't be written until after the bill becomes law, we can't definitely say what will happen. We rule Dockery's claim Barely True. ",/factchecks/2010/apr/06/paula-dockery/dockery-says-sb-6-would-not-allow-teachers-return-/

Jean Evans overstates Clean Missouri effects on emails
","Missourians overwhelmingly supported Amendment 1, also known as Clean Missouri, in the November election. The amendment includes changing processes for redistricting, capping campaign contributions and establishing limits on lobbyist gifts. But one particular issue has become controversial among lawmakers after the amendment’s passage. The bill requires that legislative records and proceedings now be open to the public, meaning that all state legislators will now be subject to the Missouri Sunshine Law. Several Missouri lawmakers have since brought up concerns with the limitations, or lack thereof, of what will have to be made public if a Sunshine Law request is made of them. ""Constituents now face the reality that all their personal issues will be made public,"" State Rep. Jean Evans said on Twitter. Later in her Twitter thread, she makes clear that she believes her constituents have lost privacy when sending her emails. We decided to take a look. When we reached out to Evans, she directed us to information given to members of the House of Representatives by Chief Clerk and Administrator Dana Rademan Miller. It isn’t a legal opinion, but rather resources that members could use if they received a request under the Sunshine Law. It did, however, provide some clarity on the language and enforcement of the amendment. In short, state legislators will now become subject to the Sunshine Law and become the custodian, or keeper, of their own records under Amendment 1. Governmental bodies in Missouri have been subject to the Sunshine Law, but before the passage of the amendment, individual legislators were not considered to be governmental bodies. Joseph Martineau, primary First Amendment lawyer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, said that the law essentially applies the same rules to individual legislators that lower public governmental bodies and the legislative branch already followed. Jean Maneke, a lawyer at the Maneke law group and legal hotline attorney for the Missouri Press Association, said that it is important to note that in the context of Evans’ tweet, the law does not specifically say emails, but rather says legislative records (including electronic ones), and that it will be up to each legislator to decide if they classify emails as legislative records. Where things get most interesting, however, is the provisions listed in the Sunshine Law, section 610.021, that allow for closure of certain records. The section lists 24 provisions, with several that call for the closure of records for situations dealing with identifiable persons, such as welfare cases, nonjudicial mental and physical health proceedings, and personnel records.    Sean Soendker Nicholson, from Yes on 1 for a Clean Missouri, said, ""There are rules already in place to protect private information when someone submits a Sunshine Law request to the governor or to their mayor, and those will remain in place for Sunshine Law requests that go into politicians."" Maneke believes, however, that things are far from that simple. She was quick to point out that at this stage, everything is interpretation, as there have been no suits filed for a court to rule on. She said that it will be impossible to know for sure until that occurs, but agrees with Nicholson that some public records are closed under the Sunshine Law, and that could be applicable here as well. Evans said, ""Constituents now face reality that all their personal issues will be made public"" under Clean Missouri. All of them? That’s unlikely given that the Sunshine Law contains provisions for the closure of certain public records that are more sensitive. It is hard to say that all personal issues emailed to state legislators will be made public without knowing the content of those communications. The new law gives legislators more responsibility for determining what is appropriate to release under the law. Evans’ warning appears to be a broad overstatement of what could occur because of Clean Missouri. For these reasons, we rate Evans' statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/dec/06/jean-evans/jean-evans-overstates-clean-missouri-effects-email/

Amy Klobuchar: Number, rate of children without insurance rises
","The uninsurance rate is one of the main barometers for how the country is doing on health care. In that vein, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., sounded the alarm. ""After a decade of progress, the rate of uninsured children is now rising,"" Klobuchar tweeted Dec. 3. ""This is very troublesome. Every child needs access to quality, affordable healthcare."" After a decade of progress, the rate of uninsured children is now rising. This is very troublesome. Every child needs access to quality, affordable healthcare.https://t.co/tBJJIYl2MA Behind Klobuchar’s tweet lies a recent report from the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. It found an increase in the number of U.S. children without health insurance. Between 2016 and 2017, the number grew by 276,000, and the fraction of uninsured kids — defined as children 18 and under — went from 4.7 percent to 5 percent. The data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which reaches enough people to give statistically valid results at both the state and national levels. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a well-respected center for health care data, also crunched the American Community Survey numbers and had the same result. The Georgetown study saw increases in uninsurance in every state. The only improvement came in the District of Columbia where the rate fell from 3.1 percent to 1.2 percent. Even though a growing economy provided more children insurance through a parent’s job, it wasn’t enough to compensate for a larger decline in publicly-funded coverage. ""This is the eighth time I have written this report and we have never seen such uniformity in state results,"" said Joan Alker, director of the center and the lead author. Alker said the breadth of the shift across the board led her to believe that national forces are at play. The report suggests that the push to repeal the Affordable Care Act and administration moves that curtailed the marketing effort and length of time for people to sign up for coverage on the health care marketplaces took a toll. The effect on children was indirect, since it’s adults that sign up for health plans. But the more parents who show up, the more kids who gain coverage. Health policy researcher Michael Karpman at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, said parents of modest means often discover when they apply that their children qualify for subsidized insurance they hadn’t known about. ""A consistent finding is that expansions of coverage for parents often have spillover or ‘welcome mat’ effects on coverage for children who are already eligible for public health insurance,"" Karpman said. About three-fourths of all the children who lost insurance from 2016 to 2017 lived in states that did not expand Medicaid to all low-income adults, the Georgetown study found. Texas alone accounted for about a fifth of all the uninsured children in the country. With an uninsurance rate of 10.7 percent, it ranked last among the states. Alker said a rise in one year doesn’t mean there couldn’t be improvement the next. But she said she thinks that’s unlikely ""because we continue to hear that kids are losing Medicaid."" Karpman noted that it is unusual for the number of uninsured to go up in a growing economy. Still, the trend won’t be clear until new numbers come in for 2018. There’s one difference between Klobuchar’s tweet and the study. She said the shift came after a decade of progress. The report looked at the past nine years, the furthest back that the Census Bureau collected comparable data. Klobuchar said that the uninsurance rate for children is rising after a decade of gains. U.S. Census Bureau data show an increase last year. The uninsurance rate for children 18 and younger rose from 4.7 percent to 5 percent between 2016 and 2017. Progress since 2008 had been steady. The main caveat is that so far, we have just one year of data, and we're missing numbers for 2018. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/dec/05/amy-klobuchar/amy-klobuchar-number-rate-children-without-insuran/

Donald Trump's false claim about the cost of illegal immigration
","In a renewed effort to get Democrats to approve money for his border wall, President Donald Trump claimed that the border wall would quickly pay itself using a simple concept. Trump had originally promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, but he now says the United States can bear the costs using savings that would come from preventing illegal immigration. ""Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!"" Trump tweeted Dec. 4. Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done! The White House did not respond to PolitiFact queries for data backing Trump’s claim. It’s difficult to pin a hard number on the cost of illegal immigration, because there’s limited data on the population living in the United States illegally. But several immigration experts told PolitiFact they were unaware of any study pegging immigration losses or costs at $250 billion a year. The largest estimate we could find is not even half of Trump’s assertion. Trump has previously touched on the country’s fiscal burden from illegal immigration. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he claimed that ""illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year."" That was Mostly False. His latest claim more than doubles the figures he claimed two years ago; most estimates of the unauthorized population remain around 11 million. The right-leaning Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimated in a September 2017 report that the federal, state and local costs of more than 12.5 million people in the United States illegally was around $135 billion a year. After factoring in this population’s tax contributions, the group said the total economic impact of illegal immigration was around $116 billion a year (up from $113 billion in 2013). The federation seeks to reduce legal and illegal immigration to the United States, and its cost estimates tend to be higher than other related studies. Its conclusions have generally been criticized for relying on inexact estimates and broad assumptions. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said FAIR’s 2017 report was ""fatally flawed."" It undercounted immigrants’ tax revenues, inflated the number of immigrants in the country illegally, counted millions of U.S. citizens as illegally in the United States, and used a method of estimating fiscal costs ""that is rejected by all economists who work on this subject,"" he said. Without precise data on the unauthorized immigrant population, researchers typically draw inferences about characteristics based on responses to surveys that don’t ask about authorization status. Trump claimed that a $25 billion border wall would pay itself in two months, under a scenario where illegal immigration costs $250 billion a year. There are obvious problems with the numbers. And overall, the total cost of a complete border wall is unclear. But the real problem is the comparison of one-time construction costs of a border wall to annual costs of net government benefits paid in excess of taxes received. ""Building a wall doesn’t magically remove unauthorized immigrants already in the country,"" said Ryan D. Edwards, a research associate at the Berkeley Population Center and a curriculum coordinator in UC Berkeley's Division of Data Sciences, in an email. ""Only deportations do."" Trump's claim also overlooks the complexities of congressional appropriations and the reasons why many Democrats are hesitant to fund the wall. Democrats say the wall is too costly. They also say there are other ways to secure the border, including the use of technology surveillance and more border patrol agents. A February 2017 study from the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels, analyzed data from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The study considered data related to the likely education level of future immigrants crossing the border illegally and their estimated fiscal impact. ""If a border wall prevented 160,000 to 200,000 illegal crossings (excluding descendants) in the next 10 years, it would be enough to pay for the estimated $12 to $15 billion costs of the wall,"" the analysis said. The projected savings are based on an average lifetime fiscal burden of almost $75,000 for someone who crossed illegally, but not their U.S.-born children. Some caveats noted by the analysis: • The population of immigrants in the United States illegally includes people who overstay a visa; and a southern border wall would not address this issue. • A large share of the net fiscal costs of illegal immigration is at the state and local levels, yet building a border wall would be a federal cost. It’s also worth noting that some of the federal costs included in some estimates for illegal immigration include expenditures tied to education and health care — it’s uncertain whether those specifics funds would be diverted to pay for the border wall. Trump tweeted, ""Our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months."" The White House did not provide data or any other information backing Trump’s assessment. Several economics and immigration experts said they were unaware of any report stating that $250 billion figure. It’s difficult to peg an exact cost of illegal immigration, but even high estimates are significantly lower. Trump’s claim that a $25 billion border wall would pay for itself in two months isn’t supported by the facts, either. Trump’s claim is inaccurate.

Claims over a 'small cell technology' economic boom partly on track
","Caleb Rowden had an excellent November, having been selected by his fellow Republicans as Missouri Senate majority leader. Given his elevated role in the Missouri General Assembly, we thought it was a good time to look at his recent priorities. Rowden sent out his annual legislative mailer that listed four bills under the major legislative achievement section. House Bill 1991, also known as the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act, was among them. In the mailer, he claims that HB 1991, which passed last legislative session, ""is expected to create more than 20,000 jobs and attract $2 billion in capital investment, resulting in nearly $4 billion in economic growth over the next few years."" PolitiFact can't predict the future, but we wanted to check out whether his numbers matched analysts' expectations. His source appears to be the wireless communications industry itself. As wireless technology progresses toward mobile fifth generation (5G) technology, the infrastructure needed to use those systems has progressed as well. Berkeley Teate, public affairs specialist for the National Conference of State Legislatures, gave us the group's latest information on how small cell technology works. ""Small cells, which generate less power, collect and transmit the signals in a short range from one another,"" according to the NCSL’s latest Mobile 5G and Small Cell Legislation information article. But to actually use this technology, the small cells must be spread by wireless and telecom companies across communities in Missouri and throughout the United States. These cells are usually attached to existing structures, such as road-side utility poles. The bill, which was signed into law on June 1, updates the laws associated with wireless infrastructure in Missouri that will make it possible for small cells to be installed. It establishes specific provisions on how communities and wireless communication providers can work together to bring 5G wireless to their communities. Much of that infrastructure will begin taking shape in the upcoming year. We reached out to Rowden, whose team pointed us to a 2017 study from Accenture that estimates the economic impact of total 5G deployment in cities across Missouri and the United States. Jilane Rodgers Petrie, director of public affairs for CTIA, a wireless trade organization that commissioned the study from Accenture, told us that the study does not assess states as a whole, but rather looks at cities in terms of estimated network investment, estimated GDP growth and estimated jobs from benefits of using 5G. Fifty cities in Missouri were chosen, including Kansas City and St. Louis. Petrie told us that although the formula uses cities, and not an entire state, it is possible to estimate the benefit to Missouri by adding together the 50 cities studied. When added together, the sum more-or-less lines up with Rowden’s claim. Network investment, or ""capital investment,"" as Rowden calls it, comes out to $2.097 billion, slightly higher than his own claim. Estimated GDP growth is $3.888 billion, a shade under his claim of $4 billion of economic growth. Job creation is estimated at 23,841 jobs, nearly 4,000 over his own claim. Doug Brake, director of broadband and spectrum policy for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told us that these numbers seem to be on the optimistic side of what is possible from this type of legislation, but aren’t out of the realm of possibility. He did caution, however, that the numbers in the study are estimates based on all the benefits of 5G deployment, such as smart grids, transportation optimization and infrastructure monitoring, not just small cell deployment itself. ""The small cell bill improves the conditions to bring that deployment to fruition, but the two are not the same,"" he said. The study's total numbers do show a positive outlook similar to Missouri's across the U.S. There is an expected network investment total of roughly $275 billion and an expected economic growth of $500 billion from 5G deployment. The effects vary widely by state, however, depending on their current wireless infrastructure and related legislation. Caleb Rowden said that ""the small cell bill is expected to create more than 20,000 jobs and attract $2 billion in capital investment, resulting in nearly $4 billion in economic growth over the next few years."" Rowden is relying on estimated numbers of 50 cities in Missouri to give an outlook of the state in relation to total 5G deployment, not just small cell legislation. Rowden’s numbers are mostly accurate to the study, however, it goes beyond his claim to look at the benefits of 5G deployment as a whole, and not just the deployment of small cells. Essentially, the bill opens the possibility for more than 20,000 jobs, $2 billion in capital investment and $4 billion in economic growth, but won't be the sole cause of it. For those reasons, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2018/dec/05/caleb-rowden/claims-over-small-cell-technology-economic-boom-pa/

Christmas controversy: The Obamas never removed the White House nativity scene
","It’s the most wonderful time of the year — to spread misinformation. The holiday season brings out a lot of good, but it is also a prime time to resurface old rumors, embellishments and hoaxes. One example is a claim about the Obama administration’s war on a White House nativity scene. Social media posts (like this one) claim the Obamas removed the nativity scene, but it’s ""back in the White House thanks to First Lady Melania Trump."" The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The posts are not true: The holy family display has been showcased in the East Room — without interruption — since it was donated to the White House in the 1960s. Here’s how we know. The 47 figures of the nativity scene, known as the White House crèche, are made of carved wood and terra cotta and were created in Naples, Italy, in the late 18th century, according to White House archives. The crèche was donated to the White House by philanthropist Jane Engelhard in 1967, and it has been displayed every Christmas since then.   In 1978, Engelhard donated 10 additional figures and funds for a new tableau, which was first displayed in 1999. The rumor of the Obamas ""banning"" the famous nativity scene is seemingly brought back to life every Christmas season, despite being continuously debunked. The rumor is said to have started back in 2009, during Obama’s first year in office. The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was considering a ""non-religious"" Christmas at the White House, which included a thought of whether to display the crèche. In the end, tradition won out, and the crèche was placed in its usual spot. In 2015, an Obama White House press release also touted the crèche as a ""long-standing holiday tradition.""

"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
Terry McAuliffe is mostly right about his jobs record
","Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, considering a 2020 run for president, is lauding his record as a job creator. ""Every single city and county in Virginia, their unemployment dropped, and in most of the rural communities, it dropped by over 50 percent,"" McAuliffe, a Democrat, said about his term as governor from 2014 to 2018. His comment came during a Nov. 28 radio interview on The John Fredericks Show in Portsmouth. McAuliffe was governor during a prosperous time. The United States had shaken the Great Depression and was well advanced in what’s become a 113-month economic expansion.   Sill, we wondered whether McAuliffe’s statement is correct. Our fact-checking required two determinations: Did unemployment drop in every Virginia county and city during his term; and did it drop by more than half in most rural localities? Jake Rubenstein, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, said McAuliffe got his information from statistics kept by the Virginia Employment Commission. The VEC gets its data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is our go-to source for job numbers. Cities and counties The data shows that both the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed people dropped in all 95 Virginia counties and 38 cities during McAuliffe’s term. Virginia's unemployment rate was 5.7 percent when McAuliffe took office in January 2014 and sank to 3.3 percent during his last full month as governor in December 2017. During the same span, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped from 7 percent to 3.9 percent. Virginia had the 14th lowest unemployment rate among states and the District of Columbia when McAuliffe took office. It ranked 16th in the nation when he left. The number of unemployed Virginians fell from almost 240,000 to about 143,000 during McAuliffe’s term - a 40 percent decrease. The number of unemployed people in the U.S. dropped from almost 10.9 million to almost 6.3 million during the same time - a 42 percent decrease. Rural areas To define rural areas in the state, we relied on a map posted by the Virginia Department Health that identifies rural counties and towns. We used two measures to examine McAuliffe’s corollary claim - that unemployment fell by 50 percent in most rural communities. Rubenstein sent us a list of unemployment rates in all Virginia cities and counties at the start and end of McAuliffe’s term. Only one rural locality - Galax - saw its unemployment rate drop by more than half. ""Many of the other (rural jurisdictions) were close to 50 percent…"" Rubenstein wrote. Not quite. Just nine rural localities, including Galax, saw their rates drop by 40 percent or more. Because McAuliffe never said in his statement that he was specifically referring to the unemployment rate, we also checked whether the raw number of unemployed people had dropped by more than 50 percent in most rural areas. Again, McAuliffe fell short. Ten of the 50 cities and counties saw their number of unemployed residents halved during McAuliffe’s term. But many came close under this measurement. If McAuliffe had said most rural communities saw their number of unemployed residents fall by 45 percent during his term, he would have been correct. Final note PolitiFact puts a caveat on fact-checks about employment numbers. Although presidents, governors and mayors love to take credit for good numbers, economists generally say politicians have only marginal effect on the numbers. The economy, they say, ebbs and flows with global trends over which politicians have little control. While unemployment significantly fell during McAuliffe’s years, the decreases were about average compared to other states. Our ruling McAuliffe said that during his term as governor, ""Every single city and county in Virginia, their unemployment dropped, and in most of the rural communities, it dropped more than 50 percent."" He’s right on the first part; every Virginia locality did experience decreases in unemployment. McAuliffe governed during boom years, and every state saw steep a drop in unemployment. The second part of his statement, that most rural communities saw a 50 percent fall in unemployment, comes up a little short. If McAuliffe had said most rural localities had seen a 45 percent drop in their number of unemployed people, he would have been correct. Recognizing that governors have little impact on the economy, we rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/dec/04/terry-mcauliffe/terry-mcauliffe-mostly-right-about-his-jobs-record/

NC GOP misleads about NC election fraud investigation
","The North Carolina elections board is investigating voting irregularities in the congressional race between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready. The race was expected to be among the closest in the country and unofficial results put Harris ahead of McCready by 905 votes. But the N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement on Nov. 30 declined to certify those results after the legitimacy of some ballots from Bladen County area were called into question. The N.C. Republican Party has urged the elections board to certify the results, despite the fact that the board’s investigation isn’t complete. ""The reality is that there aren’t enough ballots in question to change the outcome of this election,"" the NC GOP said in an email to media outlets on Dec. 2. Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, made the same claim in a press conference on Dec. 1. ""It is mathematically impossible for there to be enough mail-in ballots that can be in question in Bladen County to turn this race,"" Woodhouse said. His remarks can be found around the 11:45 mark of this WRAL video. Is it true there aren’t enough ballots in question to change the outcome of the election? ""In Bladen County, there were only 569 unreturned absentee mail-in ballots,"" Woodhouse said in an e-mail to PolitFact on Monday night. ""Moreover, 175 of these voters actually cast a ballot by another method. This leaves only 394 truly unreturned ballots in Bladen County, certainly not enough ballots to change the result of the election with a margin of 905 votes."" Woodhouse has a point that there’s a gap between the number of absentee-by-mail votes in Bladen County (an unofficial total of 684 for all candidates, combined) and the 905 total votes by which McCready trails Harris. However, the NC GOP claim gives the misleading impression that the mail-in ballots counted in Bladen County are the only ones in question by the NC elections board. That’s not the case. What the elections board has said Woodhouse has criticized the lack of transparency around the investigation, and he’s right that the NC elections board has revealed little about the case in the 9th Congressional District, which runs from Charlotte eastward past Fayetteville along the South Carolina border. The board has released two public statements about the investigation. On Nov. 27, the board announced in a statement that it wasn’t certifying the results. ""In his motion, Board Vice Chairman Joshua Malcolm cited the Board’s authority under G.S. 163A-1180 as the reason for delaying certification of that contest,"" the statement says. ""That statute gives the Board the authority to ‘take any other action necessary to assure that an election is determined without taint of fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed the result of an election.’ "" Then, on Nov. 30, the board announced its intention to hold a public evidentiary hearing into claims of ""irregularities and fraudulent activities related to absentee by-mail voting and potentially other matters in the 9th Congressional District contest."" The NC elections board cited the Bladen irregularities as a reason for not certifying the Harris-McCready contest results, but the statement didn’t say investigators would limit their review to that county alone. The elections board hasn’t publicly disclosed: Questions remain not only about mail-in ballots that were returned and counted, but also about ballots that were requested but never returned. First, let’s look at the mail-in ballots that were counted. Unusual voting trends Eight counties are wholly or partly included in the district and Bladen was the only county in the district in which Harris had more mail-in support than McCready. (Unofficial results can be found on the NC elections board website.) In six of the counties, fewer than 3 percent of total votes were absentee-by-mail ballots, according to a FiveThirtyEight news analysis of NC elections board data. ""But in Bladen County, that number was 7.3 percent, suggesting a push to get people there to vote by mail,"" FiveThirtyEight reported. Harris won 61 percent of the votes from mail-in ballots in Bladen County — even though registered Republicans accounted for only 19 percent of the county’s accepted absentee ballots, an independent analysis by Catawba College political scientist Michael Bitzer showed. Harris’s Bladen County support stands out from the Republican primary, too. In May, Harris beat incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger by 828 votes and was aided by a 400-vote advantage by absentee by-mail ballots in Bladen County. That figure is more than double the mail-in total in most other 9th District counties. And Bladen was the only county where Harris had a substantial absentee by-mail advantage over Pittenger. Back to the general election. Bladen County had the highest percentage of absentee ballot requests in the state, according to the Charlotte Observer. However, the number of unreturned ballots have raised eyebrows. Unreturned ballots On average, about 16 percent of registered voters who request mail-in ballots never return them, according to Bitzer. In the Harris-McCready district, the non-return rate was 24 percent. In Bladen County alone, 40 percent of the requested mail-in ballots were never returned. And in neighboring Robeson County, 60 percent were never returned, according to a News & Observer review. The N&O found that the unreturned ballots are disproportionately associated with minority voters. In terms of actual votes, Bitzer reported that 495 ballots were requested but never returned in Bladen and 1,180 were requested but never returned in Robeson. As FiveThirtyEight noted, Robeson had more unreturned ballots than Mecklenburg County (home to Charlotte) despite Mecklenburg casting three times as many total votes as Robeson. It’s certainly possible that some people requested ballots and then lost their ballot or moved or forgot to vote. The elections board is likely to review the situation. Steve Stone, chairman of the Robeson County Board of Elections, told The Washington Post that state investigators have requested information the county board kept on an unusual number of absentee ballot requests. County residents reported to the Robeson board that people were going door-to-door telling voters that their registrations had been dropped and they needed to re-register, Stone told the Post. It’s illegal to take someone else’s mail-in ballot and turn it in unless you’re related to them. Yet, a few voters filed affidavits with the NC board of elections stating that they were approached in their homes by someone claiming to be a ballot collector. Much to be determined Monday night, NC elections board spokesman Pat Gannon emailed PolitiFact to clarify the scope of the investigation. ""The easy answer is that the scope is absentee voting irregularities in the 9th CD,"" Gannon’s email said. ""Investigators will go where the evidence takes them, including ballots not returned. We don’t know whether there are enough ballots in question. That’s part of what the investigation is trying to determine."" Ultimately, the exact number of altered votes and destroyed ballots may be irrelevant, according to Bitzer and Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly and longtime legislative staffer. In separate emails to PolitiFact, they pointed to NC General Statutes Section 163A-1181 with regards to ""New elections."" The law says the state elections board can order a new election by majority vote if ""irregularities or improprieties occurred to such an extent that they taint the results of the entire election and cast doubt on its fairness."" Our ruling The NC GOP says ""there aren’t enough ballots in question to change the outcome of this election."" There’s a gap between the number of mail-in votes cast in Bladen County (684) and the 905 votes by which McCready trails Harris. But it’s possible -- if not likely -- that the NC elections board is examining more than just the absentee-by-mail ballots that were cast. The board hasn’t publicly defined the scope of its investigation. Investigators could be examining the 684 mail-votes from Bladen County, the 680 mail-in votes from Robeson County, as well as the combined 1,675 mail-in ballots that weren’t returned from either county. The N.C. GOP hasn’t presented evidence to prove that the NC elections board is focusing solely on the mail-in ballots that were already counted in Bladen County. In fact, they’ve criticized the board for lacking transparency. We believe Woodhouse and the NC GOP’s claim meets the definition of a Mostly False claim: it contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2018/dec/04/north-carolina-republican-party/nc-gop-misleads-about-nc-election-fraud-investigat/

Wisconsin Republicans gave GOP governor more power, but that's changing with new Dem governor
","The November 2018 election means there will be a partisan changing of the guard in the Wisconsin governor’s office -- Republican Scott Walker out, Democrat Tony Evers in. The election results led to a changing of the minds among GOP leaders in the Legislature, where Republicans will continue to hold power in the new term. Republican leaders are moving quickly to undo some of the powers they granted the governor after the 2010 election, when Walker won and the GOP gained full control of the Legislature. How quickly? The package was formally introduced late on Nov. 30, a Friday. The committee vote was scheduled for Monday, Dec. 3. The Senate and Assembly could vote as early as Tuesday, Dec. 4, sending the matters to Walker for his signature. The discussion of possible changes began a single day after Walker lost his bid for a third term. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said he would discuss whether to look at limiting Evers' power with Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. That prompted us to dust off the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to examine views on particular issues. Requisite footnote: We’re not rating whether any change is good politics or good policy. Just whether the individual -- or in the case, the GOP leadership -- has been consistent. In a word: No. Changes made in 2011 There were a host of changes made after the 2010 election that vested more power in the governor’s office. Some were arcane and procedural, but had a major impact. Consider Act 21. It gave the governor new powers to approve or prevent the adoption of administrative rules. Previously, the rules were written by state agencies and reviewed by the Legislature before they could take effect. Administrative rules include more specifics than state statutes and carry the force of law. The bill was introduced by the Joint Committee on Organization at the request of Walker and former state Rep. Thomas Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst. Tiffany is now in the Senate. Why was it necessary? ""Now, when a rule comes out of an agency, the Governor must approve the rule,"" Tiffany said in a March 3, 2011, e-newsletter. ""We are making the Governor take responsibility for his agencies."" Changes proposed in 2018 Now, following the defeat of Walker in the Nov. 6 election, Republicans have proposed legislation that would reverse the 2011 law. The change is one of many included in the package of legislation Republican lawmakers have laid out for the so-called ""lame-duck"" session. Several others would limit the power of Evers and Josh Kaul, the Democrat who defeated Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel. One provision could allow Republican lawmakers to prevent the state from getting out of a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, something Evers has promised to do. Another provision would require Evers to get permission from lawmakers to ban guns in the state Capitol or make other changes to security provisions there — including increasing the number of police officers who patrol the statehouse. The administration would also be required to report if the governor pardons anyone or his aides release anyone from prison early. The legislation would also restrict Evers' power over rules used to implement state laws and limit his flexibility in how he runs many public benefits programs. Their plan would provide more legislative authority over state agencies. And it would require Evers to go along with a plan aimed at reducing premiums for insurance plans offered through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces for individuals. ""I view this as a repudiation of the last election. I will take any steps possible to assure the people of Wisconsin that I will not invalidate those votes,"" Evers told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview. Republican legislative leaders say the plan will re-balance power between the legislative and executive branches. GOP leaders also said the plan prevents Evers from undoing laws passed under Republican control. ""Maybe we made some mistakes giving too much power to Gov. Walker and I'd be open to looking at that to see if there are areas we should change that,"" Vos told reporters a day after the general election. ""The manufactured outrage by the Democrats right now is hilarious,"" Fitzgerald told WISN's conservative radio host Jay Weber in a Dec. 3 interview. ""I mean, most of these items are things (that) we never really had to kind of address because guess what — we trusted Scott Walker and the administration to be able to manage the back and forth with the Legislature. ""We don’t trust Tony Evers right now in a lot of these areas."" Our rating In this case, the change of position is clear. In 2011, the Legislature moved to give the governor more authority. In 2018, they are doing the reverse. That’s a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2018/dec/03/wisconsin-republican-legislative-leaders/wisconsin-republicans-gave-gop-governor-more-power/

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrong on scale of Pentagon accounting errors
","  Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is one of Congress’ most ardent supporters of Medicare for All, the Democratic proposal to expand Medicare to all ages in order to create a government-funded health insurance system for all Americans. In a tweet, Ocasio-Cortez compared the scale of Pentagon waste to the price tag for Medicare for All, which a study by the free-market Mercatus Institute said would cost $32 trillion over 10 years. This fact-check will focus on her point about Pentagon spending. It is important to note that the $32 trillion Medicare figure she cited is based on one group’s estimate using assumptions about how the proposal would affect current rates of spending; it is not an official cost figure. On Dec. 2, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a screenshot from an article in the Nation, a left-leaning magazine, along with the following comment: ""$21 TRILLION of Pentagon financial transactions ‘could not be traced, documented, or explained.’ $21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs ~$32T. That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon. And that’s before our premiums."" $21 TRILLION of Pentagon financial transactions “could not be traced, documented, or explained.”$21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs ~$32T.That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon.And that’s before our premiums. https://t.co/soT6GSmDSG Observers quickly pounced on the tweet, saying that Ocasio-Cortez was misreading the Nation article. So we took a closer look. The Nov. 27 Nation article addressed a historical pattern of accounting discrepancies at the Pentagon. The portion that Ocasio-Cortez highlighted in her tweet referenced research by Mark Skidmore, a professor of economics at Michigan State University. Citing Skidmore’s research, the story said ""in all, at least a mind-boggling $21 trillion of Pentagon financial transactions between 1998 and 2015 could not be traced, documented, or explained."" The problem with what Ocasio-Cortez said: The $21 trillion figure refers to a cumulative amount of individual transactions — including some double- and triple-counting — not a single pot of money that was misspent. One tip-off is the amount of Ocasio-Cortez’s ""accounting errors"" is far bigger than the actual Pentagon spending from 1998 to 2015, which was $8.5 trillion. In fact, it’s also far bigger than the amount the government has spent on national security since 1940 and, in all likelihood, in the nation’s history. Here’s a chart we assembled showing national-security spending by the federal government from 1940 to today. Ocasio-Cortez’s $21 trillion estimate exceeds the entirety of national-security spending since 1940, which checks in around $17.8 trillion. And while full data back to 1776 doesn’t exist, prorating backwards for another 164 years would almost certainly not add enough to make the total $21 trillion.   So what did Ocasio-Cortez get wrong? The $21 trillion figure tallies up internal financial transfers that would not pass muster in an audit; the same dollar can be included in multiple transactions, which is why Ocasio-Cortez’s figure exceeds all Pentagon spending. This misunderstanding renders the Medicare for All comparison inaccurate, experts said. Although he’s a longstanding critic of Pentagon waste, Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Ocasio-Cortez had dramatically inflated the scale of the problem. ""One dollar involved in 10 transactions is not 10 dollars,"" Ellis said. ""There is a lot to cut and a lot of waste at the Pentagon, and I have unapologetically said so. But simple math demonstrates that the Pentagon did not get anywhere near that amount of cash, averaging more than $1 trillion per year, much less lost track of anywhere near that amount of money."" Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed. The $21 trillion figure ""double- and triple-counts funding that was transferred internally within the Defense Department,"" Harrison said. ""And just because a transaction cannot be fully traced and documented does not mean it was fraudulent or wasted. It just means the Pentagon has not been able to pass an audit, which we already knew."" Just to be sure, we checked with the author of the Nation article, Dave Lindorff. ""She's wrong,"" he said. Lindorff said his findings suggest large-scale sloppiness in accounting and potentially deliberate obfuscation to deter congressional oversight — but not a fixed budgetary amount that could have theoretically been applied to other uses. While some of the $21 trillion may be real expenditures, Lindorff said, ""clearly most of it is simply fictitious numbers designed to obfuscate the accounting and keep the Pentagon accounting from being seriously monitored. It would be wrong to suggest that that is real money that could have been used to fund something else more useful to society."" It's also worth noting that the Nation article and the Mercatus study refer to different time periods, said Ben Tomchik, deputy chief of staff at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Nation's figure refers to 18 years — twice as long as the Mercatus study's 10-year period. Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not respond to an inquiry. As of publication, the tweet remained up, appended only with a quote from the Nation article: ""DoD has literally been making up numbers in its reports to Congress— knowing that Congress would rely on those reports when deciding how much to give the following year."" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, ""$21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs ~$32T. That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon."" The comparison is specious. In fact, the data suggests that the Pentagon hasn’t spent $21 trillion in the entire history of the United States. Rather, the $21 trillion figure refers to a collection of transactions in which the same dollar could have been transferred between internal accounts multiple times. As such, it’s comparing apples and oranges to say that ""Pentagon accounting errors"" would have been equivalent to two-thirds of Medicare for All’s projected 10-year costs.

No, red trees don't symbolize blood of Jesus and the resurrection
","Red trees lining a hall of the White House sparked a flurry of memes shortly after the White House unveiled the Christmas decorations. Pushing back against comparisons to The Handmaid’s Tale and ""blood trees,"" some people on social media defended the choice of red trees on religious grounds.   The @WhiteHouse is sparkling for the Christmas season! pic.twitter.com/ncNhlkZAWl   ""Red trees are significant to the early Christian church. In eastern Europe, the church would dye the trees red to symbolize the blood of Jesus & the resurrection,"" said one viral post. Readers asked PolitiFact if it was true that red trees represent the blood of Jesus and the resurrection, tying back to an eastern European tradition. It’s not true. Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism are the most prevalent religious affiliations in Central and Eastern Europe, and Orthodox Christians make up the majority in the region, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. Several religious and history scholars and a representative for the Orthodox Church in America told PolitiFact that the meme’s claim is inaccurate. ""I know of no custom among Orthodox Christians (or Roman Catholics and Protestants) anywhere that calls for dyeing Christmas trees red to signify the blood of Christ and the Resurrection,"" said Father John Matusiak, web editor for the Orthodox Church in America. The Orthodox Church in America traces its origins to the 1794 arrival in Alaska of eight Orthodox missionaries from a northern region of Russia. Matusiak said there is a custom of dyeing boiled eggs red for distribution on Holy Pascha (Easter), but that doesn’t extend to Christmas trees. ""Obviously the author of the post was confusing the egg custom associated with Pascha and Christmas trees,"" Matusiak said. Nadieszda Kizenko, a history professor and chair of the history department at the University at Albany, said she’s never heard of red trees being significant to the early Christian church. Several other scholars agreed with Kizenko and also said the meme is likely conflating the well-known tradition of dyeing eggs red with western Christmas traditions. ""I know of absolutely no early Christian tradition that used trees of any kind to celebrate Christmas,"" said George E. Demacopoulos, a theology professor and co-director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center of Fordham University. ""The Christmas tree is a much later, Western European tradition, only recently imported into the Christian East,"" Demacopoulos added. The White House in its statement about the Christmas decorations also did not mention any reference to an eastern Europe Christian tradition. The choice of red in Christmas decorations at the White House ""is an extension of the pales, or stripes, found in the presidential seal designed by our Founding Fathers. It’s a symbol of valor and bravery,"" the White House said. Finally, and we're not sure if this what the author of the post was going for, but first lady Melania Trump was born in Slovenia, which is in south central Europe, not eastern Europe. Referring to red Christmas trees at the White House, a meme claimed, ""Red trees are significant to the early Christian church. In eastern Europe, the church would dye the trees red to symbolize the blood of Jesus & the resurrection."" Several experts told us that’s not true.

Did California's border closure cost $5.3M in economic loss? Are 'billions’ at stake?
","During a recent visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, California’s Democratic Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom claimed the Trump administration’s temporary border closure last month cost $5.3 million in economic loss in the area and that future shutdowns could run into the billions of dollars. U.S. border officials on Nov. 25 stopped all traffic for several hours at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, which serves as the gateway between Tijuana and San Diego. It’s the busiest land border crossing in the United States and among the busiest in the world. The six-hour shutdown happened as migrants from Central America protested just south of the crossing. A group later rushed a border fence and were met with tear gas fired by U.S. border agents, who said some threw rocks at them.   Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement the same day that her agency ""will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons,"" and would ""not tolerate this type of lawlessness."" Days after the closure, here’s what Newsom claimed at a press conference held near the San Ysidro crossing: ""Every time, with respect, that there is a flippant comment about shutting down the border, it impacts the economy and the lives of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people that are reliant on that trade and commerce on a daily basis. … [There was] an estimated $5.3 million of economic loss just for a few hours of shutting down the border."" ""You’re talking about millions and millions of dollars — billions of dollars — of economic consequence, if we continue with this rhetoric around shutting down the border without considering what that means."" As the debate over the shutdown lingers, we wanted to know whether Newsom got his figures right about its economic impact. We set out on a fact check. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents attend operational readiness exercises at the San Ysidro port of entry on the U.S.-Mexico border in November 2018. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) Our research  An average of 90,000 people legally pass north through the San Ysidro crossing each day, 70,000 in cars and 20,000 by foot. Many work, go to school or shop in the community of San Ysidro, which is the southernmost portion of San Diego, and points north, serving as an economic engine for the region. California’s other border crossings include Otay Mesa, about 11 miles east, along with Tecate, an hour’s drive east, and two in Calexico in Imperial County. For the specific dollar loss from the Nov. 25 closure, Newsom appears to have relied on an estimate from Jason Wells, executive director of the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce. In an interview with PolitiFact California, Wells said the $5.3 million loss figure is an estimate based on an average day of sales for the 650 businesses in the area during the Nov. 20 to Jan. 6 holiday period. The area is home to outlet malls, money exchanges and many immigration and tax services, all a short distance from the border. Wells said it draws between 97 and 99 percent of its customers from Mexico. The threat of violence at the border led owners of The Las Americas Premium Outlets, a shopping center next to the port of entry, for example, to shut down the mall that day. Wells said some businesses in the area believe the $5.3 million figure is conservative, given the shutdown happened the Sunday after Black Friday. He added that approximately 75 percent of the area’s businesses closed within about 90 minutes of the 11:30 a.m. closure of the border crossing. ""Just in that one Sunday alone, because of the Christmas and holiday season and so forth, we lost $5.3 million. Just in that one day,"" Wells added on the San Diego Union-Tribune’s podcast, The Conversation. ""Tijuana itself lost another $6.9 million. So, just between Tijuana and San Ysidro [there] was $12.2 million lost in one day. And that’s not even counting Chula Vista, National City, San Diego, LA, all those areas that were affected by the closure."" Lynn Reaser, chief economist at San Diego’s Point Loma Nazarene University, said at least some of the economic loss was probably recovered. ""At this point, the impact on San Ysidro may have been primarily temporary during the relatively brief stoppage,"" Reaser said in an email. ""Shoppers appeared to have returned to stores at the Las Americas Premium Outlet, which means that sales could have been primarily delayed. Of course, if border closings start recurring, the picture could become much more grave."" Wells said its ""our hope and prayers"" that the $5.3 million was made up by shoppers who returned to San Ysidro. Newsom didn’t say anything about the potential recovery of this loss, but was generally on the mark. We also examined his claim that future shutdowns could cause ""billions,"" a figure that’s a bit more difficult to assess. ‘Billions in losses’? Extended border closings and delays could mount to billions of dollars in economic losses over the coming months, Paola Avila, a vice president at the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, told Bloomberg in a recent article. ""The uncertainty of border closures occurring at any time is a substantial economic threat for our region,"" she said. ""Our economies are inextricably linked. We produce together, we work together, we have families together, we have an integrated supply chain worth $2.5 billion."" Jerry Sanders, the former Republican mayor of San Diego and current head of the city’s regional Chamber of Commerce, echoed those sentiments in a New York Times article. ""If people are staying home because they are worried, the economic impact is obviously huge — we have 73 million crossings a year and we know that the region’s $255 billion gross regional product depends on cross-border commerce,"" Sanders told the paper. Newsom’s spokesman said the news reports supported the claim. Our ruling  California Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom claimed there was an estimated $5.3 million in economic loss from the temporary closure of the San Ysidro border crossing that separates San Diego and Tijuana on Nov. 25. He added ""billions of dollars"" are potentially at stake should future closures take place. Newsom’s $5.3 million figure was supported by the head of the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce, which represents hundreds of businesses on the U.S. side of the border. A leading economist in the region said San Ysidro is likely to recover at least some of that loss when shoppers who delayed their visits return, as long as there aren’t additional border closures. Newsom can also point to warnings from business groups about ""billions of dollars"" potentially being lost in future shutdowns. San Diego’s regional chamber of commerce, including the city’s former Republican mayor, said future closures could threaten the billions of dollars in economic activity that flows through the international gateway. This portion of Newsom’s claim, however, assumes a worst-case scenario of a prolonged weeks- or months-long closure. While President Trump has threatened to close the border, there’s been no evidence that his administration is seeking an extended shutdown. We found Newsom’s overall statement was accurate but could use some clarifications. We rated it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",/factchecks/2018/dec/03/gavin-newsom/did-californias-border-closure-cost-53m-economic-l/

How much does the US depend on imports for key minerals?
","Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., raised concern about the United States' dependence on foreign countries for mineral needs in an opinion-editorial this fall. Manchin wrote an op-ed with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, that was published in the Parkersburg News and Sentinel on Oct. 14, 2018. The op-ed touts several bipartisan efforts by Manchin and Murkowski on national energy policy. In a section detailing a joint amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that the senators submitted this year, Manchin and Murkowski wrote that ""we import 50 percent of at least 50 mineral commodities each year, including 100 percent of 21 of them."" Is that correct? We were able to trace Manchin’s claim back to a report published by the U.S. Geological Survey published in January 2018. The report includes figures showing how much the United States relies on imports for individual commodities and where these imports come from. This report, published annually, notes that in 2017, ""imports made up more than one-half of the U.S. apparent consumption for 50 nonfuel mineral commodities, and the United States was 100 percent import-reliant for 21 of those."" Here’s a chart from the report summarizing the critical minerals, the percentage of imports, and the countries of origin.  The chart confirms that for 50 minerals, at least half are imported, and for 21, the U.S. supply is entirely imported. Some of the commodities that the U.S. most heavily imports include arsenic, asbestos, and gemstones. China and Canada were the heaviest suppliers of mineral commodities to the United States in 2017, the report said.  We found only one thing to quibble about the statement. Manchin and Murkowski would have been more accurate if they had put the phrase ""at least"" in a different place, by writing that the United States imports ""at least 50 percent of 50 mineral commodities each year, including 100 percent of 21 of them."" In his joint op-ed with Murkowski, Manchin wrote that the United States imports ""50 percent of at least 50 mineral commodities each year, including 100 percent of 21 of them."" The point is well-taken, though the language is a bit garbled. It’s actually ""at least 50 percent of 50 mineral commodities.""

Are Chicago residents among the nation's most taxed?
","Lori Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor vying to become Chicago’s next mayor, has repeatedly argued that high taxes are driving lower income families out of the city. In May, she made a claim that we rated Mostly False about population loss in the Chicago metro area, which she dubiously attributed to the tax burden those residents face. Recently, Lightfoot expanded on her crushing tax burden message with a national comparison. ""We live in one of the most taxed cities and the most taxed county, unfortunately, in the country,"" she said at a debate in November. ""And low-income families and individuals and working families have shouldered far too great a burden because our tax system, our levies and fees, have been completely regressive."" It’s common practice for office seekers to complain with a broad brush about tax burdens. But such sweeping statements often oversimplify the issue. Lightfoot’s claim, it turns out, is no exception. Lightfoot said Chicagoans live in one of the most taxed cities and the most taxed county, but what she appears to have meant was that Chicago residents are the most taxed because they have to pay high Cook County taxes on top of high city levies. ""Taxes and fees in Chicago and Cook County are forcing low-income families like the one I grew up in out of this city,"" Lightfoot said in a statement emailed to us by her campaign. ""It’s clear we can’t keep treating low-income and middle-class families like an ATM machine with no limit."" To back that up, Lightfoot pointed to more than 300 different fees the city can impose on residents, hefty property taxes and a combined sales tax rate of 10.25 percent on most retail purchases in the city. But ranking tax burdens is a far more complex exercise than Lightfoot seems to suggest. Take that Chicago sales tax rate, which indeed is one of the highest in the nation. What the number doesn’t take into account, however, is that Illinois, and by extension Chicago, applies the sales tax more narrowly than do many other places in the nation with lower rates. Here, few services are taxed. What’s more, purchases of groceries and drugs are taxed at a steep discount, meaning the high general rate alone doesn’t guarantee Chicagoans pay more in sales taxes. Ron Alt, a research economist with the Federation of Tax Administrators, said it’s important to account for both state and local taxes to accurately determine where people pay the most overall. Evaluating local taxes in a vacuum can be misleading, he said, because some states take on more of the cost of local functions than others, allowing municipalities to lower their taxes. Illinois is among the states that pick up less, leaving local property taxpayers to shoulder the lion’s share of public education costs, which contributes to higher local taxes here. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, added that Chicago should be judged against other large cities given the scope of its economy and the scale of public services it provides. He also stressed the need to evaluate which residents bear the heaviest burden in any given municipality. With those factors in mind, we turned to a report produced annually by the government of Washington, D.C. that analyzes the combined state and local tax burdens residents at five different income levels face in each state’s largest city as well as the nation’s capital. That analysis shows Lightfoot has a point — but only when it comes to low-income Chicagoans. A hypothetical Chicago family consisting of two working parents and one school-aged child earning $25,000 faces the fifth-highest tax burden among those 51 jurisdictions. A similar family earning $50,000, meanwhile, pays the 10th-most in major taxes. But as the income of Chicago taxpayers increases, their burden declines relative to that of similar earners in other large cities. Chicago families making $75,000 and $100,000 both pay the 16th-highest taxes, while families earning $150,000 rank 22nd among their counterparts. Compare that to New York, where lower income earners pay taxes that put them in the middle of the pack nationally, while families that earn more occupy the fifth-highest spot compared to their peers. But that may say more about state than city tax policy because tax deductions offered to New York state residents are far more generous than similar benefits for Illinois taxpayers. State constraints on the kind of taxes local governments can levy also play a role. Counties in Indiana, for instance, tack on local income taxes to the state rate, but the Illinois Constitution bars local income taxes. In Marion County, home to Indianapolis, the combined rate for individuals is 5.25 percent, higher than Illinois’ 4.95 percent income tax. That helps explain why the D.C tax study shows the burden on low-income families in Indianapolis is nearly as steep as in Chicago even though nominal tax rates in Indiana are considerably lower. ""It’s difficult because we want to assess the (local) policy makers on their policy choices, but all of these things work together,"" Auxier said. The D.C. analysis requires a few other disclaimers, but they don’t do much to advance Lightfoot’s case. The study uses tax rates in effect in 2016, before Illinois raised its flat income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent. Auxier, however, said that increase wouldn’t be likely to have a major effect on Chicago's rank. And while the report accounts for state and local income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes and auto taxes, it doesn’t cover the myriad fees Lightfoot referenced. The Urban Institute has found such charges account for a greater share of local government revenue on average than local sales and local income taxes combined, though the analysis doesn’t break costs down by particular cities. And it’s important to note that Lightfoot contended Chicagoans were among the most taxed, not that they paid the most in fees. Lightfoot said, ""we live in one of the most taxed cities and the most taxed county, unfortunately, in the country."" By that, she meant Chicagoans are among the most taxed because they pay high county and city taxes. It’s clear the tax burden in Chicago is punishingly regressive, taking a bigger bite out of the overall incomes of poorer residents than the wealthy. That’s a byproduct of not only local but state tax policy. So Lightfoot would have been correct had she claimed that low-income Chicagoans are some of the nation’s most taxed. And her broader comments do suggest those residents were the focus of her concern. Instead, she made a blanket statement that plays straight into a common but misleading narrative that all in Chicago pay punishingly high taxes. We rate her claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, there is no evidence that Vatican is funding migrant caravans
","A website called Puppet String News falsely claims there’s evidence that the Vatican is funding with cash caravans of migrants seeking entry into the United States. ""Evidence surfaces of Vatican funding caravans targeting America with cash,"" says a Nov. 25 post on puppestringnews.com. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Puppet String News’ story did not support its headline. The story links to an April post on National Review (another caravan was trekking toward the southern U.S. border around that time) arguing that U.S. churches aid ""immigration lawlessness"" and that Catholic groups have long sponsored and subsidized ""nation-sabotaging campaigns."" Puppet String News’ story highlights a section of the National Review’s post saying that the Vatican donated at least $20,000 in 2009 for a shelter in southern Mexico for Central Americans passing by as they head north. It also flagged another part of that post that said Catholic Extension, ""poured more than $12 million"" over the past five years into ministries along the southern U.S. border. ""We now have the very first piece of evidence that has pointed out Vatican money influencing the caravans, illegals, and the church groups along the border in America that help them. Time to sanction the Vatican!"" the Puppet String News post said. Puppet String News’ headline says the Vatican is paying caravan members cash. There’s no proof of that. The new ""evidence"" it cites is a months-old post talking about years-old actions. Catholic Extension builds churches across the United States and provides funding to under-resourced U.S. dioceses. Catholic Extension said it is not an arm of the Vatican. It is a nonprofit Catholic entity. Catholic Extension told PolitiFact that since its founding in 1905, its funds come from private donations and does not receive funding from the U.S. government, nor from the Vatican. ""Catholic Extension helps build churches and support core ministries in some of the poorest communities of our country and that includes the southern border region — one of the most densely Catholic areas of our country,"" Tom Gordon, Catholic Extension's chief operating officer said in a statement. Catholic Extension said that per its funding guidelines, the money it contributes to any U.S. Catholic diocese ""is individually negotiated with the local bishop in response to the pastoral needs that he identifies in his diocese, with the goal of helping strengthen these Catholic communities."" In July 2018, Catholic Extension said that it presented checks to Catholic ministries along the southern border that shelter, care and defend immigrants. (The organization said that a Texas shelter near the border gets calls from immigration officials asking it to take in paroled immigrants and asylum seekers.) Assistance from the Vatican or Catholic organizations to build or support shelters for immigrants is not equivalent to ""funding"" migrants. While migrants benefit from that aid, the headline on Puppet String News gives a misleading and false impression that the Vatican is giving them cash to migrate. The post also falsely claims that there’s ""proof of Soros supporting the caravan invasion."" That’s not true. We’ve rated as False several versions of that claim. Puppet String News’ About page said the website was created by a U.S. Navy veteran who ""decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability."" Puppet String News did not respond to PolitiFact queries sent to its Facebook and Twitter accounts. Its headline claiming ""evidence surfaces of Vatican funding caravans targeting America with cash,"" is inaccurate and misleading.

State Rep. Dale Kooyenga close on ranking but falters on 'everyone' has health care claim
","Editor's note, Dec. 4, 2018: This item has been updated to note that Wisconsin is the only state, among those who did not do the Obamacare expansion, without a so-called coverage gap. Both sides in the political divide have used health care as a major talking point, with heated arguments ranging from coverage of pre-existing conditions to Medicare for All proposals. Now, state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, has raised an issue that piqued the interest of PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""We have the number one health care system in the country,"" said Kooyenga, referring to the state of Wisconsin. ""Everyone in poverty now has health care."" Kooyenga’s comment came Nov. 7, 2018, on the ""Mark Belling Show"" on WISN-AM. The day before, Kooyenga had won the seat that Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir gave up to run unsuccessfully against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Let’s see what Kooyenga is talking about. The evidence When asked to provide backup for the claim, Kooyenga staffer Rachel Vander Wiele pointed to a Sept. 2, 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin item that rated a similar claim from Gov. Scott Walker. The claim: That even though Walker ""turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,"" because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history ""everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid."" We rated the statement Mostly True. The item noted that 145,000 people gained coverage as a result of the extra action. What’s more, Wisconsin is the only state among those that did not do the Obamacare expansion without a coverage gap, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks health-care-related matters. Vander Wiele also cited a Nov. 1, 2017, news item issued by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Medicine: ""Wisconsin has best health care quality in the nation, federal agency says."" The item noted that according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Wisconsin had the best health care quality in the nation, based on a ranking of 130 measures. Digging into the rankings It is true that Wisconsin was ranked No. 1 in 2017. But the information is outdated. In the latest such report, released in September 2018, Maine ranked first, with Wisconsin coming in fourth. Reasons cited for Wisconsin’s dip included a high rate of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for opioid-related conditions. Stephanie Marquis, vice president of communications for the Wisconsin Hospital Association, noted that the state has generally fared well in the AHRQ rankings -- first in the nation in 2006, 2008 and 2017 and second in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2015. Marquis also pointed out that the 2018 ranking was still tops among Midwestern states. Jon Dyck, supervising analyst at the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, said ranking the health care systems of states is a complicated issue. ""The results depend a great deal on what is being measured and how various measures are aggregated to derive a final score,"" Dyck said. ""Everyone in poverty now has health care"" According to the Kaiser Family Foundation more than two million poor, uninsured adults nationally fall into the ""coverage gap"" that results from state decisions not to expand Medicaid. That means their income is above current Medicaid eligibility, but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits. These individuals would be eligible for Medicaid had their state chosen to expand coverage. Because Wisconsin sets the income limit for Medicaid at the federal poverty level, does that mean that everyone under the poverty line has coverage?   There is a small wrinkle here. Remember: While Walker focused on people ""covered"" by Medicaid, as in eligible for it, Kooyenga stated ""Everyone in poverty now has health care.""   Dyck, of the state’s Legislative Fiscal Bureau, noted that while a person may meet financial requirements to enroll in Medicaid, there are other requirements that are not tied to finances. As an example, he cited a person who immigrates to the United States ""and resides in Wisconsin is generally not eligible for Medicaid until five years after entering the country, even if he or she becomes a naturalized citizen and meets the income eligibility standard."" Meanwhile, there are other sources that show there are people without insurance in the state. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 American Community Survey, an estimated 309,404 people out of a population of more than 5.7 million, or 5.4 percent, are uninsured. The Census Bureau also estimates about 60,000 residents under the federal poverty level are uninsured. Our rating Kooyenga said Wisconsin has ""the number one health care system in the country. Everyone in poverty now has health care."" The state did receive a top rating in 2017, but in a more recent rating by the same agency the state had slipped to number four. Meanwhile, changes under Walker mean that everyone in poverty (and somewhat above) is eligible for coverage under Medicaid. But clearly there are still residents who do not have insurance. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2018/nov/30/dale-kooyenga/state-rep-dale-kooyenga-close-ranking-falters-ever/

Nancy Pelosi wrong on legal debate over attorney general Matthew Whitaker
","Legal challenges to President Donald Trump’s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general are wending their way through the federal courts, with analysts and court watchers divided over how the high-stakes fight will shake out. Regardless of how the courts rule, though, some believe there’s already agreement across the political spectrum that Trump’s move violates the U.S. Constitution. ""There’s bipartisan consensus that this appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, which trumps any statute that the administration’s lawyers have cited,"" Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said. Politicians sometimes apply the label ""bipartisan consensus"" misleadingly to suggest a public policy debate has been favorably resolved, when in fact the battle rages on. That’s what Pelosi did here. A day after the midterm elections, Trump replaced outgoing Attorney General Jeff Sessions with Whitaker, a Justice Department lawyer. A legal fight erupted over whether Whitaker, as a non-Senate-confirmed officer, assumed the role legally. (See our story for more details on the legal arguments.) The stakes of the dispute are especially high because the attorney general oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Whitaker has publicly criticized the Mueller probe as overly broad. Attorneys for the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel argue Whitaker’s appointment is on solid ground. But some constitutional experts say Trump unlawfully sidestepped Congress when he elevated Whitaker without Senate confirmation. The state of Maryland mounted the first legal challenge of Whitaker’s post in federal court, and three Democratic senators have asked the courts to declare Trump’s move in violation of the Appointments Clause. Pelosi’s phrase, ""bipartisan consensus,"" requires unpacking. Politicians typically apply this label to create an impression that a critical mass from both parties have jointly settled on a unified view of things, and that no serious debate lingers. We found only one Republican lawmaker, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who called the appointment unconstitutional. ""To have somebody who is not Senate-confirmed in a position to oversee an investigation of the president's campaign just does not sit well here,"" Flake told The Hill, ""and I don't think it's consistent with practice and the Constitution really."" Pelosi’s office also cited examples of hand-wringing by other GOP members. A Politico article they sent us quotes Republican lawmakers expressing hope that Trump moves quickly to fill the top Justice Department job with a permanent replacement and lay to rest Whitaker's controversial tenure.  But wanting to squelch a negative story isn't the same thing as calling the current arranagement unconstitutional. Inquiries to Republican congressional leaders asking for their view on the constitutionality of Whitaker's appointment were not returned.  We didn’t need to look hard to find instances of Republican lawmakers defending Trump’s pick, contrary to Pelosi’s claim. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ""Presidents are entitled to surround themselves with advisers of their choice."" ""Given the fact that he is the choice of the duly elected president of the United States,"" Kennedy told CNN, ""I think we ought to give the guy a chance."" In follow up correspondence with Pelosi’s office, her staff appeared to confirm that Republican lawmakers by and large do not believe the Constitution has been breached. ""Leader Pelosi is referring to the bipartisan consensus from leading Republican legal minds across the country, a consensus which the radical congressional Republicans have pointedly ignored to rubber stamp President Trump’s unconstitutional actions,"" said Henry Connelly, a Pelosi spokesman. Pelosi’s office did cite six conservative legal and political commentators who have either argued against or questioned the constitutionality of Whitaker’s appointment. For instance, they pointed us to an interview with Michael Mukasey, who served as attorney general in the George W. Bush administration. ""The successor needs to be a confirmed person, in my view,"" Mukasey said. But we also found plenty of examples of Republicans who think Whitaker’s appointment is constitutionally sound. ""I accept the OLC’s judgment that the Whitaker appointment is lawful even though he is not Senate confirmed,"" Alberto Gonzales wrote in a USA Today op-ed that ran after Pelosi’s statement. Some constitutional scholars share this view. Pelosi said, ""There’s bipartisan consensus that (Matthew Whitaker’s) appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution."" The so-called ""bipartisan consensus"" Pelosi speaks of rests on a group of conservative thinkers who share the view, widely held by Democrats, that Whitaker’s appointment is unconstitutional. But Pelosi’s office acknowledged that, in the main, this is not a view with broad support among Republican lawmakers. In fact, some Republican lawmakers and legal leading lights, along with some constitutional scholars, believe Whitaker’s appointment was legal. The claim that there's ""consensus"" misleadingly suggests the debate over the constitutionality of Whitaker's appointment has been resolved, when in fact the battle rages on. We rate this statement False. ",/factchecks/2018/nov/29/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-wrong-legal-debate-over-attorney-gene/
