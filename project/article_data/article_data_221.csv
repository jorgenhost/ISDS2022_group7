Eric Holder signed off on Florida's 2011 early voting law, Rick Scott says
","As Florida heads toward a hotly contested governor’s race in November, Attorney General Eric Holder warned Gov. Rick Scott that the feds are ""carefully monitoring"" voter access in the state. ""I am deeply disturbed that during your tenure, your state has repeatedly added barriers to voting and restricted access to the polls,"" Holder wrote in a July 21 letter to Scott. Holder recapped changes in state election law during Scott’s tenure, as well as the state’s attempt to purge noncitizen voters from the rolls, disenfranchisement of felons and a dispute about where voters can return absentee ballots in Pinellas County. When the Tampa Bay Times blogged about the letter Aug. 1, Scott’s campaign dismissed Holder’s letter as a ""bizarre attempt to help Charlie Crist"" -- Scott’s likely Democratic opponent in November and an ally of President Barack Obama. Holder and Scott’s campaign made some dueling claims about the state’s early voting law. Holder wrote that 2011 changes in state law ""significantly narrowed the early voting window"" and that a federal three-judge panel concluded it threatened a ""dramatic reduction in a form of voting disproportionately used by African-Americans."" Holder wrote: ""Accordingly, the court refused to approve reduced early voting hours with respect to the five counties in Florida covered by the preclearance provision in the Voting Rights Act."" That led the Scott campaign to point the finger at Holder, for allowing the 2011 early voting law to be implemented: ""In fact, Attorney General Eric Holder’s own Justice Department precleared the voting changes in the 2011 law that governed the 2012 general election in Florida,"" Scott campaign manager Melissa Sellers wrote. At a campaign event in St. Petersburg on the same day, Scott made a similar claim: ""In 2011, we changed our voting laws, and they were precleared by the Justice Department ... ."" Since Scott, a Republican, is on the ballot this year, we decided to fact-check his statement that the Justice Department approved the early voting changes. On first blush, the claims from Holder and Scott sound like they are in conflict: A federal court refused to allow the reduction in the early voting schedule, but Holder signed off on the changes. We found that Scott left out some important steps along the way to implementing that law. Early voting hours changed In 2011, the GOP-led Legislature passed HB 1355, which cut the number of days of early voting from 14 to 8, among other election changes. The law, signed by Scott, allowed supervisors to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. Republican supporters at the time said that the various changes in the law would better protect the state's voting system against fraud. Democrats said the changes were an attempt to suppress voter turnout. Because of past discrimination, five counties in Florida -- Hillsborough, Monroe, Collier, Hardee and Hendry -- were subject to a section of the federal Voting Rights Act, which required any voting-law changes to be precleared by the federal government. (Precleared simply means approved in advance.) Holder signaled early on that he intended to challenge Florida’s new early voting law. In a speech in Texas in December 2011, Holder said: ""We're also examining a number of changes that Florida has made to its electoral process, including changes governing third-party voter registration organizations, as well as changes to early-voting procedures, including the number of days in the early-voting period."" The state decided to seek preclearance from a three-judge federal panel in Washington, instead of Holder’s Justice Department. The department ended up weighing in anyway, telling the court that the state had failed to prove it was protecting minorities from discrimination.    On Aug. 16, 2012, the panel issued a ruling siding with the Justice Department’s position and refusing to approve Florida’s early votings changes. The court said the state failed to prove that minority voters would not be harmed if the five counties held the minimum number of early voting hours. But the panel gave the state a path to get federal approval: The state could submit a plan showing a commitment to offer the maximum number of early voting hours for those counties. The Scott administration quickly filed a plan with the federal court seeking approval for 96 hours of early voting in the five counties. On Sept. 5, Holder filed a motion saying that his department didn’t object to that plan. The state submitted its plan to Holder the next day, and about a week later the Justice Department signed off on it. That November, Florida saw long lines in the 2012 presidential legislation. In 2013, the Legislature passed HB 7013, which expanded early voting to a minimum of 64 hours over eight days and maximum of 168 hours over 14 days. Later that summer, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the requirement for jurisdictions to seek preclearance. But in his letter to Scott, Holder seems to be putting the state on notice that his department still has powers to enforce other provisions in the Voting Rights Act. ""Whenever warranted by the facts and the law, we will not hesitate to use all tools and legal authorities at our disposal to fight against racial discrimination, to stand against disenfranchisement and to safeguard the right of every eligible American to cast a ballot,"" Holder wrote. Our ruling Scott and his campaign said Florida’s 2011 voting changes were precleared by the Holder’s Justice Department. That statement ignores the fact that the department only signed off on the state’s plan after the state agreed to offer the maximum number of early voting hours in some counties to satisfy a court ruling. So approval came only after the state committed to offering the maximum number of hours in places that had a past history of discrimination. Scott's statement leaves out important details that led to Holder’s Department signing off on Florida’s election plan. We rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/04/rick-scott/eric-holder-signed-floridas-2011-early-voting-law-/
"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Dennis Richardson']","
Has Oregon's unemployment rate been above the national average for the past 17 years?
","Year in and year out, the economy plays a significant role in deciding important political races. That’s especially true now, as Oregon shakes off the lingering doldrums of the Great Recession. The claim: Republican gubernatorial challenger Rep. Dennis Richardson, in a recent debate with incumbent Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber, said Oregon’s economy has lagged behind the nation’s for years. ""It’s been 17 years that we’ve had unemployment higher than the national average in Oregon,"" said Richardson, a state representative from Central Point. ""When is that going to change?"" Oregon’s unemployment rate hasn’t dipped below the national rate since 1997? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We emailed Nick Beleiciks, an economist with the state Employment Department. The last time Oregon’s monthly seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was lower than the U.S. rate, Beleiciks wrote, was February 1996, when Oregon was at 5.4 percent and the U.S. was at 5.5 percent. So it’s actually been 18 years since Oregon’s jobless rate was lower than the national average, he said. As with anything involving the intersection of politics and economics, however, the matter doesn’t stop there, Beleiciks added. In mid-2007, leading into the Great Recession, he wrote, the state’s jobless rate of 5.2 percent was just 0.2 percentage points higher than the U.S. average. As recently as February 2014, Oregon’s rate was a mere 0.1 percentage point higher, at 6.8 percent. Beleiciks’ point: ""Statisticians don’t consider Oregon’s unemployment rate to be significantly different than the U.S. when our rate is just a few tenths of a percentage point higher or lower."" The most recent numbers, for June 2014, showed a 0.7 percentage point difference, with Oregon at 6.8 percent and the U.S. at 6.1 percent. ""Very close,"" Beleiciks said, ""to the historical average difference."" Richardson, in the debate, didn’t specifically blame Kitzhaber in making his claim, though Richardson’s staff later confirmed that was the implication. Kitzhaber is in his third term as governor, serving from 1995 to 2003 and since 2011. He’s now running for an unprecedented fourth term. We found an Oregon Employment Department report from February 2009 showing that the state’s unemployment rate had been higher than the national rate in 25 of the previous 33 years – meaning Oregon’s higher jobless rate long predates Kitzhaber’s first inauguration. We also called B. Starr McMullen, an Oregon State University economics professor, to ask how much sway any one politician might have to reverse those lines. ""Not much,"" McMullen said. ""If we could figure out why we are consistently remaining above the national average and the problem was solvable by government policy, we would have done that a long time ago."" Tom Potiowsky, former state economist and now chairman of Portland State University’s Economics Department, agreed. ""You’ve got rural areas facing long-term unemployment because there are few jobs there and nowhere near the military contracts in Oregon that, say, Washington and California have,"" he said. The ruling: Richardson, in a recent debate with Kitzhaber, claimed that Oregon’s unemployment rate has hovered above the national rate for 17 years. It’s actually been 18 years, but that covers the time frame of Richardson’s claim. Also, though a state economist said Oregon’s rate was sometimes statistically even with the national average, that feels like splitting hairs. Anyone looking up Oregon Employment Department statistics would find Oregon’s rate higher for the period Richardson cites. Though Richardson implied that Kitzhaber was at fault, he didn’t say so directly at the debate, so we didn’t evaluate that as part of Richardson’s claim. We find Richardson’s claim True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/04/dennis-richardson/has-oregons-unemployment-rate-been-above-national-/

GOP challenger Marilinda Garcia says U.S. Rep. Kuster used taxpayer funds for campaign mail
","Voters in New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District are accustomed to getting a bundle of campaign mailings when election season rolls around every two years. The 2nd District seat has changed hands three times in the last decade. It was captured most recently by Democrat Ann McLane Kuster, who spent nearly $3.2 million in her bid to defeat former Republican Congressman Charles Bass. All that politicking means it’s not unusual for voters to find lots of glossy campaign material in the mailbox as the November election approaches. But when a full-color postcard bearing Kuster’s name and likeness was distributed at taxpayer expense, it drew fire from her opponents. The campaign staff for one of Kuster’s GOP opponents, Marilinda Garcia, accused Kuster of using taxpayer money to send campaign mail, which would be a violation. Kuster ""used 293K of your tax $ for campaign mail,"" tweeted Tom Szold, Garcia’s campaign manager.   We decided this was a job for PolitiFact. Rules in place for more than a century allow U.S. senators and representatives to use federal money to communicate with their constituents, using their signature to take the place of postage on mass mailings. The Congressional ""frank"" -- as the privilege is called -- is meant to allow elected officials to keep voters apprised of what’s going on in Washington. Politicians are forbidden from using the privilege for campaigning or self promotion. Kuster’s use of franked mail came under scrutiny by the New Hampshire Union Leader, which reported in June 2013 that Kuster has spent close to $293,000 on franked communications -- six times more than the rest of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation combined, the newspaper reported. The paper highlighted a postcard encouraging constituents to visit Kuster’s website and sign up for her electronic newsletter. Rules of the frank Congress has wrestled for decades with the question of what material is appropriate to send with taxpayer money without crossing into the realm of electioneering. Most recently, a six-member commission on Congressional mailing standards authored a detailed manual in 1998 laying out guidelines for material that can be sent using the frank. Guidelines in the manual discourage politicians from using their names or referring to themselves -- or even using a personal pronoun -- more than eight times on a single page. The regulations also prohibit most autobiographical material, reports on family life, personal hobbies or community service activities. Politicians also are prohibited from using franked mail for birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages or holiday greetings. When it comes to political content, franked mail cannot contain specific references to past or future campaigns or elections, including re-election announcements and schedules of campaign related events. Politicians are asked to avoid ""excessive"" use of party labels -- defined as generally being more than two per page -- and materials used in campaign literature or campaign pledges or promises, including photos, logos and slogans, can’t be reproduced in franked mail. Before any communications are authorized, they must be reviewed by the Franking Commission, a body established under the Committee on House Administration. Staff members serving under both Democratic and Republican committee members review the material to ensure it adheres to the guidelines. Kuster’s communications Politifact New Hampshire analyzed 26 franked communications Kuster was authorized to send out since she took office in 2013. They ranged from welcome letters for new residents -- offering her assistance ordering flags or planning visits to Washington D.C. -- to newsletters, surveys and scripts for telephone town halls. Kuster was also authorized to use her franking privilege to purchase several advertisements on Facebook asking constituents to ""Like"" her Facebook page. ""Granite Staters have a problem solver in Congress. Like my page and follow me!"" reads one advertisement that was authorized in 2013. It was accompanied by a photo of the Congressional seal. Garcia’s campaign argues the franked communications raise red flags because they don’t offer specific explanations of Kuster’s policy positions, and instead make generic statements that have the ring of election stumping. Garcia’s camp also criticized Kuster for using franked mail to invite residents to follow her social media accounts, and for including material that resembles her campaign literature. Szold said that the talking points used in Kuster’s 2014 re-election campaign mirror the subjects she has highlighted in her franked communications. Kuster’s spokeswoman, Rosie Hilmer, defended the use of franked mail, saying it helps Kuster advocate for the needs of her constituents in Washington. She pointed out that every piece of mail undergoes a rigorous approval process by the Franking Commission. ""Franked mail is an important tool that gives Congresswoman Kuster an opportunity to communicate directly with her constituents and let them know about important resources and issues they care about,"" Hilmer said. Campaign-like statements We couldn’t find any flagrant violations of the franking commission’s guidelines, but Garcia’s campaign has a point that some statements that appear in Kuster’s franked mail bear resemblance to material in her campaign literature. For example, when Kuster was campaigning in 2012, she wrote in an op-ed published in The Telegraph that she hoped to ""bring a new approach to Washington that’s focused on common-sense solutions to create jobs, strengthen our economy and grow the middle class."" Similar language appears in a constituent survey that was authorized by the Franking Commission in 2013. It reads: ""Your voice matters and helps me as I work with members of both parties to find common sense solutions to help create jobs, grow New Hampshire's economy, and strengthen our middle class."" When she was seeking to advertise an upcoming job fair in 2013, Kuster prepared a robocall script that stated her ""top priority in Congress is helping create jobs and opportunity for middle class families."" A similar phrase now appears on Kuster’s 2014 campaign website, which states that since taking office, ""Annie has made creating jobs and opportunity for Granite State families her number one priority."" The campaign website indicates that Kuster is focused on passing measures to grow New Hampshire’s economy and create middle class jobs -- a package of legislation Kuster refers to as her ""Jobs and Opportunity Agenda."" Kuster also referenced her ""Jobs and Middle Class Opportunity Agenda"" in an automated phone call that was authorized by the Franking Commission in 2014, and highlighted her ""Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Agenda"" in a piece of franked mail. Another automated phone call authorized by the Franking Commission focused on women’s issues. ""I'm holding a live Telephone Town Hall to share with you my Women's Economic Agenda and hear your thoughts on how we can level the playing field for New Hampshire women,"" the script reads. Kuster’s 2014 campaign website contains similar language. ""Annie also recently unveiled an Economic Agenda for Women and Families, which advocates support for critical reforms that will help level the playing field for Granite State women and their families,"" it reads. Our ruling Marilinda Garcia’s campaign said that Kuster uses taxpayer money to send campaign mail. Kuster did spend a good deal more on franked mail than other members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation, and some of the language that appears in those communications is similar or identical to language used in her campaign materials. In the same vein, some of the subjects that came up in Kuster’s newsletters and telephone town halls track closely with the issues highlighted on her campaign website, such as student loan debt, support for veterans, advocacy on women’s issues and protection for Social Security and Medicare. But as Kuster’s spokeswoman pointed out, all of the franked communications were reviewed by a panel of both Republicans and Democrats, and those that were authorized weren’t found to violate any of the Franking Commission’s guidelines. Those guidelines are designed to ensure franked mail isn’t being used to support a reelection campaign. While some voters may have trouble distinguishing between Kuster’s franked mail and her campaign mail, it appears Kuster stayed within the letter of the law. The Franking Commission has not received any complaints about her communications, nor has it found she violated any rules. There’s an element of truth to Garcia’s statement, but overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/04/marilinda-garcia/gop-challenger-marilinda-garcia-says-us-rep-kuster/

Van Susteren: Kerry angered Arab League by meeting with Hamas
","Fox News host and pundit Greta Van Susteren wrongly claimed on ABC’s This Week that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Hamas officials in Paris on July 26 to discuss a possible ceasefire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a back-and-forth with host George Stephanopoulos, Van Susteren described how Arab League members were upset that Kerry chose to meet with Hamas. ""That's why so many people were critical of Secretary Kerry going to Paris and talking with Hamas,"" she said. ""The Arab League thought that that was, you know, supporting Hamas to the exclusion of the Arab League."" Van Susteren was not challenged about her claim on air, but no meeting took place. No American official is allowed to negotiate with Hamas because it is defined by the United States as a terrorist organization. ""If Kerry or his representatives were to meet with Hamas, they would spend the next 20 years in Leavenworth (Penitentiary),"" said James Gelvin, a Middle East historian at the University of California, Los Angeles. In a post on Twitter, Van Susteren acknowledged her error. ""Meant to say Kerry talked to Turkey/Qatar ABOUT Hamas in Paris,"" she wrote. ""The point I was trying to make: talking to Turkey and Qatar ABOUT Hamas had the Arab League unhappy."" What happened in Paris While Kerry did not meet with Hamas in Paris on July 26, he did meet with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Qatar, two of Hamas’ major international backers. After negotiating a short-lived ceasefire, he said that many state actors have helped in the peace talks but singled out the two countries. ""We’re grateful obviously for the Egyptian initiative, for the Israeli efforts initially, but also this particular effort now has been significantly assisted by the input of Qatar, the input of Turkey, and the willingness of these foreign ministers to work hard even though they were at a distance, and to engage directly with some of the Palestinian factions in order to try to help get us where we are today,"" Kerry said. Arab League reaction Experts we spoke with said that even Van Susteren’s modified point -- that the Arab League was unhappy by Kerry’s talks with Turkey and Qatar -- is an oversimplification. Gelvin noted that Qatar itself is a League member (though Turkey is not), and that desire for peace in the region may outweigh disapproval of Hamas. The League, which is composed of 21 member states, also hasn’t issued any statement as a group condemning or criticizing Kerry’s meeting. ""Most of the Arab League, while not enamored with Hamas, wants a ceasefire simply because their lack of a strong backing for the Palestinians is very unpopular among their people,"" Gelvin said. Still, there are tensions between some individual League members and the United States based on Kerry’s recent diplomatic maneuvers. Steven Cook, a Middle East expert on the Council on Foreign Relations, said Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates all have been critical of Kerry’s reaching out to Qatar and Turkey. Those countries oppose Hamas in the current crisis largely out of a fear that Hamas’ political Islamist movement will spread, experts say. ""The Arab states may not be fond of Israel, but they fear political Islam and Hamas as a more direct threat to their stability than Israel,"" said George Bisharat, a professor at the Hastings College of Law and a legal expert on the Middle East. In general, the great majority of the Arab League members are either indifferent to or enemies of Hamas,  said Amatzia Baram, professor of Middle East studies at the University of Haifa in Israel. The two exceptions are Qatar and Sudan, a ""friend"" of Hamas because of shared ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. ""It’s very clear that (most of the Arab League) supports Egypt and not Hamas. Of course, Qatar has a lot of money, which Egypt does not, but Egypt is still the most important country in the Arab world,"" Baram said. The ruling Van Susteren said, ""So many people were critical of Secretary (John) Kerry going to Paris and talking with Hamas,"" because Kerry was seen as ""supporting Hamas to the exclusion of the Arab League."" Kerry never spoke directly with Hamas, a factual error that Van Susteren acknowledged. Instead, Kerry spoke with leaders from Turkey and Qatar -- who are seen as intermediaries for Hamas. As to her point about the meeting upsetting the Arab League, experts say some key members of the League were upset, but not all of them.

Warner says Gillespie supports a personhood amendment
","During a sharp exchange at their first debate, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner insisted that GOP challenger Ed Gillespie supports laws that would provide embryos with rights the moment of conception. ""He supports a personhood amendment that is so far out of the mainstream that it would ban certain common forms of contraception,"" Warner, a Democrat, said during the July 26 debate. He cast Gillespie as sympathetic towards several other socially conservative policies. Gillespie protested. ""This is an area where you’re making up my views,"" he said. ""Please provide the documentation for my support of any of those things."" Warner persisted, directly asking Gillespie if he ever supported a personhood amendment. ""No,"" Gillespie said. ""Provide documentation of that. When did I support a personhood amendment?"" ""We’ll give you the documentation,"" Warner replied. Shortly after the debate, his campaign put out an email saying that Gillespie was chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2004 when the party adopted a national platform calling for a personhood amendment. The platform said, ""As a country, we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence. That is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children."" As our colleagues at PolitiFact national have noted, the human life amendment would assert that legal personhood begins at conception and with it, constitutional protection. Personhood legislation has drawn enormous debate in Virginia and across the nation. Supporters say the laws provide a legal remedy if an unborn child is killed by neglect or a third party. Opponents say the measures are a ruse to challenge rights to abortion and contraceptives that could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. Gillespie ""had an understanding of the platform, and what was in it,"" said David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman. ""He was chair of the RNC and on the platform committee that crafted the language."" Gillespie was RNC chairman from 2003 to 2005. We should note that GOP has adopted platforms calling for a human life amendment at each of its national conventions since 1984, according to records kept by the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara. All this is in the past, however. Warner’s statement was in the present tense. He said Gillespie ""supports a personhood amendment."" Turner shifted to 2014 by pointing to the National Right to Life’s endorsement of Gillespie in May. The anti-abortion group said Gillespie, when he was RNC chairman, ""worked closely with pro-life leaders to ensure the platform remained resolute in seeking to restore legal protection to unborn children threatened by abortion…"" We repeatedly asked officials at National Right to Life group to specify actions Gillespie took to ensure the GOP stood hard on a personhood amendment but didn’t receive a direct answer. Turner noted that Gillespie tweeted news of his Right to Life endorsement. ""By touting a release that specifically referenced his work on a platform that had language described as calling for a personhood amendment, he has effectively endorsed that work during this campaign,"" Turner emailed. Gillespie, on his website, says he’s ""pro-life,"" and opposes taxpayer funding of abortion. He doesn’t mention a personhood amendment. Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, emailed us last week that ""Ed doesn’t support a personhood amendment."" Our ruling Warner says Gillespie ""supports a personhood amendment."" Gillespie says he doesn’t and challenged the senator to prove his claim. Gillespie was certainly national GOP chairman in 2004 when the party adopted a platform supporting a human life amendment.

SEIU's Spanish-language ad claims Cory Gardner is blocking immigration legislation in Congress
","Looking to mobilize Hispanic voters around immigration, the Service Employees International Union released Spanish-language radio ads in Colorado, California and Nevada criticizing select Republicans for the House’s failure to move a bill on the issue. One of them is Rep. Cory Gardner, the Colorado Republican challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. ""It’s simply unacceptable: (Reps.) Mike Coffman and Cory Gardner, together with the Republicans, have blocked immigration reform,"" the ad says, according to a translation provided by SEIU. ""Worse yet, they voted to deport our DREAMers."" We’re closely watching the Colorado Senate race, so for this fact-check, we’re just going to focus on Gardner’s immigration record. Blocked immigration reform? Notably, Gardner was one of the lone Republicans to stand and applaud President Barack Obama’s call for immigration reform in his 2014 State of the Union address. ""I think we can all agree that the system is broken,"" Gardner said after the speech. So far the House has not acted, and prospects are dim for action before the fall elections. That means Gardner hasn’t had the opportunity to actually vote on legislation, making it hard to attribute any blame to him. It’s not as though he holds any leadership positions where he could have advanced legislation or held up the process. When senators introduced a bipartisan bill in January 2013, Gardner — who called on Republicans to take on immigration reform a day after winning reelection in 2012 — said the legislation was a beginning. ""I am glad that our country is starting to have a serious conversation about how to repair our broken immigration system — it is long overdue,"" Gardner said in a statement. He made similar comments four months later as the immigration debate heated up. ""Some people are slamming the bill, and I'm not one of them,"" Gardner told the Denver Post. ""I think it's a good first step, but I don't know if it's 100 percent there."" The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill in June 2013 on a 68-32 vote. The package included $40 billion in border enforcement over the next decade and provided a 13-year path to citizenship for the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. At this point Gardner said he ""would not vote for"" the Senate bill because it ""moves the ball down the field without ensuring borders are secure."" But he has continued to advocate for the House to put forth their own legislation. So Gardner might not like the Senate bill, but he has repeatedly called for the House to take up the issue. Voted to deport our DREAMers? In June 2012, the Obama administration announced a two-year moratorium on the deportation of some children brought to United States illegally by their parents. These kids — often called DREAMers, a nod to the DREAM Act that has failed to pass Congress — would instead be able to live in the United States without the immediate threat of deportation if they applied, met certain criteria and avoided criminal activity. A year later, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, introduced an amendment to a Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill that would block Obama’s ability to enforce this executive action. Effectively, the status quo prior to Obama’s maneuver would resume, meaning these children could once again be deported. The amendment passed, but the entire bill died in the Senate. A SEIU spokeswoman noted that Gardner voted for the King amendment. Gardner’s campaign, however, disagreed with SEIU’s characterization of it as a vote to ""deport our DREAMers."" Rather, a spokesman said the vote was a protest against Obama’s executive overreach. His campaign also noted that the text of the amendment did not direct DREAMers be deported and only addressed Obama’s actions. That stance appears to be backed up by Gardner’s rhetoric. During a July 2013 House immigration hearing, Gardner called the children of illegal immigrants ""culturally American"" and said they should be allowed to stay. ""I believe members across the aisle can unite and agree that providing these children with some sort of immigration relief is the just and fair thing to do,"" Gardner said. ""The children do deserve to have the opportunity to continue the American dream and we, as members of Congress, should have the compassion to provide them with this."" More recently, Gardner said that children of illegal immigrants who join the military should be given citizenship. As we were researching the ad, the House once again passed a measure that — similar to the 2013 King amendment — would have ended Obama's deportation delay for DREAMers. Gardner was one of 11 Republicans to vote against the bill. Our ruling SEIU said Gardner ""blocked immigration reform"" and ""voted to deport our DREAMers."" While Republicans in the House have not moved forward on immigration, Gardner himself has repeatedly advocated for his colleagues to take up the issue. There are plenty of obstacles to passing a bill in the House, but Gardner does not appear to be one of them. Gardner did vote for an amendment that effectively would have ended Obama’s two-year delay in deporting certain children of illegal immigrants. However, he said that was a move against Obama’s unilateral action, and not the DREAMers. Indeed, he has actually called for permanent status for children brought to the U.S. illegally, including citizenship for those who join the military. We rate the statement from SEIU as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/04/service-employees-international-union-committee-po/seius-spanish-language-ad-claims-cory-gardner-bloc/

Scott Walker says Mitt Romney didn't run on his business resumé
","Republican Gov. Scott Walker drew criticism in conservative circles when his campaign TV ads portrayed Democratic rival Mary Burke as an outsourcing profiteer at Trek Bicycle Corp. Walker was asked if the strategy was hypocritical, given that he criticized President Barack Obama’s relentless attacks on 2012 GOP presidential rival Mitt Romney as a greedy outsourcer in his private equity days at Bain Capital. ""Fundamentally different,"" Walker was quoted as saying in the July 24, 2014 Wisconsin State Journal. Walker argued that, ""Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him. If he had, then I think it would be fair game to say then you need to look at all of his experience."" Let’s hit the rewind button. Is Walker right that Romney ""did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him""? Presidential politics, circa 2012 To back up the claim, Alleigh Marré, a Walker campaign spokeswoman, sent us 11 video examples of Romney criticizing Obama and his record, as well as touting his own plans. ""The contrast Governor Walker was making between Burke and Romney in the statement you provided is that Romney was running a more robust and dynamic campaign that did not focus solely, or even primarily, on his business experience like Burke’s does,"" Marré wrote in an email. But Walker did not couch his remark that way; he said Romney didn’t offer his business experience even as ""a"" reason to support him. That’s a rewrite of history. Romney may have downplayed his tenure as Massachusetts governor. But from start to finish in the campaign, he hammered home his private-sector time, as did campaign surrogates including key Republican officials. A few examples: April 2011: Just 45 seconds into his announcement video, Romney ran through his 25-years-long private-sector resumé and emphasized how it could help him solve America’s economic woes: ""I learned how America competes with companies in other countries, why jobs leave and how jobs are created at home."" September 2011: ""I spent my life in the private sector, not in government,"" Romney said in Orlando during a GOP primary debate. ""I only spent four years as a governor. I didn’t inhale. I’m a business guy."" August 23, 2012: Responding to Obama attacks, Romney defended and embraced the lessons of his private-sector years, writing in the Wall Street Journal: ""The lessons I learned over my 15 years at Bain Capital were valuable in helping me turn around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They also helped me as governor of Massachusetts to turn a budget deficit into a surplus and reduce our unemployment rate to 4.7%. The lessons from that time would help me as president to fix our economy, create jobs and get things done in Washington."" August 30, 2012: At the Republican convention, Romney repeatedly used his acceptance speech to talk about the fundamental divide between he and Obama. ""He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business,"" Romney said. ""Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience."" October 2012: In the second presidential debate, Romney cited his real-world work experience to bolster his credibility on tackling complex problems: ""I want to make small businesses grow and thrive. I know how to make that happen. I spent my life in the private sector. I know why jobs come and why they go."" And that list is just after a cursory review. Finally, we offer one more quote from the 2012 campaign trail: ""We know that Mitt Romney had an incredible career in the private sector, turning businesses around that otherwise would have failed, and thousands of people owe their jobs to that today."" That was from an introduction of Romney at a Nov. 2, 2012 campaign rally in West Allis. The speaker: Scott Walker. Our rating Walker said that ""Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him."" To the contrary, Romney made frequent and high-profile use of his extensive private-sector credentials, making them the core of his deep and sustained criticism of Obama’s record on handling the economy. Nobody would know that better than Walker, who helped remind voters of nominee’s business-world record. The claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Juan Williams: People who want impeachment are white, old and Republican
","House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the House has no plans to impeach President Barack Obama, but that doesn’t mean the idea isn’t lurking in the wings. Yes, House Republicans have voted to sue the president on the grounds that he singlehandedly rewrote his signature health care law, but with conservatives now calling him ""lawless"" and ""out of control,"" a lawsuit might not satisfy. Fox News analyst Juan Williams accused Republicans of demonizing Obama in an Aug. 3, 2014, broadcast of Fox News Sunday. Host Chris Wallace pressed Williams on whether he thought Republican opposition to the president was racial. ""All I can do is look at the numbers,"" Williams said. Then, in a heated exchange with another panelist, Michael Needham of the conservative group Heritage Action, Williams said, ""The core constituency, the people who want him impeached, they’re all white, and they’re all older, and guess what, they’re all in the far right wing of the Republican party."" We decided to find the numbers and see if they matched Williams’ claim that the desire for impeachment rests with white, older, Republican voters. The polls We found three polls that asked about impeachment. One from CNN/ORC reported that 33 percent of the public at large thought Obama should be impeached (with a margin of error of 3 percent). Among conservatives and Republicans, the share jumped to about 56 percent. The CNN/ORC poll found no significant variation among the age groups. The numbers hovered around 33 percent. There was a sharp racial divide. About 40 percent of whites said they favored impeachment, while just 17 percent of non-whites took that view. (The margin of error was higher for non-whites -- plus or minus 6.5 percentage points.) Just 13 percent of Democrats supported impeachment. Fox News did its own survey. Fox put overall support for impeachment at 36 percent. The age factor showed a slightly greater skew than in the CNN poll, with just 28 percent in favor among people under 35 and older voters coming in closer to 40 percent. Fox also found that about 40 percent of whites liked the idea of impeachment. They reported that 20 percent of African-Americans support impeachment. (The margin of error on was plus or minus nine percentage points.) Among people who described themselves as ""tea partiers,"" support for impeachment jumped to 68 percent. The Huffington Post partnered with YouGov to conduct an online survey and like the other polls, reported that about a third of the public favored impeachment. Support was strongest among Republicans, at 68 percent, and lowest among Democrats at 8 percent (with no reported margin of error). As with the Fox poll, this one found more interest in impeachment among older people; 47 percent of those 65 and up liked the idea. In terms of race, 40 percent of whites, 10 percent of African-Americans and 26 percent of Hispanics leaned in favor, but the number of responses among non-whites was very low and no one should put much faith in those exact figures. What the experts say The general sense from the political scientists we reached is that Williams had a point but went overboard. The main problem had to do with the word ""all."" ""That's a categorical assertion, one that I cannot support,"" said Christopher Parker, a political scientist at the University of Washington. ""However, I will say that this group of people is more likely than any other group of folks to wish to see the president impeached."" Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard University, also noted that Williams had taken ""a few everyday language shortcuts, but he is basically right."" ""In our research in 2010-11, we found that conservative Republicans/tea party sympathizers are overwhelmingly white and definitely tend to be older,"" Skocpol said. ""Now, keep in mind that all Republicans tend, statistically speaking, to be older and whiter than other Americans. So any time you talk about Republicans, you are talking older and whiter. And of course, only Republicans tell pollsters in a majority that they favor impeachment."" William Miller, a political science instructor at Flagler College in Florida who has written about the tea party and the Republican Party, generally agreed with Skocpol. Both the tea party and people supporting impeachment tend to be older and whiter, but ""there are pockets of support in other groups,"" he said. Our ruling Williams said that the people who want to impeach Obama are all white and all older and all are in the right wing of the Republican Party. ""All"" is going too far.  But the publicly available polling shows that the people who support impeachment are more likely to be white, conservative and older. In one poll, about a third of the public supported impeachment, while about two-thirds of tea partiers said they did. In another, 40 percent of whites supported impeachment compared to 10 percent of African-Americans.  The polling data bears out the general thrust of Williams' claim. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/03/juan-williams/juan-williams-people-who-want-impeachment-are-whit/

Rick Perry: 'Historic record highs' of people from terrorists states being apprehended at border
","Texas Gov. Rick Perry says the border needs more protection against a record-high number of illegal immigrants coming from terrorist havens, but the figures don’t match Perry’s rhetoric. With Congress scrambling to address illegal immigration before the start of their summer recess this past Friday, it’s no surprise that the issue was a main topic on the Aug. 3, 2014, talk shows. Perry, who is considering a 2016 presidential run, appeared on CNN’s State of the Union to talk about President Barack Obama’s response to the crisis in Israel and the situation along the U.S.-Mexico border. Perry defended his recent decision to ramp up state spending on border operations following a massive influx of children from Central American countries. ""I'm the governor of the state of Texas. My citizens' safety is what is foremost here. And it hasn't got anything to do with anything other than those numbers of individuals who are coming across the border. And when you think about the idea that some of them are from countries that have substantial terrorist ties, whether it's Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria, we are at historic record highs with individuals being apprehended from those countries,"" Perry said. The claim about illegal immigrants coming from countries with terrorist ties caught our attention. PolitiFact Texas checked two similar Perry claims in June. Perry said there was a record number of border apprehensions of people from countries other than Mexico, which PolitiFact Texas found to be True. But Perry also said of the surge in apprehensions, ""These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations."" PolitiFact Texas found that less than 5 percent of the ""other than Mexico"" apprehensions in 2012 (the most recent available data) involved people from countries that the United States designates as terrorist states or safe havens. For that, PolitiFact Texas rated Perry’s claim Pants on Fire. Is it possible, though, that the small number of apprehensions of individuals from those countries in 2012 could be a record? By the numbers We asked Perry’s office for evidence, but they did not get back to us. We found the most recent and comprehensive breakdown of apprehensions by country and year in the Department of Homeland Security’s 2012 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics (table 34), released July 2013. The document has data from the past 10 years. Here are the number of apprehensions for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria: Year Afghanistan Pakistan Syria 2003 61 4,083 369 2004 57 641 106 2005 55 792 113 2006 53 721 151 2007 28 654 101 2008* 74 654 101 2009 74 575 87 2010 88 592 95 2011 106 525 108 2012 95 458 56   *Note: Data from 2008 and on includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement enforcement and removal operations. Based on the DHS data, there were not record apprehensions in 2012 for individuals from the three countries Perry mentioned, nor are apprehensions trending up. In fact, 2012 was the lowest year out of these 10 for Pakistan and Syria. To cover our bases, we also looked the DHS yearbook’s data for about a dozen other countries designated by the State Department to be terrorist safe havens or state sponsors of terrorism. The list includes Afghanistan, Colombia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. We found that none of these countries had record highs in 2012. Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia hit their record in 2011, though there is no discernible upward trend. The numbers of apprehensions of individuals from these countries is also incredibly low compared to the primary sources of illegal immigrants. In 2012, DHS apprehended nearly 450,000 Mexicans, 55,000 Guatemalans and 50,000 Hondurans. In contrast, officials apprehended 95 Afghanis, 458 Pakistanis and 56 Syrians. Justification It’s important to note that while Perry was using this statement to justify bringing more resources to the Texas-Mexico border, an apprehension and other enforcement measures can happen at the border, in the country’s interior or at designated places outside of the United States, according to the DHS document. Historically, only an extremely small number of people from the Middle East or South Asia who try to enter the United States illegally do so by crossing a land border, said Stephen Kelly, former deputy chief of mission for the United States in both Mexico and Canada. ""People from those areas are more likely to try to enter via an airport, perhaps with false documents,"" said Kelly, now a public policy professor at Duke University. And many people coming from these countries without a valid visa apply for asylum as soon as they enter the United States, so they are essentially turning themselves in. This has been an argument against increasing the number of border patrol agents in response to the influx of Central American children because they come to the country actively seeking officials rather than trying to evade them. This is because the current law, passed under former President George W. Bush to combat child trafficking, allows children from countries that don’t border the United States to stay in the country. Policymakers are now contemplating changing the law. Our ruling Perry said the United States is at ""historic record highs"" of individuals being apprehended on the border from countries with terrorist ties such as ""Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria."" The most recent data does not show record apprehensions of individuals from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria or any other designated terrorist countries, nor does it show an upward trend in apprehensions of individuals from those areas. Even if it did, many apprehensions of people from these areas happen at airports rather than land borders. We rate Perry’s claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/aug/03/rick-perry/rick-perry-historic-record-highs-people-terrorists/

Mary Burke: Abbott deal had ""strong protections for taxpayers""
","Gov. Scott Walker alleges that former state Commerce Secretary Mary Burke ""wasted"" nearly $25 million in the so-far failed attempt to attract a major Abbott Laboratories expansion in Wisconsin. But Burke, Walker’s main Democratic challenger in the 2014 governor’s race, says her agency built tough failsafes into the deal. ""Everyone from local officials to the local chamber of commerce to Walker's own administration agrees that this was and is a good deal from an economic development standpoint,"" Burke’s campaign said on July 9, 2014. ""The grant,"" she continued, ""contained strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met or infrastructure was not developed for economic development."" On July 31, 2014, we rated Walker’s $25 million claim False, noting that Walker double-counted the $12.3 million cost of the deal. In the jousting over the strength or weakness of the deal’s protections, the two campaigns cite the same sections of the complicated Abbott aid agreement as evidence for their side’s view. Let’s start there. The 2006 deal passed $12.5 million in federal block grant funds through the Village of Pleasant Prairie and the Kenosha Area Business Alliance to purchase 40 acres of land to hold for Abbott, which already had amassed 500 acres for a potential Kenosha County corporate campus. If the pharmaceutical giant’s Wisconsin expansion proceeds, Abbott could buy the land for $1. State officials wanted a so-called ""clawback"" provision that would require Abbott to pay back the money if the company did not create at least 2,400 jobs, but Abbott declined to sign one, according to Michael Pollocoff, Pleasant Prairie’s administrator. Burke and then-Gov. Jim Doyle pushed forward without such a provision. It’s common for Commerce Department grants and loans to businesses to be tied to performance measures mandating partial or full return of such aid if jobs are not added, according to a 2006 state audit. Often the state’s contracts call for personal loan guarantees and financial penalties in case of non-repayment. Such conditions vary depending on the situation, but in the Abbott case, the state’s approach meant that the party the state was hoping to come through with jobs was not directly on the hook. It was subject only to indirect financial pressure to do so -- the loss of a ""free"" piece of land. Land sale envisioned The plan, however, did not leave the state without any recourse. Under the agreement, the business alliance, known as KABA, is responsible for returning some funds to the state if the Abbott jobs don’t emerge by 2016. That refund, though, was tied to what the 40-acre property could bring in a sale, and the plan came with some terms that weakened the possibility the full amount could be recovered. At this point, the land’s assessed value is about 55 percent of what KABA paid for it -- nearly $5 million lower than the $12.3 million purchase price (a pre-recession price paid to a truck stop developer who had leverage in the negotiation.) So at least as things stand now, far less than the full $12.3 million seems recoverable. The deal called for KABA and Pleasant Prairie to recoup their own costs related to holding and preparing the Abbott site for development. Those costs are nearly $4 million, said Pollocoff. So if the state were to immediately sell the property, the leftover funds might total only $2 million to $3 million. There’s nothing in the deal that would block the state from holding the land in hopes that its value in a busy corporate corridor would increase. ""This is a unique piece of collateral with significant growth potential,"" Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki argued in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, ""40 acres of land along a busy highway, next to up-and-coming businesses like Amazon and Uline."" Todd Battle, president of the KABA group, didn’t respond to interview requests for this story, but in 2006 he described the land as ""some of the most valuable real estate along the (Interstate 94) corridor."" But there’s one more, major point here. Because federal officials in 2013 declared the deal ineligible for federal money in the first place, and the promise of jobs was so vague,  the state is being forced -- now -- to pay back HUD from state tax revenue. Federal officials say the project was overly speculative and has not paid off over eight years. That’s something no one contemplated as a possibility, and one that a stronger and more properly drawn deal would have prevented as a matter of course. Mike Huebsch, state Department of Administration secretary and a top member of the Walker administration, is not impressed by predictions of money coming back to the state. ""The deal was constructed in a way that put us at a disadvantage every step of the way,"" he told us. ""The state’s position was not strong."" We sought an outsider’s opinion and turned to Ronald D Berkebile. He’s a founder of Dominion Scientific Analytics, a financial analyst with the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and an author of articles on the financial impact of economic development projects. Berkebile didn’t fault the general structure of the deal, and said there’s an element of hindsight in the criticisms. If the economy had not soured, Abbott might have met the agreement’s expectations, and ""no one would have asked about this situation,"" he said. ""The economy (in 2006) likely supported the promise of a large pharmaceutical company developing the land. A promise of this nature is very enticing."" But he said more performance milestones should have been built in to protect the investment, and there should have been better monitoring to avoid violating state and federal rules. If Abbott couldn’t produce by a date certain, ""then KABA should have had the ability to exercise alternative property rights to develop the land in accordance with (block grant) standards,"" he said. Our rating Burke’s campaign said the $12.5 million incentive deal she approved for Abbott Laboratories contained ""strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met."" While the land provides some collateral, the deal’s protections and structure fell short of those used in many such cases, leaving the state vulnerable to picking up some or most of the pieces if Abbott doesn’t deliver. And it’s hard to reconcile how ""strong protections"" could have allowed the scenario now unfolding in which the state is paying cash to HUD. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/03/mary-burke/mary-burke-abbott-deal-had-strong-protections-taxp/

Seth Magaziner says state pension investments earned less than average during Frank Caprio's term
","In the Democratic primary contest for Rhode Island's general treasurer, in which former treasurer Frank Caprio is looking to get his old job back, challenger Seth Magaziner is making the past performance of the state's pension fund an issue. During a debate that aired July 13, 2014 on WPRI-TV, Magaziner claimed that when Caprio oversaw the fund, its performance was below par. ""Our state's pension system has been underperforming our peers for years,"" Magaziner said. After some back-and-forth with Caprio, who disputed figures Magaziner cited, Magaziner made this statement: ""Whether you measure it by calendar year or by fiscal year,"" he said, ""we underperformed the median three out of the four years that Mr. Caprio was in office."" (The median is the ""middle"" number in a ranked list.) Before we begin, we should note that we will be dealing with two definition of ""year"" -- the calendar year that begins Jan. 1 and the state fiscal year, which begins July 1. Caprio was in office for four full calendar years and three full fiscal years, the periods that are relevant. When we asked Magaziner's campaign for his supporting documentation, it sent us a spreadsheet with the earnings from 107 state plans for the fiscal years 2007 to 2011 based on information from Boston College's Center for Retirement Research. ""The data clearly shows that in only in one of the years when he was in office did Mr. Caprio (barely) outperform most other states, hence Seth's assertion of 'three out of the four years Mr. Caprio was in office,'"" said Evan England, Magaziner's campaign manager. But that list turned out to be less than accurate. When we forwarded the spreadsheet to Caprio for comment, he quickly found 11 plans in 9 states that were not valid comparisons because their rate of return was calculated using a different fiscal year than Rhode Island's. ""This is like using the score from the 5th inning of a baseball game and saying that's the final score,"" Caprio said. In response, the Magaziner campaign sent us an updated list that eliminated 25 of the 107 plans. ""Unfortunately for Mr. Caprio, the result is the same. The R.I. plan still underperforms the median four out of the five fiscal years he was in office,"" said England. Yet he was referring to two fiscal years during which Caprio wasn't in office for half the period. Even that new list wasn't perfect. Nebraska was still included even though its reporting year is out of synch with Rhode Island's and Massachusetts was dropped from the list even though it should have stayed on. It should be noted that during the three fiscal years when only Caprio was in office, the rates of return for the Rhode Island plans were always within 1 percentage point of the median. Magaziner's campaign also offered as evidence an analysis comparing Rhode Island's rates of return (based on reports from the Rhode Island State Investment Commission) to a national index developed by Wilshire Associates, a respected California-based investment management firm. By that measure, Rhode Island underperformed in three out of four calendar years, as Magaziner said. (The exception was Caprio's first year in office.) During the three fiscal years when Caprio served a full term, Rhode Island underperformed the Wilshire during the first two years, one fewer than Magaziner claimed. How reliable is the Wilshire index? ""It’s among the largest and most representative indexes for measuring institutional investment performance,"" said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. However, Brainard cautioned that comparison is difficult because, if nothing else, each pension plan has its own unique mix of investments based on its needs. ""Really, the best benchmark is its own internal benchmark"" which is determined in advance based on that investment mix, Brainard said. So we checked that. Monthly reports for Rhode Island's investment plan, compiled by State Street Investment Analytics, show that Rhode Island's performance was lower than its own benchmark in two of the four calendar years (2007 and 2009) Caprio was on the job. It was also lower than the benchmark during two of the three complete fiscal years of Caprio’s tenure. By that measure, it's Magaziner's criticism that underperforms. In response, Caprio noted that the overall rate of return for the three fiscal years he served as treasurer was -4.63 percent, compared to the State Street's benchmark of -5.28 percent, which means that the state lost less money than the benchmark during the recession. Magaziner's campaign responded by saying that the benchmark in the investment commission report ""has nothing to do with Rhode Island's performance relative to other public pension funds."" Our ruling Seth Magaziner said that Rhode Island's state pension system ""underperformed the median three out of the four years that Mr. Caprio was in office,"" which is the claim we're checking. There is no uncontested gold standard against which the ""median"" can be determined. Using the benchmarks Magaziner wants to use -- Boston College's data on pension returns in other states and the respected Wilshire index -- Magaziner is off the mark a bit, in part because Magaziner wants to count fiscal years in which Caprio wasn't serving a full term as treasurer. But the government pension experts with whom we spoke cautioned that such comparisons are not always fair, because different plans use different investing strategies based on their history and funding requirements. If you look at the predetermined benchmark used for Rhode Island's plan, the state's pension program performed below the median in two of the four calendar years that Caprio was in office, and in two of the three full fiscal years that included his tenure. The bottom line: The state’s plan underperformed benchmarks, as Magaziner said, but not quite as often as he said. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, such as an alternative measure of success that tells a slightly different story, we rate it Mostly True.

Ed Gillespie says White House is cutting Navy to pay for Obamacare
","The Navy is ailing, and Obamacare is to blame, says Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate. ""This administration is slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare,"" he said during a recent debate with Democratic incumbent Mark Warner. ""There’s no two ways about it when looking at their budget."" It wasn’t the first time Gillespie has made this claim on the campaign trail in Virginia, home to the world’s largest Naval base. We decided to see if he’s right. The Navy Budget The final Navy allocation requested by George W. Bush’s administration, for fiscal 2009, was $149.3 billion. Congress appropriated $148.1 billion. Here are the amounts President Barack Obama has requested for the Navy: And here are the amounts Congress appropriated for the Navy: You may notice that the first list goes one year into the future while the second list doesn’t. That’s because Obama has made his Navy budget request for 2015, but Congress hasn’t agreed on the appropriation. There are two important trends in these lists. First, over the course of Obama’s  administration, a chart of his Navy budget requests would look like a hill, sloping up in the early years and then dropping below its starting point. A chart for the congressional allocations would have the same shape. The second trend is that in four of the first five years of the administration, Congress appropriated less Navy money than Obama requested. The trends stem from a partisan showdown over the federal debt in 2011 that resulted in an unhappy compromise. The fight arose over raising the nation’s debt limit so the government could continue to pay its obligations, something Congress had routinely done in the past. This time, however, Republicans insisted on spending cuts in return for raising the limit. Democrats initially refused. The standoff was broken that August by passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which eventually triggered $1.2 trillion in automatic budget cuts over 10 years -- called sequestration -- in exchange for raising the borrowing limit. Half the cuts will be made in domestic programs, which Democrats sought to protect, and half will come in defense spending -- including the Navy -- that Republicans wanted to shield. The cuts began to take effect on March 1, 2013. Is Obamacare tied to Navy cuts? The Navy and Obamacare -- also known as the Affordable Care Act -- are funded under different budget rules. The Navy falls under discretionary spending, which accounts for about 40 percent of all federal outlays. These are programs that receive annual appropriations subject to the whims of Congress and are affected by the sequester. Although defense consumes about half of the discretionary budget, other areas include education, agriculture and housing. Obamacare was set up to be self-supporting through a series of specially enacted taxes and long-term Medicare savings. It doesn’t rely on an annual appropriation. In other words, the ACA and the Navy are supported by two unconnected funding streams. So where does Gillespie find the link? His campaign sent us a variety of information but none of it tied the Navy cuts to Obamacare. We received: A 2013 blog entry by Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of Navy operations. He warned that the U.S. fleet could sink to about 255-260 ships in 2020 if sequestration continues. That’s a loss of about 30 ships, or about 10 percent. A 2013 news release from Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, announcing he had introduced a bill to remove the Department of Defense from the sequester. Two long-term budget outlooks published by nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office this year, noting there will be costs for expanding health insurance subsidies under Obamacare. The reports, however, did not address ACA revenues. ""They looked completely at the spending side,"" said Josh Gordon, an analyst for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization urging deficit reduction. For now, insurance provisions under Obamacare are costing less than expected. The CBO estimated in April that the expanded insurance under the act will cost $104 billion less than it originally projected over the next 10 years.   Experts told us Gillespie’s linkage of Navy cuts to Obamacare is way off base. ""I don’t see any connection between the defense budget and the Affordable Care Act,"" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a think tank focused on defense policies. Winslow T. Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project for the Project on Government Oversight, called Gillespie’s comment ""specious nonsense."" Our ruling Gillespie says the Obama administration is ""slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare."" The claim is erroneous for two reasons. First, Congress is complicit in the Navy budget cuts. By failing to agree on a debt-reduction plan, it triggered a self-imposed regimen of automatic cuts to defense and domestic programs. Second, Obamacare is shielded from those reductions because it’s not subject to annual appropriations from Congress. The ACA is self-funded through a series of specially enacted taxes and health care efficiencies. Its fortunes are not tied to those of Navy. Gillespie, who has made this statement at least twice, sent us plenty of information, but none of it linked the Navy cuts to Obamacare. We agree with the military expert who called the claim ""specious nonsense."" But at PolitiFact, we call it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/aug/03/ed-gillespie/ed-gillespie-says-white-house-cutting-navy-pay-oba/

U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst does not support a national minimum wage, says her opponent
","A new ad from Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Bruce Braley focuses on the minimum wage as part of his campaign’s effort to paint Ernst as ""too extreme"" for Iowa. It uses video and audio clips of Ernst speaking at primary debates and in interviews as evidence for the claim that she does not ""think there should be a national minimum wage."" According to the most recent polls, Ernst and Braley are nearly tied. We wanted to know if this latest attack ad was accurate: Does Ernst oppose a national minimum wage? This isn’t the first attack on Ernst for her position on the minimum wage. In a June ad, the Iowa Democratic Party accused Ernst of flip-flopping on the issue. We decided to take a look back at Ernst’s public statements and positions on the minimum wage, but it can get confusing. So we compiled a timeline to see if her views changed. January 2014 On Jan. 9, 2014 Braley released a report on minimum wage that suggested raising the national figure to $10.10 an hour. Ernst disagreed. ""I believe that businesses will do what is best for their business,"" she said in an interview the same day. ""I don’t know that the government needs to be stepping in and telling them this is what you will do."" February 2014 Ernst’s opposition to the federal government’s role in raising a minimum wage continued. ""Government and government-mandated wage increases are not the solution,"" she said, as reported in a Quad-City Times story. March 2014 At a candidate forum held by the National Federation of Independent Business on March 18, 2014, Ernst said this: ""I do believe it is best left up to the states. Our state economies are much different from state to state, so I don’t believe the federal government should be involved in setting the minimum wage."" Ernst also talked about the great opportunity she had working a minimum wage job as a biscuit maker at Hardee’s. ""I think $7.25 is appropriate for Iowa,"" she concluded. April 2014 In an April debate Ernst said she would not raise Iowa’s minimum wage. She argued that minimum wage jobs were ""introductory level"" positions and eventually workers could progress into better paying jobs as they acquired more skills. June 2014 Ernst appeared on Iowa Public Radio for a candidate profile on June 1, 2014. When asked about increasing the minimum wage, Ernst responded with a familiar line. ""I do not support a federal minimum wage. Every state has a different economy, different cost of living. I don’t believe that’s the role of the federal government,"" she said. But she seemed to soften that position in late June. After Ernst won the Republican primary she suggested the minimum wage should be left as it is but not raised. ""I never called for the abolishment of it. Never,"" Ernst said to U.S. News and World Report on June 23, 2014. ""I’m saying I don’t support a $10.10 minimum wage. This is somewhat contradictory as her earlier comments suggested she saw no role for the federal government in setting the minimum wage. When we asked about it, Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel said Ernst believes that decisions about the minimum wage should be made ""locally, not in Washington."" Ernst believes that ""Iowans know what’s best for Iowa and that’s where these decisions belong -- on the state level."" July 2014 PolitiFact asked the Ernst campaign on July 31, 2014, about Ernst's position on the minimum wage. PolitiFact: ""Does she believe that the federal government should play any role at all in deciding the minimum wage? Or should it be left up to the states entirely?"" Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel: ""While in college Joni worked for minimum wage at Hardee’s and believes the minimum wage is a safety net. Joni does not believe in Washington’s one size fits all approach; that’s why any decision pertaining to the minimum wage rate going forward needs to be decided locally, not in Washington. What’s right for New York or California, is not necessarily right for Iowa."" PolitiFact: ""In a couple of debates and interviews she refers to the minimum wage as a 'safety net.' What exactly does she mean by that?"" Hamel: ""The baseline minimum wage that has been set."" Our ruling Braley said that Ernst does not support a ""national minimum wage."" Ernst's public statements have been confusing at times, but overall, she has said repeatedly that states should decide the minimum wage, not the federal government. She's also called the minimum wage a ""safety net,"" and her campaign told us that by that she means the current baseline minimum wage.  Overall, we rate Braley's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/01/bruce-braley/iowa-senate-candidate-rep-bruce-braley-says-joni-e/

Chief Reese says if Portland were like Seattle, the bureau would have 300 more officers
","
Well, if you’re done comparing our farmers markets, bikeways and standards of living, Portland Police Chief Mike Reese has identified another battle in the ongoing Portland-Seattle War: The police-to-resident ratio.

Yep. In a recent appearance at the City Club of Portland, Reese noted that if Portland ""had the same staffing ratio as Seattle, we'd have 300 more officers in our department.""

Could we really be falling that far behind? Could our bike paths really be so superior or produce so much fresher but our police force so much smaller?

Naturally, we had to know.

We called up the Seattle Police Department and asked just how many officers our sister city to the north has. As of February 1, 2011, they had 1,338 sworn officers. That number includes everybody from patrol officers to detectives to assistant police chiefs.

According to the 2010 census, the city of Seattle is home to some 608,660 residents. Divide the number of residents by the number of officers and you get about one officer for every 455 residents.

To see how many officers Portland would need to have the same ratio you just need to take our population -- 583,776, according to the 2010 census -- and divide it by 455. Do that, and you get 1,283.

So, how many officers does Portland actually have? Well, according to bureau spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson, we have 981 sworn officers in all -- about 300 fewer than we’d need to hit Seattle’s ratio.

Reese is right. We have about 25 percent fewer officers than we would need to match Seattle’s ratio. That percent difference holds up when you consider just the number of patrol officers, too. (Seattle has some 550 patrol officers -- one for every 1,106 residents -- to Portland’s 392 -- one for every 1,490 residents.)

But before we pronounce this a case closed, let’s consider one other variable: The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro-area population is some 3,400,000* strong while the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metro-area population is roughly a third smaller at 2,200,000.

The reason that has anything to do with Seattle police staffing is this: Seattle’s day-time population -- the number of folks coming in for work and entertainment -- gives the city’s population even more of an edge over Portland’s.

Day-time population estimates for the 2010 Census haven’t been published just yet, but if we take a look back at the estimates from the 2000 Census they show Seattle’s population growing by more than 28 percent during the day, while Portland grew by 23 percent during the day.

If we keep those ratios, Seattle’s population reaches 781,519 and Portland’s jumps to 718,097. Rerun the numbers and Seattle has one sworn officer for every 584 ""day-time"" residents. In order to match that ratio, Portland would need 1,229 officers. We’re 248 officers short this time around. 
We just can’t win. At least, as Reese noted during the same speech, our crime rate is down to levels not seen since 1967.

Still, why are we lagging behind? Well, there are a number of variables here, but, perhaps most importantly, Seattle’s property-related revenue stream puts our own to shame.

All told, Portland has an assessed property value of nearly $45 billion. (The actual market value for Portland is about double the assessed value according to the Tax Supervising and Conservation Commission, but Measure 5 and related laws keep the taxable value depressed.)  Meanwhile, Seattle has an assessed property value of $123 billion -- nearly three times as much as we have to work with.

Portland draws about 40 percent of its budget from property taxes.

Whatever the case, it seems Reese is on to something here. If you take the population of each city, we’re short about 300 officers if we want to match Seattle’s resident-to-officer ratio. Even if you control for the number of people in the surrounding metro area, we seem to be lagging pretty considerably.

We rate this claim True.

Rep. Jean Schmidt says 32 of every 33 pregnant women who visit Planned Parenthood get abortions
","
Soon after taking control of the House of Representatives, Republicans opened a new front in the abortion war by attempting to block Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal money.

Federal law already prohibits tax dollars from paying for abortions, but Republicans argue that the $363 million that Planned Parenthood gets each year for Title X family planning services actually subsidizes abortions indirectly because money is fungible.

The April 14 measure that would have stripped federal funds from Planned Parenthood passed the House by a 241-185 margin but failed in a 42-58 U.S. Senate vote.

During debate over the bill, Democrats portrayed Planned Parenthood clinics as a major provider of many types of health services to low income women, while Republicans claimed that Planned Parenthood steers pregnant women into getting abortions.

""For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion,"" Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Cincinnati-area Republican, said in a speech in the House of Representatives.

That ratio got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. So we asked her office where the numbers came from.

Schmidt was president of Right-to-Life of Greater Cincinnati before she was elected to Congress and currently chairs the House Pro-Life Women’s Caucus. She referred us to reports produced by several anti-abortion organizations, including Americans United for Life, Concerned Women for America, Liberty Counsel Action, Family Research Council Action, and the Chiaroscuro Foundation.

All stated that roughly 98 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services to pregnant women consist of abortion. They derived their information from a March 2011 fact sheet from Planned Parenthood. That fact sheet says the group performed 332,278 abortions in 2009, referred 977 patients to other agencies for adoptions, and provided prenatal care to 7,021 patients.

The anti-abortion groups came up with the 98 percent figure by comparing the number of abortions to the number of procedures in the other two categories. Schmidt’s 32 out of 33 statistic works out to 97 percent - the approximate percentage her sources provided.

But there are problems with that calculation.

First, it assumes that pregnant women only go to Planned Parenthood for one of those three options.

Planned Parenthood representatives say that interpretation overstates the ratio of abortions among its pregnant clients. It ignores other statistics, such as the 1,158,924 pregnancy tests the group provided, and the fact that those 332,278 abortions were just 3 percent of the 11,383,900 total procedures that Planned Parenthood health centers provided that year to its 3 million patients.

Thirty five percent of its services consisted of providing contraception and another 35 percent consisted of testing for sexually transmitted diseases and treatment.

The fact sheet stats also don’t reflect the fact that only a tiny proportion of Planned Parenthood centers around the country provide prenatal care - just 63 out of more than 800, said Tait Sye, a spokesman for the organization. Those that don’t offer prenatal care refer pregnant women to other health care providers for those services, and Planned Parenthood doesn’t keep track of those referrals. And the 7,021 figure for prenatal clients that was used in the calculations doesn’t include pregnant women who went to Planned Parenthood for prenatal care and were sent to outside obstetricians.

The group doesn’t ""ask the pregnancy status of every woman that walks into Planned Parenthood,"" and plenty of pregnant women use the organization for other services, like breast exams, Sye said.  Consequently, he says it’s ""impossible to calculate an accurate percentage if you don’t know the total number of pregnant women it is based on.""

In an emailed statement, Planned Parenthood Vice President for Communications Stuart Schear called Schmidt’s assertion ""a meaningless and unverifiable statistic since Planned Parenthood does not collect information on the pregnancy status of every female patient who comes into our health centers.""

When Schmidt was asked about the points made by Planned Parenthood’s spokesmen, she said the group ""obfuscates the truth by comparing apples to oranges – or services to patients.""

""They say 90 percent of the services they provide are preventative, but more than 10 percent of their patients are provided an abortion,"" Schmidt said in an email. ""They say they don't know the number of pregnant women they serve. It shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Whether a patient is pregnant or not should be one of the first questions they ask.""  

Schmidt is correct that women of childbearing age are routinely asked whether they might be pregnant when they visit a doctor’s office. Sye acknowledged that Planned Parenthood’s intake form contains a question that asks whether female patients are pregnant. ""But, we don’t tally the number of women we see every year who are pregnant or not pregnant,"" he said.

PolitiFact recently fact checked a statement Sen. John Kyl made about Planned Parenthood. In that item we noted a few caveats that are worth repeating.
   
First, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of ""services"" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. So Schmidt does have a point about citing services, rather than patient numbers.
   
Second, it’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith.
   
What certainly is true is that without knowing the total number of pregnant women that Planned Parenthood sees, it is impossible to compute an accurate ratio for how many of them get abortions.

PolitiFact places the burden of proof on the speaker. In this case, Schmidt cannot meet that burden because information needed for that showing is unknown.

Anti-abortion groups and Schmidt can try to fill the information vacuum by using Planned Parenthood’s incomplete data to come up with their own number.  But that doesn’t mean that their number is correct.

The fact sheet shows that Planned Parenthood does a sizable number of abortions. But the ratio she cites (97 percent) is extreme.

Sye noted that just 63 out of more than 800 Planned Parenthood centers provide their own prenatal care. That means that pregnant women seeking prenatal care from more than 700 centers would be referred to outside providers.

Women seeking prenatal care are not likely to be seeking an abortion, and none of those women are included in the totals cited by Schmidt’s sources.

Schmidt’s claim also overlooks that pregnant women who ""walk into"" a clinic could be there for any reason, not just for pregnancy-related services.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Schmidt’s statement False.

Bill Maher says GOP proposal would limit seniors to $15,000 spending under Medicare
","During the April 15, 2011, edition of HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, the liberal host and his ideologically diverse panel had an animated discussion about a proposal to overhaul Medicare that has been offered by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Ryan’s plan was included in a budget resolution that passed the House on a near party-line vote earlier that day. Republicans argue that bold proposals like Ryan’s are needed to rein in rising federal debt, while Democrats counter that the Ryan’s proposal for Medicare is too radical.

Here’s what Maher said. (For purposes of clarity, we’ve cut a few interjections by other panel members.)

""This Ryan plan for Medicare … is to … get rid of Medicare as we have known it, give seniors a $15,000 voucher to buy Medicare, which probably does not cover the health costs for a lot of seniors. Not to mention, what insurance company is going to want to sell insurance to a 75-year-old sick person? Well, what happens when you run out of the $15,000? You get sick and die. …

""What happens to a person, if this plan is enacted, who uses the $15,000 -- which, by the way, if they’re in an assisted living facility, they’ll go through it in three months -- what happens to them? What do they do when they use up the $15,000 by this time of the year? What happens for the rest of the year? What happens to them? What happens? I’m just asking. ...

""But this seems pretty black and and white. (What happens) if you have $15,000 to spend and you run out of the $15,000 and still have more days to live?""

A reader who watched the show asked us to check whether Maher had described the proposal accurately. So we did.

We turned to Ryan’s official proposal, but we found its description too general to fully compare it to what Maher had said. So we looked instead at an April 5, 2011, analysis of Ryan’s proposal released by the Congressional Budget Office. CBO is Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of fiscal matters.

According to CBO, Ryan’s proposal would ""convert the current Medicare system to a system of premium support payments."" People who turn 65 in 2022 or later ""would not enroll in the current Medicare program but instead would be entitled to a premium support payment to help them purchase private health insurance."" (People who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare.)

This premium support payment is similar (though not identical) to a voucher. With the payment in hand, beneficiaries ""would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange,"" CBO says. ""Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age.""

The size of the premium support payment would vary depending on the beneficiary’s health status and income. The payment for 65-year-olds in 2022 would average $8,000 -- roughly the same as the federal government currently pays for 65-year-olds in traditional Medicare (when calculated by subtracting beneficiary premium payments from the government’s Medicare outlays). The payment to beneficiaries would increase annually according to the general rate of inflation and the beneficiary’s age. The premium support would be reduced for those in the top 8 percent of the annual income distribution.

CBO says that the ""projected net federal spending per capita for all people age 65 and older in traditional Medicare would be about $15,000 in 2022.""

That appears to be the source of Maher’s $15,000 figure. That’s an average for all Medicare beneficiaries over 65 in 2022, so there would actually be quite a bit of variation in the amount paid to various beneficiaries. But that's not the basis for our ruling.

Our takeaway from Maher’s comments is that he believes the elderly would have $15,000 to spend on health care overall, and if that money were to run out, they’d be out of luck. As Maher put it, what would happen ""if you have $15,000 to spend and you run out of the $15,000 and still have more days to live?""

Problem is, that’s not an accurate portrayal of how Ryan’s plan would work.

The average Medicare beneficiary in 2022 wouldn’t have $15,000 to spend on all health-care-related expenses. They’d be given $15,000 to purchase a health insurance plan. That plan, in turn, would pay at least part of their medical bills. That plan might have limits and co-pays and deductibles -- as current Medicare does -- but the money the plan could spend on any given beneficiary’s health expenses would not be capped at $15,000 per year. The $15,000 limit only refers to what the government will pay for the insurance plan itself.

We don’t take a position on whether the Ryan prescription for Medicare is good or bad policy. There’s a debate to be had, for instance, over whether $15,000 will be enough to purchase a good insurance plan for Medicare beneficiaries, who are older and sicker, on average, than Americans as a whole. And according to CBO, the typical 65-year-old would be responsible for a bigger share of costs -- including premiums, deductibles and co-payments -- under Ryan’s plan than under traditional Medicare, due to such factors as higher administrative costs (including profits) for private plans and a slower increase in the government’s contribution over time than the rate at which medical costs increase.

Still, we think that Maher’s basic description of what Ryan’s proposal would do -- which was essentially unchallenged by his fellow panelists -- misleads viewers who are unfamiliar with Ryan’s proposal. So we rate his comments False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/20/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-gop-proposal-would-limit-seniors-1/

Democrats say Republicans voted to end Medicare and charge seniors $12,000
","
A new political ad from Democrats shows seniors running a lemonade stand, cutting the grass, and even stripping at a bachelorette party -- all to raise money to pay for Medicare.

The stripper, dressed as a firefighter, bellows, ""Did someone call the fire department? Because it's about to get HOT in here!"" The young women throw money at him while he dances around with a pink feather boa. (See the ad here.)

""Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care,"" the ad says, ""because Republicans voted to end Medicare.""

So do grandparents have to go back to work because of a Republican vote? Not really.

The Republican proposal explained

The ad critiques a budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee. Ryan’s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline, and it has widespread support in the Republican caucus.

One of the its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries contribute premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes.

Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would receive ""premium support,"" which means they would buy plans from private insurance companies with financial assistance from the government. People who need more health care would get a little more money. Some call this a voucher program, but the proposal says it’s not a voucher plan, because the government would pay the insurance companies directly.

The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards to be set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium support to high earners.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found that it will save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for insurance.

""A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare,"" the CBO concluded.

Ryan says the plan would offer more choice for Medicare participants and increase competition among private insurers to drive down cost.

What the ad gets wrong

Yes, the Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, have said they are strongly opposed to the plan.

But to say the Republicans voted to end Medicare, as the ad does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year.

Republicans say that future spending projections for Medicare are not sustainable, and the program requires changes. Their proposal ""protects and preserves Medicare -- with no disruptions -- for those in and near retirement and provides those now under the age of 55 with a strengthened, personalized Medicare program they can count on when they retire,"" said Conor Sweeney, a spokesperson for House Budget Committee.

Democrats, though, contend that the proposal would change the essential nature of Medicare as a guarantee of health coverage for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office released a detailed analysis of the proposal, and concluded that future beneficiaries would pay more for current levels of coverage, and that some will decide to go without any insurance.

The Republican proposal will end the aspect of Medicare that directly covers specific services, such as hospital coverage. ""It's as if you took the Office of Faith-Based Partnerships and ended the faith-based portion of it, but continued to call it faith-based,"" said Jesse Ferguson of the DCCC. ""There is no doubt that Medicare -- a health insurance program for seniors --  would end under the House Republican plan and, according to the independent Congressional Budget Office, health insurance costs would rise for seniors.""

Democrats, including Obama, have said the plan would end Medicare ""as we know it,"" a critical qualifier. But the 30-second ad from the DCCC makes a sweeping claim without that important qualifier . 
Another problem with the ad is that it claims that participants would have to find $12,500 to pay for Medicare. That number is based on statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The ad doesn’t mention, though, that the number includes money that would go to Medicare in any case. The CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute about $6,150 in premiums in 2022 if the program isn’t changed at all. So the extra money seniors need to pay under the Republican proposal is more like $6,350.

Still another problem with the ad involves who’s immediately affected by the Republican proposal. In one scene, the ad shows a senior citizen pushing a walker behind a lawn mower. A teenager looking on eats an apple and says, ""You missed a spot."" In reality, people 55 and older won’t see changes under the Ryan plan. It’s actually that teenager -- or anyone else 54 or younger -- who would pay extra money when they are older.

And finally, the ad neglects another critical fact: The Republicans voted on a budget resolution that states policy preferences, but the vote did not actually change Medicare, much less end it. As we’ve noted before in previous fact-checks, budget resolutions are non-binding documents that cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law. Deeply desiring something and accomplishing it are different.

We ran this by Richard Kaplan, an elder law expert at the University of Illinois, who agreed the Republicans have not voted to end Medicare.

""Nobody voted to end it,"" he said. ""They voted to hopefully change it one day, when they get a chance, but they would need a Republican-dominated Senate and a Republican president, neither of which they have.""

""It’s not as if this is of no consequence. But it doesn’t change Medicare,"" he said.

Our ruling

Both Republicans and Democrats would no doubt agree that Ryan’s plan for Medicare is a dramatic change of course. But we don’t agree with the ad’s contention that the proposal ends Medicare. Additionally, images in the ad imply that current seniors will have to go back to work to pay for changes to the program. That’s not true either. It’s actually those 54 and younger who will need extra money. With its scenes of seniors going back to work, it seems intended to frighten those who are currently enrolled in Medicare. Finally, the Republicans' vote was symbolic and didn’t actually change the program. When you add up all those distortions, we find the ad highly misleading.

The ad’s aged firefighter says, ""Did someone call the fire department? Because it's about to get HOT in here!"" We agree. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2011/apr/20/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-republicans-voted-end-medicare-and-c/

Internet sweepstakes cafes: gambling loophole or illegal gambling?
","
A Pinellas County legislator is at odds with his local sheriff over whether an Internet sweepstakes cafe the lawmaker has opened is against the law.

State Rep. Peter Nehr's business, Fun City Sweepstakes sells phone cards.

But as the St. Petersburg Times reported on April 20, 2011, for every $1 a person spends on a card, they also get 100 sweepstakes points to use at one of the business' 45 desktop computers. The computers can simulate the spinning images of a casino slot machine. You spin, and win, or lose. If you win, you can collect the winnings from the cashier.

Pinellas County Sheriff Jim Coats says he believes the sweepstakes businesses constitute gambling.

""As far as I'm concerned, they are illegal,"" Coats said.

But Nehr disagrees.

""This is a legitimate business that has been vetted and found to be completely legal in the state,"" he told the Times. ""I'm entitled like anyone else to open a legal business to earn money for my family.""

Nehr sounded so sure about his business -- saying that it ""has been vetted and found to be completely legal"" -- that we wanted to check it out.

Our analysis concludes the law is murkier than Nehr lets on.

Let us explain.

Gambling is currently illegal in Florida except in places where it is specifically permitted -- dog and horse tracks and on Indian land. Nehr's business, and others like it across the state, operate not as gambling businesses but instead offer promotions for purchasing a service. Nehr says it's like McDonald's restaurants that sell sodas with a scratch-off, or Monopoly tickets.

But in the case of Fun City Sweepstakes, Nehr gives customers who purchase a phone card an opportunity to win a casino-style sweepstakes game.

In 2007, the police chief of Cedar Grove, near Panama City, wrote to then-Attorney General Bill McCollum about a similar sweepstakes parlor to ask whether the business was violating state gambling laws as set out in state statutes.

McCollum responded, basically, that it's not clear.

""The machine or device that is the subject of your inquiry may be a gambling device within the scope of section 849.16, Florida Statutes. Moreover, the sweepstakes involved may be a lottery. Both of these enterprises are illegal in the State of Florida. Gambling activities may not be disguised as a 'game promotion' under the terms of section 849.094, Florida Statutes, in an effort to avoid the criminal sanctions attendant to violations of Florida's gambling laws,"" McCollum wrote.

""In sum, it is my opinion that a determination of whether a particular game or contest violates the provisions of Chapter 849, Florida Statutes, is initially a determination that must be made by local law enforcement based on the particular facts of each case. If the Tel-Phone (the game specifically cited in the Cedar Grove case) game does contain an element of chance inherent in the machine which determines the outcome of the game, the game may be characterized as a slot machine within the meaning of section 849.15, Florida Statutes. However, this office recognizes that the ultimate determination of whether Florida's gambling laws may have been violated must be made by local law enforcement agencies.""

The ambiguity has left law enforcement and prosecutors in a tough spot. The fundamental question: Is it worth the time and effort and resources to prosecute a business that may or may not be breaking the law?

So members of the Florida Legislature are considering legislation that would ban the type of business altogether.

Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, has sponsored HB 217 to prohibit the use of simulated gaming for promotional purposes. (His bill is moving through the committee process, while a Senate companion has yet to be heard.) A legislative analysis of the bill provides an excellent overview of the issue. The analysis of the bill says there are questions over the legality of the sweepstakes games, and that different counties have handled them differently.

Seminole County, for instance, passed an ordinance to ban all simulated gambling devices -- though that ordinance is being challenged as an unconstitutional limitation on free speech. Other counties, including Baker and Leon, have considered ordinances that ban the games.

There have been just a few cases involving Internet sweepstakes cafes brought to court. And no one has been found guilty of gambling charges.

In Marion County, the owners of an Internet sweepstakes cafe like Nehr's were found not guilty on gambling charges in October 2010, the Ocala Star-Banner reported on Oct. 18. ""We're going to see if the State Attorney gets the message,"" said Kelly Mathis, the Jacksonville attorney who represented the sweepstakes cafe owner. ""They (prosecutors) put on their best case, and they still can't show there was a violation of criminal law.""

Other cases in Marion and Sumter counties were either dismissed, or prosecutors decided against pursuing a conviction.

In an April 2011 case in Brevard County, the state dropped felony gambling charges against an Internet sweepstakes cafe owner in exchange for the business owner agreeing to plead no contest to a misdemeanor count of not properly advertising her sweepstakes promotion.

No case has been reviewed by an appellate judge.

Where does this leave us? Nehr said his Internet sweepstakes cafe is ""a legitimate business that has been vetted and found to be completely legal in the state.""

Yes, it's true that no one has been found guilty of a crime for running a business like Nehr's, and some in the Legislature are trying to make the games explicitly illegal. But that doesn't mean the games themselves have been found to be completely legal. McCollum, the former attorney general, issued an opinion saying they might be illegal, and many think that, in fact, they are.

Some 40 death row inmates awaiting death warrant from governor, Democrat claims
","
Speaker Dean Cannon's proposal to create separate criminal and civil divisions of the Florida Supreme Court passed the House 79-38 on April 15, 2011, but not before Democrats and Republicans argued over an alleged purpose of the court expansion -- the handling of death penalty cases. 
Cannon wants to expand the Supreme Court from seven to 10 members, and then separate them into two five-member panels. One panel, including the three most senior judges (appointed by late Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles) would serve on the criminal side, while the four justices appointed by Republicans would serve on the civil division. Gov. Rick Scott would appoint nominees to fill the other three slots.

Republicans argue the expansion is needed to help settle death penalty cases more expeditiously -- 393 people currently are waiting on Florida's death row.

""Unreasonable delays plague state post-conviction review, and there is little Florida's current Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process,"" Cannon, R-Winter Park, wrote in an April 14 op-ed article in USA Today. (We previously checked -- and rated True -- Cannon's claim that more people die on death row of natural causes than are executed.)

But Democrats say the appeals process isn't necessarily what's slowing down death penalty cases.

In remarks on the House floor, Rep. Geraldine Thompson, D-Orlando, said the governor's office is as much, if not more, to blame.

""The proponents argue that the Florida Supreme Court should be split because it will allow them to expeditiously resolve capital cases that have languished in the court,"" Thompson said. ""The facts are the Florida Supreme Court has a capital caseload that is lower this year than last. The facts show that approximately 40 persons on death row have had all of their appellate review completed and await only the governor's signature on a death warrant to end the case.

""Perhaps the proponents should pass legislation requiring a governor to sign a death warrant within 60 to 90 days after all appellate review has been denied, if their concern is 'disposing' of death penalty cases.""

Are 40 people, more than 10 percent of the current case back-log, waiting on the governor to sign a death warrant?

After checking with several agencies, including the Supreme Court and the Department of Corrections, we were directed to the state Commission on Capital Cases, a body created in 1997 by the Legislature to provide oversight on the administering of death penalty cases. Legislators and judges serve as members of the commission, which also has a full-time staff. (Interestingly, another bill passed by the House would eliminate the commission.)

The commission keeps a list of what it calls warrant-eligible inmates, said commission executive director Roger Maas. He explained to us that the list covers inmates who have exhausted both their state and federal appeals.

That makes the next step toward execution the signing of a death warrant and setting of an execution date, Maas said.

A note: For the most part, the governor has discretion over issuing death warrants. In other words, he picks who and when. In fact, the governor can sign a death warrant for any prisoner sentenced to death, though those warrants likely will be stayed until the state and federal appeals process is complete. And the signing of a death warrant can and often does trigger potential additional appeals -- though if no new information is presented, the appeals are more delay tactics. (The Supreme Court can issue a death warrant, based on an application from the attorney general's office, if the governor has committed an ""unjustified failure"" to issue a warrant).

Maas provided us with his warrant-eligible inmate list as of April 7, which you can see for yourself here.

According to the commission, 47 inmates currently have exhausted their appeals and the next step is for the governor to sign a death warrant.

The list includes Gary Alvord, for instance, who has been on Florida's death row since April 1974 and is awaiting a death warrant. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, has been awaiting execution for 37 years.

But many experts say he will never be executed. Alvord has a history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts. 
Since 1979, 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year.

Craig Waters, a spokesman with the Florida Supreme Court, said there is no limit to how many death warrants a governor can sign. But governors have signed just a handful a year despite the backlog of inmates awaiting execution.

Gov. Charlie Crist signed six death warrants in his four years in office. Gov. Jeb Bush signed 24 death warrants in the preceding eight years. Of those 30 inmates, 26 were executed. Of the other four, two inmates had their death sentences vacated, one died while awaiting execution, and one inmate's execution was stayed by Bush.

Scott has yet to sign a death warrant since taking office.

During arguments against a proposal to expand and split the state Supreme Court, Thompson said ""approximately 40 persons on death row have had all of their appellate review completed and await only the governor's signature on a death warrant to end the case."" According to the Commission on Capital Cases, the number sits at 47. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/20/geraldine-thompson/some-40-death-row-inmates-awaiting-death-warrant-g/

Rep. Marcy Kaptur says G.E. pays no taxes and creates no jobs but makes record profits
","
Certain companies make natural targets for people who believe that multinational conglomerates  game the United States tax system while the proverbial little guy can’t catch a break

That’s why Rep. Marcy Kaptur brought up the names of certain companies while explaining her demand for fairness as Congress debated spending cuts.

""I’m willing to support a package that is balanced,"" Kaptur, a Toledo Democrat, said during an April 6 interview on ""On Point,"" a public radio show, when host Tom Ashbrook, asked what level of federal spending cuts and policy compromises she’d accept.

Pointing to what she thinks is an imbalance, she cited the case of General Electric, ""which hasn't really created any jobs in this country, doesn't  pay any taxes and they're making historic profits.""

Her comments stood out because General Electric’s federal income taxes have been a matter of  dispute. Did the Connecticut-based company, with $14.2 billion in earnings, avoid paying any U.S. corporate income taxes for 2010? A New York Times examination  March 24 said so, noting in detail the tax-avoidance lengths -- all legal -- to which the company goes. Kaptur’s communications director, Steve Fought, says that Kaptur was referring to that article when making her comment.

Yet that article has come under attack, and not just from GE. Another investigation, by the nonprofit journalism organization ProPublica and co-published with Fortune magazine, says the Times went too far. Due to various deductions, credits and an ace tax accounting team, GE got a $3.2 billion ""tax benefit,"" both investigations found. But ""tax benefit"" is a financial term that is not the same as a tax refund or negative tax balance.

So does GE ""not pay any taxes,"" as Kaptur said?

GE pays other kinds of taxes. But we believe that those following this issue -- especially public radio listeners -- knew that Kaptur meant income taxes. She was using a kind of shorthand that’s well known in public policy circles when discussing corporations’ avoidance and the way some shelter profits overseas.

What is not disputed is that heavy losses from its financial unit, GE Capital, played a big role in helping GE avoid all U.S. income taxes for calendar year 2009. Forbes reported on this this last year and GE told us in an e-mail that ""the total company lost money on its U.S. operations"" in 2009.

But Forbes suggests the Times was wrong about GE’s taxes for 2010. The Columbia Journalism Review sides with the Times, however. And Henry Blodget, a financial blogger and analyst who runs Business Insider, concludes that ""GE is still trying to find a way, any way, to talk its way out of this.""

Our own discussions by phone and e-mail with GE spokeswoman Anne Eisele may illustrate why this is so hard to pin down.

Eisele said in an e-mail: ""We will file our 2010 tax returns by September. We expect to have a small, positive U.S. federal income tax liability."" The figures reported elsewhere are based on pre-payments and projections.

But that’s not quite the same as what GE said in a recent web statement: ""GE paid significant U.S. income tax in 2010 and in total from 2006-2010."" And AFP, an international wire service, reported that when it inquired about the dispute, Eisele replied in an e-mail  saying, ""GE did not pay U.S. federal taxes last year because we did not owe any.""

Confused?

Add to that confusion something Eisele told us: ""In 2010, GE paid significant federal income taxes for prior years."" Presumably, that would mean GE paid taxes during 2010, but not for the 2010 tax year -- and presumably not for 2009 because GE reported that it lost money on U.S. operations that year.

GE is not legally obligated to say what it actually paid or didn’t. You could put GE’s statements together like a jigsaw puzzle and the pieces seem to fit, but the statements are nuanced, qualified and at times legalistic.

Given all this, we are going to hold this part of Kaptur’s claim in reserve. We’ll come back to it if the picture gets clearer.

But what about Kaptur’s claim that GE ""hasn’t really created any jobs in this country?""

We turned to what we thought would be a reliable measure: GE’s annual 10-K filing, a self-reported, audited examination of its performance that it turns in to the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also looked at some of its annual reports to investors.

In 2010, GE had 133,000 employees in the United States. In 2004, it had 165,000. The declines occurred every year, totaling 32,000 jobs lost in six years. If you went back even further you’d see more domestic job shedding.  

Meantime, the company’s foreign employment has shot upward. In 1996, GE had 84,000 workers in foreign countries. The number reached 172,000 by 2007 before dipping to 154,000 in 2010. GE itself has said it: There were growth opportunities abroad.

Thousands of these job losses were the result of layoffs. Eisele attributed about 4,000 of them to the financial crisis and its effect on GE Capital. But she also said that since the beginning of 2009, ""GE has announced plans to create nearly 7,000 new U.S. manufacturing jobs through 2013."" She provided us with a list of those announcements, which listed 6,465 new jobs with GE plus others in support of a GE-related smart energy project. Furthermore, ""GE's three largest industrial businesses (Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare) grew U.S. jobs 31% over the decade,"" Eisele said.

But, even with these upcoming gains, GE will not employ as many people in the United States as it did in 2008. The expansion would create a blip, not a total comeback.

Yet there is more to consider, Eisele said. About 33,000 jobs since 2004 are no longer on GE’s books because their divisions were sold or spun off, she said. ""Those jobs weren't cut; they moved to other companies,"" she said.

Add those 33,000 people back into the equation and the number of workers rises to 166,000.

This math works in GE’s favor, because in 2001, GE reported 158,000 workers in the United States, and 165,000 in 2002. It gives credence to a GE assertion -- that if you factored in the dispositions, ""GE's U.S. employment has increased from 2001 to 2010.""

But wait: It you decided to compare 2000 with 2010 -- going back just a year further -- a funny thing happens: GE winds up showing a loss again, even if you add those dispositions back in.  We wanted a more precise accounting of job spin-offs by year so we could do a more exacting comparison, but Eisele said she did not have ""that level of granularity"" available.

So how do we gauge Kaptur’s claim that General Electric ""hasn’t really created any jobs in this country?""

Using GE’s own filings to shareholders, Kaptur is correct. Backing out some of those losses because employees simply moved from GE’s books to successor companies’, the answer is: GE has mostly held steady since 2001 -- but not since 2000 or 1999. Getting precision beyond GE’s SEC filings requires, well, granularity.

Kaptur made one more claim about GE -- that ""they’re making historic profits.""

That’s false. GE reported $14.2 billion in continuing operations before taxes in 2010. But it was significantly higher in 2008, at $19.8 billion, and it was $27.52 billion in 2007.

So, on the first part of Kaptur’s claim, the jury is still out.

On the second part, GE’s self-reported numbers back her up. GE provided rough numbers that could point to a different conclusion, but it depends on the years selected. Short of much better detail -- if the company wants to go granular, we are here awaiting -- we go with the precise numbers the company reported to the SEC.

But Kaptur is wrong on the third part of her claim. While $14.2 billion is a lot of money, it set no GE record.

When arrows compete for opposite poles, the Truth-O-Meter turns to the only place it can: Half True.

Tax burden overwhelmingly on wealthy, congressman says
","
Some of you may have come to work bleary-eyed Tuesday and angry at Uncle Sam.

You procrastinators waited untl the last minute to file your income taxes, which were due by midnight Monday.

In honor of the tax deadline, Tom Graves, a congressman from northwest Georgia, began sending out messages last week about the current tax system. One message, posted on his Twitter page, caught our attention.

""America's wealthiest 25 percent pay 86 percent of total income taxes. Wealthiest 5 percent pay 60 percent of total income taxes,"" the message said.

If you’re part of either of those income classes, you may be really upset now. That’s the point most fiscal conservatives are making as President Barack Obama proposes ending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans as part of his debt reduction plan.

""This is not because we begrudge those who’ve done well -– we rightly celebrate their success,"" Obama explained in a recent speech. ""Instead, it’s a basic reflection of our belief that those who’ve benefited most from our way of life can afford to give back a little bit more.""

The top 5 percent have an annual adjusted income before taxes of about $160,000 or more. The top 25 percent have an annual adjusted income before taxes of about $67,000 or more.

Instead of trying to figure who’s right about whether the rich pay their fair share in taxes, we wanted to know whether Graves’ facts were correct.

Our friends at the PolitiFact national site found that U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., slipped up while talking about the subject in a recent television interview on ""Today.""

Bachmann, who is considering a run for president, said, ""The top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government."" The top 1 percent of income earners (people making more than $380,000 a year before taxes) did in fact pay 39.5 percent of individual income taxes in 2007, but they paid 28 percent of all federal taxes in 2007.

That’s a meaningful distinction because, as a general rule, the burden of the income tax is tilted heavily toward the upper end of the income spectrum, while the payroll tax burden -- another major federal tax -- is paid somewhat more evenly by poor and rich alike. PolitiFact rated Bachmann’s claim False.

Graves, by contrast, avoided Bachmann’s linguistic error. His spokesman, John Donnelly, directed us to a report by the Internal Revenue Service that was completed this past winter, based on 2008 data. The report shows that the top 5 percent of taxpayers paid 58.7 percent of federal income taxes. The top 25 percent of taxpayers paid 86.34 percent of total income taxes.

The National Taxpayers Union keeps a chart of such data on its website, and its spokesman said Graves’ math is accurate. The group supports the Republican proposals to cut the federal debt, which includes spending cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicare and no tax increases.

""The [tax] burden is inordinately high on the top 50 percent of income earners,"" spokesman Doug Kellogg said.

Eric Toder, a veteran tax expert at the centrist to liberal Urban Institute, said his organization analyzed income tax rates for 2010 and also found similar numbers to what Graves put on Twitter. Toder noted that the current annual income cap on Social Security is $106,800, which is less than what the top 5 percent of earners pay. Obama said Tuesday that he wants to raise the income cap on Social Security.

Graves was off by a percentage point in relaying the figure for the top 5 percent, but both of his numbers are very close to the IRS data. And while using only the federal income tax as a stand-in for the total federal tax burden paints a somewhat skewed picture, Graves was careful to make his words in the tweet accurate. So we rate his claim as True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/20/tom-graves/tax-burden-overwhelmingly-wealthy-congressman-says/
"['National', 'Pundits', 'Taxes', 'Chris  Hayes']","
Journalist Chris Hayes says the ""average American pays about 22 percent of their income to federal taxes.""
","As tax filing day approached on April 15, 2011, Chris Hayes of the liberal magazine The Nation, said on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show that the super-rich pay less of their income toward taxes than average Americans do.

""Conservatives, in arguing against taxes going up (for) the wealthy, want you to focus on what percentages of all income taxes are paid by the wealthy,"" Hayes told Maddow. ""Maybe your conservative co-worker sent you an e-mail about this, or your kid's baseball coach, or your right-wing dad. ‘The wealthy pay all the income tax in this country. Everyone else is just along for the ride.’

""The sleight-of-hand here is that's just income taxes. Middle class and working class and poor people pay payroll taxes and they pay sales taxes. They paid tons of state and local taxes. They pay their fair share.

""The wealthy, on the other hand -- look at what's happening to their marginal tax rate over the last five decades. Does that pattern look familiar at all? What we've been seeing, the central fact of the American economy over the last several decades is an increase in inequality with more income going to the people at the very top. At the same time, the people at the very top have seen their tax burden decrease.

""This week, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston published a great article called Nine Things the Rich Don`t Want You to Know About Taxes. In it, I learned for the first time that every year, the IRS conducts this study of the 400 wealthiest tax filers. And what the data revealed recently is remarkable. According to Johnston, the average American pays about 22 percent of their income to federal taxes. The richest 400 Americans, 16 percent, pay about 16 percent of their income to federal taxes.""

We wondered whether Hayes’ description of the statistics was accurate. So we first took a look at the document he referenced.

The document, compiled annually by the Internal Revenue Service, takes a close look at the 400 tax returns with the highest level of adjusted gross income during a given year. The most recent available data covers 2007.

The document shows that the 400 top-earning tax returns pulled down a total of $137.9 billion during the year, and that those taxpayers shelled out $22.9 billion in federal income taxes. That works out to a 16.6 percent tax rate. So by this measure -- which, we’ll note, only addresses federal income tax, not federal payroll taxes -- Hayes is close.

We then used the same method to calculate the tax rate for the nation as a whole. Americans paid $1.116 trillion in income tax during 2007, on adjusted gross income of $8.688 trillion. That works out to a tax rate of 12.8 percent. The rate is slightly higher if you use a different figure as the denominator -- adjusted gross income from all the returns for which tax was due, as opposed to all returns that were filed, some of which resulted in no taxes owed. Using the second, more limited figure, the tax rate is 13.8 percent.

Still, using either figure, the tax rate is lower for Americans as a whole than it is for the top 400. What gives?

When we contacted Hayes, he said he relied on Johnston’s work. So we contacted Johnston, and he provided us with his calculations, as well as an explanation of how he put the statistics together.

What Johnston did is to create a separate tax model to determine the tax burden for a single worker at the median wage -- an individual worker who earned $26,000. Johnston proceeded to use standard income tax rules to determine what this taxpayer would owe. Unlike the IRS calculation, Johnston also factored in the payroll tax. He found the individual’s total tax bill would be $6,084 -- 23.4 percent of the worker’s cash wage, and 22.3 percent of the worker's total income.

His number for the top 400 was close to what the IRS had found -- he adjusted it slightly upward to account for payroll taxes. Johnston’s final tax rate for the top 400 was 16.9 percent.

So, based on these numbers, Hayes’ statement would be essentially correct.

However, this is not the only way to look at the figures.

For starters, the top 400 compilation included tax returns of all sorts -- couples with kids, couples without kids and individuals. But Johnston’s comparison is to an individual.

Individual tax returns amount to a plurality of all tax returns filed, but they’re not a majority. In all, 46 percent of returns are individual returns, 38 percent are joint or surviving spouses, 15 percent are for head of household and 2 percent are married filing separately. This means that a modest majority of returns are for multi-person households.

Why is this important? Because a childless individual can’t claim child tax credits or additional personal exemptions that could reduce the individual's tax rate. So if you looked instead someone who’s married with a couple of kids, they would likely have a lower tax rate than the 22 percent Johnston found.

In an e-mail conversation, Johnston said Hayes made a reasonable statement.

""To compare the average of the top 400 for whom we have actual data against the model example of a single worker at the median is entirely reasonable,"" he said. ""To compare the top 400 to ‘America as a whole’ is ludicrous. That includes some people whose incomes are negative and some who make almost a million dollars a day. Since Hayes wrote about the average and I wrote about median, then the reasonable comparisons would be to compare to the median income ($33,000) or the median household income from Census (approaching twice that) or the median wage worker, as in my example.""

If anything, Johnston said, Hayes understated the number, considering that data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggests that the middle 20 percent of the population has an overall tax burden closer to 30 percent.

""What is the point of these comparisons? It is to show that by the classic, standard method of measuring tax burdens the system is no longer progressive,"" Johnston said, adding, ""If you want to pick lint have at it.""

So where does this leave us? We agree with Johnston that simply using the IRS calculations -- income tax paid divided by adjusted gross income -- isn’t a perfect solution either, because among other things it doesn’t include the payroll tax, and, as Hayes noted in the interview, payroll taxes are borne more heavily by lower- and middle-income Americans.

But while Johnston’s calculation may be ""reasonable,"" it isn’t the only reasonable way to make the comparison. Describing an individual filing singly as ""the average American,"" as Hayes did, means focusing on a type of filer with relatively high tax rates, compared to families. Just as the United States has ""people whose incomes are negative and some who make almost a million dollars a day,"" average Americans also include people who are married and have kids, and who in turn benefit from tax breaks that reduce what they owe.

We understand that Hayes was relying on an expert tax journalist for his numbers and that the numbers as they were calculated are correct. But the calculation was based only on one of type filer, so we do think that it’s important to add context to his comment. We rate his comment Half True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/19/chris-hayes/journalist-chris-hayes-says-average-american-pays-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Taxes', 'Joe Walsh']","
Rep. Joe Walsh said that every time we've cut taxes, revenues have gone up, the economy has grown
","Members of the tea party movement like to say the ""tea"" stands for ""taxed enough already."" Several House members on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour said they stand by that sentiment, even if tax increases could more quickly balance the budget. Amanpour asked if it was realistic to oppose tax increases while also calling for a balanced budget. ""Can you really sustain what everybody is calling for, just by cuts in public services? Doesn't there need to be revenue-raising mechanisms?"" she asked.

""Christiane, you raise revenue by growing the economy,"" said Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill, one of several new House members elected with tea party support. ""And everything this president has done the last two years has gone against that. You get taxes and regulations off the backs of businesses so that revenues can increase.""

""I know that that is your position,"" Amanpour said. ""But there's so much evidence, even going back to Ronald Reagan, where he did tax cuts and in fact the debt increased, and then he had to make tax increases. I mean, can you really cut public spending by that amount and just expect to balance the budget?""

Walsh answered, ""In the '80s, government revenues went up. We didn't cut spending. Revenues went up in the '80s. Every time we've cut taxes, revenues have gone up, the economy has grown.""

We decided to check out Walsh’s claim that ""Every time we've cut taxes, revenues have gone up, the economy has grown."" We should first note that on its face, Walsh’s statement is not accurate. The White House Office of Budget and Management publishes detailed tables of government collections of income taxes. There was a small dip in 1983, after President Ronald Reagan signed off on a tax cut in 1981, though tax revenues increased the next year and all through the 1980s. More significantly, income tax revenues fell in 2001, 2002 and 2003, as President George W. Bush successfully pursued tax cuts.

We contacted Walsh’s office, and his staff told us that the Bush tax cuts didn’t reach their full impact until 2003 (when the top rate decreased to 35 percent, where it now stands), and that tax revenues increased after that.

""The pickup in economic growth, and the strong growth in revenues, coincides fairly neatly with the 2003 tax cut,"" said spokesperson Elizabeth Lauton via e-mail.

But the question of rising revenue is more complicated than that.  For one thing, economists expect tax revenues to go up each year due to economic growth, population growth and inflation, even if tax rates stay the same. So saying ""revenues have gone up"" isn’t particularly meaningful in that context.

Given that, it would be more significant to be able to say what effect tax changes have on the overall economy. But this isn’t easy, because so many things affect the economy more than the federal tax code. What this means is that you can raise taxes during a bad economy and get less revenue, or you can cut taxes during a time of economic growth and get more revenue.

Those changes to revenue generally aren't caused by the tax rates at all, but by other changes in the broader economy. President Bill Clinton, for example, raised taxes in 1993, and the economy expanded for much of the 1990s and tax revenue went up.

""There's no clear relationship between taxes and economic growth,"" said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""Too many factors complicate the picture to draw clear conclusions about the taxes-growth relationship.""

Additionally, a 2006 report from the U.S. Treasury Department concluded the effect of most tax laws on the wider economy were ""uncertain, but probably generally small.""

Previously, we’ve rated statements that tax increases lowered revenues, and we’ve found that False. Walsh’s statement stops short of such a claim, but it does leave the impression that tax cuts could help the budget picture, and that’s problematic.

The 2006 Treasury report sought to document the revenue effects of every major tax law passed since 1940. To compare the different laws, it examined tax revenues as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, a measurement that accounts for economic growth and inflation.

The report found that laws that lowered taxes produced declines in revenues, and that laws that increased taxes produced increases in tax revenues. This undermines claims that tax cuts can actually increase government revenues more than they would have increased otherwise.

We’re examining Walsh’s statement, ""Every time we've cut taxes, revenues have gone up, the economy has grown."" He said ""every time,"" and that’s not the case. Revenues did not go up in 2001, 2002 or 2003, after tax rates were lowered. We also find it problematic to make hard claims about tax cuts growing the economy enough to increase tax revenues and helping balance the budget. Overall, we rate Walsh’s statement False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/19/joe-walsh/rep-joe-walsh-said-every-time-weve-cut-taxes-reven/

Ward Armstrong says Appalachian Power wants a 10 percent rate hike
","
House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has been fighting Appalachian Power Company for two years.

Apco won the last round in January, when Republicans in the House of Delegates squashed two Armstrong bills aimed at returning Virginia to its old system of electric utility regulation. Energy lobbyists and the company, alongside Dominion Virginia Power, argued that most of Apco’s price increases in recent years would still have been permitted under the old system and that no change was needed.

Armstrong’s latest salvo came March 31, the same day Apco announced it was seeking a series of rate increases in Virginia. He took to Twitter to vent his frustration.

""Apco wants another 10% rate increase. The compensation package for CEO Mike Morris rose 22% to $8.7 million in 2010,"" Armstrong wrote.

Armstrong has botched up the facts in past attacks on Apco, so we took a look at his latest claims.

Apco announced in a March 31 press release it was seeking to raise rates by ""about 10 percent"" for 2012 through a series of rate filings. The actual increase, if granted in full by the State Corporation Commission, which oversees utility regulation in Virginia, would be 9.6 percent. Under the new rate, Apco says, customers would pay $104.99 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours.

The company has discussed its proposed rate hikes with Armstrong and other politicians representing Apco customers.  Del. Anne Crockett-Stark, R-Wytheville, told The Roanoke Times that she and other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will oppose the company’s rate request when the SCC holds its hearings.   

Under Virginia’s utility regulations, companies can adjust the ""base rate"" they charge customers every two years. But they also can can also file separate ""rate adjustment cases,"" or ""RACs"" at any time. RACs are designed to cover certain changes in costs, such as a sudden increase in fuel prices -- primarily coal in Apco’s case -- or changes in the cost of meeting environmental regulations.

The company requested and received a hefty rate increase for environmental costs about two years ago. In January hearings on Armstrong’s bill, Apco executives said the money was needed to meet stricter air pollution mandates from the Environmental Protection Agency. The utility was adding new air ""scrubbers"" that reduced the amount of pollution, especially sulfur dioxide, released by its coal-fired plants.

Apco customers complained that between the biennial base rate increases and RAC changes, they never knew what they would be charged month to month. The company said it has decided to bundle the base rate case and three RACs together this year to avoid that problem, with the aim of altering rates once and then leaving them in place for an extended period of time.

In the current request, the firm wants to boost its base rate by about 6.3 percent, then tack on a 3.2 percent increase for environmental costs and a 0.5 percent increase to meet voluntary standards on renewable energy investments. After a slight decrease in generation rates, the requested increase comes to 9.6 percent.

So Armstrong’s right about the size of Apco’s requested increase, but what about the CEO’s salary?

First, we should note that Michael Morris is not the CEO of Apco, as Armstrong implies. Morris is the CEO of American Electric Power, Apco’s parent company. AEP serves about 5.3 million customers in 11 states, including Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The company operates through several different subsidiaries; Apco serves AEP’s customers in Virginia and West Virginia.

Armstrong took the salary information from an article by The Associated Press, which reported that Morris received total compensation of $8.7 million in 2010. The AP said that was a 22 percent increase from 2009.

The AP’s salary calculations are based on a company’s annual proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The calculation includes any salary, bonuses and perks, as well as the estimated value of stock options given to the executive in a given year. The AP does not include the change in value of an executive’s pension. That figure is usually included in an executive’s reported salary.

According to AEP’s 2010 proxy, Morris was paid $9 million in 2010, up from $7.5 million in 2009. That’s an increase of 20 percent. Morris made $10 million in 2008.

AEP does not disclose the salary for Charles Patton, Apco’s CEO.

Let’s review our findings.

Armstrong’s right that Apco has requested a roughly 10 percent rate increase. The actual request is for a 9.6 percent jump, but even the utility said ""about 10 percent"" in its press release.  

Readers could easily conclude from his message that Mike Morris is Apco’s CEO. That’s not the case; Morris is actually CEO of American Electric Power, Apco’s parent company. But Armstrong does cite Morris’s 2010 salary, and the increase from 2009, accurately. The salary figures for Apco CEO Charles Patton are not available.

Gov. John Kasich says new state labor law doesn't cut worker pay, pension or health care
","
Opponents and supporters of Ohio’s new collective bargaining law are preparing for a possible referendum in November that would decide whether the controversial measure stays on the books.

So it’s no surprise Republican Gov. John Kasich, a proponent of Senate Bill 5, immediately began defending the law after he signed it on the last day of March.

The law will sharply reduce public workers’ collective bargaining rights.

Unions have declared the law an attack on Ohio’s middle class. Kasich rejects the argument that it will damage public workers’ livelihoods.

""In this bill that I’ve just signed, we don’t cut anybody’s salary. We don’t take away their pension. And we don’t destroy their health care,"" Kasich said March 31 in a interview with Sean Hannity on the Fox News Network.

Campaigns for and against SB 5 are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars to sway voters should opponents of the new law collect enough signatures to put the referendum on the ballot. Kasich himself sent an e-mail to supporters promoting passage of SB 5 and seeking campaign donations.

With such a passionate debate on the horizon, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Kasich’s characterization of SB 5.

Before we get into the specifics of Kasich’s claim, it is important to remember a few things:
  
Now let’s begin.

We’ll break this down into thirds, examining how SB 5 affects pensions, health care and worker salaries. We relied on interviews and an analysis of the 444-page bill by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission to reach our conclusions.

 Impact on pensions

Kasich was correct when he said the bill does not take away worker pensions. The new law could affect amount employees contribute toward their pension plans. It does not change pension benefits in any way, nor does it grant management new authority to do so.

Many public workers contribute 10 percent of their salary toward their pension while the employer contributes 14 percent of the a worker’s salary. Some unions, however, have negotiated deals where the employer pays a portion of the employee contribution. If an employer agreed to pay 2 percent of the worker share, for example, it would pay 16 percent of the worker’s salary and the worker would pay 8 percent.

Senate Bill 5 prohibits the practice, known as a ""pension pick-up."" So Kasich is correct to say the bill does not ""take away"" any worker’s pension. Some workers who benefited from pension pick-ups, however, would have to pay more of their pension contributions under SB 5.

Impact on health care

Kasich says the bill does not ""destroy"" workers’ health care. The governor is correct here too because the bill does not change health care benefits. It limits the share of the premiums that the public employer can pay toward those benefits.

The new law bars public employers from paying more than 85 percent of health care coverage costs. That leaves at least 15 percent to employees. State workers currently pay 15 percent of their health care costs, but many other public workers pay less. While SB 5 will shift health care costs onto some workers, it does not ""destroy"" benefits.

Impact on wages

The shifts in pension and health care contributions could have a direct effect on wages. If the new law shifts a bigger share of retirement and health care costs onto workers, they’ll want higher wages to make up the difference so their take home pay remains intact.

Kasich said ""we don’t cut anybody’s salary.""

In a literal sense, he is correct. SB 5 does not set new salaries for public workers. But the new law effectively wipes out salary schedules in past labor contracts and directs cities and unions to agree to new salary structures that assign pay raises based on job performance.

Kasich other supporters often tout the leverage the new law provides local governments to control labor costs. Management gains a new edge under SB 5 through the reduction of public workers’ collective bargaining rights, a ban on striking and a new system to resolve labor disputes that favors employers.

So while Kasich has said the bill does not cut workers’ pay, he also has promoted SB 5 as a tool to control labor costs.

Which is it? Critics say the answer is obvious.

""Something has to give somewhere,"" said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for We Are Ohio, an anti-SB 5 group collecting signatures to put the bill on the fall ballot. ""The only possible way for these local governments to save money is to eliminate jobs or reduce wages. There’s no other way.""

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols insisted the bill ""doesn’t prescribe wages,"" so it is inaccurate to conclude SB 5 cuts workers pay. But reduced pay is a near certainty in some communities.

Kasich says the bill ""didn’t cut anybody’s wages,"" but some key points are missing from that statement:

Group says Republican legislator behind the call for drastic cuts
","
It’s not even election season, but a recent political ad has generated quite a bit of buzz.

Our Oregon, an organization backed by several unions and other progressive groups, released an ad attacking Rep. Dennis Richardson. The Central Point Republican has a target on his back because he sits on the Legislature's budget committee.

In the ad, titled ‘Priorities,’ Our Oregon rips into Richardson for ignoring seniors and children.

Here’s the ad’s text in full:

""It's tough out there for middle class families. But Dennis Richardson and the Republicans voted to give tax breaks to corporations. Now Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities. But what could be more important than the health and safety of seniors and our children's future. call your legislators. tell them to get their priorities straight.""

There’s a lot in there -- most all of it the House Republicans find objectionable -- but, per our methods, we have to pick one statement. We’ll go with ""Now Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities.""

The ad is referencing the proposed budget put forth by the Legislature’s budget committee, so let’s start there.

First some background: The Legislature’s budget writing committee is composed of both representatives and senators. Generally, it’s led by two co-chairs, one from each chamber. This year, though, with an evenly divided House, there are three co-chairs: one from the Senate, two from the House.

Richardson is the only Republican of the three men who control the committee. The two others are Democratic Sen. Richard Devlin from Tualatin and Rep. Peter Buckley from Ashland.

Generally, after the Oregon governor releases a proposed budget, the co-chairs set to work crafting their own. The Legislature then spends time adjusting the proposals to create something that will pass both chambers and win the governor’s signature.

This time around, the co-chairs -- after considerable negotiation -- presented a framework budget of about $14.6 billion. The budget actually offers schools some $140 million more than what Gov. John Kitzhaber suggested in his own proposal.

(All told, school funding will remain flat -- it’s not being cut. Of course, the cost of education rises each year, meaning Oregon won’t get the same amount of services for the same amount of money in the next biennium as it did in the current. Human services, meanwhile, will face a shortfall as a result of lost stimulus money.)

Somewhat controversially, the co-chairs decided to leave $444 million in reserve funds alone. Unions, and many Democratic lawmakers, feel that cash should be used now. The funds, they say, were meant to help out in bad times; these are bad times. Others believe it offers a cushion. If the burgeoning economic recovery stalls, the state will have some money to fall back on. Without the cash on hand, the state would need to reduce services.

Any guess where Our Oregon stands on the issue? Yep, they think the co-chairs should be tapping into that reserve. Hence the ad.

With that in mind, there are a few things wrong with the ad. Most important: This is not just Richardson's doing. Sure, he had a seat at the negotiating table. But the ultimate proposal was a bipartisan effort. To single him out isn’t accurate. At least two others ultimately decided that, for the purposes of compromise, the Legislature should set aside some cash for an even rainier day.

As Harry Esteve recently reported in The Oregonian: ""He and his fellow co- chairs, Sen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, and Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, argued for a hefty cushion of reserves, worried that recent hikes in oil prices could spur another recession. If the economy improves, dollars could be added to the budget when the Legislature meets again next year, they said during a Capitol news conference.""

That’s right, all three men -- two Democrats, one Republican -- were there selling the legislation.

We called Our Oregon to ask about the discrepancy here. Scott Moore, the spokesman for the organization, said the co-chair proposal ""was an agreement signed by the Democratic co-chairs basically under duress.""

He pointed to a House Democrats press releasewhen the budget proposal was unveiled that begins by pledging to ""advocate for using a greater share of the $444 million in reserves"" and then a Senate Republican releasethat says they are ""generally positive about the new direction and tone set by the state budget proposal.""

(Two House Democrats have since introduced two bills that would tap into those reserves giving an addition $100 million to schools from the Education Stability Fund and $75 million to health care and public safety from the Rainy Day Fund.)

""There's clearly a great deal of support among the Republican caucus,"" Moore said. House Democrats seem to think funding needs to be higher.

While that may be true, it still doesn’t make this proposal any more Dennis Richardson’s than it does Peter Buckley’s or Richard Devlin’s. What’s more the Senate Democrats recently voted unanimously in favor of the education spending bill that mirrored the co-chairs’ proposal.

As the House Republican spokesman Nick Smith says, ""The levels of spending in the education budget, human services, public safety, each of the areas that are pointed out in this television ad, were all the result of bipartisan negotiation and compromise.""

We agree. Sure, these next two years will be harder for social services and public education -- but that’s a result of an anemic economy not a cut-happy Republican. Moreover, this budget represents a consensus, not one man’s vision.

We find the claim that ""Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities"" to be False.

Austin resident says fluoride compound added to local water supply is ""toxic waste""
","
In a letter to the editor published in the March 18 Austin Chronicle, Mike Ford suggests Austin residents have reason to question whether fluoridated water is safe.

""How many would be comfortable if they knew that the fluoride Austin is putting into our drinking water is fluorosilicic acid (toxic waste from the fertilizer industry) that the city buys from Lucier Chemical Industries?"" his letter states.

Eww.

Ford, an Austin resident, is part of Fluoride Free Austin, which has urged the city to stop putting fluoride in drinking water. On March 22, a City Council committee took testimony on the practice--and at least one speaker referred to the chemical additive as an industrial toxic waste, according to video of the hearing placed online.

Ford answered our request for backup by forwarding information from various sources including a November 2009 memo from an assistant city manager to Austin’s City Council stating that after voter approval, the Austin Water Utility began adding fluoride to the water supply Feb. 2, 1973; the council can change the practice by majority vote.

Nationally in 2008, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 195.5 million people (72.4 percent) on public water systems had access to ""optimally fluoridated"" water, up from 69 percent of individuals on public water supplies in 2006.

The Environmental Protection Agency regulates how much fluoride that drinking water should have. The current recommended range is 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams (parts per million) per liter of water, though the EPA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans in January to consider setting the limit at the low end of the current standard, 0.7 milligrams.

Peter Silva, an EPA water administrator, said: ""EPA’s new analysis will help us make sure that people benefit from tooth decay prevention while at the same time avoiding the unwanted health effects from too much fluoride.""

One health effect is dental fluorosis, which the agency’s announcement says ""may occur with excess fluoride consumption during the tooth-forming years, age 8 and younger. Dental fluorosis in the United States appears mostly in the very mild or mild form – as barely visible lacy white markings or spots on the enamel. The severe form of dental fluorosis, with staining and pitting of the tooth surface, is rare in the United States."" (It’s not rare in the Texas Panhandle, where groundwater is naturally high in fluoride.)

The city of Austin memo says the ""level of fluoride naturally occurring in the raw water supply for the City of Austin is 0.20 to 0.24 mg/l or parts per million. The Austin Water Utility adjusts the fluoride level to a range of 0.6 – 0.9 mg/l, averaging at about 0.75 mg/l. These values are well within the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines for optimally fluoridated water as well as being within the recommended range from (the World Health Organization).""

And what of the chemical compound cited in Ford’s letter? The memo says the fluoride product used is hydrofluorosilicic acid, which fulfills a standard ensuring ""purity of products for the control of potential adverse human-health effects from products added directly to the water during treatment, storage and distribution."" There’s no mention of fertilizer in the 17-page memo.

Next, spokeswoman Jill Mayfield of the water utility sent us a statement stating that the acid, also known as FSA, is supplied by Mosaic Chemicals, which she said has bought Lucier Chemical. Mosaic generally describes itself as the world’s leading producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash, two primary fertilizers.

Mayfield said hydrofluorosilic acid is ""derived from apatite which is a type of limestone deposit used in the production of fertilizers. The apatite is ground up and treated with sulfuric acid producing phosphoric acid (the main ingredient in the production of phosphate fertilizer) plus a solid and two gases. The two gases, hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride, are captured in water to form hydrofluorosilicic acid.""

An entry on Mosaic’s site aligns with Mayfield’s explanation. It says the vapor stream from the phosphoric acid reaction is scrubbed with water to form FSA from the naturally occurring silica and fluorine in the phosphoric acid.""

We ran Ford’s description of the acid as ""toxic waste"" past the company. Spokesman Rob Litt replied by e-mail: ""Many fluoridation opponents will cite the toxicity of the chemical in its concentrated form. This is a fallacy as no one is ingesting this concentrated form. By this rationale, these same individuals should also be opposed to Vitamin D, B6, A & E, which are all considered toxic in concentrated form.""

For more perspective, we contacted the CDC where Linda Orgain, a spokeswoman in its Division of Oral Health, said by e-mail that fluorosilicic acid ""is not toxic waste."" She pointed us to a CDC web page on water fluoridation with a section stating: ""All additives used at water treatment plants, including fluoride additives, must meet strict quality standards that assure the public’s safety. These additives are subject to a stringent system of standards, testing, and certificates by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute (NSF/ANSI). Both of these entities are nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations.""

Orgain added: ""There are no health implications for community water fluoridation – at the level used for community water fluoridation (currently 0.7-1.2 mg/L) fluoridation prevents and controls tooth decay – preventing about 25 percent of decay in children and adults, throughout the lifespan.""

We filled Ford in on our research. He replied that the acid purchased by water providers cannot otherwise be dumped in the ocean, inland waterways or landfills unless it’s contained: ""It’s toxic until they sell it to the city and then magically the city puts it in our water.""

Next, the CDC’s national water fluoridation engineer, Kip Duchon, said it’s ridiculous to call the water additive toxic waste. Duchon said the compound put in water comes from gypsum, a byproduct of phosphate-based fertilizer plants that often ends up piled in landfills. The compound results from a gas that’s isolated via vacuum extraction, he said, then quenched with water, making the acid.

Per Ford’s point about pouring the acid into bodies of water, Duchon replied: ""It’s no different than any other acid (undiluted) that would kill everything in the lake. It would be irresponsible of anyone to capriciously or arbitrarily dump . any chemical in a water body.""

Duchon said the acid becomes toxic at concentrations of more than 100 milligrams per liter, over 100 times the concentration in Austin’s water. He said he was aware of one episode involving such a toxic error involving a small community’s water well; an Alaska man died.

Ford urged us to seek more on the compound’s toxicity from Neal Carman, also a participant in Fluoride Free Austin. Carman said a loophole in federal environmental law makes it possible to sell the compound so long as it’s going to be diluted. Then, he said, it’s no longer considered a hazardous waste.

We were unable to confirm or disprove this claim; Mosaic’s description of the acid it ships to Austin says it’s corrosive but stable when stored properly.

At the EPA, spokesman Richard Yost said by email that in ""water at levels used for fluoridation, hexafluorosilicic acid hydrolyzes essentially completely to fluoride ions and various forms of silica... Various forms of silica and silicates occur in nature as sand and do not represent any health hazard.""

Yost said the fluoride compound put into Austin’s water is not on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act list of ""hazardous constituents"" nor is it on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s hazardous materials transport list.

Finally, we asked city officials to speak to Ford’s ""toxic waste"" reference.

Philip Huang, medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, said it’s misleading and inflammatory to call the acid, which he calls a byproduct, toxic waste. Staff toxicologist Janet Pichette said the key issue for any substance is concentration. Even too much water ""could kill you,"" she said.

Last gulp: Ford’s statement accurately notes that the water utility buys the acid that fluoridates Austin’s drinking water from a fertilizer maker. Yet there’s no reasonable support for calling the the same acid toxic waste; it’s not poisonous at its concentration in the water. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/19/mike-ford/austin-resident-says-flouride-compound-added-local/

U.S. Rep. Broun said FDR had aides learn socialism from Stalin
","
The U.S. is marching toward socialism, Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens says. During last week’s scrum over the federal budget, he lectured Congress for 45 minutes on why.

Broun blamed Supreme Court justices, for instance, who he said have ""no clue"" about the Constitution. He called out President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, architect of the New Deal, the massive package of economic and social programs designed to bring the country out of the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Roosevelt strove to import the socialism of Soviet Union dictator Josef Stalin, Broun said. In fact, Broun said, he sent emissaries to learn from the dictator himself.  

""Franklin Delano Roosevelt sent his advisers, his close-held friends, his Cabinet people, to go visit with Stalin in communist Russia to study what ... Stalin was doing there so that FDR could replicate it here in the United States,"" Broun said on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. ""And he did everything he possibly could to do so.""

This was like no version of history your PolitiFact Georgia scribes studied. Was Roosevelt in cahoots with Stalin, a murderous despot, to bring communism or socialism to the United States?

Certainly, Roosevelt expanded the federal government greatly. He created the popular Social Security program and started the Works Progress Administration, which employed millions in public works projects as wide-ranging as building bridges and documenting folk culture.  

We contacted Broun’s office and asked for proof. His spokeswoman referred us to ""The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression,"" a 2007 book that is critical of New Dealers.

We read it. It does not even suggest Roosevelt sent his aides to Stalin to learn about communism.

""The Forgotten Man"" does say that some future New Dealers visited the Soviet Union on their own in 1927, more than a year before Roosevelt became governor of New York and some five years before he won the presidency. Some were inspired by Russia in their New Deal work.

Its members dubbed the trip ""the first non-Communist, unofficial American trade union delegation.""

The contingent included professors, labor leaders, lawyers and writers. They were not sent by Roosevelt, and the trip took place before Stalin’s purges of the 1930s.

""The Forgotten Man’s"" author, Amity Shlaes, a senior fellow in economic history at the Council on Foreign Relations, was hesitant to criticize Broun but said his specific claim is not accurate.  

The trip to the Soviet Union resembled more recent junkets to China, especially those in the 1980s, Shlaes told PolitiFact Georgia. People have been willing to overlook China’s poor human rights record and the lack of democracy out of excitement for the country’s economic possibilities. Russia played that role for the world in the 1920s.
 
""These particular people are not traitors,"" Shlaes said of the visitors to the Soviet Union.  

Other experts were more critical of Broun.

Thomas Remington, an Emory University professor who has written numerous books and articles on Russian politics, called Broun’s comments a ""malicious, scurrilous lie.""

""It’s so deeply misguided that it is an astonishing statement,"" Remington told us.

Remington said the United States had diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, so American officials in that country did send intelligence to Roosevelt, much as the Central Intelligence Agency does today.

As president, Roosevelt had some awareness of Stalin’s brutality, and he was not willing to replicate his approach in the U.S., Remington said. Roosevelt attempted to implement policies to make capitalism stronger, although Remington acknowledged that some thinkers believe those policies ""were in small measure, socialism.""

Susan Butler, author of ""My Dear Mr. Stalin: The Complete Correspondence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph V. Stalin,"" is working on her second book about the relationship between the two men. She called Broun’s claim ""a whole bunch of hooey.""

Butler said none of Roosevelt’s domestic or foreign initiatives aimed to bring socialism to the U.S. The United States needed trade partners as it emerged from the Great Depression and allies to form an international peacekeeping organization after World War II. Roosevelt built a relationship with Stalin to achieve these goals, she said.   

""This,"" she said of Broun’s speech on the House floor, ""has no relation to the truth.""

To sum up:

The book Broun’s spokeswoman said supported his version of history did not. Its author said she knew of no evidence that Roosevelt sent his aides to study communism in the Soviet Union to ""replicate it here in the United States.""

Future New Dealers did travel to the Soviet Union -- five years before Roosevelt was elected president. Roosevelt did not send them, much less assign them to learn about socialism.  

At the very least, the claim is inaccurate. Two experts we consulted said it made no sense.

Broun needs to brush up on his history before he gives his next lecture. False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/19/paul-broun/us-rep-broun-said-fdr-had-aids-learn-socialism-sta/

President Obama says Republican Medicare plan would cost people $6,400 more in 10 years
","
In his April 13, 2011, speech on his vision for America’s fiscal future, President Barack Obama quickly went on the offensive against the Republican deficit-cutting budget proposal championed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a plan that passed the House in a partisan vote two days later.

Obama was particularly critical of Ryan's controversial proposal to dramatically overhaul Medicare. While Medicare benefits would remain as they are now for people 55 and older, when those younger than 55 reach retirement, the traditional Medicare system would be replaced with ""premium support"" payments that would subsidize the purchase of private insurance plans.

""It’s a vision that says America can’t afford to keep the promise we’ve made to care for our seniors,"" Obama said. ""It says that 10 years from now, if you’re a 65-year-old who’s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today.  It says instead of guaranteed health care, you will get a voucher. And if that voucher isn’t worth enough to buy insurance, tough luck – you’re on your own. Put simply, it ends Medicare as we know it.""

This $6,400 figure has become a White House talking point and is sure to be repeated often as the 2012 campaign heats up, so we thought we'd better take a look.

We'll begin by explaining how Obama arrived at the number. It's based on an analysis of the Ryan plan by the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that those who get premium support payments in 10 years will end up paying substantially more for their health care than if Medicare is left as is.

According to the CBO analysis (see page 20 -25), under the Ryan plan, the $8,000 premium support voucher in 2022 would cover 39 percent of the cost of the average private plan for a 65-year-old. Which means the plan actually costs about $20,500 and that beneficiaries would be on the hook for about $12,500 of the cost.

The CBO also presented estimates for an ""alternative fiscal scenario"" –- which incorporates ""several changes to then-current law that were widely expected to occur or that would modify some provisions of law that might be difficult to sustain for a long period."" Under this scenario, the typical beneficiary who enrolled in traditional Medicare would pay about 30 percent of the cost of the average private plan in 2022, or about $6,150. In other words, the increased amount the 65-year-old would have to pay would be about $6,400.

The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which did an analysis of the CBO data, came up with the same numbers as Obama. So did the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Republicans don't contest that's what the CBO numbers are.

But Obama left out an important fact, said Stephen Spruiell, a spokesman for the Republicans on the Committee on the Budget: ""Elsewhere in the letter, CBO makes clear that the comparison is making unrealistic assumptions in order to construct a future for Medicare under the status quo –- a future in which Medicare goes bankrupt, seniors suffer from reduced access to care, and the nation enters a debt crisis.""

Indeed, the CBO clearly states that both of its scenarios, by keeping benefits largely as they are, would create ""pressures over the long term that would make them difficult to sustain."" Without Medicare reform, the CBO warned ""the government’s debt would skyrocket to levels unprecedented in the United States."" That would result in either rising tax rates or ""surging federal debt."" And that, in turn, might lead lawmakers to reduce Medicare benefits.

Said Spruiell: ""Comparing our plan to save Medicare to an unsustainable status quo means comparing a real plan to a false reality. The president’s comparison is not valid, because he ripped the CBO number out of context and omitted the director’s clear warnings about the unsustainability of the status quo.""

Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, said the CBO also does not take into account the behavioral changes that Ryan's plan would likely encourage.

Right now, she said, all the pressure is on the providers. But under the Ryan plan, more of the burden shifts to the consumers. If it is set up as it is for federal employees, there would be a wide range of plans, at a wide range of costs. And people will be able to shop around and change every year, Wilensky said.

""This gets people looking and being involved in a way that they haven't been,"" she said.

Consumers will be highly motivated to migrate to cheaper plans, she said, and there will be more competition among providers.

The CBO often gets it wrong when it comes to predicting behavioral change, Wilensky said. For example, she said, the Medicare part D prescription drug program has proven to cost about 40 percent less than government projections. The CBO did not predict the market competition caused by people using private drug plans, she said.

""So be cautious of the CBO numbers,"" she warned.

So where does that leave us with Obama's claim that the Republican plan ""says that 10 years from now, if you’re a 65-year-old who’s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today""?

That number is based on a CBO analysis of the Republican plan. Republicans rightly point out that the CBO warned that unless major reforms are made to the Medicare program, it could lead to skyrocketing public debt, which might ultimately lead to pressure on legislators to reduce Medicare benefits.

In his speech, Obama used the lower of two CBO estimates of costs, one based on some anticipated changes in Medicare. And he did not argue for the status quo on Medicare.

""We will change the way we pay for health care -– not by the procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to prevent injuries and improve results,"" Obama said. ""And we will slow the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission of doctors, nurses, medical experts and consumers who will look at all the evidence and recommend the best ways to reduce unnecessary spending while protecting access to the services that seniors need.  

""We believe the reforms we’ve proposed to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid will enable us to keep these commitments to our citizens while saving us $500 billion by 2023, and an additional $1 trillion in the decade after that,"" Obama said. ""But if we’re wrong, and Medicare costs rise faster than we expect, then this approach will give the independent commission the authority to make additional savings by further improving Medicare.""

Whether that approach will succeed is a matter of political debate. Obama has accurately portrayed the consequences of the Republican plan, at least according to the CBO analysis. It's a long-term projection -- which always carries a degree of uncertainty, and some, like Wilensky, argue that the CBO fails to adequately account for the behavioral changes the plan would encourage, which might drive costs substantially lower. (We should note that some Democrats believe the CBO has consistently underestimated health care cost-saving initiatives contained in the controversial health reform law passed last year.) 
But the bottom line is that under the Republican plan, those who reach 65 in 10 years would pay more out of pocket for private health care. That's the idea, to reduce the cost of the Medicare program to the government. Republicans argue it the most responsible way to make the program fiscally sustainable. Obama argues that cost is too high and that savings can be achieved in other ways. Again, that's a matter of political debate. The CBO compared the Republican plan to the status quo and to a somewhat modified Medicare. The CBO says either scenario would cause crushing debt, and would likely encourage legislators to cut Medicare benefits in the future. Obama too, is proposing reform. Obama's figure is close to what the CBO estimated in one scenario -- the least costly one -- that the Republican plan would cost consumers in 10 years compared to what seniors pay today. As a result, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/18/barack-obama/president-obama-says-republican-medicare-plan-woul/

Michele Bachmann says top 1 percent pay 40 percent of all federal taxes
","
In an April 13, 2011, interview on NBC’s Today show, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., offered a striking statistic describing how much of the tax burden in the United States is borne by the wealthy.

In the interview, host Matt Lauer cited a deficit-reduction plan offered by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and asked why it included a major restructuring of Medicare but protected tax cuts for upper-income Americans.

""If that's on the table, then why shouldn't the burden be equally shared?"" Lauer asked. ""Why shouldn't we put some of that burden on the wealthy and corporations?""

Bachmann responded, ""Well, remember, again, already the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government. So if you want to talk about fairness, the top 1 percent are paying 40 percent of all of the income.""

We wondered whether she was right that ""the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government.""

The most recent hard data on this question comes from the 2007 tax year. It can be found in a Congressional Budget Office report released in 2010. CBO’s report shows what share of the federal tax liability was carried by various income groups. Here’s the rundown of the federal tax burden for the top 1 percent:

Federal income taxes: 39.5 percent share
Federal payroll taxes: 4.1 percent share
Federal corporate taxes: 57.0 percent share
Federal excise taxes: 4.7 percent share

Total federal tax share for the top 1 percent: 28.1 percent

So -- using 2007 numbers at least -- Bachmann is off by quite a bit. She’s even further off if you use an estimate for 2010 by the centrist to liberal Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which pegs the share of all federal taxes for the top 1 percent at 22.7 percent.

Bachmann would have been right if she’d said, ""the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all income taxes into the federal government."" But she didn’t say that -- and even if she had, her decision to focus on income taxes, rather than looking at the whole federal tax picture, would have presented the numbers in such a way that wealthier Americans would look more heavily taxed than they are.

As a general rule, the burden of the income tax is tilted heavily toward the upper end of the income spectrum. The payroll tax burden is also tilted toward the upper end, but the payroll tax differential for rich vs. non-rich  is not quite as great as it is for the income tax. For instance, the top 20 percent paid 86 percent of the income tax, but 42.9 percent of the payroll tax. Also, the Social Security portion of payroll tax applies only up to $106,800 in income. Meanwhile, the middle 20 percent of earners paid 4.6 percent of federal income taxes in 2007, but 16.6 percent of payroll taxes.

So for critics of taxes -- and Bachmann certainly is one -- it packs a greater wallop to cite income tax burdens for the wealthy than it does to cite their overall tax burden. But in this case, she didn’t define the statistic she was using correctly. So we rate her statement False. 
Update: The original version of this story said, ""Also, the payroll tax applies only up to $106,800 in income, with no tax on earnings above that limit."" It should have noted that the income limit applies only to Social Security taxes.",/factchecks/2011/apr/18/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-top-1-percent-pay-40-percent/
