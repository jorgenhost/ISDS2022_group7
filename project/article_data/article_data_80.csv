Facebook post shares flawed COVID-19 survival statistic
","An unsourced but seemingly optimistic statistic on the survival rate of the novel coronavirus in the United States is making a splash on Facebook. ""Current survival rate for COVID19 in the US is 98.54%. Let’s share this story. Positive vs. Panic,"" it reads. The post, which was shared in mid-April, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The figure isn’t too far off from what databases are reporting right now in terms of the known fatality rate from the disease. But the figures from this developing pandemic are preliminary, and it’s important to note that the best calculations include people who are still sick — patients who have neither died nor recovered. Also, while a 98.5% survival rate might sound promising, it really isn’t. Even a 1% mortality rate (99% survival rate) would mean that a disease is 10-times more lethal than the seasonal flu. If everyone in the country contracted COVID-19, that rate would lead to about 3,300,000 American deaths. Let’s look at the numbers. Our World in Data, a collaboration between researchers at the University of Oxford and the nonprofit Global Change Data Lab, uses the case fatality rate to calculate the mortality risk of the disease. Case fatality rate is the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases.  Using that rate, the database shows that the current mortality rate in the U.S. is 5.9%, which puts the survival rate at 94.1%. Johns Hopkins University, which uses the same method, currently lists the U.S. rate at 6%. But even these researchers acknowledge that during a pandemic, the rate of case fatalities is a ""poor measure of the mortality risk of the disease."" That’s partly because the actual number of cases is hard to determine without widespread testing. ""One, it relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed; and two, it relies on the total number of deaths, and with COVID-19, some people who are sick and will die soon have not yet died,"" Our World in Data researchers wrote in an article. ""These two facts mean that it is extremely difficult to make accurate estimates of the true risk of death.""  Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that the ability to calculate accurate recovery rates hinges on having access to credible data.  ""The survival rate depends on how well we understand the denominator,"" Mina wrote in an email. ""We need to be looking at denominators from good serological surveillance to know the true numbers infected. Additionally, we should consider the infection fatality rate in the context of demographics like age.""  Infection fatality rate is the number of total deaths from a disease divided by the total number of cases — as opposed to the confirmed deaths and cases.  Mina also explained that the data varies sharply when looking at a weighted average of fatality rates for specific age groups: ""So, a one-number-fits-all value for the infection fatality rate doesn’t really make too much sense given the major skew in the data."" Even the 94% rate is a flawed statistic amid an ongoing pandemic. Data is incomplete and government agencies and organizations vary in how they collect and report it.  Rates that include ""total cases"" or ""confirmed cases"" should also be considered preliminary, because many outcomes aren’t known yet: These patients may recover, or they might not. We did find one coronavirus tracking database that singles out the number of deaths among resolved U.S. cases that have had outcomes. Worldometer, a private statistical resource that collects data from official reports, shows that about 289,100 COVID-19 cases in the United States are considered closed as of May 7, 2020. Of those, around 213,500 people have recovered, and about 75,500 have died, according to the database. This represents a 74% survival rate. But this, too, may be off and will continue to fluctuate daily. A Facebook post says the ""current survival rate for COVID-19 in the US is 98.54%."" This is problematic for several reasons. In an ongoing pandemic with incomplete numbers, mortality rates should be viewed with caution. There are a slew of factors to take into account such as variations among demographic groups that skew data, a lack of testing, and the number of active cases.  Even discounting these factors, based on current projections, the 98.54% figure is incorrect. If you include all the confirmed cases, the number is about 94%. And while both numbers may sound high, they indicate a fatality rate that is more than 10 times that of the seasonal flu.   Ultimately, declaring an accurate U.S. survival rate will be difficult until most cases are resolved and more complete and accurate data is released.

Do immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in New York City?
","When President Trump announced a plan to suspend immigration to the United States, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted the news with her own assessment of the decision: ""Immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City,"" the Democrat wrote April 21. ""They're on the front lines of the battle against this pandemic. I stand with our immigrant communities now and always."" With so much dependent on the group of people that have become known as ""essential workers,"" we wanted to look closer at Gillibrand’s statement to see if the numbers support it. Immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City—they're on the front lines of the battle against this pandemic. I stand with our immigrant communities now and always. https://t.co/3KvPLoztko We found that while the statistics on this question are a little murky, one credible study does reinforce her assertion. Gillibrand’s communication’s director, Evan Lukaske, told PolitiFact that the senator was defining essential worker based on the way the New York City comptroller's office defined ""frontline workers"" in its March 26 report, ""New York City’s Frontline Workers."" The comptroller’s report defined New York City’s COVID-19 ""frontline workers"" as grocery, convenience, and drug store workers; public transit workers; trucking, warehouse, and U.S. Postal Service workers; health care workers; child care, homeless, food, and family services workers; and cleaning service workers. On March 20, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, and the New York State Department of Economic Development issued a guidance on the term ""essential worker,"" and it listed several categories of worker who would not be covered under the categories used in the comptroller’s report, including those working at airports, certain types of manufacturing enterprises, hardware stores, funeral homes, animal shelters, and banks. Notably, the comptroller report’s ""frontline worker"" category includes only ""direct-service, mostly non-governmental employees,"" meaning that it doesn’t count most types of public employees. As a result, the report does not take into account police officers, firefighters, and other first responders. So while Lukaske said that Gillibrand ""is using ‘frontline’ and ‘essential’ as synonymous, there is a discrepancy between the two terms, and an alternate definition could end up changing the demographic profile. That said, the comptroller’s report provides one reasonable definition. So what does the report’s analysis show? According to the comptroller’s study, more than 53% of frontline workers are foreign-born, meaning they’re immigrants. Of the sectors studied, building cleaning services employs the highest share of immigrants at 70%. It is followed by health care and food and drug store workers, both at 53%.   Other studies have backed up the broader proposition that immigrants make up a significant portion of essential workers. The Center for Migration Studies of New York, a think tank on international migration, has estimated that 1.8 million immigrants in New York state work in jobs the state considers ""essential businesses."" The think tank found that foreign-born workers make up 31.5% of workers in essential businesses in New York state, despite only representing 28% of the state’s overall labor force. (It is logical that New York City’s percentage would be higher, since immigrants represent a higher share of the population in the city than in the rest of the state.) Nationally, immigrants make up a ""sizable"" share of essential workers in the fight against the pandemic, said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute. The group estimates that 6 million immigrants are working frontline jobs in health care, food production, and transportation, and another 6 million immigrants work in industries such as food services and domestic household services. ""You can assume that an immigrant-rich area like New York City might have higher shares of immigrants than the U.S. average in particular occupations,"" she said. Meanwhile, U.S. Census Bureau data shows that immigrants represent about 45% of the total workforce in New York City. That’s in line with Gillibrand’s assertion, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center. Gillibrand said that ""immigrants make up a majority of essential workers in places like New York City."" This number is backed up by a New York City comptroller’s office study that found that 53% of all ""frontline"" workers in the city are immigrants. However, the comptroller office’s definition, which doesn’t include government workers such as first responders and which differs from the state’s definition of ""essential workers,"" is only one way of analyzing the data, and other methods might produce a lower percentage. We rate the statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/may/07/kirsten-gillibrand/do-immigrants-make-majority-essential-workers-new-/

News outlets did not use photo of same boy to report on 3 COVID deaths
","Amid a pandemic that is believed to affect elderly people most severely, the deaths of several young people from COVID-19 around the world have drawn special attention — and generated misinformation. A post on Facebook falsely claims that different media outlets misused a boy’s image to report that he died from the coronavirus three times in three different countries. The post shares a collage of screenshots of various news reports that appear to include the same image. The text above reads: ""Child dies in 3 countries of corona virus.""  The photo depicts Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a 14-year-old Portuguese boy who died at the end of March after testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The Portuguese newspaper Record wrote about his death.  Other news outlets also reported on Godinho’s death and correctly identified him, including the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail, whose article appears in the center of the collage. The Daily Express, another U.K. outlet in the collage, wrote about a 12-year-old girl who died from COVID-19 in Belgium. That story includes Godinho’s photo, but not in connection with the girl. It includes his photo in a reference to another young person who died from the virus and correctly identifies him in the caption. Lastly, an article by the U.K.’s Daily Record that appears in the Facebook post didn’t use Godinho’s photo at all.  That March 31 story covered the death of a 13-year-old boy, Ismail Mohaemd Abdulwahab, from the U.K. There is no photo of any child in the article. It’s unclear where the screenshot combining Godinho’s photo and Abdulwahab’s name originated. We couldn’t find its source. Godinho’s photo does turn up in image searches on the Abdulwahab story headline, but they link to accurate reports about Godinho’s death.

Can’t blame governor for high Pennsylvania gas prices
","Across the country, lower gasoline prices — dipping to below $1 per gallon, in some places — have been one byproduct of the COVID-19 outbreak. Pennsylvania is the exception, according to a Facebook post that blames Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. It says: ""Pennsylvania gasoline — $2.27/gallon. Ohio gasoline — 99 cents/gallon. Actually, 13 states under a dollar! Thanks Gov. Wolf!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Even within a state, gas prices vary, of course. Leaving aside the precise cost of a gallon of regular unleaded on a given day, it’s fair to say that Pennsylvania’s gas prices are on the high end nationally.  But gas taxes are only one reason gas prices vary among the states. And large gas tax hikes in Pennsylvania were done with a law that was enacted before Wolf was elected. On May 2, the day of the Facebook post, the average price of regular gas in Pennsylvania was $2.03 per gallon, the American Automobile Association told PolitiFact. Forty states had averages of $1.99 or less. That post was removed while we were preparing this fact-check. But the same image was posted by another Facebook user on May 4.) On May 6, as we prepared this fact-check, the average price per gallon in Pennsylvania was $2.028 — ninth-highest in the country, according to AAA. Oklahoma was lowest, at $1.391. In a comment to his post, the Facebook user cited an April 20 news article from a San Francisco TV station. That article cited a report three days earlier from GasBuddy.com, an app that tracks gas prices, that said gas prices were under $1 in 13 states:  Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania’s total gas tax (state plus federal) is 77.1 cents per gallon. That is second only to California’s 79 cents, as of Jan. 1, 2020, according to the American Petroleum Institute. (The federal tax alone is 18.4 cents per gallon.) Pennsylvania’s gas tax is more than twice as high as the tax in three of the other 13 states cited in the Facebook post (Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma). Here are the total gas taxes in those 13 states, in cents per gallon: Arkansas (43.2), Colorado (40.4), Iowa (48.9), Kansas (42.43), Kentucky (44.4), Michigan (60.38), Mississippi (37.19), Missouri (35.82), New York (63.43), Ohio (56.91), Oklahoma (38.4), Virginia (40.35) and Wisconsin (51.3). Asked why Pennsylvania’s prices at the pump are higher than in the other 13 states, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told PolitiFact it’s generally because of the state’s higher gas tax. But there are also regional factors, he said. Distance from supply, supply disruptions, and retail competition and operating costs all play a role, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal office. Marc Stier, director of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, noted that states such as Arizona, which has one of the lowest gas taxes, and Nevada, which is roughly in the middle, have higher gas prices than Pennsylvania. As of May 6, according to AAA, the average price per gallon was less than 1 cent higher in Arizona than in Pennsylvania, but more than 30 cents higher in Nevada. When we asked Wolf’s office about the Facebook post, we were referred to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. A spokesman responded by citing a 2013 Pennsylvania law that raised money for transportation.  That law was signed by Wolf’s predecessor, Republican Tom Corbett. It resulted in a series of increases in the state’s portion of the gas — from 32.3 cents per gallon to 58.7 cents.  Stier said he is not aware of any attempts by Wolf, who took office in 2015, to reduce gas taxes.  Wolf has defended the 2013 tax law as a mechanism to improve aging roads and bridges. In 2017, he and the Republican-controlled legislature allowed another increase from the 2013 law to take effect. A Facebook post blamed Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf for gas prices in Pennsylvania being higher than in 13 other states, where prices had dropped recently to lower than $1 per gallon in some places, while prices in Pennsylvania were above $2 A recent survey found gas prices under $1 in 13 states.  Pennsylvania has the second-highest gas tax in the nation and gas taxes are a major reason why gas is more expensive in Pennsylvania. But large increases in Pennsylvania’s gas tax took place under a law that was adopted before Wolf was elected. And there are other reasons — distance from supply, supply disruptions, and retail competition and operating costs — that cause gas prices to vary by region.

Lincoln Project’s “Mourning in America” ad critical of Trump misleads on bailouts
","A group called the Lincoln Project, headlined by several high-profile Republicans and former Republicans who oppose President Donald Trump, recently released an ad that turned a famous re-election ad for President Ronald Reagan on its head. The Reagan ad, ""Morning in America,"" is one of the most celebrated campaign ads in history. Using optimistic imagery and themes to argue that the country was on the right track after the crises of the 1970s, the ad set the tone for Reagan’s landslide reelection victory. By contrast, the Lincoln Project’s ad, retitled ""Mourning in America,"" is replete with depressing footage of masked Americans and economic devastation. And it directly blames Trump for acting ineffectively on the health and economic fronts.  At one point, the ad asserts, ""Trump bailed out Wall Street, but not Main Street."" Trump tweeted his displeasure with the ad, ironically producing a banner fundraising day for the Lincoln Project.  But is the ad’s claim about bailouts accurate? While there have been high-profile examples of larger corporations being awarded loans from a primarily small-business lending program (and sometimes giving them back), this line in the ad is inaccurate.  Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, has been tracking the federal response to the coronavirus-driven economic downturn. He said the dichotomy in the ad is wrong. The coronavirus relief legislation passed so far, Goldwein said, ""generally bails out everyone."" We should start by noting that Trump wouldn’t be solely at fault for any design flaws in the primary law for coronavirus relief, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act. The $2.2 trillion act, which Trump signed into law on March 27, 2020, included stimulus payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small businesses, and other relief measures. However, before it got to Trump’s desk, the bill had the support of both parties. It passed the Senate unanimously, and it passed the House overwhelmingly. The primary way the bill helps small companies is through the Paycheck Protection Program. Under that program, small businesses can take out federally backed loans through banks or credit unions to tide them through the coronavirus pandemic. The government will forgive the loans if the company keeps all of their employees on the payroll for eight weeks, and as long as the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities. The Paycheck Protection Program attracted negative media attention when some larger employers, such as Shake Shack, secured small business loans. Criticism grew as the program ran out of money allocated under the CARES Act. Congress later provided funds for additional loans. The Shake Shack loan appears to have been legal, since the program allowed loans for businesses in the food services sector that have more than one physical location and employ less than 500 people per location. Still, the negative attention led some of these businesses, including Shake Shack, to voluntarily give back their loans.   The Small Business Administration, which is overseeing the program, has produced some broad breakdowns of how the first $342 billion in loan money was spent. For assessing the ad’s claim, the most problematic cut of the SBA data concerns the size of the loans made so far.  The breakdown shows that slightly more than 74% of the individual loans granted were for $150,000 or less, totaling $58 billion. Because most companies apply for the maximum amount allowable, and because the loans are capped at 10 weeks of payroll costs, a loan of this size is consistent with a company that has roughly seven to 10 workers, Goldwein said. (Because the individual loan amounts in this category were small, the sum of all these loans was equal to only 17% of the total money spent.) Further evidence that the loans are reaching smaller companies comes from a survey released May 5 by the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading small-business group. This survey found that 77% of the group’s small business-owner members have successfully submitted an application, and about 61% of those applicants had already received their loans. Others were still in process. So contrary to what the ad argues, tens of billions of dollars are flowing to small businesses.   The public’s aversion to rescuing Wall Street dates back to the Great Recession in 2008, which, unlike the coronavirus downturn, was sparked by a meltdown specifically of the financial sector. The first big bill to address it, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, was designed primarily to help ailing banks, credit markets, and other financial institutions. Another early action was to rescue the government-chartered home mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This initial legislation bailed out the financial services sector, rather than economically stressed ordinary Americans. Since then, complaints about lawmakers favoring ""Wall Street"" have  persisted for more than a decade, from the Occupy Wall Street movement to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ insurgent presidential campaigns. As recently as a few months ago, Sanders, in his second presidential bid, was regularly assailing federal assistance to Wall Street firms. The Paycheck Protection Program does not put any special emphasis on aiding financial firms, although most of the big ""Wall Street"" players would be too big to qualify. In addition, after the bill was passed, regulations were implemented to bar private equity firms from benefiting from the program. If a financial company is small enough, from community banks or credit unions to insurance broker firms, it could qualify for a loan under the program. In fact, the SBA data shows that the ""finance and insurance"" sector received 2.39% of the dollars loaned under the program.  Still, that’s well down the list of sectors being served by loans. The biggest recipients were companies in construction (13.12%), professional, scientific, and technical services (12.65%), manufacturing (11.96%), and health care and social assistance (11.65%).  Another way banks and credit unions can benefit from the Paycheck Protection Program is by servicing the program’s loans to small businesses.  When lenders make a loan under the program, the government pays them a fee. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the total administrative costs of the first $349 billion loan tranche was $7.6 billion. Much of that probably went to financial institutions, some of them big players of the kind critics have targeted. However, it’s worth noting that this was not a ""bailout"" but rather a fee for services rendered. Probably the closest the relief legislation has come to a ""bailout"" of Wall Street comes from a separate part of the law, and its impact has been indirect. The CARES Act provides the Federal Reserve with $454 billion in emergency lending authority. This is designed to provide liquidity to the financial system to aid eligible businesses, states and municipalities. So while much of this aid will flow through banks, it was not created with bailing out Wall Street as its endpoint; Wall Street is being enlisted to aid a wide range of companies within the U.S. economy. Of course, some of this support will be used to help bigger companies, and this has probably helped the stock market recover some of its initial losses from the pandemic, Goldwein said. In turn, a healthier stock market does help ""Wall Street."" But this is an indirect benefit. The Lincoln Project did not get back to us with support for the claim; nor did the White House or the Trump campaign. (Editor's note: We received a response from the Lincoln Project after publication; their response is included after our ruling.) The Trump campaign issued a news release on May 6 that cited the 74% figure from the SBA as well as a tweet from White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saying that 1 million businesses with 10 or fewer employees received Paycheck Protection Program loans in the first round. The Lincoln Project ad says, ""Trump bailed out Wall Street, but not Main Street."" This is wrong on several levels. First, Trump doesn’t solely get the credit, or the blame, for anything in the CARES Act; it was supported by virtually all congressional Democrats as well. The financial firms criticized for benefiting from the Great Recession bailouts do receive some ancillary benefits from the act, but the loan-accepting companies are the primary target of such largesse, not the banks. The clearest problem with the claim is the notion in the ad that ""Main Street"" is not being aided. About three-quarters of the loans in the Paycheck Protection Program were made in the smallest loan size category, one that would support a business of roughly seven to 10 people. We rate the statement False. UPDATE: After publication, we received the following response from the Lincoln Project. Our key findings still stand, and the rating remains False.  ""We base that claim on the following Meriam Webster remarks about Wall St: 'In popular culture ""Wall Street"" stands in contrast to ""Main Street."" While Wall Street is used to describe the capital markets and the financial industry, Main Street is typically used to describe the larger economy in which the vast majority of people live and work.'

""Charlie Gasparino, the senior correspondent at Fox Business Network, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post, 'These measures will almost certainly benefit Wall Street and market speculation — even as their impact on Main Street will be slow to come.' He also wrote, 'Wall Street traders will make money, while Main Street businesses face economic conditions not seen since the Great Depression.'  ""Private equity, one of the largest sectors of the financial industry, is looking to cash in on COVID-19 relief money.  According to an article from Vanity Fair, 'Among those angling for a federal handout is one of the wealthiest sectors of the American economy: private equity. These firms not only have a record $1.5 trillion in cash on the sidelines, waiting to be invested, but their CEOs are among America’s richest executives. So why should they be permitted to raid the federal Treasury in a time of crisis?'""",/factchecks/2020/may/07/lincoln-project/mourning-america-ad-critical-trump-misleads-bailou/

Roswell post fudges the facts on Democrats’ birthdays
","Social media has proven to be fertile ground for political humor and insults. But sometimes users play loose with the facts to land their punchline. That’s what happened in an image posted on Facebook in April 2019, which features a long-winded set-up for a joke that casts several prominent Democratic politicians as the descendants of aliens and livestock. The image in the post recalls the tale of a purported UFO crash and alien landing during the summer of 1947 ""on a sheep and mule ranch"" near Roswell, New Mexico, and refers to longstanding theories that the U.S. Air Force and other federal agencies tried to bury the incident. Then it pivots to this contention:  ""However, what you may NOT know is that in the month of April 1948, nine months after that historic day, the following people were born: ""See what happens when aliens breed with sheep and jackasses?"" the post reads. The post earned some LOLs from the commenters.  But at PolitiFact, we check verifiable facts, not jokes and insults, so we couldn’t resist taking a closer look at the birthdays and the enduring claims about an alien landing. Aliens or no aliens, it would be a curious occurrence indeed if nine prominent Democratic leaders, including four presidential nominees, had all been born within 30 days of each other. But they weren’t. Most of the people on this list weren’t born in 1948. And none of them were born in April. PolitiFact used two sources to check each person’s birthday. Here's what we found:  Gore, the former vice president and 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, would have fit the bill if he had been born a day later.  Farthest off the mark is Feinstein, California’s senior senator, who was born in 1933 and will turn 87 this summer. The setup of the joke refers to witnesses who claim a UFO ""with five aliens aboard"" crashed just outside Roswell. It points to longstanding suspicions that the U.S. government engaged in a massive cover-up of an alien landing that occurred there. It turns out there was a government cover-up that lasted nearly half a century, but it had nothing to do with aliens.  On an unknown date between mid-June and early July, a rancher named Mac Brazel drove out on his lands — about 80 miles outside of Roswell — and found unfamiliar debris, including tinfoil, rubber strips, sticks and heavy paper. Brazel brought his findings to local officials at the nearby Roswell Army Air Field. Military officials initially described the debris field as the remains of a ""flying disk.""  When news outlets began to pick up the story, U.S. Army officials quickly explained that the debris was not from a flying saucer, but from a weather balloon. Photos of the remaining wreckage were provided as proof.  But then, in 1994, the U.S. Air Force changed its story again, releasing a report that admitted the ""weather balloon"" story had been fake. The report said the debris found near Roswell was consistent with a balloon device from a once top-secret operation known as Project Mogul that sought to determine via sound waves whether the Soviet Union was testing nuclear weapons. In a subsequent report titled ""The Roswell Report, Case Closed,"" released in 1997, the Air Force asserted there was no evidence that a life form of any kind was found in the Roswell area that could be connected to the UFO sightings reported. Even so, to this day, the Roswell UFO conspiracies remain popular — and so do jokes about aliens landing there. An image posted on Facebook refers to theories about a UFO crash and alien landing near Roswell to skewer various prominent Democrats born ""nine months later"" in April 1948. None of the Democrats listed in the post were born in April 1948. In fact, most were born at least a year before the Roswell incident occurred. The reported Roswell UFO sightings in 1947 have been explained as a case of the military using a false explanation for the debris found, in order to protect a top-secret U.S. operation to spy on the Soviets.

Trump wrong that COVID-19 death projections omit revisions based on social distancing
","President Donald Trump downplayed academic projections that COVID-19 deaths could rise higher than previously expected this summer. Trump was asked about new projections multiple times on May 5, the day he traveled to Arizona to tour a mask factory.  ABC’s David Muir asked Trump about a model by Johns Hopkins University that said the daily death rate could rise to 3,000 a day, as well as a University of Washington update that projected 135,000 deaths by early August. Trump criticized the models as ""out of whack."" ""Those models that you're mentioning are talking about without mitigation,"" Trump replied. ""Well, we're mitigating, and we've learned to mitigate."" Mitigation generally refers to steps to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing, requiring people to wear masks and reducing public gatherings.  In recent days, many states or counties have loosened such restrictions or have announced plans to do so, reopening beaches, restaurants and shops. Medical experts have cautioned that such measures could lead to more cases.  By saying the new reports don’t factor in mitigation, Trump made it sound like they didn’t reflect ongoing efforts to limit the spread. But Trump is wrong — the University of Washington update does take into account mitigation such as social distancing. The Johns Hopkins data was a draft and was not intended as a forecast. RELATED: Donald Trump’s 4 biggest falsehoods on ABC News The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington released an updated forecast showing about 134,000 deaths by early August. That was nearly double their forecast in late April. The revision reflects the winding down of social distancing measures expected in the majority of states by May 11. ""Increases in testing and contact tracing, along with warming seasonal temperatures — factors that could help slow transmission — do not offset rising mobility, thereby fueling a significant increase in projected deaths,"" the university said. The ""model includes mitigation and always has,"" Amelia Apfel, a spokeswoman for the institute, told PolitiFact in an email. The institute’s published frequently asked questions contains more details about how it factors social distancing into the models.  Some experts have criticized the model as the numbers have fluctuated.  The model from Johns Hopkins University caused a stir after the New York Times reported on an internal federal document showing deaths of 3,000 a day by June, compared with 1,750 now. The draft slide show, published by the Washington Post, included preliminary information from a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor who is contracted with the Federal Emergency Management Administration. Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology, told the Washington Post that his work contained a range of possibilities. A Johns Hopkins spokeswoman told PolitiFact that it is not a forecast. ""The information illustrates that there are some scenarios, including the premature relaxation of social distancing, that are likely to cause significant increases in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States,"" the university said. We emailed Lessler directly to ask if his 3,000 figure took into account mitigation and did not get a reply. In Lessler’s interview with NPR, he said the various scenarios took into account how effective current measures are, and that his contract with FEMA prevents him from sharing his final projections with the public. The White House told media outlets that the numbers had not been vetted or presented to the coronavirus task force. The Trump administration has made it clear that even with mitigation the U.S. death toll will grow.  ""Our projections have always been between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost, and that's with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance,"" said Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, on Fox News Sunday. When Trump was asked about new models projecting COVID-19 deaths, Trump responded that they ""are talking about without mitigation."" The Johns Hopkins data was preliminary, and not designed as a forecast. The researcher told NPR that he assumed some degree of mitigation. Trump is clearly wrong about the University of Washington’s model, which does take into account mitigation efforts.

No, the flu hasn't killed more people than coronavirus
","Some people have tried to put COVID-19 into perspective by comparing it with the flu. On April 24, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest told a group of young Republicans that the flu had actually killed more people than the novel coronavirus. Forest, who’s running for governor against incumbent Democrat Roy Cooper, has suggested that North Carolina’s stay-at-home order might be disproportionate to the effects of COVID-19 in his state. In a video interview, Forest said: ""You know, we’ve still had more deaths to the flu this year than we’ve had COVID-19,"" Forest said, adding: ""There’s been about three times more deaths for HIV/AIDS, remember that was a pandemic at one time that still has no vaccine. This one’s bad. It’s obviously worse than the normal flu year, but it hasn’t hit the extremes of other pandemics yet."" Forest also compared COVID-19 with HIV. But let’s focus on Forest’s claim about the flu, since that’s what it’s most commonly compared with. It isn’t clear from Forest’s claim if he is talking about the United States or North Carolina. So we’ll address those stats at the both state and national level. Is Forest right?  No. And there are several reasons why Forest’s comparison is neither fair, nor accurate: He compared diseases that entered the United States at different times. When it comes to flu deaths across the U.S., he based his claim on an estimate — and cherry-picked the worst case scenario from that estimate. He overlooked data from his home state, where publicly available information showed there had been more COVID-19 deaths than flu deaths. It’s important to note first that the flu and COVID-19 did not enter the U.S. at the same time. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started tracking the flu in 2019, authorities didn’t report the first case of the novel coronavirus until Jan. 20. The first death occurred on Feb. 29. If the diseases were in a race, the flu got several months of a head start.  ""Comparing deaths from laboratory confirmed cases of COVID that occurred between Feb. 29–April 24 to statistical model estimations of all flu deaths (detected and undetected) from October 1–April 4 is not at all equitable,"" said Dr. Ben King, clinical assistant professor of public health at the University of Texas Dell Medical School.  With that said, let’s look at the numbers that are available. As of April 25, the day after Forest made his claim, more than 50,000 people had died from COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The estimate has grown to 65,700 by May 4. Some experts believe the CDC’s numbers to be low. A study released by the Washington Post and the Yale School of Public Health on April 27 found that experts missed as many as 15,000 coronavirus deaths in the first weeks after the virus arrived in the U.S. What about flu deaths? The CDC doesn’t have up-to-date flu death numbers. Forest based his claim on the CDC’s estimate that flu deaths could be as high as 62,000, Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn told PolitiFact in an email. A problem for Forest’s claim? That CDC estimate also predicted flu deaths could be as low as 24,000. That’s a wide range, which has recently drawn criticism. In an April 28 Scientific American column titled, ""Comparing COVID-19 Deaths to Flu Deaths Is Like Comparing Apples to Oranges,"" a Harvard Medical School instructor explains the CDC’s prediction methods — and argues they should change. Dr. Jeremy Samuel Faust, who practices emergency medicine at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, noted that the CDC tries to account for unreported flu deaths ""by multiplying the number of flu death counts reported by various coefficients produced through complicated algorithms,"" he wrote. Indeed, the CDC’s estimation process is ""fairly elaborate,"" said William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. The CDC estimates deaths, rather than counting raw numbers, in part because death certificates ""can be mushy,"" Schaffner told PolitiFact in a phone interview. Deceased people can sometimes have multiple health problems, leaving the cause of death up for debate. Compounding matters, processes for determining and recording causes of death vary across the country. Faust, who wrote the column, argued that the number of actual flu deaths could be much lower than the CDC’s estimate. As the Washington Post pointed out on May 2, the number of actual deaths directly contributed to the flu has been less than 10,000 each of the past two seasons. In the past, Faust said it was justifiable to err on the side of substantially overestimating flu deaths ""in order to encourage vaccination and good hygiene."" But now, ""the CDC’s reporting about flu deaths is dangerously misleading the public and even public officials about the comparison between these two viruses."" Without a clear idea of how many flu deaths might be tallied for the 2019-20 season, we turned to past totals and estimates. The CDC preliminary estimates show that 34,000 people likely died from the flu in the 2018-2019 season and that 61,000 died over the 2017-18 season. Finalized CDC data shows that 38,000 died between 2016-17 and 23,000 died between 2015-16. That’s an average of about 39,000 flu deaths over the last four seasons, (assuming death estimates from the last two seasons turn out to be accurate.) The 2017-18 season stands out as one of the highest in history, according to Reuters. Flu deaths only topped 60,000 on three other occasions. About 100,000 Americans died of the flu in 1967, about 116,000 died in 1957, and nearly 675,000 died from the 1918 flu. We asked Schaffner if it’s possible to predict flu deaths and flu severity based on reports from prior years. It’s difficult, he said. ""There’s a saying: If you’ve seen one flu season, you’ve seen one flu season,"" Schaffner said, emphasizing that each season can be different and unpredictable.  The CDC hasn’t offered a prediction of how many Americans might die from COVID-19 over the course of this year’s season. Modeling from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has offered death counts in the range of 48,000 to 123,000. On April 24, the day of Forest’s claim, Politico reported that the institute was predicting about 67,000 deaths. On May 4, the institute’s model predicted 134,000 deaths by Aug. 4.  Information on flu deaths is limited. But Lisa Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins, recently wrote that coronavirus deaths are ""thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu."" Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, agreed. In an email, she said, ""SARS-CoV-2 is at least as deadly as the highest flu estimate, and over the year will undoubtedly be more so."" What if the flu does turn out to kill 62,000 over the course of the season? That would still make it less deadly than the coronavirus on a per-day basis, CNN reported on May 1. If 62,000 people died from the flu between Oct. 1 and April 4, that would mean the U.S. had an average of about 331 flu deaths a day, CNN reported. By contrast, CNN estimated that an average of 739 people died per day from coronavirus between February and the end of April, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While flu deaths across the U.S. have yet to be determined, flu data is more definitive in Forest’s home state. And it further proves him wrong. Mandy Cohen, North Carolina’s health secretary, announced on April 20 that COVID-19 deaths had surpassed flu deaths in less than a month. Cohen said in a press conference that 179 people died between March 24, when North Carolina recorded its first coronavirus death, and April 20. By contrast, WUNC reported, 167 people had died over the course of the flu season, which started in September. By April 25, a day after Forest made his claim, the NC Department of Health and Human Services, had reported 177 flu deaths and more than 300 coronavirus deaths. By May 3, there had been 183 flu deaths and 430 coronavirus deaths.  On April 24, Forest said: ""We’ve still had more deaths to the flu this year than we’ve had COVID-19."" Forest phrased his claim in a way that makes it seem like health experts were keeping and publicizing an ongoing log of flu deaths across America. That’s not the case. The CDC predicts that the number of flu deaths will be anywhere between 24,000 and 62,000. Forest cherry-picked the highest number possible, and then compared it to the CDC’s running tally of coronavirus deaths. That’s unfair because he compared an estimate to an actual number, and because the diseases entered the U.S. at different times. Forest’s claim isn’t true for his home state either. In fact, Forest never proved that there have been more flu deaths than coronavirus deaths as of April 24. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2020/may/06/dan-forest/no-flu-hasnt-killed-more-people-coronavirus/

Laura Ingraham wrong about 'no real scientific basis' for social distancing
","Fox News host Laura Ingraham falsely claimed on her TV show that there’s ""no real scientific basis"" behind social distancing, the practice of keeping distance from others to reduce the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. ""Although intuitively I think it probably seemed like social distancing would be necessary, there was no real scientific basis for believing that, since it had never been studied,"" Ingraham said.  Americans have widely followed social distancing directives to ""flatten the curve"" of new coronavirus cases and prevent hospitals from being stretched beyond capacity. In the absence of widespread testing, most Americans have supported such mitigation efforts.  But scattered protests have also captured attention and led pundits like Ingraham and fellow Fox News host Tucker Carlson to call for an end to more statewide shutdowns as U.S. deaths due to the coronavirus top 70,000. Members of the White House coronavirus task force have encouraged social distancing. President Donald Trump credited nationwide closures with saving ""millions of lives"" as recently as May 3 in a town hall. But while it’s difficult to assess the exact impact of social distancing policies so far, experts told us Ingraham’s claim is wrong. There’s plenty of science behind social distancing. ""It’s one of the few tools that we know works in the case of an unknown, novel virus such as this,"" said Thomas Novotny, an epidemiologist at San Diego State University. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment. With the coronavirus still running its course, studies on the impact of mitigation efforts are only just emerging. But past respiratory disease outbreaks have been informative, experts said. On her show, Ingraham cited a recent study on the effects of lockdowns in western Europe and a clip of Stanford University biologist Michael Levitt calling European lockdowns a ""mistake."" She also highlighted a recent CBS News interview in which Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said mitigation ""didn’t work as well as we expected."" Gottlieb has himself encouraged social distancing, however. And the study of European countries, which hasn’t yet been peer reviewed, doesn’t say social distancing is futile, but rather that social distancing measures ""have approximately the same effects"" as full lockdowns. ""My work does not question the efficiency of social distancing,"" said Thomas Meunier, the researcher behind the study.  Charles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University, said social distancing ""is a fundamental way to interrupt the transmission of disease in populations."" ""To say that there was no scientific basis for believing that is like saying there is no scientific basis for epidemiology,"" he said. The concept of limiting person-to-person contact dates back centuries. But non-pharmaceutical interventions, as the practices we associate with social distancing are known, became official U.S. policy under President George W. Bush in 2007, according to the New York Times. The shift came after researchers looked back at government responses to the 1918 influenza, which killed about 675,000 Americans. Elaine Nsoesie, assistant professor of global health at Boston University, said that pandemic saw many social distancing measures put in place, including bans on gatherings and school closures. RELATED: What the 1918 flu pandemic shows us about social distancing One study in the Journal of the American Medical Association examined social distancing in 43 cities for about 24 weeks in 1918 and 1919. It found cities suffered less when they implemented social distancing swiftly, comprehensively and for a sustained period of time. A second study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on 17 U.S. cities. It found those with early, layered interventions had flatter epidemic curves and peak death rates about 50% lower than cities that didn’t take similar steps. Those findings became the basis for the policies adopted by the Bush administration and later modified under President Barack Obama. Studies of the 1918 pandemic ""indicated that early implementation of multiple social distancing interventions was associated with a lower death rate at the peak of the epidemic,"" Nsoesie said. David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, told us Ingraham’s claim is incorrect: ""Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been shown to help reduce the overall number of cases and virus-related mortality.""  That’s because shrinking gatherings ""should lead to less exposure to potentially infected individuals and thus reduce the potential for transmission,"" Hamer said. Other evaluations of social distancing, handwashing, mask-wearing and related interventions have been compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, especially as they relate to influenza pandemics. (See page 23 of this 2017 CDC document, for example.) Now more than ever, it’s important to sort fact from fiction. Please donate to support our mission. What we know about COVID-19 also suggests that social distancing works, experts said. Hamer cited the Imperial College of London's projection that the U.S. could see up to 2.2 million COVID-19 deaths if it did nothing to slow the spread, as well as a not-yet-peer-reviewed study from Swiss researchers that estimated the impact of various interventions on new cases. The Swiss researchers said non-pharmaceutical interventions contributed to ""a strong overall reduction"" in new cases, with venue closures, border closures, work-from-home policies and limits on large gatherings having the highest impact. The coronavirus spreads mainly among people in close contact, through respiratory droplets launched into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, according to the CDC. ""Those droplets, as they’re falling out of the air, someone else may inhale them or get them into their mouth or their eyes,"" said Johns Hopkins University’s Lauren Sauer on a university podcast. ""And that’s why you have to be less than 6 feet away to really be at risk."" Ingraham said ""there was no real scientific basis for believing that"" social distancing would be necessary, ""since it had never been studied."" Experts we spoke to cited a number of studies — including two influential analyses of the 1918 influenza — that show social distancing can help slow the spread of new infectious diseases.

Don’t fall for conspiracy about Dr. Anthony Fauci, hydroxychloroquine
","A widely shared conspiracy theory on Facebook alleges that Dr. Anthony Fauci is knowingly advocating against a treatment for the novel coronavirus.  An April 27 article says the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has known since 2005 that hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat conditions like lupus and arthritis, is effective against coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19.   ""Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose ‘expert’ advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses,"" reads the article. ""How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director."" The source of the article is One News Now, a website operated by the American Family Association, a Christian fundamentalist nonprofit founded by Mississippi pastor Donald Wildmon. The Southern Poverty Law Center has classified the political organization as an anti-LGBTQ hate group. One News Now’s article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 27,000 times. (Screenshot from One News Now) Despite being one of the most trusted coronavirus experts in the United States, Fauci has been the target of several conspiracy theories about his handling of the pandemic — particularly since he tempered expectations for hydroxychloroquine during a March press conference. So we wanted to check out this article, too. There are several things wrong with the One News Now story.  First: The article relies on a 2005 study about the effect of chloroquine on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, more commonly called SARS. Chloroquine is chemically similar to hydroxychloroquine, but it is a different drug and is primarily used to treat malaria. Both drugs pose risks for people with heart problems. The One News Now story claims the journal that published the study is ""the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health."" That’s inaccurate. While the 2005 study has been indexed by the NIH’s National Library of Medicine, it was published in the peer-reviewed Virology Journal. The journal is produced by BioMed Central, a United Kingdom-based for-profit publisher. The study’s authors worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, and the study was funded by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. We reached out to the NIH for more context, but we haven’t heard back.  Second: The study does not suggest that hydroxychloroquine could be effective at treating or preventing COVID-19, as One News Now claims. ""HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine,"" the website wrote. ""In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus."" This is inaccurate — there is no cure or vaccine for SARS or the novel coronavirus. While some studies have found that hydroxychloroquine could mitigate some of the symptoms associated with COVID-19, other research has found no such effect. With more than 50 studies in the works, as well as an NIH clinical trial, it’s too soon to say whether the drug is a viable treatment for the coronavirus. The 2005 study found that chloroquine — not hydroxychloroquine — was ""effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV,"" the official name for SARS. The research was conducted in ""cell culture conditions,"" meaning the drug was not administered to actual SARS patients. The authors wrote that more research was needed on how the drug interacts with SARS in animal test subjects. ""Cell culture testing of an antiviral drug against the virus is only the first step, of many steps, necessary to develop an antiviral drug,"" said Kate Fowlie, a press officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an email. ""It is important to realize that most antivirals that pass this cell culture test hurdle fail at later steps in the development process."" RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know Finally: Fauci could not have known in 2005 that hydroxychloroquine was a potential treatment for COVID-19. Available evidence shows that the novel coronavirus first emerged in Hubei Province, China, in November. While the novel coronavirus is similar to SARS in some respects — both are human coronaviruses that originated in bats, cause respiratory illness and spread through coughs and sneezes — they are different diseases. COVID-19 has infected more than 3.5 million people worldwide compared to the 8,000 who were sickened during the 2003 SARS outbreak. While SARS cases are generally more severe, scientists believe that COVID-19 is more transmissible. As One News Now notes, the novel coronavirus and SARS have a 79% genetic similarity and use the same ""host cell receptor,"" meaning they infect people in similar ways. But that doesn’t mean the findings of the 2005 study apply to COVID-19. ""Whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are of value for treating infections with the different, but related, SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot be answered by the data in the 2005 study,"" Fowlie said. One News Now wrote that Fauci ""has known for 15 years that chloroquine and … hydroxychloroquine will not only treat a current case of coronavirus but prevent future cases."" The website cited a study that has to do with SARS, not the novel coronavirus. It was published in 2005 in Virology Journal, which is not the ""official publication"" of the NIH.  While the study found that chloroquine helped inhibit the spread of SARS in cell cultures, those results do not suggest that the drug is an effective treatment for SARS or COVID-19. As of now, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for either coronavirus. The One News Now article is inaccurate.

Nate McMurray on target with tweet about Chris Jacobs’ sick leave vote
","Democratic congressional candidate Nate McMurray recently took to Twitter to attack state Sen. Chris Jacobs, his Republican opponent, over a vote he cast on paid sick leave.  McMurray and Jacobs are the two major-party candidates running for the vacant 27th District congressional seat. The vacancy emerged when Republican Rep. Chris Collins resigned following pleading guilty to federal charges in an insider trading case. Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison.

Andrew Cuomo. It provides for certain employee benefits if the employee is subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. Among these benefits is paid sick leave during the government-mandated shutdown of non-essential businesses. Jacobs voted against the bill. He was one of six senators who voted against it. All of the senators voting against the bill were Republicans serving in the Democratic-controlled chamber. Jacobs issued a press release the day before the vote critical of the measure. In the release, Jacobs called the bill a ""new burden on New York businesses that will significantly raise costs starting in 2021. These new requirements would mandate small businesses grant paid leave for employees for an extremely broad swath of activities not at all related to being sick, such as ‘immigration’ and to ‘prepare for or participate in any criminal or civil proceeding.’ The COVID-19 crisis will bring many small businesses to their knees."" In a May 1 statement to PolitiFact, Jacobs said that he supports paid sick leave for workers coping with COVID-19 but voted against the bill because he thought it should have been presented differently.  ""S8091 was a poorly written bill because it imposed 100% of the cost onto small businesses, which are already fighting for their very survival during this coronavirus crisis,"" Jacobs said. "" I could not, in good conscience, vote for a bill which would put more financial stress on our already struggling small businesses."" Jacobs said that if the bill worsens the environment for small businesses, more of them would close, and in the long run, employees of those businesses would suffer.  McMurray said Jacobs ""voted against paid leave for COVID-19."" Jacobs did vote against the New York Senate bill that provides paid sick leave to employees of                 non-essential businesses. Jacobs argued that while he supports the concept of sick leave for workers with COVID-19, he thought the particular bill offered placed too much of a burden on small businesses.

Internet posts say three Democratic senators 'took bribes from Iran' to support nuclear deal
","There’s no question that the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran has unleashed passions. Some of the passions directed against the deal are clear from a recent series of Web posts accusing Democratic lawmakers of accepting bribes from Iran to approve the deal. We first became aware of this allegation when a reader directed us to a post at the website Jewsnews.co.il, headlined, ""ALERT: List Of Democrats Who Took Bribes From Iran… They Back Insane NUKE Deal."" Other sites passed along the charge, including one with the headline, ""The REAL Reason Why Dems Want Iran Nuke Deal – $$$$,"" on a site run by Samuel Wurzelbacher, who became famous as ""Joe the Plumber,"" a critic of Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential race. The posts all track back to an article in FrontPageMag.com, a website published by the conservative David Horowitz Freedom Center. The original article is titled, ""Traitor Senators Took Money from Iran Lobby, Back Iran Nukes."" The article begins by accusing Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. -- a supporter of the nuclear agreement -- of topping ""the list of candidates supported by the Iran Lobby. And the Iranian American Political Action Committee (IAPAC) had maxed out its contributions to his campaign. ""After more fake suspense, (Minnesota Democratic Sen.) Al Franken, another IAPAC-backed politician who also benefited from Iran Lobby money, came out for the nuke sellout. ""Senator Jeanne Shaheen (of New Hampshire), the Iran Lobby’s third Dem senator, didn’t bother playing coy like her colleagues. She came out for the deal a while back even though she only got half the IAPAC cash that Franken and Markey received."" The article continues, ""Democrats in favor of a deal that will let a terrorist regime go nuclear have taken money from lobbies for that regime. They have broken their oath by taking bribes from a regime whose leaders chant, ‘Death to America.’ "" That’s a lot of tough rhetoric -- and there are more charges we didn’t mention about Iranian influence on Democrats aired in the rest of the article -- but we’ll focus here on the part about the three Democratic senators. The article references donations from the Iranian American Political Action Committee, which is the political arm of the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans. The group’s website confirms that IAPAC supported all three listed Democrats in the 2014 election cycle. To understand the charges, we’ll break down the claims into manageable pieces. First, did the three Democratic senators receive money ""from Iran""? Second, is it true that the senators ""took bribes""? And third, have these ""bribes"" only gone to Democrats? Did the senators receive money ‘from Iran’? It’s not logical to assume that just because a group has ""Iranian"" in its name that it’s a stooge for the government of Iran. In reality, the groups in question -- PAAIA and IAPAC -- are organizations that represent Iranian-Americans. That’s a key difference: Often, people emigrate to the United States because they oppose the government of their previous country. Just because a senator received money from a group of Cuban-Americans doesn’t mean they are effectively taking money from Fidel and Raul Castro. In fact, and certainly in the case of Cuba, it’s much more likely that the group’s members can’t stand the Castro regime. That’s not to say that an unfriendly government can’t subvert or co-opt a group of expatriates for its own purposes. Daniel Greenfield, the author of the original article, said in an email to PolitiFact that such a scenario has been ""discussed and debated in the past by Iranian opposition groups,"" as has also been the case with organizations of ""emigre Cubans, Chinese and Russians in the United States."" However, the group itself strenuously denies that it is a front for Iran’s theocratic government. ""We have no connection to the Iranian government -- no, none at all,"" said Morad Ghorban, director of government relations and policy for the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans. ""We’re a non-profit, non-partisan, non-religious organization that is really here to serve the interests of the Iranian-American community before policymakers and the American public."" Every year or so, the organization hires a pollster to survey Iranian-Americans, as a way of guiding the group’s policy agenda. The 2014 poll sheds some light on where the community’s sympathies lie regarding the current government of Iran. When asked which form of government would work best for Iran, 69 percent of Iranian-Americans said Iran should be a secular democracy, compared to just 9 percent who said it should be any form of an ""Islamic Republic."" The breakdown was much the same in the prior poll, from 2011. Such views undercut the notion that the organization is a puppet for the mullahs. The accusation that the group is a front for the Iranian regime ""has no basis,"" said Vali Nasr, dean of the John Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an expert in the region. ""This organization is supported by Iranian-Americans in leadership positions across high-tech, finance, law and other sectors. It has no support from Iranian government. Its board and membership includes Republicans and Democrats and has a wide perspective on political issues."" Did the senators take bribes? Given all the possible influences on a lawmaker’s vote -- the views of constituents, pressure from party leaders, lobbying by other interest groups, even their own gut feelings -- it’s hardly obvious that the support of Iranian-Americans was the factor that tipped the balance for them on the Iran deal. But even if you assume that it did represent the tipping point on their vote, it’s hard to consider this a ""bribe."" ""If this is a bribe, then no one would be left on Capitol Hill,"" said Kenneth A. Gross, who heads the political law practice at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The Justice Department election-crime manual, he said, ""is explicit that in order to prosecute a political contribution as a bribe, there needs to be an explicit quid pro quo. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Byron White, in McCormick vs. United States, essentially stated that political contributions are not bribes -- they are how we fund elections in the country."" In bribery, it’s the agreement to vote a certain way that matters, added Brett Kappel, a partner in political law at the firm Akerman LLP. ""Making a campaign contribution to a senator in the hope that he will vote for a resolution when it comes to the floor is not a bribe – there has to be an agreement"" to do something, he said. And there’s even less reason in this case to believe these transactions would qualify as bribes. Markey, Franken and Shaheen all received their support from the group during the 2014 election cycle. At that point, there was not even a certainty that there would be a nuclear agreement, much less what it would contain. Have these ‘bribes’ only gone to Democrats? Actually, no: The group has given donations in a bipartisan fashion, including to a variety of Republicans who are almost certain to vote against the nuclear deal. During the 2014 campaign cycle, IAPAC gave money to such Republicans as Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Reps. Randy Forbes of Virginia, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, John Mica of Florida, and Ed Royce of California, and the National Republican Congressional Committee. In the 2012 campaign cycle, the group supported GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and John Cornyn of Texas, Rep. Peter Roskam and the National Republican Congressional Committee, as well as a Democrat who has come out against the agreement, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. And in the 2010 campaign cycle, the group supported Sen. Charles Schumer, another Democratic opponent of the deal, as well as Republican Rep. Randy Wittman of Virginia. The original article did note that ""the Iran Lobby had even tried, and failed to turn"" Flake and Schumer into deal supporters. But it gave no indication of the breadth of Republicans who received support from the group, the lack of which communicates an unbalanced perspective on the group’s political leanings. The article’s author, Greenfield, said the focus on Democrats was justified. ""The acid test of influence is action,"" he said. ""The final determination will be seen when the vote happens. Currently, however, no Republicans are backing a deal ... while the Democrats listed in the article are. Other Democrats who have received Iran Lobby money have come out against the deal and were not in any way deemed traitors."" We should note that the Iranian-American group’s 2015 poll found that 64 percent of Iranian-Americans approved of the framework agreement that preceded the final nuclear deal with Iran, compared to 20 percent who disapproved and 16 percent who were not sure. So Iranian-Americans, despite their concerns about the Iranian regime, do appear to support the deal by a wide margin. ""Some of the candidates we supported in the past … are not going to be supporting this deal,"" said Ghorban of PAAIA. ""There are other issues where we will work with them."" Our ruling Posts on the Internet said that Markey, Franken and Shaheen ""took bribes from Iran"" on their way to supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran. The ""bribes"" in this case are campaign contributions, and there’s no evidence they are anything more than that. The donations came from a group of Iranian-Americans and not the government of Iran, and the allegation glosses over the fact that many top Republicans who oppose the nuclear deal also received the same type of support from the same group. This claim is wildly inaccurate. We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/sep/01/blog-posting/internet-posts-say-three-democratic-senators-took-/

Santorum cites flawed climate change figure, and misquotes it
","Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum sparred with liberal talk show host Bill Maher on a topic near and dear to both men’s hearts for different reasons: climate change. Maher kicked off the debate by naming climate change as one of his main concerns for the 2016 election and challenged Santorum’s skepticism. Santorum, who has repeatedly called climate change ""a hoax,"" shot back by arguing that there really isn’t scientific consensus. ""I’m not alone,"" Santorum said on Maher’s Aug. 28 HBO show. ""The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2."" Santorum, pressed by an incredulous Maher, repeated the claim: ""There was a survey done of 1,800 scientists, and 57 percent said they don’t buy off on the idea that CO2 is the knob that’s turning the climate. There’s hundreds of reasons the climate’s changed."" ""Rick, I don’t know what ass you’re pulling that out of,"" Maher retorted. ""I’m not! I’ll send you the survey,"" Santorum promised. Several readers wrote to us asking about Santorum’s numbers, so we asked his campaign to send us the survey as well. They didn’t get back to us, but we did find the figure.   In short, Santorum’s claim commits ""two orders of mischaracterization,"" said Anthony Leiserowitz, who studies climate change public opinion at Yale University. He not only uses a flawed statistic, but also misstates what it’s allegedly disapproving. Santorum’s sloppy reading To begin with, Santorum inaccurately describes the ""idea"" that he says 57 percent of scientists ""don’t agree with."" What he’s referring to is a finding by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its fifth report. The IPCC has said it is ""extremely likely"" (meaning a 95 percent confidence level) that humans are causing climate change. The IPCC also said it is ""very likely"" (meaning a 90 percent confidence level) that greenhouses gases are the driver. Santorum restated IPCC points wrong. They never said 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2. In fact, no one has ever made that statement, according to Leiserowitz. ""There are several other greenhouse gases, including methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor, as a amplifier. CO2 is the most important of these and others, but no one to my knowledge has ever claimed that CO2 caused 95 percent of the warming,"" he said. The closest IPCC comes to what Santorum claimed is saying that there’s a 90 percent chance that greenhouse gases are driving climate. That’s a far cry from what Santorum actually said. Even still, the 57 percent figure doesn’t hold up. Fuzzy math The figure likely comes from the blog Fabius Maximus (and repeated by the prominent climate change skeptic Joanne Nova), which re-analyzed the findings of a 2014 survey by the Dutch environmental research agency PBL. According to Fabius Maximus editor Larry Kummer, the survey’s findings disprove the IPCC's confidence level finding. He walked us through how he got the 57 percent: 1. About 65.9 percent of scientists said they agreed that greenhouse gases were the main driver of climate change. 2. Of those scientists, 65.2 percent reported ""virtually certain"" or it was ""extremely likely"" that their estimate was correct (corresponding to a 95 percent or higher confidence level). 3. That means, according to Kummer, about 43 percent (65.2 percent of 65.9 percent) were extremely confident that greenhouse gases were the main driver of climate change. In other words, 57 percent weren’t 95 percent confident. We ran Kummer’s analysis by a few experts, including the survey authors themselves, who said his interpretation is flat-out wrong. The survey’s lead author, Bart Verheggen, told us that Kummer — and, by extension, Santorum — made a few mistakes. First, 22 percent of climate scientists surveyed didn’t directly answer a question as to what extent greenhouse gases were causing climate change, says Verheggen. Verheggen said it would be more accurate to consider only those who answered the question. (He goes into more detail in a blog post.) Second, Kummer only counts scientists who were 95 percent or more confident that greenhouse gases drive climate change, when the actual IPCC statement reports a 90 percent certainty, Verheggen pointed out. ""Basically, Santorum’s claim is not consistent with the results from our survey,"" Verheggen concluded. ""This is like something out of that book, How to Lie With Statistics,"" said Stephen Farnsworth, who studies climate change and political communication at the University of Mary Washington. ""What we’re talking about here is extraordinary cherry-picking. You’re only counting one question in one survey, and you’re talking about a very high (confidence level). Once you start stacking up numbers like this, you’re really distorting the real finding of this research."" What the survey (and others) actually say The real finding of the survey actually backs the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, despite varying levels of confidence, said Verheggen. ""It is clear from our survey that a strong majority of scientists agree that greenhouse gases originating from human activity are the dominant cause of recent warming,"" he said. That’s consistent with most of the literature on scientific opinion about climate change, experts agreed. ""You don't get anywhere near 57 percent when surveying the broad earth science community, and you get very close to full consensus when you ask the experts in climate science,"" said Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University. National Science Board member James Powell surveyed what’s actually published in scientific journals, finding that the consensus in the literature is about 99.9 percent. And multiple independent studies have ""asked scientists directly"" and found consensus levels of around 97 percent, said William Anderegg, who studies climate change at Princeton University.   ""Those studies were rigorously peer-reviewed and thus should be considered more credible than a blog post that misreads an institute report,"" he said. Our ruling Santorum said, ""The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2."" He’s not pulling the numbers out of thin air, as Maher suggests more bluntly, but the claim is inaccurate and misleading. Essentially, Santorum garbles a blog’s textbook misinterpretation of a survey. In reality, the survey actually supports the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, the lead author told us. We rate Santorum’s claim False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/01/rick-santorum/santorum-cites-flawed-climate-change-figure-and-mi/

Fox News' Eric Bolling misstates tie between gun laws and gun deaths internationally
","The murders of two television journalists in Virginia renewed the debate about gun control in America. On Fox News’ The Five, panelist Juan Williams said he feels more threatened by the number of guns on the street in New York and Washington, D.C., than he does by the militant Muslim group ISIS. Show co-host Eric Bolling shot back, ""In countries where there are higher, more strict gun laws, there is more gun violence."" We decided to see if Bolling had his facts straight. We couldn’t find proof that he did, and neither Bolling nor Fox News got back to us to show otherwise. There is no hard and fast yardstick to compare gun laws across nations, but there are some rough indicators. The United States is unusual in framing gun ownership as a right, so at the most basic legal level, most countries begin from a more restrictive starting point. There’s helpful data on gun regulation in other countries from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. According to the group’s 2011 small arms survey, personal protection is not a sufficient reason to own a weapon in Australia and the United Kingdom. In fact, in the United Kingdom, the 1996 slayings of 16 school children in Scotland led to a ban on private handguns. Japan also bans handguns. Canada requires all would-be gun owners to get a license to own a gun. They must pass a background check and complete a safety course. If they then go and buy a weapon, they must register it. They can buy a gun for personal protection, but they must show that they face an imminent threat and that police protection is not good enough. In a previous fact-check, a researcher at the study center in Geneva told us that Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom have some of the strictest gun regulations. Comparing gun violence The studies we found measured gun violence in terms of the rate of firearm-related homicides. By that standard, America ranks worst among every country of comparable economic status. David Hemenway at Harvard’s School of Public Health has looked at gun deaths across nations. ""If we look at high-income countries, the weakest gun control laws are in the United States, and we have by far the most gun violence,"" Hemenway said. ""At the other extreme are the U.K. and Japan, which have the strongest gun laws, and they have among the lowest levels of gun violence."" The World Bank provides a list of high-income countries. Based on data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and reporting by the Guardian, America does top the list for the rate of murder by gun fire with a rate of 2.97 deaths per 100,000. Chile comes next, but Chile is not on the list of wealthy nations with strict gun laws. (The full list is here.) In the wealthy group with strict laws, the data undercut Bolling’s claim. Country Homicide by firearm rate per 100,000 population United States 2.97 Canada 0.51 Australia 0.14 United Kingdom 0.07 Japan 0.01 Source: UNODC, Guardian For the countries that have tougher gun laws but lower wealth than the United States, South Africa has a higher rate of gun violence, 17.03 deaths per 100,000, and Singapore has a lower rate, .02 deaths per 100,000. Our ruling Bolling said that countries with tougher gun laws have more gun violence.  The data show that among countries more like America economically, nations with stricter regulation have much lower rates of gun-related homicides. South Africa has tougher laws but is much poorer, and it is the only exception. Bolling described a pattern that does not exist.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Climate Change', 'Credo Action']","
Obama's words and actions on climate don't match, activist video says
","President Barack Obama is playing an environmental joke on us, according to a video by progressive activist group Credo Action. This week, Obama traveled to Alaska to promote his climate change agenda. But some environmental activists see the visit as hypocritical, considering some of his other policy decisions, such as permitting oil drilling in the Arctic. To highlight what it sees as contradictory policies, Credo Action released an annotated version of a White House video promoting the Alaska trip. Credo’s video says Obama’s trip is antithetical to some of his own policies, including ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030."" Credo is right that mining 10 billion tons of coal in quick order would more than negate any carbon reductions from Obama’s EPA plan. There’s just one problem: There’s no proposal to mine 10 billion tons of coal. What proposal? Credo’s source is a 2015 report by Greenpeace, another progressive environmental activist group. The report references the federal coal lease program, by which the government leases public lands to private companies for coal mining. The report said that a field office of the Bureau of Land Management in Buffalo, Wy., is proposing several new leases that would amount to 10.2 billion tons of coal. Greenpeace estimated that burning all 10.2 billion tons would result in almost 17 billion tons of carbon pollution. That dwarfs what the Environmental Protection Agency says Obama's Clean Power Plan will cut in carbon emissions. According to the EPA, the Clean Power Plan will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by about 870 million tons annually by 2030. Greenpeace used a National Resources Defense Council estimate of the cumulative emission reductions through 2030 -- 5.3 billion tons. Greenpeace’s carbon pollution calculation is reasonable, said Michael Mann, executive director of the Institute for Energy Studies at the University of North Dakota. Roughly 2.4 pounds of carbon are produced per pound of subbituminous coal (found in Wyoming) burned. The problem is that this 10.2 billion new tons of coal proposal is nonexistent. Greenpeace -- and others who have quoted this figure -- are distorting a single line buried in a 3,000-page report. In May 2015, the Wyoming field office released a resource management plan, which says the bureau ""has estimated that it would issue 28 coal leases encompassing 106,400 acres with approximately 10.2 billion tons of coal...over the next 20 years."" But this is not a proposal or prediction. This is an outer-bounds estimate generated solely for the purposes of analysis, bureau spokeswoman Kristen Lenhardt told PolitiFact. The figures refer to the maximum amount of development possible within the 20-year lifespan of the resource management plan. The many regulatory steps that happen before land is offered for a coal lease, as well as shifts in market demand, would affect the actual amount of land available. ""It was not a plan for how much coal may, or may not be, leased in future years,"" she said. ""It is highly unlikely that actual development during the period of the plan will be anywhere close to this number of leases or acres."" Also noteworthy is the fact that the resource management plan did not designate any new lands for coal lease consideration. These 106,400 acres identified by the report were already categorized as lands that could be available for mining. Even if this were a real proposal, Credo’s timeline is unrealistic. It assumes that all 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal would be burned by 2030, which would require a staggering increase in coal use. The country has consumed around 1 billion tons of coal annually in recent years, and that’s including coal produced all over the country, not just Wyoming. There are not nearly enough power plants in the country for this to work, Mann said. The United States has fewer than 520 coal-fired plants, and that number is on the decline. ""If we replaced all of the coal that is currently burned with this new coal from Wyoming, we still would not use that much coal,"" Mann said. Our ruling A video by Credo Action said the Obama administration is ""proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030."" Burning 10 billion tons of coal over the next 15 years would unleash more carbon pollution than the federal clean energy regulations expect to save in the same period of time. However, burning that much coal in that timeframe is unrealistic, and, more importantly, the government has not made such a proposal. Rather, the 10 billion tons figure refers to an estimate -- developed solely for analysis -- of the maximum amount of coal that could be available for mining in a particular region of Wyoming over the next 20 years. Credo’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. Correction, Sept. 8, 2015: We revised the explanation of Greenpeace's estimate of the Clean Power Plan's emission reductions by 2030 to reflect that the organization's estimate is cumulative over 15 years, while the EPA's estimate is annual.",/factchecks/2015/sep/01/credo-action/obamas-words-and-actions-climate-dont-match-activi/

Scott Walker didn't fund law requiring independent review of police-involved deaths, Gwen Moore says
","In April 2014, Gov. Scott Walker signed a groundbreaking law, a decade in the making, that provides for this: Any time there is a death in Wisconsin and a police officer is involved, an outside agency -- not the officer's own department -- must conduct an investigation. News coverage suggested Walker was enthusiastically behind the bill. And since then, Walker on occasion, including at least once on the presidential campaign trail in New Hampshire, has made a point to say that the law he signed was the first of its kind in the nation.   U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, offers a different view on the GOP governor and the law. While speaking to reporters in Milwaukee on Aug. 26, 2015, Moore was asked about a comment she made about Walker’s campaign for the White House. Two days earlier, in a teleconference with reporters, she had said Walker's policies are ""tightening the noose, literally, around African-Americans."" Moore told the Milwaukee reporters she might have chosen her words differently. But she defended her criticism of Walker’s policies, such as drug testing food stamps recipients, which she said hurt African-Americans. And regarding the law on officer-involved deaths, Moore said of Walker: ""He brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it."" The implication is that Walker signed the law, but hamstrung it by not allocating money to enforce it. As we’ll see, Walker initially did not provide extra funding for a state agency that does the bulk of reviews, but ultimately signed a state budget that provided the funding. Officer-involved deaths around U.S. Officer-involved deaths around the country, particularly since the August 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., have spurred a number of claims that have been checked by PolitiFact National. Among them: National Urban League CEO Marc Morial said ""the number of killings of citizens by police"" in the United States ""is at a two-decade high."" Our colleagues rated the statement Half True. There were many unknowns in the available data. Wisconsin’s investigation law was prompted in part by the 2004 fatal shooting 21-year-old Michael Bell by police in the Wisconsin-Illinois border city of Kenosha. Wisconsin’s law The law, which had Democratic and Republican co-sponsors, applies to deaths that result ""directly from an action or an omission of a law enforcement officer while the law enforcement officer is on duty, or while the law enforcement officer is off duty but performing activities that are consistent with his or her law enforcement duties,"" according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. It says all police agencies must have a written policy regarding the investigation of officer-involved deaths, and that the policy must require a team of at least two investigators to conduct the review. The law does not specify that any particular state or local agency run the investigation. Once the investigation is complete, a report must be submitted to the district attorney in the county where the death occurred, for consideration of criminal charges. If no charges are filed, the investigation agency must release its report to the public. The funding Republican J.B. Van Hollen, who was the state attorney general when Walker signed the law, asked Walker to include money in the 2015-’17 state budget in order to implement the law. The request, for the Department of Justice, was for $738,600 for five positions -- three special agents and two analysts. Walker, however, did not include the any funding for the law as part of the budget he submitted to the Legislature in February 2015. The next month, as the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee reworked Walker’s budget, newly elected Attorney General Brad Schimel, also a Republican, renewed the funding request. ""As a result of the new legislation, the DOJ has become the go-to investigative resource when there is an officer-involved critical incident in Wisconsin,"" Schimel told the committee. ""Officer-involved death cases are very time-consuming. It is critical to public confidence in law enforcement that the investigations be conducted expeditiously and capably. In addition to the intensive work involved in conducting the investigations following an officer-involved death, the DOJ typically receives public records requests from parties. These requests require the careful review of reports, photographs, crime scene diagrams, audio and visual recordings and other multi-media prior to release."" Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick responded at the time by saying that when the bill was adopted, the Department of Justice did not anticipate a fiscal impact, and the governor's office believed no additional resources would be needed. She cited a memo that had been issued by Walker's budget office a few months before the bill became law. ""If DOJ feels as though additional funding is necessary to address these cases, we are willing to work with them and the state Legislature to ensure adequate funding,"" Patrick told the Capital Times. Two months later, in May 2015 -- with a state report showing DOJ had investigated 12 deaths in the less than a year since the law took effect, up from seven in 2013 -- the committee agreed to fund four of the five positions that were requested. So, although the law didn’t specify that the state Department of Justice investigate officer-involved deaths, as a practical matter it has become the agency doing them. The $635,000 allocation made by the Joint Finance Committee, for three agents and one analyst, ultimately became part of the two-year budget that Walker signed into law in July 2015. Our rating Moore said Walker ""brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it."" Walker has cited the fact that a law he signed was the first in the country to require independent investigations of deaths that involve police officers. And he did not include in his 2015-’17 budget proposal funds requested by the state Department of Justice for five positions to implement the law. However, three months later in the budget process, Walker signed a final budget that included money for four positions, which had been added to the spending plan by state lawmakers. So, ultimately, Walker did include some funding, although only after the Legislature included it in its version of the budget. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Moore a Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/01/gwen-moore/scott-walker-didnt-fund-law-requiring-independent-/

Dan Gecker says U.S. only wealthy nation without universal health care
","When it comes to health care, state Senate hopeful Dan Gecker says the U.S. is in a dubious league of its own. ""Of the 25 wealthiest nations, we’re the only one that doesn’t provide basic health coverage,"" Gecker, a Democrat who serves on the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, said during an Aug. 18 candidates’ forum. Gecker is seeking the 10th District Senate seat that long has been held by Republican John Watkins, who is not seeking re-election. Also running is Glen Sturtevant, a Republican who serves on the Richmond School Board; Marleen Durfee, an independent who is a former Chesterfield supervisor; and Carl Loser, a Libertarian from Powhatan County. Gecker, in his comment, was referring to universal coverage, in which all citizens get national help in paying for health costs. We wondered if he was right about about the United States’ exceptional status among the wealthiest nations. Gecker pointed us to a report last year issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 nations -- mostly with industrialized economies -- seeking to improve trade. The report says only two OECD countries -- the U.S. and Mexico -- do not offer universal care. A chart in the study shows that all of the other OECD nations provide coverage for more than 90 percent of their people.. The roster of OECD nations, however, does not translate to a list of the 25 wealthiest countries. Gecker also directed us to the World Bank’s ranking of the wealthiest nations based on each country’s gross domestic product divided by its population -- a figure called GDP per capita. About two-thirds of the nations on the World Bank’s 25-richest list belong to the OECD. We sought to compare that ranking with a list of all nations that provide universal health care. We found two organizations that try to keep tabs on nations that provide universal coverage. One is the New York State Department of Health, which compiled a 2011 list to give medical providers guidance on billing practices when they treat foreign patients. The other resource is a 2010 study by researchers in the United Kingdom and the U.S. examining universal health care around the world. Among high GDP-per-capita nations, universal care coverage is the norm. Only three of the 25 wealthiest -- the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Qatar -- weren’t listed as having universal health care. The embassy for Qatar told us that the country does provide universal health care. Saudi Arabia is listed as providing universal health care in a June 28, 2012, story from The Atlantic magazine. We reached out to the Saudi Arabian embassy several times to confirm that’s the case, but did not hear back. A 1998 study published in the Journal of Family Community Medicine says ""Saudi Arabian policy is to provide free, comprehensive and universal health care services to all citizens."" The final source Gecker cited is a 2012 op-ed by David de Ferranti, former vice president of the World Bank, and Julio Frenk, the former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, about universal health care coverage. ""Except for the United States, the 25 wealthiest nations have some form of it (universal coverage),"" de Ferranti and Frenk wrote in their op-ed. We got a similar take from two other health care analysts we contacted. Andrea Feigl, a visiting scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the 2010 U.K.-U.S. report, told us in an email that ""The United States is still on its way towards UHC (Universal Health Coverage), and it is the last developed country to do so."" The World Health Organization said in a September 2014 report that the United States is ""currently the only high-income country without nearly universal health-care coverage."" Our ruling Gecker said that ""of the 25 wealthiest nations, we’re the only one that doesn’t provide basic health coverage."" Gecker was referring to rich nations that provide coverage to all of their citizens. We can’t say definitively that the U.S. is the only one that doesn’t provide universal coverage, but evidence strongly points that way.

They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed."" So we did. We’ll take the two parts of the claim in turn. ‘We have 93 million people out of work’ We have addressed claims like this one previously and have not rated them favorably. Trump’s press office did not answer an inquiry, but we have a good idea where the number came from. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official collector of employment data, either 92 million or 93 million members of the civilian, non-institutionalized population who were age 16 and over were not in the labor force in July 2015. (There are slight differences in the figure if you use seasonally adjusted numbers as opposed to non-seasonally adjusted numbers.) But what does this number actually mean? For one, it includes lots of people who likely aren’t looking for work. It includes every American of retirement age -- 65 and older. It includes every high-school student at least 16 years of age. It includes every college and many graduate or professional-school students. It includes every person who has a disability that makes it impossible for them to work. It includes parents who are choosing to stay home to take care of their kids. It includes every adult who’s gone back to school full-time. It even includes trust-fund kids who are living off investments. Put it all together and this is not a trivial group of people. Out of the 93.8 million Americans age 16 and up who are deemed ""not in the labor force,"" 9.7 million of them are between 16 and 19 years of age. Another 5.7 million are between 20 and 24. And 37.8 million are age 65 and over. (In fact, 17.5 million are over 75 years old.) What’s left? This leaves 40.5 million Americans who are not in the labor force and are between the ages of 25 and 64. It’s possible to argue that this number should be a bit higher -- college typically ends at age 22, not everyone goes to college, and healthy seniors today can usually work past 65 if they wish. But right off the top, Trump’s claim significantly overstates the matter. So what’s a better number? The official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it’s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it’s not unreasonable to include: • The 6.4 million people who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being ""in the labor force,"" but who say they ""currently want a job."" • And the 6.5 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job. This would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as ""out of work"" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that’s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered. Most of Trump’s 93 million ""don’t want to work and are not in the job market,"" said Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed and associate professor at George Washington University. Burtless added that a large chunk of those suffering the plague of being ""out of work"" can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society. ""The fact that these adults are jobless is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits,"" he said. ‘They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed’ The second half of Trump’s claim is no closer to accurate. Trump seems to suggest that government statisticians are performing something like medieval alchemy, turning lead (unemployment) into gold (employment) with the flick of a wand. But if someone gives up looking for a job, they are counted as either unemployed or not in the labor force -- not as ""employed."" There actually is an official statistical category for a person in this situation: If someone wants and looks for a job but then gives up, they are called ""discouraged workers."" Specifically, these people ""want and are available for a job and who have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months"" but are ""not currently looking because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify."" However, ""discouraged workers"" are relatively rare -- in the most recent month, there were 668,000 of them, or less than 1 percent of the 93 million ""out of work"" Americans Trump referred to. Burtless said that Trump’s statement is ""so confusingly wide of the mark"" that he may have misspoken. Our ruling Trump said, ""We have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed."" That figure, boosted by Trump’s description, represents a basic misunderstanding of the labor market. Once you strip out full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen not to work to take care of their children, a more reasonable estimate of ""out of work"" Americans is somewhere in the neighborhood of 21 million, or less than a quarter of Trump’s figure. Meanwhile, he is flat wrong that the government reclassifies discouraged workers as ""employed."" We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-has-93-milion-people-out-work/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says he has released all his emails from time as governor
","As the other presidential candidate with a private email server, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to contrast himself with Democrat Hillary Clinton. ""My email address, write it down, and send me your thoughts, [email protected],"" he’s shown telling a crowd in an Aug. 27, 2015, campaign video (the clip is from the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on Aug. 14). ""By the way, I just gave out my email address. It’s exactly what I did when I was governor of the state of Florida. I released all my emails; I’m writing an e-book about my emails."" Bush and Clinton have drawn criticism from campaign rivals because they both used private email accounts and servers for their government jobs. But can Bush claim he’s released all of his emails as a way of drawing a distinction between himself and Clinton? No, in reality, he's done exactly what Clinton has done. Bush says he has turned over and made public all the emails he was required to. That's the same argument Clinton is making. And like Clinton, that means we may never know with 100 percent certainty if Bush left out any work-related emails. The email trail Clinton has faced mounting scrutiny first into whether she turned over all of her non-personal emails to the State Department, then questions about how she handled information that was eventually marked classified. Bush, meanwhile, has been very vocal about being open and transparent in his digital dealings. In December 2014, he announced the website jebbushemails.com, an archive of emails from the private email address he used as Florida’s governor, [email protected]. Bush used the private address on a private server every year between 1999 and 2007, corresponding with constituents and conducting state business while using a server he owned and kept at the governor’s office in Tallahassee. The archive site went live in February 2015 with a total message count his campaign has put at about 280,000. Now, that may sound like a lot, but they were by no means every email message Bush sent while he was governor, nor were they newly available to the public. The emails were already a part of the state archives, and could have been accessed by anyone who asked for them. That’s because under Florida’s Sunshine Law, an official has to turn over records and emails related to government business ""at the expiration of his or her term of office."" Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush’s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007. The last batch of emails was turned over in June 2014, raising a few eyebrows among critics for taking an unusually long time. The last batch of 25,000 emails was described as ""Additional 2002-2003 emails."" The American Democracy Legal Fund on Aug. 27 accused Bush of violating public records law for taking too long to turn over all his records. The group has asked the state attorney’s office in Leon County to fine Bush, although the rules on how long he could take are somewhat murky. So how many emails did Bush send as governor? We’ve asked the state archives to confirm the exact number they have from all accounts, but have not heard back. We’ll update this item if they let us know. The Bush campaign also did not confirm to us whether he meant he’d released all the emails from his private server, but it’s pretty clear he did not release every single one. We do know that during a 2007 interview, Bush said his private server had about 550,000 messages on it, a number his campaign has since declined to confirm to PolitiFact Florida. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told us in March that the number of emails on the server is ""immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained."" Bush also guessed he had gotten about 2.5 million more emails through a public email account run by the state. We aren’t really counting state account emails in this case, because the government was responsible for reviewing and archiving those. First Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen has told PolitiFact that state workers would have seen and vetted messages from state government accounts, and not Bush’s private staff or lawyers. She thought most of the Bush emails from any official account had been retained and made public through the state archives. There also have been reports of a third account, [email protected], which Bush’s campaign has denied having. The emails that Bush turned over from the private server, however, are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising, which the Sunshine Law allows him to do. So that means he didn’t literally release all his emails, just the ones he says he was required to give the state. There’s nothing in the law preventing him (or an authorized custodian) from editing them down the way he did, or from using a private account. But that also leaves room for doubt as to whether he left some messages out that should have been included in the public sweep. That is no different than points raised by Clinton’s detractors who have questioned whether she included all pertinent materials from her server. In short, we have to take Clinton’s word that she complied with the law. Same with Bush. Critics have pointed out there is a lack of correspondence among Bush’s released emails about subjects ranging from the 2000 election to Terri Schiavo (the case of a Florida woman on life support who Bush and lawmakers tried to intervene to save) to voter purges, although he did discuss Florida National Guard deployments via email after Sept. 11, 2001. In Florida, there are ways to investigate whether something that should have been included in public records isn’t available. Petersen said someone who thinks messages are missing from a records request can sue Bush in civil court and ask a judge to inspect the server. But there’s no evidence Bush has violated state law. No judge has asked for an inspection to see if any messages that should have been included are missing, either. Our ruling Bush said, ""I released all my emails."" In trying to draw a contrast to Hillary Clinton, Bush actually offered much of the same defense. In reality, Bush says he released all the emails he was required to under Florida law, in the same way Clinton says she turned over all the emails she was required to under federal law. But Bush hasn’t turned over every single email he sent as governor. While the state handled his public account’s emails, he was allowed to self-edit [email protected] correspondence from his private server. That amounted to 280,000 emails out of a half-million or more, which Bush repackaged on a website earlier this year. Bush’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Brat says he's among ""very few"" who voted against Iran deal
","Again and again, U.S. Rep. Dave Brat places himself in the vanguard of congressmen opposed to the Iran nuclear deal. ""I was one of the few, very few, who voted `no’ on the Iran deal,"" Brat, R-7th, said during an Aug. 10 breakfast with Henrico County business leaders. ""On the Iran bill, you want to know one of the few people who voted `no’ on the deal?"" Brat asked at speech that night at the University of Richmond. He answered by raising his hand. And during an Aug. 18 radio interview on ""The John Frederick Show,"" Brat reiterated, ""I was one of the few votes against the Iran deal because I believe the Senate has a constitutional duty on treaties."" All of this caught our attention for a simple reason: The Iran deal hasn’t come up for a vote. So we took a deep dive into Brat’s statements. The deal, you’ll remember, was reached in July between Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States. Iran agreed to limit significantly its nuclear capabilities for more than a decade in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions that have crippled its economy. Supporters say the accord, while far from perfect, has safeguards that will prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in the near term. They say the U.S. needed to make concessions, because many of its allies have grown weary of continuing economic sanctions against the oil-rich nation. Opponents say the deal lacks long-term guarantees that Iran -- hostile to Israel and the U.S. -- won’t develop nukes. They say the U.S. should demand that Iran renounce any future nuclear arms ambitions in exchange for lifting sanctions. Brat has made these points repeatedly. But when did the congressman vote against the accord? Jack Minor, Brat’s communications director, told us the vote occurred June 14 on a bill that gave Congress the power to review and potentially reject the Iran deal. The House overwhelmingly passed the measure, 400-25, with Brat voting in the minority. A week earlier, the bill sailed through the Senate on a 98-1 vote. It’s important to note that the roll calls were not up-or-down votes on the deal and that the bill did not directly pertain to provisions in the accord. The measure set up a review process that would require Congress, if it’s of such a mind, to pass a resolution rejecting the accord. If one or both of the chambers can’t muster a majority vote against the agreement by Sept. 17, the deal takes effect. Brat voted against the review bill because, according to Minor, it would ""grease the skids"" for the deal. Let’s explain: President Barack Obama had a choice on how to designate the accord: either as a treaty or as an executive agreement. He opted for the latter, and Brat objects to that decision. An executive agreement is a political accord -- as opposed to a legal one -- between heads of states. Presidents of both parties increasingly have opted to enter into executive agreements because, unlike a treaty, they give Congress narrow -- if any -- sway. A treaty, which is a binding legal agreement, must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the 100-member Senate. That would be an impossible barrier for the Iran deal, given that 41 Republicans and two Democrats in the senate already have said they oppose the deal, according to an article on The Hill, a political website.    Executive agreements are not binding; they can be reversed by the next president. The trade-off, for sitting presidents, is that they do not necessarily require congressional approval. In the case of the Iran deal, with emotions high on both sides, Obama agreed to give Congress a say through the procedures bill that Brat opposed. Under the legislation, as we’ve said, Congress could reject the Iran agreement with a majority vote in each chamber. But, as Brat and others note, Obama likely would veto such a resolution. His veto would be sustained if it’s backed by one-third of the members in either house -- a low hurdle given Democratic support for the accord. That’s a far smaller threshold than the two-thirds backing Obama would need in the Senate to pass a treaty. Brat opposed the procedures bill because he believes Obama has a constitutional obligation to submit the Iran deal as a treaty, according to Minor, the congressman’s spokesman. Brat has introduced a bill, with three cosponsors, that would require the deal to be considered as a treaty. The measure is sitting in the in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Does Brat’s vote against the procedures make him one of ""the few"" to vote against the accord? We asked two political scientists who have studied the use of treaties and executive agreements to weigh in. Michael Ramsey at the University of San Diego said the claim is misleading, because if the procedures bill had failed, as Brat hoped, Obama would have been free to implement the Iran deal without consulting Congress. Even if Brat had carried the day, ""that would have not stopped the deal,"" Ramsey said. Ramsey also said Brat’s statement inaccurately implies that legislators who voted for the procedures bill support the Iran deal. To the contrary, 197 House Republicans who backed the procedures bill have signed a resolution voicing disapproval of the Iran accord. All told, 219 Republicans -- including Brat -- have signed the resolution. That’s more than half of the House. Andrew Rudalevige at Bowdoin College said Brat cast a symbolic vote against the deal. But he also noted that if Congress had rejected the procedures bill, ""they wouldn’t have given themselves the review and reporting requirements that were in the act, and that Obama agreed to, so you can argue they would have been worse off on the margins."" Rudalevige added, ""The real vote against the Iran deal will be when the resolution for disapproval comes up on the floor."" Our ruling Brat says, ""I was one of the few, very few, who voted `no’ on the Iran deal."" But the Iran accord has not come up for a vote. What Brat voted against was a procedural bill that gave Congress the power to review and potentially reject the Iran accord. Brat objected that Obama negotiated the deal as an executive agreement instead of as a treaty, which would have been required to clear a higher level of congressional support. The congressman was in the minority on a 400-25 bipartisan vote to pass the procedures. Brat’s statement implies that those who backed the bill supported the Iran deal. To the contrary, had the bill failed, Obama could have enacted the Iran deal without input from Congress. Almost 200 Republicans who voted for the procedures that allow them to have a say subsequently have signed a resolution opposing the Iran accord. Clearly, Brat cast what he sees as a protest vote against the deal. But again, the real vote on the accord has not occurred and when it does, many in addition to Brat are poised to oppose it. We rate Brat’s statement False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/31/dave-brat/brat-says-hes-among-very-few-who-voted-against-ira/

Bobby Jindal: 'I'm the only candidate that has actually reduced the size of government'
","Fresh from marking the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal says he thinks the political storm caused by Donald Trump will die down after the weather cools off. Jindal, who’s No. 14 in the latest polls, said on ABC’s This Week that while Trump ""has done a great job tapping into the anger, the frustration that voters feel,"" there’s only one candidate with true conservative bona fides: himself.   ""I think after we get past this summer of silliness and insults, the voters are going to begin to look at who is prepared to do the job,"" he said on Aug. 30. ""Right now the American people are saying we've got to shrink the size of the government, grow the American economy. I'm the only candidate — there are not two — I'm the only candidate that has actually reduced the size of government, and I think that experience matters."" We were curious about Jindal’s claim that he’s the only candidate out of 17, including 8 former or current governors, who’s walked the fiscal conservative walk. The answer is, it depends on the analysis. Jindal’s evidence On his website, Jindal makes a more specific version of the claim: Jindal is ""the only candidate to actually cut spending."" To back up the claim, he cites a report by libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. (A spokesperson for Jindal confirmed that this is what he was referring to on ABC.) According to Cato, Jindal is indeed the only governor out of the eight running to have cut spending. During his seven-year tenure as Louisiana's chief, Jindal reduced spending by an average of 1.76 percent every year. Every other governor increased spending. Here’s a graph that details this:  Jindal’s chart doesn’t factor in the size of the states, which Cato says is important. When adjusted for population, Jindal’s numbers actually come out looking better: 2.41 percent per capita in cuts every year. ""Bobby Jindal shows the most fiscal restraint,"" the report concludes. (Much of the reduction, reported the Times-Picayune in 2011, is ""explained by waning hurricane recovery appropriations and the end of federal stimulus aid."") However, the Cato report is just one way, and something of a simplistic way, to look at the state budget picture. It fails to consider the different per capita income levels across different states (higher incomes bring more government services and thus spending), different approaches to handling federal money (Ohio Gov. John Kasich, for example, took the Medicaid expansion while Jindal did not), and different time periods, lists Alan Auerbach, a professor of public finance at the University of California at Berkeley. Unlike Jindal and other sitting governors, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee and George Pataki weren’t leading their states through economic downturns. Auerbach explains: ""During recessions, balanced-budget requirements have typically forced states to cut spending, in addition to legislating tax increases."" Kasich himself takes issue with Cato’s analysis, arguing that Cato focused on a specific pool of money known as the general revenue fund. Kasich prefers instead to look at the all-funds budget, a much larger pot of federal and state money. (Cato’s response: ""Our data is correct, and so is his. Kasich seems to pick the dataset that shed the best light on him."") Chris Edwards, Cato’s director of tax policy, argued that the general fund data is more recent and perhaps more relevant than the all-funds. ""Governors have more direct control over the general fund budget,"" he said. ""A lot of the non-general fund budget comes from the federal government, which governors don’t have much control over."" Another way to run the numbers Others have looked at this question and come up with different results. If we look at all-funds and adjust for the time differences, four governors actually out-cut Jindal, according to a fact-check by Fox News, which compared each governor’s budgets to their contemporaries (in other words, how Bush stacked up against other governors in the 2000s, and how Jindal is doing compared to sitting governors). The two top spenders by Cato’s count, Bush and Kasich, actually ranked best in Fox News’ analysis. Bush and Kasich slashed spending by 3.66 percent and 1.76 percent respectively. Jindal, meanwhile, came in at No. 5 on the Fox News analysis, with an average reduction of 0.25 percent per year. Here’s Fox’s breakdown: This is still an imperfect way of comparing the budget records of the various governors, but to an extent, it’s fairer, Auerbach said. ""Controlling for what other states did at the same time certainly is better than not controlling for time period,"" he said. ""One might do better still by controlling for relative economic conditions in the different states but … the controls are reasonable."" Our ruling Jindal said, ""I’m the only candidate that has actually reduced the size of government."" He was talking about the cuts in spending. To his credit, a Cato report backs his claim. However, there’s more than one way of looking at spending cuts. One other approach that an expert said is valid suggests that Jindal was out-cut by four other governors. Jindal’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/30/bobby-jindal/bobby-jindal-im-only-candidate-has-actually-reduce/

Bernie Sanders: 'Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the entire world'
","Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has so far centered his campaign around domestic issues such as income inequality, campaign finance reform and college affordability. In a Sunday interview on ABC’s This Week, however, host Martha Raddatz took the opportunity to ask the Vermont senator about an issue that isn’t even included on his campaign website -- foreign policy. Raddatz asked Sanders to explain his vote against the 1991 Gulf war and his opposition to increased military action in Syria and Iraq, compared to his support for military action in Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2011. Sanders said he thought the United States could have forced Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait without invading, and that military action should be ""the last resort, not the first resort."" ""The United States cannot do it alone,"" Sanders added. ""In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the entire world. They're going to have to get in and take on ISIS as well as other countries in that region. The United States should be supportive. We should be working with other countries. But the United States cannot always be the only country involved in these wars."" We wondered about Sanders’ claim that Saudi Arabia, with a population roughly the size of Texas, has the ""third-largest military budget in the entire world."" Sanders’ campaign pointed us to the latest statistics from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), widely cited as an authoritative source for international security statistics. We looked at IISS figures for a separate defense-related fact-check last year. According to estimates from the IISS, Saudi Arabia did have the world’s third-largest military budget in 2014, at around $80.8 billion. Its budget was smaller than only those of China and the United States.    Another reputable group, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), catalogues the security expenditures of 171 countries every year. On that list, Saudi Arabia ranked fourth in 2014, behind the United States, China and Russia. Why the difference? SIPRI estimates that Russia spent around $84 billion on defense in 2014, almost $14 billion more than the IISS estimates it budgeted. The dataset’s footnotes, however, make clear that Saudi Arabia likely spent much more than $80 billion on military-related activities in 2014. SIPRI says its numbers ""may not include billions of dollars of military aid for Lebanon and Egypt that was announced in 2013 and 2014."" Saudi Arabia hasn’t always spent this much on its military. Its defense budget has grown fourfold in the last 10 years, from around $20 billion in 2004 to $80 billion in 2014, an increase that reflects the intensification of the Saudis’ military involvement in the rest of the Middle East. For the record, SIPRI’s best estimates for military expenditures in North Korea and Iran are significantly below the budget of Saudi Arabia’s defense. Our ruling Sanders said, ""Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the entire world."" While there are a few different ways to calculate this statistic, both studies we looked at placed the size of Saudi Arabia’s military budget at or near No. 3 in the world.

Bernie Sanders is right: Police do treat African Americans differently
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, is trying to attract black voters to his presidential campaign, despite some opposition from activists in the Black Lives Matter movement. The website for Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic nomination devotes an entire section to ""Racial Justice."" It kicks off by reciting the names of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and other individuals who have died during encounters with police. ""We know their names,"" it says. ""Each of them died unarmed at the hands of police officers or in police custody… We should not fool ourselves into thinking that this violence only affects those whose names have appeared on TV or in the newspaper."" Then it says this: ""African Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police."" Further into Sanders’ presentation, the policy statement repeats the same two points. Only this time, these points closely follow some other statistics about blacks being three times as likely to be searched during a traffic stop, a statistic attributed to a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report. We wondered where Sanders had gotten his information about blacks being twice as likely to be arrested and being almost four times as likely to experience police force. Sanders’ policy advisor, Warren Gunnels, initially referred us to a 2007 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report based on 10-year-old data from 2005.   He directed us to the first page, where the federal statisticians had reported that ""...black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be arrested."" This didn’t support the statement that African Americans are twice as likely to be arrested in all cases for all arrests. The report did make a convincing presentation on another page showing that in 4.4 percent of their contacts with police, blacks experienced a use of force in 2005, while whites experienced force in only 1.2 percent of their contacts with police. This did support Sanders’ statement that African Americans are almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with police. In 2011, the federal statisticians revisited the same issue, examining 2008 statistics. They found that blacks experienced a use of force in 3.4 percent of their contacts with police. The percentage for the whites was still 1.2 percent. So the updated statistics show blacks being just shy of three times as likely — not almost four times as likely — to experience force during an arrest. Is there also more current data on the first part of Sanders’ claim? We got back to Gunnels to follow up on the likelihood of arrest question. Gunnels directed us to a report compiled by The Sentencing Project, a Washington D.C.-based organization that promotes alternatives to imprisonment and also carries out research on criminal justice issues, including racial disparities. A passage in that 2008 report asserted that blacks are arrested at a rate twice their share of the population. Marc Mauer, The Sentencing Project’s director, provided additional analysis based on 2013 arrest statistics from the FBI Uniform Crime Report and data from the U.S. Census. In 2013, blacks represented 28.3 percent of all persons arrested, even though they were only about 13.2 percent of the national population, Mauer said, noting that the 13.2 percent population figure is an estimate that tends to fluctuate. ""If all things were equal, you would expect blacks to represent 13.2 percent of all arrests,"" Mauer said. ""But they are not equal. The 28 percent figure is a little more than double the national population figure."" By contrast, whites represented about 77.7 percent of the population in 2013, Mauer said, and whites represented about 68.9 percent of all arrests. Does this mean blacks are twice as likely to be arrested as whites? ""They are arrested at twice their share of the population,"" Mauer said. And yes, he said, this also means blacks are twice as likely to be arrested as whites. Our ruling Blacks are twice as likely to be arrested as whites based on a criminologist’s analysis of the 2013 data. But, based on the latest numbers that the federal statisticians could provide regarding  use of force, blacks are about three times as likely to experience force during encounters with police. Three times is not ""almost four times,"" but Sanders was 75 percent correct, which is more than a passing score and the rate was close to four times in an older study. For this reason, we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/30/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-right-police-do-treat-african-ameri/

Donald Trump says U.S. is 'most highly taxed nation in the world'
","During a recent interview on Fox & Friends, Donald Trump offered a digression on tax policy -- at times an unorthodox one, at least for a Republican. For instance, Trump said that hedge fund managers -- some of them the billionaire counted as ""friends"" -- are ""not paying enough tax."" He also rejected a flat tax, an idea supported by some Republicans, countering that progressivity in the tax code is important. ""As you make a certain amount of money, I think you should have to graduate upward"" in tax rates, Trump said. Then he shifted gears again, articulating a more traditional Republican argument in favor of lowering taxes. ""Look, we’re the most highly taxed nation in the world — that’s why taxes have to go down, business has to come back, jobs have to be back,"" he said. A reader asked us if the United States is the ""mostly highly taxed nation in the world,"" so we decided to check it out. Trump’s press office did not respond to an inquiry. We should note that a more specific claim would have been largely accurate. We have given a Mostly True rating to the claim that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. (The statutory corporate tax rate ranks as the world's highest, but widespread deductions and exclusions tend to lower the effective rate below the comparative level for other countries.) But Trump's comment doesn't cite the corporate tax rate, and he seemed to be discussing overall tax rates when he said the United States is ""the most highly taxed nation in the world."" When we asked tax experts what they thought was the best yardstick for comparing different countries, they pointed to two possible criteria. One was tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The other was tax revenue per capita. Both measures are calculated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 advanced industrialized nations. We found that for both measurements, many of the United States’ industrialized peers had higher levels of taxation in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available. Taxes accounted for about 25 percent of the United States’ gross domestic product -- but if that sounds like a lot, it was only enough to rank the United States 27th out of 30 countries studied. The five with the highest percentages were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Sweden, each of them with taxation accounting for more than 42 percent of gross domestic product. Only South Korea, Chile and Mexico had lower levels of taxation per GDP than the United States. When looking at tax revenue per capita, the United States ranks somewhat higher, but still far from the top. Taxes per capita in the United States totaled $13,482, according to the OECD data. That ranked 16th out of 29 countries for which data was available for 2013. The five with the highest per-capita amounts were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, with amounts ranging from $23,000 to $48,000. Eleven countries had per-capita amounts less than $10,000, including Hungary, Chile and Turkey, the bottom three on the list. While it probably makes the most sense to compare the United States to other advanced, industrialized nations, there is one additional data source that includes the full roster of countries -- the World Bank. In the World Bank’s comparison of 115 countries for 2012, the U.S. ranked 12th from the bottom in taxation as a percentage of GDP. Among the countries with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), some wealthy oil-producing nations (Oman and Kuwait) and handful of very poor countries (including Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). Bottom line: Trump is wrong by all the data sets we looked at. Our ruling Trump said the United States is ""the most highly taxed nation in the world."" Depending on the measurement you use, the United States is either in the middle of the pack or on the lighter end of taxation when compared to other advanced industrialized nations. We rate his claim False.  ",/factchecks/2015/aug/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-most-highly-taxed-nation-worl/

Hillary Clinton says Jeb Bush and Donald Trump share same views on immigration
","While Donald Trump and Jeb Bush have been arguing about immigration policy, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton says the competing Republican candidates actually hold the same views. ""How do Jeb Bush and Donald Trump differ on immigration? Spoiler alert: They don't,"" her campaign wrote in an Aug. 25th tweet. That tweet included a campaign video released a day after Bush visited the border in McAllen, Texas. The video shows clips of Bush and Trump saying they would repeal President Barack Obama’s actions related to immigration, expressing concerns about ""anchor babies"" and calling for a path to legal status, not citizenship. ""Don’t let the surface distract you,"" Clinton says. ""Most of the other candidates are just Trump without the pizzazz or the hair."" We won’t compare the personality (or hair) of Trump and Bush, but we will fact-check Clinton’s statement that the two candidates share the same views on immigration. Spoiler alert: the candidates’ statements on immigration policy cover a broad range of laws and topics and can’t be boiled down to a tweet or short video. While Bush and Trump agree in some areas, they have also shown sharp contrasts on immigration policy. Where Bush and Trump are similar Let’s look at the areas Clinton cited in her video as evidence that Bush and Trump overlap. Obama’s executive action: ""I will immediately terminate President Obama’s illegal executive order on immigration,"" Trump said in his June 16 announcement. In his speech ,Trump didn’t make it clear if he was referring to Obama’s 2012 program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, or the 2014 program aimed at parents, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA. In an interview on Meet the Press in August, Trump said he would rescind DACA but he wasn’t asked point blank about DAPA. Then, the video shows Fox News’ Sean Hannity asking Bush, ""Would you repeal Obama’s executive amnesty?"" and Bush replies ""yes."" Bush has said he would get rid of both DACA and DAPA, but a spokesman said he’d do that after after comprehensive immigration reform passed. Legal status: Trump told CNN’s Dana Bash that if elected his plan for illegal immigrants would be to ""get the bad ones out."" But he also called for having immigrants leave and then come back legally: ""I would get people out, and I would have an expedited way of getting them back into the country, so they can be legal. Let them be legal. .... I love the idea of immigration, but it's got to be legal immigration."" Here is the back-and-forth that followed about legal status: Bash: ""When you say legal, do you mean legal status, or can they be eligible for citizenship?"" Trump: ""Legal status."" Bash: ""No citizenship?"" Trump: ""No citizenship. We will see. Later down the line, who knows what is going to happen, but legal status."" Clinton’s video then shows Hannity summarizing Bush's position as ""legal status, but not citizenship"" and Bush replies ""exactly."" Bush told Hannity that his plan as outlined in his book calls for earned legal status and ""over an extended period of time, you earn legal status."" If we compare recent statements, Trump and Bush agree on providing legal status to certain immigrants and not citizenship, but that was not always the case with Bush, because at times in the past he expressed support for path to citizenship. Anchor babies: ""I’ll use the word anchor baby,"" Trump said Aug. 20. Then Clinton’s video cuts to an interview in which Bush on Aug. 19 called for ""better enforcement so that you don't have these, you know, 'anchor babies,' as they're described, coming into the country."" In another clip Bush defends his use of the term ""anchor babies"" -- a term some immigration activists find offensive. Asked by a reporter about using the term Bush said, ""No, I don’t regret it. Do you have a better term?"" So both have used the term ""anchor babies."" The Clinton campaign told us the tweet on Trump and Bush agreeing referred only to these areas. But we found many other specifics where Trump and Bush didn't agree that were not mentioned in the video, and that makes the tweet misleading. Where Bush and Trump are different We asked spokespersons for the Bush and Trump campaign to cite areas where they differ on immigration policy but did not get a reply from Trump’s campaign. Here’s a few key examples of where they differ: Mass deportations: Trump has called for mass deportations. He said on The O’Reilly Factor on Aug. 24: "" If I’m elected, they’re going to be out of here day one. We’re going to get them the hell out of our country. They’re going to be out so fast your head will spin."" Bush has repeatedly said that mass deportation is an unrealistic solution. On his campaign website Bush said it would cost as much as $600 billion, would step on civil liberties and is ""a border plan that could be best described as a fantasy."" A wall between Mexico and the United States: Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall between the two countries and impound remittances which Bush says is unrealistic. ""So who is going to decide who is legally remitting money back to their families in other countries? Are we going to go door-by-door and just do this? It’s just not practical at all,"" Bush said at a town hall in Englewood, Colo., on Aug. 25. Birthright citizenship: Trump calls for ending birthright citizenship and argues that it could be done despite the 14th amendment. Bush defended birthright citizenship. ""That’s a constitutional right. Mr. Trump can say that he’s for this because people are frustrated that it’s abused. But we ought to fix the problem rather than take away rights that are constitutionally in doubt,"" Bush told CBS’ Major Garrett on Aug. 18. Rhetoric: Trump has made some statements about immigration that Bush has criticized, including Trump’s comments about Mexicans: ""They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people"" Trump said. Bush has said such rhetoric is ""way out of the mainstream and ""To make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Trump is wrong on this."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""How do Jeb Bush and Donald Trump differ on immigration? Spoiler alert: They don't."" Bush and Trump agree in some areas, including getting rid of Obama’s executive action. Both also call for a pathway to legal status and not citizenship, although Bush in the past has spoken in favor of citizenship. But in many other areas they disagree. Trump calls for mass deportation, ending birthright citizenship and building a wall between Mexico and the United States, all major policy changes that Bush has denounced. Clinton’s overall message here that there is no daylight between Bush and Trump is misleading, although there is a kernel of truth here in that they overlap a few immigration policies.

"['Terrorism', 'PunditFact', 'Curt Schilling']","
Schilling throws wild pitch with Nazi stat
","Curt Schilling, the baseball pitcher and ESPN commentator, normally tweets about baseball, the Bible and members of the armed services. But on Aug. 25, he lobbed a different message into the twittersphere. Schilling passed along a graphic to his 133,000 followers that had a photo of Adolf Hitler giving the Nazi salute. The image had two lines. ""It’s said that only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. ""In 1940, only 7% of Germans were Nazis. How’d that go?"" Schilling quickly found himself suspended from commentary duties by ESPN.  He retracted the tweet and wrote, ""I understand and accept my suspension. 100% my fault. Bad choices have bad consequences and this was a bad decision in every way on my part."" Still, many readers asked us to assess his claim. The point of the graphic is opaque, and its logic faces some logical stumbling blocks. Muslim extremists are non-state actors, while German Nazis were fighting for the German nation. And as Vox pointed out, Muslim extremists primarily kill other Muslims, while Germans signed on to subjugate or kill non-Germans, Jews, gays, and political opponents of any stripe. These are not insignificant differences. Regarding extremist Muslims, we’ve examined before the challenge of identifying, much less counting them. If counting armed jihadists is your standard, then a 2014 estimate done for the Bipartisan Policy Center's Homeland Security Project, the follow-on group to the 9-11 Commission, suggests there are about 100,000. Out of a worldwide Muslim population of about 945 million, that’s about a hundredth of a percent. But beyond actual fighters, the definition can rest in the eye of the beholder. The kind of numbers thrown around in the tweet would include Muslims who might endorse some fundamentalist principles but not all. You won’t find reliable numbers because the definition is vague and the data are too limited. That loose standard for Muslim extremists stands in sharp contrast to the numbers behind the claim about Germans, our focus in this fact-check. The statistic that in 1940, only 7 percent of Germans were Nazis seems to rely on a very narrow definition of who was a Nazi. If it has any accuracy, it counts only Germans who formally joined the party, which excludes a much larger number who were supporters. In his book The Nazi Party 1919-1945: A complete history, Dietrich Orlow wrote that early in the war, membership in the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (the full name of the Nazi party) surged to about 6.5 million. Georg Fertig is a professor of economic history and specialist in historical demography at Halle University in Germany. Fertig told us the 6.5 million figure is based on sound sources. Fertig and a large team of economic and social historians recently collected historical data on Germany going back to 1834. It shows that in 1940, there were about 69.8 million Germans. That would mean party members represented about 9 percent of the total. That’s not too much different from Schilling’s figure. But party membership was for adults, not children. In 1939, Germany had about 52 million people over 15. In that light, formal Nazi party members represented about 12 percent of the relevant population. However, the wrinkles don’t stop there. By 1940, Germany had annexed Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia, so defining the German population base gets dicey. If party membership was the be-all and end-all of defining Nazi supporters, the claim would be in fine shape. But the reality is far from that simple. For starters, in the last totally free elections in Germany in 1932, the Nazi party beat out every other party, winning about 33 percent of the vote and taking control of the parliament, or Reichstag. That election put Hitler on his path to running the country. (In presidential elections earlier in the year, Hitler did not do as well.) Fertig said the Reichstag vote is an inexact yardstick for German support, although it captures some level of popular sympathy for the Nazi agenda. After 1933, Germany was a totalitarian state, and voting was either coerced or nonexistent. Thomas Kuehne is a professor of history and director of Holocaust and genocide graduate studies at Clark University. Kuehne told PunditFact that it is difficult to define with certainty who was a Nazi. Formal membership in the party was just one measure. Kuehne said the general consensus among historians is that the regime’s popularity peaked around 1940 thanks to the rapid German victories known as Blitzkrieg. He sees the winning percentage of 33 percent in 1932 as a useful benchmark. ""There is no reason to assume that this share decreased before, say, late 1944,"" Kuehne said. ""The 7 percent figure is totally misleading."" But even with that, both experts cautioned that it is notoriously difficult to put hard numbers to the question of which Germans would call themselves a Nazi. Our ruling Schilling tweeted that in 1940 only 7 percent of Germans were Nazis. That figure is too low. It might be close for the more limited fraction of Nazi supporters who formally joined the party, but it ignores the Nazis’ electoral domination in 1932 and the popularity that came after the first military victories in 1939. The vote results and the assessment of the experts we reached point to a much larger figure in the range of 35 percent. That’s five times larger than the figure in the tweet. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/

Ted Cruz: Obama administration released 104,000 'criminal illegal aliens' including 196 murderers
","Stumping for president in Iowa, Sen. Ted Cruz charged President Barack Obama with releasing thousands of violent criminals living in the U.S. without legal authorization, the Dallas Morning News noted in a news blog post. The Texas Republican, who was visiting the Iowa State Fair, told reporters: ""The Obama administration is releasing violent criminal illegal aliens. In the year 2013, the Obama administration released 104,000 criminal illegal aliens. They released 196 murderers – people with homicide convictions, who are here illegally. That’s what I find objectionable."" A moment later, Cruz said that as president, he would secure the U.S. borders and ""stop releasing violent criminal illegal aliens."" Cruz didn’t assert the administration doesn’t deport criminals. That claim, by Republican candidate Jeb Bush, was recently rated False by PolitiFact Florida, which concluded that while some individuals with criminal convictions weren’t deported, tens of thousands of people have been sent out of the country. In fiscal 2014, through September 2014, 86,923 convicted criminals were deported for a crime beyond breaking an immigration law. Cruz came to his count, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email, by drawing on a 2014 report by a think tank and testimony seemingly endorsing his tally by Sarah Saldaña, director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is responsible for enforcing U.S. immigration laws. ICE director’s testimony At a July 21, 2015, hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Cruz asked Saldaña how many murderers the administration had released ""yesterday."" The director said she didn’t know. But generally, Saldaña said, ""we don’t release people willy-nilly. We release people pursuant to these statutes and regulations,"" a reference to two thick paperback volumes she’d waved. ""There are only a limited number of crimes that we are required to detain people,"" she said, including ones related to drug distribution. In 2013, Cruz replied, ICE agents chose not to begin deportation proceedings against 68,000 people with criminal convictions and separately had released from detention 36,000 people with criminal convictions, including 193 homicide convictions, he said. To get the full picture, he said, ""you’ve got to add both"" tallies. ""Yes, sir,"" Saldaña said, ""that’s absolutely right."" She also went on to say the agency actions had taken place pursuant to federal law. At that moment, there seemed to be agreement the agency in 2013 had chosen not to detain or had released 104,000 people with criminal convictions who also were living in the country without legal permission. Frazier told us Cruz also drew on a May 2014 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. That report said that from October 2012 through September 2013, ICE ""freed 36,007 convicted criminal aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings,"" according to an agency document obtained by the center. The report’s author, Jessica Vaughan, previously told us the document came from someone she declined to identify who fielded it in connection with congressional inquiries.  Report: 68,000 ""aliens"" with criminal convictions not detained by ICE And what of the other 68,000 individuals Cruz described in Iowa as released? Such a figure came to light in a March 2014 center report, which also made it clear the count did not reflect individuals freed from detention. Rather, the report said ICE agents in fiscal 2013 chose not to act against that many ""aliens with criminal convictions, or 35 percent of all criminal aliens they reported encountering. The criminal alien releases typically occur without formal notice to local law enforcement agencies and victims,"" the report said. The ""vast majority of these releases occurred because of the Obama administration's prosecutorial discretion policies, not because the aliens were not deportable."" ""Under current policies,"" the report said, ""an alien generally must have serious criminal convictions, prior deportations, or immigration violations before an officer can move to deport them."" That may have been a reference to a 2011 memo issued by the then-director of ICE, John Morton, urging agency officials to use discretion in deciding which apprehended violators of immigration law should be removed with particular care taken with veterans, longtime legal permanent residents, minors, elderly individuals, pregnant or nursing women and individuals here since childhood. Negative factors also should be weighed, the memo said, including whether individuals pose a risk to national security, are serious felons or known gang members or have egregious records of immigration law violations. By email, Carl Rusnok, a Dallas-based ICE spokesman, sent us an ICE response to the center’s March 2014 report noting the government had removed 216,000 convicted criminals in 2013. ""The removal of criminal individuals is and will remain ICE’s highest priority,"" the statement said. In addition, ICE said the center’s report showcased ""flawed math."" Vaughan, standing by the research, posted her objections to the agency’s criticisms on April 1, 2014. By email, Vaughan told us she had no quibble with Cruz’s decision to add the 36,007 individuals released by ICE in fiscal 2013 to the 68,000 ""aliens with criminal convictions"" whom ICE agents otherwise chose not to detain that year for violating immigration laws. Government: Releases driven by federal laws Figures aside, we wondered why ICE freed convicts lacking legal permission to live here. When we previously looked into a similar claim, the government said ICE was mostly just complying with judicial rulings and federal law. In 2014, we rated Half True this claim by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio: ""Last year,"" Obama ""administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions. The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping and thousands of drug-related crimes."" Smith recited accurate figures, but his claim didn’t acknowledge administration explanations. A May 16, 2014, Associated Press news story said that according to ICE, the individuals let go had completed their criminal jail sentences. Also, the story said, nearly all the released individuals still faced deportation along with required check-ins with authorities while immigration cases were pending. Moreover, the story quoted an ICE spokeswoman saying that in many cases, the agency was required by law to release the immigrants while their deportation cases were pending. ""The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report,"" the spokeswoman said. For example, she said, mandatory releases accounted for over 72 percent of the immigrants convicted of homicide, the AP reported. At the time, Rusnok emailed us similar information. Also, he said, once ""in ICE custody, many of the individuals described in the report were released under restrictions such as GPS monitoring, telephone monitoring, supervision or bond."" Individuals convicted of less serious offenses, Rusnok said, ""were released as a discretionary matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding the priority of holding the individual, given ICE’s resources, and prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to public safety or national security."" Cruz’s claim in mind, we reached Rusnok afresh. By email, he pointed out a March 2015 ICE press release stating that in fiscal 2014, the agency had released 30,558 individuals with criminal convictions--about a 15 percent decrease from the year before. In April 2015, Vaughan pointed out to us, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said that according to ICE information, the 2014 releases included individuals accounting for 86 homicide convictions, 186 kidnapping convictions, 373 sexual assault convictions, 449 commercialized sexual offenses, 1,194 battery convictions, 1,346 domestic violence convictions and 13,636 convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol. ICE’s 2015 press release also said that at the request of Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, the agency was instituting more administrative filters over the release of certain individuals with criminal convictions including ""a panel of senior managers,"" which meets monthly, ""to review discretionary release decisions for individuals convicted of crimes of violence."" The release said: ""Notably, in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 the majority of releases of serious criminal offenders were made pursuant to federal court decisions or bond decisions by immigration judges.  In a leading court case on immigration detention, Zadvydas v. Davis, the Supreme Court ruled that ICE generally could not detain an individual ordered removed in immigration detention beyond six months, unless the individual would be repatriated in the reasonably foreseeable future. This detention limit can be triggered when a country simply refuses to accept repatriation of its national, irrespective of the individual’s criminal history."" Rusnok also provided a department statement stating that in fiscal 2013, ICE released 169 homicide convicts (not 196) and most releases occurred due to factors not controlled by the agency. For instance, the statement said, 24,851 releases occurred either in accord with court restrictions on the agency or under an ICE ""order of supervision"" issued ""because there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future."" Another 10,532 individuals were released after an immigration judge granted a bond, the statement said. ""The small number of remaining releases are attributed to prosecutorial discretion, parole and the agency’s inability to obtain a travel document,"" the statement said. Vaughan, asked to comment on the latest ICE analysis of the 36,007 releases, suggested the agency still had sway in instances it characterized as not under its discretion. For instance, she emailed, the agency may, but often does not, contest grants of bond. Law professors: Detainee releases affected by legal rights Next, we asked several expert professors about the government’s contention it didn’t entirely control which individuals it released from detention. Anyone detained by ICE, the experts said, has constitutional rights that play into judges deciding if a release is appropriate. Kari Hong, a Boston College Law School assistant professor, reminded us immigration cases are civil and not criminal matters. And under U.S. law, she and Ingrid Eagly, a UCLA assistant professor, each advised by phone, a person held longer than six months on an immigration matter has a right to ask for a hearing that could lead to release. Before such a release, the professors said, a judge decides the person wouldn’t be a danger to the community or a flight risk. Also, Hong said, a person let go on bond still might have to check in with ICE every month. Broadly, Hong opined by email, ICE detains far too many individuals. ""For the first 100 years of our history, we did not detain immigrants. From 1917 to 1988--a period of 70 years---we detained a total of 55,000 non-citizens with criminal convictions,"" Hong said. ""Since 2009, that number grew to 400,000 each year. There is no reason to detain that many people,"" she said, especially because the ""vast majority are not violent. Many are elderly, families and children."" Denise Gilman, who directs an immigration law clinic at the University of Texas, said by email that it’s also possible that released individuals win their immigration cases in court, meaning they won't be deported and must be released. Our ruling Cruz said: ""In the year 2013, the Obama administration released 104,000 criminal illegal aliens. They released 196 murderers – people with homicide convictions, who are here illegally."" We see how Cruz reached his figures. But ICE says 169 individuals with murder convictions were released and 72 percent of those releases were mandatory—out of its control. Also, 68,000 of the people Cruz described as released were never actually detained by the agency. In addition, this statement is missing vital context. Just as we said in reviewing Smith’s declaration, it’s simplistic to suggest the administration has full decision-making authority. Court decisions and federal laws play important roles. We rate the statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",/factchecks/2015/aug/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-obama-administration-released-104000-crim/
