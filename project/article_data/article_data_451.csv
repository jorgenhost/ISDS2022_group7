No evidence Hitler made this statement about gun control
","A recent Facebook post appears to forebode a dark future for the United States if it tightens gun laws by quoting Adolf Hitler on gun control in Germany. ""This year will go down in history,"" begins the Aug. 8 post. ""For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration! Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!"" The post attributes the statement to ""Adolph Hitler,"" misspelling the Nazi Party leader’s name before noting that he was remarking on the ""passing of the German Weapons Act 1935.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  When we reached out to several historians to find out if Hitler actually said this, they couldn’t tell us conclusively that he didn’t. But they were skeptical that the quote is authentic.  Richard Breitman, an American University professor emeritus who has written extensively on German history and the Holocaust, said he was ""unaware of any such statement by Hitler."" He also noted that in addition to Hitler’s misspelled name in the Facebook post, the basic Nazi law on weapons was issued in 1938, not 1935, as the post says. Peter Hayes, a Northwestern University professor who specializes in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, offered a quick history lesson: A 1928 law that pre-dated the Nazi regime required people to seek state permission to buy or own a weapon and local police could revoke that permission at any time.  In 1931, the law was amended to require people seeking that permission to prove they needed a weapon.  In 1938, during Nazi rule, the law was changed so it was harder for Roma to have guns and easier for Nazis to carry them.  A separate decree in 1938 forbade Jews from having guns.  Maybe, Hayes said, the Facebook posts refers to another such a decree issued in 1935 but, ""I haven’t heard of it.""  He was also suspicious of the language used in the Facebook quote. ""Registration"" isn’t a typical term in German gun laws, he said.  Jeffrey Herf, a history professor at the University of Maryland, told us: ""My very strong suspicion is that this is a hoax."" Christopher Browning, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor emeritus who has researched and written extensively about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, concurred. ""This sounds like a complete and total fabrication to me, invented for obvious reasons,"" he said.  A 2004 Fordham Law Review article called ""On Gun Registration, the NRA, Adolf Hitler, and Nazi Gun Laws: Exploding the Gun Culture Wars (A Call to Historians)"" notes that the ""infamous statement"" attributed to Hitler has been published more than 100 times in papers across the country and lawmakers have argued against gun registration in part because it supposedly enabled Hitler to leave people vulnerable to the Nazis. (We’ve fact-checked whether gun control regulations in Nazi Germany helped advance the Holocaust and rated that False.) But, author Bernard Harcourt says in the paper, the quote ""is probably a fraud and was likely never uttered.""  ""The citation reference is a jumbled and incomprehensible mess that has never been properly identified or authenticated, and no one has been able to produce a document corresponding to the quote,"" he wrote. ""It has been the subject of much research, all of it fruitless, and has now entered the annals of urban legends."" We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBEBFC0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/21/viral-image/no-evidence-hitler-made-statement-about-gun-contro/

Donald Trump's tariffs on China don't hurt Americans, top Trump adviser says. That's Pants on Fire
","Are the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on China hurting American consumers? His team says no.  Peter Navarro, director of the White House’s Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, told CNN’s Jake Tapper that was not the case. Tapper asked about a study that found U.S. importers are shouldering about 95% of the price change from the tariffs, China only about 5%.  After Navarro pushed back, there was this exchange: ""Tariffs aren't hurting anybody in the United States?"" asked Tapper. Navarro responded, ""They're not hurting anybody here."" The White House didn’t respond to our requests for information to support Navarro’s statement. But evidence to the contrary is overwhelming. Importers can respond to tariffs in four ways, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told us.  Two of the ways are paying their suppliers less and buying from producers in countries not subject to the tariffs; those moves would shield Americans. But the other two ways — raising prices or absorbing the tariffs and cutting into their bottom line — do make an impact. It’s worth noting that, in the back-and-forth of the trade war, China has done a series of its own tariff reductions. That helps U.S. exporters. But despite claims by Trump that China has been slashing prices, Brookings economist Gary Burtless and Boise State University political scientist Ross Burkhart said they see no evidence of price slashing as a result of the U.S. tariffs — at least on any scale as large as the impact of the tariffs. Evidence of how tariffs have hurt Americans has been accumulating for months. Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.  The trade war reduced U.S. real income by $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University and Columbia University. The price of washing machines sold in the United States rose nearly 12% because of the 2018 tariffs, according to University of Chicago researchers. (The price of dryers rose by a similar amount, even though they weren’t subject to the tariffs.) Meanwhile, retaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers. U.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau, an agricultural lobbying group. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. Trump has responded by boosting subsidies to farmers. Trump’s plan to impose more tariffs on China in September 2019 will reduce consumer purchases, raise prices and limit hiring, according to four national retail groups.  Studies have also consistently documented the general impact on Americans.  About 79% of manufacturers and 60% of service firms said tariffs had increased their input costs at least slightly, ""a considerably more widespread effect"" than in its survey a year earlier. That’s according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York August 2019 survey of business leaders in New York and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey.  The impact of tariffs on imports of steel and Chinese goods that were imposed in 2018 was largely on the United States, not China, according to the study Tapper alluded to. It was done by researchers from Harvard University, the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. A variety of companies have reported harm from the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs, including Walmart, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found. Navarro said U.S. tariffs on China are ""not hurting anybody"" in the United States. Numerous businesses, ranging from Coca-Cola, to Walmart to Costco to washing machine makers, raised prices because of the tariffs. And study after study has confirmed that the tariffs primarily hit Americans, not China. It’s simply ridiculous to make a flat claim that the tariffs aren’t hurting anyone in the United States. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB5E740>],/factchecks/2019/aug/20/peter-navarro/donald-trumps-tariffs-china-dont-hurt-americans-to/
"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Elizabeth Warren']","
Warren makes point on disparities in insurance coverage for physical and mental health
","During a July visit to Milwaukee, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren told an audience that when it comes to their mental health needs, their health insurer may not always be on their side. According to the Massachusetts senator, that’s because there is an unequal playing field when it comes to coverage of physical and mental health needs. ""The law says that mental health must be treated the same as physical health,"" Warren said at the League of United Latin American Citizens convention in Milwaukee on July 11, 2019, referencing the idea that health providers don’t care equally for the two.  Warren was among eight Democratic presidential contenders, plus Jill Biden, wife of candidate Joe Biden, who attended the convention. LULAC is the largest and oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the country.  But what does the law say about physical vs. mental health? And, as Warren contends, do insurers treat them unequally? Coverage requirements When we reached out to Warren’s campaign for backup, spokesman Chris Hayden told us the senator was referring to the Affordable Care Act’s essential health benefits. The ACA required small group and individual market plans to cover 10 different benefit categories, including maternity and newborn care, ambulance and emergency services and prescription drugs. Mental health and substance use disorder services were also included as benefits. Hayden also pointed to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, sponsored by then-U.S. senators Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici, which was enacted in October 2008. The act requires equal coverage of treatment for mental illness and addiction.   According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the federal government released rules to implement the law in November 2013. Before the law, mental health treatment was typically covered at lower levels in health insurance policies than physical illness.  So, Warren’s stance that the law requires equal insurance coverage of mental and physical health checks out. But, is there a disparity in the way insurers service patients for those needs? Studies show disparities in coverage A 2017 national study by Milliman, a healthcare actuarial consulting firm, found patients used an out-of-network provider far more often for behavioral and mental health services than physical health needs.  The study found that in 2015, behavioral care was four to six times more likely to be provided out-of-network than medical or surgical care, and insurers paid primary care providers 20% more for the same types of care than they paid addiction and mental health care specialists. In Wisconsin, about 13% of office visits for behavioral health were out-of-network compared to 2.5% for primary care. This underlines that the insurance network didn’t include as many doctors who provide mental health care. Kaiser Health News reported on Aug. 3, 2015, that since the mental health parity law went into effect, most insurers had made progress in their mental health coverage, such as dropping annual limits on therapy sessions, making higher copayments and separate mental health deductibles less of an issue.  However, Kaiser also reports insurers have continued to limit treatment through other methods, such as enforcing a ""medical necessity"" review for patients in some cases. In those reviews, insurers -- not doctors -- decide whether a patient requires a certain treatment and at what frequency. Additionally, only a few states have checked up on whether insurers are complying with parity laws, and the U.S. government has not taken any public enforcement action against an insurer or employer for violating the law since it was passed, according to the Kaiser report. Lawsuits against insurers alleging a lack of parity have been filed in states such as New York, Illinois and California where patients ran into issues regarding coverage for their mental health. Enforcement challenges of health care laws Ben Miller, chief strategy officer of Well Being Trust, an Oakland-based nonprofit focused on health issues, said one reason the parity law is hard to enforce is because most people don’t have a clear understanding of their health care coverage. ""We do not have clear transparency as ultimately what a health insurer might be doing,"" he said. ""Health insurance is like a black box.""  Secondly, he said it’s time consuming to enforce it. ""States could easily step up and enforce the federal law,"" Miller said. ""I just don’t think that’s something that happens very often."" Our ruling Warren claimed mental health and physical health have to be treated the same under the law, but coverage by health insurers is unequal. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act says insurers must provide equal coverage of physical and mental health. The ACA made it a requirement for insurers to cover certain benefits which included behavioral health. But various studies and reports found that insurers often fall short of upholding this law.  We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8AC580>],/factchecks/2019/aug/20/elizabeth-warren/warren-makes-point-disparities-insurance-coverage-/

Donald Trump wrong on Google manipulating election results
","In his latest effort to recast his election win as an even bigger victory than the ballot box showed, President Donald Trump tweeted out an eye-popping — but unsubstantiated — claim.  ""Wow, Report Just Out! Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election!"" Trump tweeted. ""This was put out by a Clinton supporter, not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought!""  Trump’s claim appears to trace back to a research paper published online in June 2017. He may have become aware of the paper after the right-wing website Town Hall ran an article that heavily cited it. The Washington Post reported that the same research paper was mentioned in a segment on Fox Business Network.  The paper, by psychologist Robert Epstein, seeks to build off earlier research Epstein did on how bias in search engine results can affect voting preferences. (For the record, Epstein’s estimate was that between 2.6 million and 10.4 million votes may have been manipulated in 2016 — not up to 16 million votes, as Trump said.) But a number of experts we reached out to said the latest paper’s methodology is freighted with too many flaws and unexplained assumptions to assert the kind of claim Trump makes here.  We reached out to Epstein to ask if he took issue with how Trump characterized his findings. ""I sure do,"" said Epstein, who supported Clinton in 2016. ""I have never said that Google deliberately manipulated the 2016 election."" When we asked what formula and assumptions Epstein used to reach his bottom-line conclusion, we did not hear back. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Experts cited several major flaws in Epstein’s paper.  First, here’s the study’s basic setup: In the run-up to the 2016 election, researchers recruited 95 people, 21 of whom identified as ""undecided."" Over a 25-day period — from Oct. 15 through Election Day, Nov. 8 — researchers analyzed between 50 and 483 of these subjects' daily web searches. Those search results were then farmed out to a crowdsourcing website, where raters voted on whether they found search results biased or not. Their key finding: that ""election-related search terms were, on average, biased in Mrs. Clinton’s favor."" Experts we spoke to cited a slew of problems with this methodology. One common complaint was a lack of definitions.  ""They can't even define what biased search results are — they simply piped them off to a crowd-sourcing site and asked random people, ‘Is this search results page biased or not?’ "" said Ryan Singel, a media and strategy fellow at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society. ""What does that even mean?"" The researchers also discarded search results from users who operated Gmail accounts, after finding these users’ searches yielded less biased results. To the researchers, this raised concerns that ""perhaps Google identified our confidants through its gmail system and targeted them to receive unbiased results."" But others doubted that explanation. ""They eliminated anyone using a Gmail address because their search results weren't considered ‘biased,’ speculating that Google was intentionally poisoning their research,"" Singel said. ""That's both equally laughable and sad."" Setting aside the methodological flaws, others took exception to the researchers assumption about how well an experiment of this kind would translate to the voting booth. To some, the holes in the definitions and unexplained formulas used to extrapolate created more questions than answers. We reached out to Nicholas Diakopoulos, a professor in communication studies and computer science at Northwestern University, to ask how researchers could get from 25 days’ worth of search results from 95 subjects to millions of manipulated votes. ""There's not enough information in the whitepaper about how the estimate was done,"" Diakopoulos said.  He said the researchers likely developed a mathematical formula that seeks to translate examples of bias they collected into estimates of voter impact.  ""But again there is not enough information in the whitepaper to say definitively how their ‘computational model’ works,"" he said, ""and whether it is a valid estimate based on the assumptions built into the model.""  Google refuted Trump’s statement, noting it was an old claim. ""This researcher's inaccurate claim has been debunked since it was made in 2016,"" a Google spokesman said in a statement. ""As we stated then, we have never re-ranked or altered search results to manipulate political sentiment."" Trump said a new report shows ""Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election."" The general idea here is that Google gave people search results that in some way affected their vote in the lead-up to the election for president.  Whether such indirect interactions could cause people to change their votes is questionable, and the paper — which is not new — does nothing to establish how that might happen. The paper doesn’t explain its methodology, and other academics questioned whether its findings were valid. Finally, Trump seems to have exaggerated the outer bound of the questionable findings. Overall, we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC63E7C0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-google-manipulating-election-re/

Do wealthy Canadians donate to hospitals to get better treatment?
","Billionaire and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban got in a testy exchange with social media users over health care recently.  The debate quickly shifted from the United States to the situation north of the border when one user tweeted, ""In Canada, me and you (Cuban) would get exactly the same level of healthcare."" ""Except that’s not true,"" Cuban said in response. ""There is a reason why wealthy people in Canada donate to hospitals.""  Except that is not true. There is a reason why wealthy people in Canada donate to hospitals https://t.co/seszdD8Puu ""When wealthy Canadians donate to hospitals they don’t just mail a check,"" he continued in another tweet. ""They meet the top folks at the hospital and get their #s. They call ahead. They get their standard issue gown sooner and with more attention.""  Except, when wealthy Canadians donate to hospitals they dont just mail a check. They meet the top folks at the Hospital and get their #s. They call ahead. They get their standard issue gown sooner and with more attention. Even in Canada it's smart to keep donors happy. https://t.co/Rq1ic6Nzrz Really? Do wealthy Canadians donate to hospitals to get better treatment? Cuban’s tweet made it sound like standard operating procedure. That sounded fishy to us, so we reached out and asked Cuban, who once flirted with running for president, what evidence he had to back up his claim.  ""Lol,"" he said. ""No. I’m not going to bust the people I spoke to."" Cuban said the point of his Twitter thread was to inspire discussion about the pros and cons of the health care systems in the United States and Canada. (He has proposed eliminating insurance companies and using federal money to pay for more medical staffers, per CNBC.) He told us to ask major hospitals in Canada if they give donors phone numbers to call to arrange for better treatment. So we did. We also talked to a number of experts.  The bottom line: Cuban might know a few rich Canadians who have their doctors on speed dial because they gave money to build a building, buy new equipment or fund research. But as a general rule of thumb, Canadian hospitals don’t award special privileges to wealthy donors. Generally speaking, health care in Canada is delivered by private doctors and hospitals but paid for with public funds. That’s why Democratic politicians such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have praised Canada as a model for what single-payer health care could look like in the United States.   Provinces and territories are in the driver’s seat, but the federal government helps handle the costs and decides which services the provinces must cover to receive federal money. Canadians don’t pay out-of-pocket for medically necessary care, defined as visits to the doctor or the hospital. (A majority of Canadians buy supplemental private insurance to cover the costs of prescription drugs, dental care and other services, however.) We won’t discount the possibility that Cuban knows people who feel their donations gave them an upper hand with their specific hospital or doctor. But hospital representatives and health policy experts told us that, while there might be isolated cases of donors getting preferential treatment, those scenarios are highly unlikely and might be against federal law. We called the press offices for a number of Canada’s largest hospitals from several different provinces. Many of them didn’t answer. But those that did were skeptical of Cuban’s claim. ""I can emphatically and strongly say no, that doesn’t happen at St. Paul’s,"" said Shaf Hussain, spokesperson for Providence Health Care, which operates hospitals across British Columbia, including St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver. (St. Paul’s received a record $75 million donation from a billionaire in 2017.) ""We do have a very generous donor community, and we are always grateful for any support provided for equipment or research,"" Hussain said. ""But no, that does not result in any kind of special treatment or access to health care."" Hussain and Ted Marmor, professor of public policy and management at Yale University, said prioritizing donors would violate the federal Canada Health Act, which stresses the importance of ""facilitat(ing) reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers."" ""As a general description of Canadian hospital practice, (Cuban’s claim) is mythology,"" Marmor said. ""That some patients have participated in pursuit of quicker service with donations is no doubt true. But this is an exaggerated portrait of hospital admission."" Other Canadian experts agreed.  ""Donors give to hospitals as signs of appreciation, civic-minded investment in infrastructure or equipment, or to invest in specific kinds of hospital-based research,"" said Antonia Maioni, professor of political science at McGill University in Montreal. ""There is no quid pro quo."" ""There is not a direct relationship between whether you contribute and what care you get,"" added Raisa Deber, professor of public health policy at the University of Toronto. For what it’s worth, donations are ""not a significant source of financing Canadian hospitals,"" Marmor said. According to the World Health Organization, 70% of total health expenditures in Canada come from general tax revenues collected by various levels of government. Cuban said ""wealthy people in Canada donate to hospitals"" to get better treatment. It’s possible Cuban knows some people who claim they’ve gotten special treatment, but hospital representatives and health policy experts told us Cuban’s claim is an inaccurate description of what happens in Canadian hospitals by and large. It’s also at odds with Canadian law, which says people should have access to care regardless of finances.  We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFF6980>],/factchecks/2019/aug/19/mark-cuban/do-wealthy-canadians-donate-hospitals-get-better-t/

Jefferson didn’t say people should be armed to protect themselves ‘against tyranny in government’
","Some supporters of gun rights on social media are sharing a striking post with a quotation attributed to Thomas Jefferson, a founding father who became the third U.S. president.  The post displays a photo of a snake wrapped around a handgun with the words ""Don’t Tread On Me."" Along the bottom, the alleged statement by Jefferson reads: ""When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.

Like many statements attributed to Jefferson on the internet, there is no credible evidence to support that Jefferson said or wrote these words.  According to Monticello.org, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation's website, the statement cannot be found in any of the former president’s writings. Both parts of the quote appear in the website’s list of ""Spurious Quotations.""  Researchers at Monticello found that the first sentence: ""When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny,"" most likely comes from a series of debates on socialism published in 1914. At one point, a man named John Basil Barnhill said, ""Where the people fear the government you have tyranny. Where the government fears the people you have liberty."" Some variations of the quote begin with, ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms,"" as the first sentence, which comes from the first of Jefferson's three drafts of the Virginia Constitution in 1776, although in the second and third drafts, the sentence was amended to read, ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms (within his own lands or tenements)."" Again, the latter sentence about using guns for protection against tyranny in government, Monticello officials say, ""does not appear in the Virginia Constitution drafts or text as adopted, nor in any other known Jefferson writings.""

Could students pray, discuss El Paso mass shooting in school?
","In an interview on Fox News almost a week after the Aug. 3 mass shooting in El Paso in August that left 22 people dead and more than two dozen injured, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick discussed the attack and possible motivating factors.  He mentioned mental health and violent video games during the interview. He also raised concerns about spiritual values. Patrick said that ""on Sunday, everyone was going to church in America, praying about this, and the next day when their kids went to school, they weren’t allowed to pray or bring it up.""  He made a similar comment during an appearance on Fox News the day after the shooting: ""I look at this Sunday morning when most of your viewers right now, half of the country, are getting ready to go to church and yet tomorrow, we won’t let our kids even pray in our schools."" Patrick’s claim is off base. Kids are allowed to pray in schools and they are permitted to discuss current events — including mass shootings.  Patrick offered a statement when asked about his claim:  ""I have pointed to a broad range of factors that contribute to domestic terrorism including a fraying in our culture that elevates hate and devalues life,"" Patrick said. ""In terms of prayer in our public schools, we do have a minute of silence for students to do what they wish, but there was a time when students prayed together out loud and students and schools weren’t sued or banned from praying at pep rallies and graduations. There was a time when city mayors didn’t sue pastors for their sermons and when reporters like you would never have challenged the idea that the issue of faith in America is important. We were a better country when everyone recognized that we all answer to a higher authority — and it wasn’t government. Many of us in America still believe that."" Do most Americans go to church?  First of all, in both interviews Patrick suggested that either ""everyone"" or ""half of the country"" went to church on Sunday to pray following the shooting in El Paso. There’s no way to know for sure how many people across the country attended a religious service on a particular day, but there has been polling on American’s habits when it comes to religion that can offer some insight here. In 2017, about 39% of Americans attended religious services at least once a week, according to Pew Research Center. Roughly 33% attended a few times per month or per year. Some of those people attended services in mosques, temples and gathering places others than churches. A poll from Gallup also looked at this trend: in 2018, 22% of Americans attended church or synagogue every week and 10% attended almost every week. Students are allowed to pray Patrick said that Texas children were not allowed to pray when they went to class the day after the shooting in El Paso.  Patrick was likely not speaking about a specific example of a school preventing a child from praying. For one, most schools in Texas were still on summer vacation when he made his claim.  In a landmark decision in 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school-sponsored or state-organized prayer, even nondenominational prayer, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  But the decision does not prohibit prayer or religious expression at school. ""Contrary to popular myth, the Supreme Court has never outlawed ‘prayer in schools’"", reads a blog post from the Freedom Forum Institute. ""Students are free to pray alone or in groups, as long as such prayers are not disruptive and do not infringe upon the rights of others."" At the same time, students do not have a ""right to have a captive audience listen"" and they cannot pressure other students to join them in prayer, the institute said. In Texas, state law dictates that school boards must require all schools in the district to offer a one-minute moment of silence at every campus. During this period, students are allowed to ""reflect, pray, meditate, or engage in any other silent activity."" These same restrictions on prayer and religious expression do not apply to private schools. Discussion of shooting Patrick also said that students would not be able to discuss the shooting in El Paso during school. The basis of his claim is unclear. There is no state-level policy that dictates whether teachers can facilitate discussions of current  events in the classroom. Plus, students are permitted to discuss these issues among themselves or in one-on-one conversations with teachers or school counselors. School counselors serve myriad roles, including as a sounding board for students who want to vent about their home life and as a resource for students with more serious mental health concerns.  They also can serve a preventative role, helping to identify students in crisis, while also being a resource for students struggling in the wake of a mass shooting who want to talk about the event. Earlier this year, state lawmakers approved a series of laws aimed at increasing school safety after a shooting at Santa Fe High School in the Houston area left eight students and two teachers dead. Included in the slew of new laws was a proposal aimed at improving mental health services available to students by expanding access to mental health professionals and offering mental health training to teachers and other school professionals. Our ruling In two interviews, Patrick said that students would not be able to pray following the mass shooting in El Paso. He also said they would be unable to discuss the shooting at school. Patrick’s claim is inaccurate. School-sponsored prayer is prohibited, but students are allowed to pray individually and, in Texas, during a required moment of silence. There is no statewide policy that dictates whether teachers can discuss current events with their students, including mass shootings. There are many avenues available to students who wish to discuss these events with school personnel. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC5CB40>],/factchecks/2019/aug/19/dan-patrick/could-students-pray-discuss-el-paso-mass-shooting/

No, police officers didn’t fake injuries during the Philadelphia shooting
","Six police officers were injured in a shooting in Philadelphia on Aug. 14. As with other recent shootings, misinformation claiming it was planned wasn’t far behind. The shooting ended after an hours-long standoff with the suspect, who was being served a narcotics warrant. Some Facebook users speculated that the incident was staged. One user with nearly 30,000 followers posted a news clip of the event with a caption that suggested two officers faked gunshot wounds. ""WTF!! Philadelphia Shootings Fake AF!!"" the user wrote. ""Police Officers Spray Fake Blood on themselves during Philadelphia Shooting."" Similar claims were also shared on Reddit. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The substance also appears to splatter on the ground. The suspicious Facebook posts claim this is fake blood. A comment on the second post suggests that it might instead be a kind of disinfectant containing iodine, which is a dark reddish color. We reached out to the Philadelphia Police Department for more context. It said the assertion that its officers were faking their injuries is false. ""This is outrageous,"" the department’s public affairs office said in an email. ""Police officers were transported to Temple University Hospital and Albert Einstein Medical Center for gunshot wounds. This video is one of our police officers that suffered a gunshot wound Wednesday."" When asked about the substance that appears in the video, the police department said it’s real blood.

Fact-checking Matt Gaetz on gun bans in Australia and Venezuela
","U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sparred with Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro about how to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands. ""I’m here in Australia, congressman. They don’t have problems like this,"" Pirro said Aug. 10 following the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton that killed 31 people. ""This is starting to be unfortunately a uniquely American situation. And I am a gun owner. I am a strong Second Amendment person, but some of the wrong people are getting their hands on guns."" Gaetz replied: ""Nobody would suggest that in the United States we would want Australia’s solution. There they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela. And now their people can't fight back when they are having to fight their way out of a socialist dictator."" But no one suggested taking away guns, Pirro responded, adding the Gaetz’s Venezuela comparison seemed ""a little off.""  So PolitiFact Florida wanted to look into it. The general point Gaetz was trying to make, his spokesman told us, was that he believes gun control failed in both Australia and Venezuela. He shared articles showing an Australian black market for guns, for example, as well as other news stories about Venezuela’s gun control laws leaving civilians and even police more vulnerable.  But there are several factual inaccuracies with his specific claim about Australia and the comparison to Venezuela. • Australia didn’t enact a total gun ban; it banned certain guns, including semi-automatics after a mass shooting in 1996.  • That’s different from what Venezuela’s government did in 2012 and 2013, when it took steps in an effort to stem the flow of guns. • In both countries, millions of guns remain in civilian hands. Gun deaths are a major problem in Venezuela. In 1996, a shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. It was one of the most deadly civilian mass shootings in the world at the time. The conservative-led national government moved quickly to ban and destroy certain guns. Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms. After that, people possessing the weapons would be subject to strict penalties. The buyback program took in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons — roughly one-fifth of the country’s estimated guns. Today, Australians still legally own a high per-capita ratio of single-shot long guns, along with plenty of handguns, said Philip Alpers, founding director of Gunpolicy.org, a global project of the Sydney School of Public Health. But the number of legal and illegal guns dropped from about 3.2 million in 1996 to 2.5 million in 1997.  Since then, it has climbed back up to almost the same number as before the ban, though the rate of gun ownership is smaller today. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Australia suffered 14 mass shootings, which claimed 117 lives, Alpers said. Following the gun law changes, there were no mass shootings for many years. In June 2019, four people were killed by a gunman who used a banned gun. In 2018, seven were killed in a mass family homicide-suicide. What Venezuela did several years ago was not the same as Australia. The gun situation was not the same, for starters. In Australia, the government responded to a mass shooting. Venezuela faced a widespread problem with rampant gun violence and homicides — and it still does. In 2012, Venezuela imposed measures to ban possession of a gun in public places and to halt private gun sales to citizens.  In 2013, President Nicolas Maduro signed a disarmament bill that was intended to stem the flow of guns. The law created an automated system of registration for arms, parts, and ammunition under control of the armed forces. Individuals were allowed conditional possession, meaning that the state could take their gun.  Rebecca Hanson, an expert on crime in Venezuela and now a professor at the University of Florida, said she wouldn’t call the 2013 law a ""gun ban,"" because civilians could still own guns as long as they registered them. Also, guns remained widely available on the black market and enforcement was lax. ""The law, in reality, did not affect people's ability to access guns in any effective or long-term way,"" she said. Since the majority of guns are purchased on the black market, regulating the legal market does little to reduce gun sales in Venezuela, she said. Many of these guns end up flowing from state security forces and the military into the black market.  ""All of this is to say that even with the 2013 law, access to guns has increased,"" she said. Alejandro Velasco, New York University history professor of modern Latin America, told us that ""the gun ban had almost no practical impact on people’s ability to buy and keep (or use) weapons."" There are no solid numbers to pinpoint the number of guns in civilian ownership in Venezuela. Gunpolicy.org estimates that there were about 5.9 million privately owned guns in civilian hands in Venezuela  as of 2017, though the consultant that came up with it said it could be a wide range.  The opposition movement has billed itself as nonviolent for the most part, Velasco said. Several experts told us it’s not surprising that civilians don’t bring guns to protests where they face the armed government.  ""Even if the disarmament law had dramatically reduced gun ownership, which is not at all clear, armed anti-government civilians would stand no chance against the tanks and fighter jets of the army,"" said Dorothy Kronick, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Experts were critical of Gaetz using the problems in Venezuela to make any commentary on gun laws in the United States. ""Linking the issue of arms control with the struggle for democracy in the Venezuelan context only contributes to distort a situation that is already very distorted,"" Keymer Avila, a professor of criminology at the Central University of Venezuela said, ""increasing violence in an environment that is already very violent, and undermines an institution that is already very precarious."" Gaetz said in Australia ""they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela."" Gaetz’s claim about Australia is wrong, and his comparison to Venezuela is flawed. After a mass shooting in 1996, Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns and offered a one-year buyback. It did not ban all guns. The number of civilian-owned guns is now nearly the same as before the 1996 law, although the rate of ownership is less. In Venezuela, the government instituted measures to try to limit the flow of guns to civilians. But experts said most guns are sold on the black market and that guns remain rampant in Venezuela. The idea that private gun owners could successfully challenge a national military is also unlikely.  We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA4E400>],/factchecks/2019/aug/19/matt-gaetz/fact-checking-matt-gaetz-gun-bans-australia-and-ve/

Trump falsely takes credit for two large industrial projects in Louisiana and Pennsylvania
","President Donald Trump has been taking credit for very large industrial projects in Louisiana and Pennsylvania. At a rally in Manchester, N.H., Trump said his policies were critical. ""In Pennsylvania we just opened up a $10 billion plant,"" Trump said Aug. 15. ""We have many of them going up. Many, a lot of jobs. In Louisiana an LNG (liquified natural gas) plant — $10 billion — could never have happened, could never have happened. Pennsylvania would have never happened."" Earlier in the week, Trump was outside Pittsburgh to see a nearly completed Shell plastics plant. The massive facility will turn natural gas from fracking into polyethylene pellets. Announced in 2012 and started in 2015, the plant has produced about 6,000 construction jobs, with 600 permanent jobs expected. ""It was the Trump administration that made it possible,"" Trump told a sea of workers in yellow and orange worksite vests Aug. 13. ""No one else. Without us, you would never have been able to do this."" Trump has crowed before about his role in getting the Louisiana plant up and running. ""It was many, many years trying to get permits, they couldn't get the permits,"" he said at a July 16 cabinet meeting. ""But we got the permits, and we got them very rapidly."" The reality is that the LNG plant in Louisiana and the plant in Pennsylvania were in the works during the Obama years. The Cameron LNG project has three plants that chill down natural gas until it becomes a liquid to be shipped worldwide. At capacity, it can handle 1.7 billion cubic feet per day. According to the company website, ""In April 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued the final environmental impact statement to construct and operate the liquefaction facility. FERC authorized the project in June 2014."" The company got its first federal approval in 2012. In 2016, Washington gave permission to add another two liquefaction lines, although the company hasn’t decided to move ahead on those. While LNG exports have skyrocketed under Trump, which makes this plant more profitable, the actual plans and permits came well before he took office. In 2012, Royal Dutch Shell picked an old industrial site in western Pennsylvania for a major petrochemical facility. Shell’s American division Shell Chemical Appalachia bought the property in 2014 and began pre-construction work in early 2015. Shell made the final decision to build the plant in June 2016. The project needed two key permits for air and water quality protection, but those were state-level decisions. By mid 2015, Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection had granted initial permits for both. Final approvals were in place by mid 2018. Washington did play a role in a pipeline to deliver natural gas to the plant. While the state approved construction in 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had to sign off on the rates the company would charge pipeline users. It issued its approval in September 2018. However, in its order, the commission noted that the company’s proposal was ""unopposed."" While both projects are humming along, they have not been totally untouched by Trump’s use of tariffs. Export demand for LNG remains high, but Trump’s trade war with China has reduced shipments to that country. In 2017, China was the third-biggest buyer. In 2018, China responded to U.S. tariffs with a 10% tariff on LNG. Reuters reported in May 2019 that only two ships headed to China had left from the United States since January, compared to 14 in the first four months of 2018. Trump’s steel tariffs threatened progress on the Pennsylvania petrochemical complex. In the face of quotas limiting steel imports, Shell warned in 2018 that it would need to slow construction and might lay off hundreds of workers. U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sent a letter to the administration Aug. 23, 2018, asking for relief. The administration did so within a week. Trump said that two major industrial projects in Louisiana and Pennsylvania exist today thanks to his policies. In reality, both were well underway before he took office. The Louisiana plant had all necessary federal permits by 2014. The Pennsylvania chemical complex was subject to state regulations, and initial approvals came in 2015. Federal regulators approved the rate structure for a key pipeline in 2018, but construction approval for the pipeline itself came from the state, not the federal government. Trump can take credit for boosting LNG exports and pushing a regulatory approach in favor of natural gas, but those dynamics were in play before his election.

No, pre-chopped onions are not ‘poisonous’ the next day as old myth claims
","Social media posts aren’t usually the best source for valid medical information, especially when it comes to ... chopped onions.  We all know the arduous practice of cutting onions makes us cry like babies – but is consuming day-old chopped onions actually ""poisonous""? That’s what a Facebook post claims: ""Please remember it is dangerous to cut an onion and try to use it to cook the next day, it becomes highly poisonous for even a single night and creates toxic bacteria which may cause adverse stomach infections because of excess bile secretions and even food poisoning."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This years-old warning is exaggerated. Don’t be scared to use pre-chopped onions – they are perfectly safe to consume as long as you handle the food properly. The myth is rooted in the possibility that bacteria can grow on vegetables between the time they are chopped and cooked. But with proper handling and storage, it is unlikely to become ""dangerous"" overnight or over several nights.  In an archived blog post, Joe Schwarcz, director of the McGill Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Canada, writes that onions are not especially prone to bacterial contamination. In fact, he says, it is quite the opposite. ""Cutting an onion triggers the release of enzymes that initiate a chemical reaction producing propenesulfenic acid, which in turn decomposes to yield sulphuric acid. It is the sulphuric acid that makes you cry by irritating the eyes! But sulphuric acid also inhibits the growth of bacteria,"" Schwarcz says in the post.  He goes on to explain that because a cut onion’s surface dries out quickly, it reduces the moisture needed for bacteria to multiply. And to have bacteria multiply, there needs to be a source of bacteria on the onion in the first place. So unless you have sliced your onions on a contaminated cutting board, or handled them with dirty hands, you can safely put them in a plastic bag and store them and there will not be any bacterial contamination,"" he says. ""There is no reason to suggest that onions are in any way more risky than other foods and avoiding onions is not only unnecessary but unhealthy. That’s because onions contain a variety of compounds that have health benefits. According to the National Onion Association, chopped or sliced onions can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for seven to 10 days.  An old myth circulating online warns consumers that pre-chopping an onion to cook the following day is dangerous because it ""becomes highly poisonous"" and ""creates toxic bacteria."" Any vegetable can become contaminated with bacteria if it isn’t handled or stored properly. Onions do not attract bacteria more than other vegetables and actually inhibit pathogen growth.  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECD09100>],/factchecks/2019/aug/16/facebook-posts/no-pre-chopped-onions-are-not-poisonous-next-day-o/

No, nurses in photo with Trump at Dayton hospital were not ‘paid actors’
","Following the deadly mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in early August, President Donald Trump visited two hospitals to meet with victims of the attacks and to thank the first responders and hospital staff treating them. But after his Aug. 7 visit to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, internet users started to share a false rumor that a viral photo of Trump smiling with a group of nurses was staged, and that the nurses were actually paid actors. Several Facebook posts say that media members were not permitted access during the visit and that the women arrived at the hospital a few hours before Trump. While it is true that reporters were not permitted to enter the hospital while Trump was visiting, the rest of the claim is false. One of the posts shares a Twitter screenshot from someone named Farid Ghalili that reads:  ""I got a text from a friend who knows a nurse at the hospital told her that many of the women who were at the hospital wearing nurse uniforms did not work at the hospital. They showed up a couple of hrs before Trump arrived. This was staged. That’s why no reporters were allowed."" Another post includes the now-viral image of the nurses smiling and embracing Trump claimed: ""No media allowed. The nurses report that the women in this picture don’t work at their hospital. ‘Why is he surrounded by mostly women all touching him. No media access...this is so propaganda bullshit from an installed Russian operative.’ Various News agencies are researching this photo and the people that were posed or paid to be in it. The one woman on the far right in scrubs was at his rallies. There may be others that were viewed at his rallies as well. Notice all the badges are turned backwards.""

Sweden isn’t planning monkeypox restrictions like those enforced earlier in the coronavirus pandemic
","Swedish health authorities on May 19 confirmed that someone in the Stockholm region had monkeypox. It was Sweden’s first recorded case amid a recent multi-country outbreak, and within days, claims about the nation’s response to the disease were circulating on social media. ""JUST IN: Swedish health authorities considering introducing restrictions because of monkeypox outbreak,"" read one such May 22 post. ""Here we go again."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook. With COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations once again on the rise, recent news about monkeypox might, at first glance, appear similar to the earliest days of the coronavirus pandemic. But is monkeypox the next COVID-19, as the Facebook post implies? No, according to Sweden’s top health official. ""There is no reason to tie monkeypox to COVID-19 and everything that makes people think of, such as fear of the illness and societal measures to control it,"" said Health Minister Lena Hallengren, according to a Swedish news report. ""There will be no limits or restrictions on how we live due to monkeypox. There are no plans to do that."" Authorities in Sweden still have concerns about the current monkeypox outbreak, however.  Since May 13, cases of monkeypox have been recorded in countries where the virus is not normally found, including the U.S., Canada and several countries in Europe. The disease is considered rare, and investigations into the confirmed and probable cases of monkeypox are ongoing. As of early May 25, Sweden had confirmed one case of monkeypox, and the United States had confirmed two cases, according to Global.Health, an organization that tracks infectious disease data.  Following the country’s first confirmed case, Sweden classified monkeypox as a disease dangerous to public health and one that is subject to mandatory contact tracing, according to the Swedish public health agency’s website and a report from The Local, a Swedish news organization. Hallengren told Svenska Dagbladet, a daily newspaper published in Stockholm, that monkeypox was given that classification so that those infected would be legally required to report it to authorities, making it easier to track the virus and limit its spread. Sweden currently classifies a number of other diseases the same way, including avian influenza, chlamydia, cholera, gonorrhea, HIV, rabies and syphilis. As of May 25, COVID-19 was classified in Sweden as ""subject to mandatory contact tracing,"" but it was not actively classified as ""dangerous to public health."" Sweden downgraded COVID-19’s classification as of April 1. Symptoms of monkeypox include a rash, fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes. People who have symptoms of monkeypox and those with whom they’ve had close contact should be aware of unusual rashes or lesions that develop and contact their healthcare provider, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  An image on Facebook claimed Swedish health authorities were ""considering introducing restrictions because of monkeypox outbreak."" While Sweden took steps to classify monkeypox as dangerous and ensure that cases would be reported for contact tracing purposes, the country’s top health official said there are currently no plans to introduce ""limits or restrictions on how we live due to monkeypox.""

No, the Uvalde school shooting wasn’t a false flag
","Eighteen children and one teacher were killed in a shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde County, Texas, on May 24, according to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and news reports citing the Texas Department of Public Safety. Amid the grief and anger online as people responded to the slaying, there were baseless claims that have become unfortunately predictable in the wake of mass shootings: that this was a false flag operation.  ""Those directing false flags know the emotional response from the Buffalo shooting is wearing down for the sheep,"" one tweet said, referencing the shooting at a grocery store with mostly Black patrons a week earlier. ""So they did another one in Uvalde Texas to reinforce the response. Don’t be fooled. False Flag season is here.""  ""As all local law enforcement including border control respond to false flag Uvalde shooting, the drugs & criminal migrants are pouring in,"" another said.  The situation was still developing as of May 24, but there is ample evidence that it was not a false flag. A false flag is an incident, such as an attack, that’s designed to look like it was perpetrated by one person or party, when in fact it was committed by someone else. One common and unfounded claim following mass shootings is that they are false flags devised by governments seeking to enact gun control laws.  As is typical, we expect to see similar claims emerge on more social media platforms in the coming days. Abbott said during a press conference about the shooting that the gunman, an 18-year-old Uvalde resident named Salvador Ramos, was also dead and is believed to have been killed by responding officers. Abbott later said Ramos had been a student at Uvalde High School, and Pete Arredondo, police chief of the school district, said it appears that Ramos acted alone. Abbott also said that ""it is being reported that the subject shot his grandmother right before he went into the school.""  The shooting started around 11:30 a.m. At 12:17 p.m., the Uvalde school district announced on Twitter that there was an active shooter at the elementary school and that law enforcement officers were on site. When the district tweeted again two hours later, it was to say that the surviving elementary students who hadn’t been taken to hospitals had been transported to the local civic center to reunite with their families.  Children and adults injured in the shooting were taken to Uvalde Memorial Hospital and University Hospital, according to news reports citing representatives of those hospitals.  For other schools in the district, the Uvalde Police Department said on Facebook that officers would be on school campuses to escort students to parents’ cars. Rey Chapa told the New York Times by phone that his nephew was in the school when the shooting happened, and that he was waiting to hear from family and friends on the conditions of other children.  ""I’m afraid I’m going to know a lot of these kids that were killed,"" Chapa said.  There is no evidence to support the claims that these killings were part of a false flag operation. This was the deadliest elementary school shooting since 26 children and educators were killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, the New York Times reported.  Claims that this mass shooting was staged or orchestrated are inaccurate and ridiculous.

On Facebook, different users are suggesting the monkeypox outbreak was planned by government and industry leaders. One post is a screenshot of a tweet that says, ""Last year the U.S. government, Chinese government, Bill Gates, J&J, the UN, WHO, Merck and more participated in a monkeypox ‘tabletop exercise’ where terrorists released an engineered monkeypox virus on May 15, 2022.

The notion that the outbreak was planned also has gone viral on social media in China, the Daily Mail reported. There is no evidence the recent surge in monkeypox cases was planned. Public health investigators are still researching how the disease spread. An adviser to the World Health Organization said the outbreak ""appears to have been caused by sexual activity at two recent raves in Europe,"" the Associated Press reported. In 2021, leaders from public health, the biotechnology industry, international security and philanthropy gathered for discussion of a simulated scenario where an oubreak of an ""unusual strain of monkeypox virus"" was ""caused by a terrorist attack using a pathogen engineered in a laboratory,"" according to a report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the event organizer. NTI is a nonprofit organization, founded by former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn and philanthropist Ted Turner, that is focused on reducing biological threats. The organization also led a February 2022 exercise that centered on a fictional virus called Akhmeta. The 2021 monkeypox event did include the attendees listed in the tweet — except for Bill Gates. He did not personally attend, but a representative from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation did. The simulated scenario also listed the initial ""attack"" occuring on May 15, 2022, as the tweet says. The first cases in the current outbreak were reported to the WHO on May 13. The event report said the exercise was aimed at examining ""gaps in national and international biosecurity and pandemic preparedness architectures"" and ""exploring opportunities to improve capabilities to prevent and respond to high-consequence biological events."" Simulated events have been the subject of misinformation before, but the events are not unusual when it comes to pandemic planning —and they are not proof that pandemics or disease outbreaks are an inside job. Unlike the 2021 tabletop scenario, though, there’s nothing unusual or mysterious about the origin of the current monkeypox strain. Cases linked to the current outbreak have all belonged to one of two previously identified genetic groups of the monkeypox virus, according to the WHO. And genetic sequencing of one sample from a confirmed case indicated that the virus currently circulating matches cases exported from Nigeria to other countries in 2018 and 2019, the WHO reported. The World Health Organization reported that the virus currently seems to be spreading by ""human-to-human transmission …occurring among people in close physical contact with cases who are symptomatic."" Cases have been identified primarily among men who have sex with men. A Facebook post suggests the current monkeypox outbreak was planned by government and industry leaders. There is no evidence the outbreak was planned. In 2021, leaders from government, public health and industry discussed a simulated scenario of a monkeypox outbreak.

Does JD Vance profit from Russia propaganda?
","In Ohio’s U.S. Senate race, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan posted an ad that slams Republican J.D. Vance as being on the wrong side of Russia’s war in Ukraine.  The ad opens with video from a Feb. 19 interview that Vance shared on Twitter in which he said, ""I don’t really care what happens with Ukraine."" (Vance later issued a statement saying ""Russia’s assault on Ukraine is unquestionably a tragedy."") Here’s the full transcript of Ryan’s May 10 ad: Vance: I’ve got to be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens with Ukraine one way or the other. The ad shows black-and-white images of a bloodstained woman with bandages above her eye and on her jaw, a mother holding a toddler, and apartment buildings and streets destroyed by shelling.  Text on screen: Venture capitalist J.D. Vance’s biggest deal? Social media platform Rumble. Russia state media uses Rumble for propaganda. Why doesn’t J.D. Vance care? J.D. Vance doesn’t care because J.D. Vance profits off Russia propaganda. JD Vance profits off of a company spreading Putin's propaganda. Is it any wonder he ""doesn't really care what happens to Ukraine?"" pic.twitter.com/C0ucvzUCf3 In this fact-check, we look at that last part of the ad to see whether Vance profits from Russia propaganda. The Ryan campaign sent us background information on the substance of their claim. We contacted the Vance campaign and they had no comment. Broadly, while the financial details are private, there’s some accuracy to Ryan’s statement, based on what’s known about Vance’s investment in Rumble. Vance is an author and venture capitalist. In 2020, he launched Narya Capital, and since then, the firm has funded a handful of startups, primarily in health care and food supply. In 2021, Narya played the lead role in assembling a group of investors to help Rumble expand. Rumble is a video-sharing platform, created in 2013 by a Toronto entrepreneur to compete with YouTube. Like YouTube, the more people who come to Rumble, the more advertising revenue it attracts. Rumble drew attention in 2020, when it became popular among conservatives for what it promoted as its hands-off approach to moderating content.  ""Rumble’s mission is to restore the Internet to its roots by making it free and open once again,"" the company said in March. Rumble’s CEO said recently it has yet to turn a profit, but it is growing rapidly. When former President Donald Trump and conservative pundits such as Dan Bongino and Steve Bannon began posting their videos on Rumble, its user numbers soared. The company reported an average of 41 million monthly active users (people who visit the site) in the first quarter of 2022. In 2020, the level was closer to 1 million users a month. Vance personally invested in Rumble. In his April 2022 candidate financial disclosure, he reported holdings in the company that fall in the range of $115,000 to $300,000. His investment was part of a larger package assembled by Narya that included billionaire Peter Thiel, now a leading backer of Vance’s Senate campaign. The details were undisclosed, but as part of the deal, a top Narya partner joined Rumble’s board.  After Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February, YouTube banned the Russia state-affiliated media outlet RT — formerly Russia Today — from its platform. In response, Rumble became RT’s primary video platform. Ryan’s campaign noted RT’s move as evidence for its claim that Vance is profiting from Russian propaganda. Scott Radnitz, a specialist in Russia and Eurasian studies at the University of Washington, said RT is largely a propaganda network. ""Some of its content is non-political, but it is backed by the state and much of its content reflects the Kremlin's messaging intended for foreign audiences,"" Radnitz said. ""RT's use as a mouthpiece of the state has been especially evident during the war, as it has echoed the Kremlin's distortions, lies, and conspiracy theories."" When Russian state media said that dead people found in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha were a hoax, RT amplified that message to non-Russian speaking audiences. Since March, RT has used Rumble to post its ongoing livestream along with individual video news stories. The livestream has accumulated over 2 million views since its launch. The video stories have much lower numbers. The most popular ones have about 14,000 views. Other Russian state-sponsored programs have also joined Rumble. They have lower viewer stats than RT. A key part of Rumble’s business plan is to increase its audience, and with that, its advertising revenues. RT and other Russian state-sponsored programs bring viewers to Rumble.  Tech investor Roger McNamee was an early backer of Facebook. Today, on top of his investment work, he’s part of a campaign to crack down on hate speech on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms. McNamee said that while RT’s viewership is less than a million a month, that still helps Rumble’s bottom line. ""The choice by Rumble to stream RT after it had been blocked by YouTube is an unambiguous play for viewers who engage with Russian propaganda,"" McNamee said. ""What matters is the intent of Rumble and the fact that RT generates millions of streams on the platform."" Many of Rumble’s financial details remain private, but as a general rule, rising user numbers increase the company’s value, and to that extent, the investment Vance made in 2021 is, on paper at least, worth more today. RT has boosted those viewership numbers, but it is far from the most popular producer on Rumble. Bongino’s show, for example, regularly draws about 150,000 views for a single episode, and one of his shows in September had over 973,000 views. Rumble benefits from RT’s presence, but it doesn’t depend on it. Ryan said, ""Vance profits off Russia propaganda."" Ryan’s claim is based on Vance’s investment in Rumble, the platform where RT posts its videos. RT amplifies Kremlin messaging, and in the past two and a half months, RT has produced nearly 2 million views on Rumble. More views mean more advertising revenues for Rumble, and RT’s presence adds value to Vance’s investment. But other programs on Rumble attract many more viewers, and the details on Vance’s investment in the company are not public. Rumble’s CEO earlier this year ​​said the company has yet to turn a profit. With that caveat in mind, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCD3FC0>],/factchecks/2022/may/24/tim-ryan/does-jd-vance-profit-russia-propaganda/

And it’s not, of course, transmitted in nature that way.  The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The virus primarily occurs in central and west Africa, according to the CDC, often near tropical rainforests, though it has been showing up increasingly in urban areas.  More than 250 confirmed and suspected cases have been found in at least 16 countries, including the United States and Canada.

Importing baby formula to the U.S. is allowed, albeit uncommon
","A recent Twitter post claimed the United States’ trade policy with its North American neighbors is the reason why there’s a shortage of baby formula nationwide. ""Why can’t we just import baby formula?"" the May 14 tweet said. ""Ever heard of the United States Canada Mexico Agreement? That bit of legislation Trump and Republicans proudly replaced NAFTA with? Remember Trump bragging about that? Remember? That. That's why."" We found a similar claim on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which officially replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in July 2020, did overhaul the country’s trade policies with Canada and Mexico. But claiming that trade agreement is the sole reason the U.S. can’t import baby formula vastly oversimplifies the issue. The U.S. can import baby formula, but in a typical year, about 98% of the infant formula consumed in the U.S. is domestically produced. Only a small amount of formula is imported from other countries, such as Mexico, Ireland, the Netherlands, Chile and Austria. The importation of baby formula is subject to high tariffs and complex policies that aim to protect the U.S. dairy industry from competitors and ensure that formula is safe to consume. Domestic and foreign manufacturers alike must adhere to government regulations and undergo review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order to have their products approved for sale in the U.S. The FDA requires baby formula to meet certain ingredient and nutrition requirements, and the products must follow specific labeling guidelines. For instance, the labels must be in English, except in areas where English is not the predominant language. Once a baby formula product receives FDA approval, retailers must then wait 90 days before marketing it. ""It’s a very heavily involved regulatory process, which is why it’s difficult to import baby formula,"" said Gabby Beaumont-Smith, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. The U.S. also requires foreign companies importing baby formula to pay tariffs of up to 17.5%. Additional duties can be placed on formula imports if they exceed a certain amount. These tariffs, as well as the FDA regulations, existed before the USMCA was adopted. But the new trade deal did make some changes to the importation of baby formula from Canada and Mexico. Provisions in the trade agreement limit how much baby formula Canada can export globally each year and impose charges if the exports exceed a certain amount. Currently, if Canadian businesses export more than 40,480 metric tons collectively, they would be subject to an export charge of $4.25 (Canadian dollars) per kilogram. The U.S. didn’t import any baby formula from Canada in 2021. This limit was imposed at U.S. authorities' insistence because there was concern before the new trade deal that Canada was ""dumping"" powdered milk products, which includes baby formula, said Andrew Novaković, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University. ""Dumping"" is when a country or company persistently sells their product to a foreign buyer at a price considered to be at a loss, ""usually for the purpose of simply gaining market share or punishing their foreign competitor,"" Novaković said. Meanwhile, under the USMCA, Mexico is one of the few U.S. trading partners that can import baby formula duty-free. Only a small amount of baby formula, roughly 12,000 metric tons, was imported from Mexico last year, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. On May 16, the FDA announced new guidance on the importation of baby formula to help increase the availability of the product in stores across the U.S. The FDA is prioritizing manufacturers that have the largest volume of product available, can get their products onto shelves the quickest, and can demonstrate their product meets the agency’s safety and nutrition standards. Social media posts claimed that the U.S. can’t import baby formula due to the USMCA replacing NAFTA. Importing baby formula to the U.S. is allowed, although these imports usually only make up about 2% of all baby formula consumption in the country. The USMCA did make some changes to how baby formula is imported to the U.S., but many other regulatory policies affect imports, too. The trade agreement is not the only barrier to the U.S. importing more formula. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBADFE40>],/factchecks/2022/may/24/facebook-posts/importing-baby-formula-us-allowed-albeit-uncommon/

No, Stacey Abrams didn’t support the baseball All-Star game boycott of Atlanta
","Even before Georgia’s primary elections were decided, a leading Republican in the state was looking ahead to the general election, in which Stacey Abrams is widely expected to secure the Democratic nomination in the state’s hotly contested gubernatorial race. On May 22, two days before the primary, Chris Carr, a Republican who is running for a new term as Georgia’s attorney general, criticized Abrams for a comment she made at a local Democratic dinner the previous night. Abrams told the audience that she is ""tired of hearing about being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live."" Abrams expanded on this characterization during the speech, blasting Georgia for its relatively low rankings for such quality-of-life issues as mental health access and maternal mortality. But critics like Carr wasted no time in painting the remark as just the latest example of Abrams trash-talking the state she’s running to lead. ""Our state’s No.1 ranking for business has transformed hundreds of thousands of Georgians’ lives,"" Carr tweeted. ""Just like when she supported the #MLB boycott, Stacey Abrams’ reckless & condescending comments continue to harm the state she claims to want to govern."" Our state’s No.1 ranking for business has transformed hundreds of thousands of Georgians’ lives.Just like when she supported the #MLB boycott, Stacey Abrams’ reckless & condescending comments continue to harm the state she claims to want to govern.#gapol https://t.co/F1D0pfizn5 But there’s a problem with what Carr said in his tweet: Abrams did not support Major League Baseball’s boycott of Atlanta for its annual All-Star Game in 2021. Carr’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. The All-Star Game controversy, which resulted in the late relocation of the game to Denver, was driven by the league’s concerns about a Republican-backed law that had been criticized by voting advocates. They said the law made it harder to cast an absentee ballot by limiting the number of ballot boxes and how long voters could use them, and it generally banned handing out food or water to voters in line. Supporters of the law disagreed that it would make voting harder, noting that the law also expanded early voting options and allowed Sunday voting in counties that wanted to permit it. Before the boycott, which was announced on April 2, 2021, Abrams urged Major League Baseball not to move the game away from Atlanta, citing the economic harm to the metro Atlanta region. She repeated that concern after the game was moved away. • In a Twitter video released March 31, Abrams said: ""I understand the passion of those calling for boycotts of Georgia following the passage of SB 202. Boycotts have been an important tool throughout our history to achieve social change. But here’s the thing: Black, Latino, AAPI (Asian American-Pacific Islander) and Native American voters whose votes are the most suppressed under SB 202 are also the most likely to be hurt by potential boycotts of Georgia. To our friends across the country please do not boycott us. To my fellow Georgians, stay and fight, stay and vote."" • Abrams told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an article published April 1 that critics of Georgia’s new law shouldn’t rush to boycott ""yet."" Instead, she said corporations should publicly condemn the law, invest in voting rights expansion and support federal legislation. The Journal-Constitution reporter, Greg Bluestein, later tweeted that Abrams spoke to a Major League Baseball senior adviser ""and ‘strongly’ urged the league to keep the All-Star game in Atlanta before the decision to yank the event."" A Major League Baseball spokesperson offered a similar characterization of the call to PolitiFact at the time. • After the announcement that the game was being moved, Abrams said, ""As I have stated, I respect boycotts, although I don’t want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs."" She also said that ""as other events, productions and businesses weigh whether to patronize Georgia, I urge those who can to come and speak out, and I urge those who are here to stay and fight, and to stay and vote."" One set of comments by Abrams — an op-ed published online by USA Today on March 31, 2021 — has attracted some attention from her critics. But even in the op-ed, Abrams doesn’t call for a boycott. ""One lesson of boycotts is that the pain of deprivation must be shared to be sustainable,"" Abrams wrote in the original version of the op-ed posted online. ""Otherwise, those least resilient bear the brunt of these actions; and in the aftermath, they struggle to access the victory. And boycotts are complicated affairs that require a long-term commitment to action. I have no doubt that voters of color, particularly Black voters, are willing to endure the hardships of boycotts. But I don’t think that’s necessary — yet. ... I ask you to bring your business to Georgia and, if you’re already here, stay and fight. Stay and vote."" Critics point out that USA Today quietly updated the op-ed a few days later, after Major League Baseball announced its boycott. However, the updated version makes essentially the same arguments against a boycott as the initial version did.  USA Today, in an editor’s note added to the op-ed after it was updated, said it asked Abrams to modify the op-ed before it ran in print to reflect the news that Major League Baseball had officially decided to move the game. In the revised op-ed, Abrams added language about Republicans being ""craven"" and President Donald Trump ""calling for cancellation of baseball as the national pastime,"" but her stance on a boycott was not notably different. She wrote, ""Instead of a boycott, I strongly urge other events and productions to do business in Georgia and speak out against our law and similar proposals in other states.""  In response to written questions from members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Abrams testified that, ""I did not suggest or request that USA Today make this or any other changes to the op-ed; rather, I agreed to a request from USA Today to update my op-ed for print purposes."" (The committee hearing was about voting rights.) Carr said that Abrams ""supported the MLB boycott."" Both before and after the league’s boycott, Abrams threw cold water on the idea, saying in a Twitter video, ""To our friends across the country please do not boycott us."" She echoed those comments to the leading newspaper in Atlanta and in an op-ed in USA Today. She also personally lobbied Major League Baseball not to take that step before the boycott was announced.

Milwaukee’s high gun rate rivals New York’s
","Gun violence has racked the city of Milwaukee for decades, and May saw a weekend with a new set of shocking headlines, as 21 people were injured in three late-night shootings near Milwaukee's crowded Deer District after a Bucks playoff game. Tackling gun violence was among the issues at the top of Cavalier Johnson's priority list in his successful bid to win the Milwaukee mayor’s office. Days after his historic win, Johnson had this to say April 9, 2022, on PBS Wisconsin’s ""Here & Now"" show, telling anchor Frederica Freyberg:  ""Unfortunately, at the local level, we don’t control gun law. We just react to it. In one of the more recent years in Milwaukee, our police department collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York."" That caught our attention, given the vast difference in size — and reputations — between the two cities.  Is Johnson right? Let’s start with gun recoveries by the Milwaukee Police Department, a number that has been on the rise in recent years. 2015: 2,504 guns recovered 2016: 2,421 2017: 2,753 2018: 2,908 2019: 2,621 2020: 3,097 2021: 3,279 As of April 20, 2022, the police department had recovered 927 guns — compared with the 681 reported at about the same time the year before. To be sure, a per-capita approach is the best way to compare Milwaukee and New York City, which is approximately 10 times larger. In this case, though, Johnson was pretty vague in declaring the city led in ""one of the more recent years."" Which year? When asked for backup, Johnson’s staff pointed to 2016 and provided two articles — one published by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the other by Wiscontext, which is part of PBS Wisconsin. Both articles reported that Milwaukee had a higher gun recovery per capita versus some of the country’s largest metropolitan cities. In 2016, the 2,421 guns recovered by Milwaukee police translated into a rate of 406.84 guns per 100,000 people, according to the Journal Sentinel article.  That same year, New York City reported 3,583 gun recoveries, which translated into about 42 per 100,000 people, according to a 2017 report issued by the city of Chicago. The numbers do not include any guns obtained through turn-in or buyback programs. The city of Chicago report was comparing its experience with that of other large cities, and was largely aimed at determining where guns used in crimes come from.  In any case, that means the rate in Milwaukee, in that year, was 10 times that of New York. Milwaukee even surpassed two other major U.S. cities featured in the report: Chicago and Los Angeles.  In 2016, Chicago counted 6,644 gun recoveries, with a rate of 244 per 100,000 people, while Los Angeles had 5,908 gun recoveries in the same year, with 149 per 100,000. Many factors go into gun recoveries, including more aggressive policing, special patrols and initiatives and the like. But Johnson made a narrow, focused claim, and on it hit the mark. Indeed, as the Journal Sentinel article noted, Milwaukee police routinely recover guns at a higher rate than many other major cities — so, truly, Johnson probably would have been safe even if he had  been more expansive in making his point. Johnson claimed that in a recent year, the Milwaukee Police Department ""collected more guns per capita off the streets than in New York."" Although the time frame Johnson referred to was vague, the claim was on point, as Milwaukee’s gun recoveries per capita numbers in 2016 were more than 10 times higher than what New York City reported for that year.

Mars ‘doorway’ photo shows a naturally-occurring crevice, not proof of life on the planet
","At first, it certainly looks like a doorway.  A grainy image captured by NASA’s Mars Curiosity rover in May 2022 shows a formation in the planet’s rock that social media users seized on as some kind of alien door, suggesting it shows the presence of life. ""Photo From Mars Curiosity Rover Looks Like We Found a Doorway,"" reads a headline from a website called the ""Good News Network."" ""NASA released this photo from the Mars Rover of an apparent doorway on Mars,"" one Facebook post featuring the image said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but while NASA did capture the image at the center of this claim, it didn’t find a secret, alien doorway on Mars.  The claim was addressed in a Twitter thread authored by the NASA-run Curiosity Rover account that called the formation a natural geological feature.  ""Some of you have noticed this image I took on Mars. Sure, it may look like a tiny door, but really, it’s a natural geologic feature! It may just *look* like a door because your mind is trying to make sense of the unknown.""  Some of you have noticed this image I took on Mars.

(This is called ""pareidolia"") https://t.co/TrtbwO7m46 pic.twitter.com/VdwNhBkN6J It’s somewhat common for people to see patterns in rock shapes that look like one thing or another, said Andrew Good, a spokesperson for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  ""This is called pareidolia, and despite all the sensitive science instruments on the rover and the mission’s hundreds of scientists working with our data, we have not seen anything that isn’t easily explainable,"" Good said. ""Sometimes it’s weird shapes in the rocks, sometimes it’s ‘bad pixels’ that leave irregular marks in some of the images."" William Dietrich, an earth and planetary science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies landscape form and evolution, said the perceived doorway is a result of rock movement.  ""You can see that the feature resulted from the shedding of a block of rock, leaving a wedged shaped cavity, and you can see the back of the cavity,"" Dietrich said. ""Another image (that) covers a larger area on this hill shows many other examples of loose blocks. Displacement of these loose blocks downslope could lead to such a cavity."" NASA shared additional images of the area and said the rover used its mast camera on May 7 to capture the photo of the mound of rock, nicknamed the East Cliffs.  The mound, located on Mars’ Mount Sharp, has a number of naturally-occurring open fractures, NASA said.  The opening featured in the posts is roughly 12 inches tall and 16 inches wide, similar in size to a dog door. The image shared online has been magnified, officials said, making the formation appear significantly larger than its real size. ""These kinds of open fractures are common in bedrock, both on Earth and on Mars,"" the organization said.  NASA says that Curiosity, which has been on Mars since 2012, is currently investigating a region on Mount Sharp that may hold evidence of a major change from wetter to drier conditions in the planet’s early history. Posts on social media claim that NASA released an image that shows a doorway on Mars, suggesting life on the planet. NASA officials and Mars experts did release a photo of a rock formation that, at some angles, looks like a doorway-shaped structure. But NASA dismissed claims that the formation is evidence of extraterrestrial life and said the opening is an unremarkable, naturally-occurring crevice that matches many others on the planet.

This is a video game, not combat in Ukraine
","Amid the war in Ukraine, a spate of video game footage is being packaged as showing actual combat in the Eastern European country.  One such video shows firefights in the sky as helicopters and jets dodge enemy weapons. ""Russian pilot escapes from jets - Russian SU-25 hit by Missile,"" reads the title of the clip recently shared on Facebook.   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the clip on YouTube by searching for the words in the title. On that platform, it was clearly identified as coming from the video game Arma 3.  On Facebook, however, it’s causing confusion. We rate claims that this shows real combat in Ukraine with Russian jets False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD81780>],/factchecks/2022/may/23/viral-image/video-game-not-combat-ukraine/

In Georgia, Perdue falsely claims Kemp allowed 7.5 million ballots to be sent to every voter
","Days before the May 24 primary, former U.S. Sen. David Perdue claimed that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp didn’t do enough to ensure election integrity in 2020.  Purdue made a long list of allegations against Kemp during an interview with Breitbart, a conservative news website. But one in particular jumped out to us as wrong. Perdue said Kemp ""allowed 7.5 million ballots to be sent to every registered voter.""  Perdue’s statement suggests that as governor, Kemp sent a mail ballot to every voter. Kemp did not do that, nor did Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. In the spring of 2020, Raffensperger sent an application for a mail ballot to every active voter.  This line of attack fits into the falsehoods that Perdue and former President Donald Trump continue to perpetuate — that voting by mail is a scheme promoted by Democrats and their allies.  We contacted Perdue’s campaign to ask for his evidence and did not receive a response. Kemp faces Perdue, who is backed by Trump, in the Republican primary for governor. If neither candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, the top two vote getters will advance to a June 21 runoff. The Republican winner will face Democrat Stacey Abrams in November.  When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in the spring of 2020, it upended plans for primary elections.  Raffensperger announced in March 2020 that his office would send an application for a mail ballot to all 6.9 million active registered voters for the primary. (The primary date kept shifting but ultimately it was June 9.) A voter is ""active"" if they voted, updated or changed their voter registration or updated their driver’s license within the previous five years.   Each voter needed to decide whether to apply for a ballot and then sign and mail the application. Then, they needed to receive, sign and return the ballot. Local election officials checked their signatures against those on file in each case. Raffensperger’s office also took steps to keep in-person voting safe, such as purchasing thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer and wipes for polling sites and helping counties recruit younger poll workers who were presumed to be at lower risk for COVID-19 than older volunteers. Kemp was not involved in those decisions. ""Election administration in the state of Georgia falls under the authority of the Georgia Secretary of State per the Georgia Constitution,"" Kemp’s campaign spokesperson Tate Mitchell said. ""The governor does not play a role in that."" About 1 million voters cast ballots by mail in the June 2020 primary. Voters who cast ballots in person the day of the election waited for hours in line at some sites. Perdue made several other charges against Kemp in the Breitbart interview that are also inaccurate or partially wrong:  Perdue said Kemp allowed ""drop boxes with no chain of custody, no security."" Kemp wasn’t in charge of drop boxes. Perdue also omits that the State Election Board required that drop boxes have security features. Nearly all of the counties followed the chain of custody rules which included filling out forms related to emptying ballot drop boxes.  Perdue said Kemp ""allowed Zuckerberg to put $55 million"" into Democratic counties for ""mobile voting buses."" This is misleading. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $350 million to a nonprofit to distribute grants to local election offices nationwide. In Georgia, counties received a total of about $45 million, but that went to both Democratic and Republican counties and it wasn’t exclusively for mobile voting. Kemp ""allowed a consent decree"" that ""basically eliminated voter ID on absentee ballots."" That’s wrong. There was no consent decree. An agreement between election officials and Democratic groups spelled out the process for election officials to contact voters when an absentee ballot was rejected for a missing or mismatched signature.  Perdue said Kemp ""allowed 7.5 million ballots to be sent to every registered voter.""  Perdue’s attack is directed at the wrong official, and it mischaracterizes what happened. The Georgia secretary of state oversees elections. In March 2020, that official — not Kemp — announced that he would send an absentee ballot application to the 6.9 million active voters in the state for the primary. An application for an absentee ballot is not the same as an actual ballot. We rate this statement False.

Raphael Warnock may love puppies. But that beagle was borrowed
","With a mixture of admiration and criticism, Republican Senate candidate Gary Black recently brought up TV advertisements in which Democrat Raphael Warnock co-starred with an adorable beagle. The ads were widely credited with helping Warnock stage a come-from-behind victory to fill a vacant Senate seat in January 2021. During Black’s May 13 interview with WLBB radio, Black acknowledged that the ads were ""great,"" saying, ""I tip my hat to him on that."" However, Black added, ""Raphael Warnock can't even tell the truth about that. That wasn't his dog. He didn't even own that dog."" Black was correct that the dog wasn’t Warnock’s. (In Warnock’s defense, we never found an instance when he claimed it was.)  The first beagle ad, released in November 2020, made fun of what Warnock expected critics would say about him during the intense lead-up to the January 2021 runoff election. The ad’s narrator warned viewers, tongue-in-cheek, that Republican nominee Kelly Loeffler would accuse Warnock of hating puppies, among other things. The ad closed with Warnock holding a beagle and telling the camera, ""By the way, I love puppies."" A second beagle ad showed footage of Warnock walking the same dog through a suburban neighborhood. Warnock told viewers he’s confident that they will see Loeffler’s attack ads ""for what they are"" — right as he dumped a bag of dog poop into a curbside trash can. The beagle barked in approval, and the ad closed with the dog licking Warnock’s neck. I told you the smear ads were coming, but Georgians will see Sen. @Kloeffler’s ads for what they are. pic.twitter.com/0sgU8ndC63 The ads were an immediate hit, even spawning beagle-themed merchandise. Campaign professionals said the ads served to make Warnock — a Black pastor running in a Southern state — relatable to white swing voters, right down to its use of a cuddly, nonthreatening dog breed.  ""The entire ad screams that I am a Black candidate whom white people ought not be afraid of,"" Stanford political scientist Hakeem Jefferson told The New York Times. Brian Robinson, a Georgia-based Republican strategist, agreed, telling the Times that the ads ""made it harder to caricature him, because they humanized him."" That the beagle wasn’t Warnock’s own has been public since the Times reported it a few weeks after Warnock was elected to the Senate. When we contacted Warnock’s campaign staff, it referred us to what the Times wrote: ""The beagle spots were the brainchild of Adam Magnus, the Warnock campaign’s lead admaker, who wanted to find a way — through humor — to inoculate Mr. Warnock against explicit attacks and implicit ones. First he had to call the pastor. ‘I want to make sure you like dogs,’ he recalled asking. ""Mr. Warnock said he did — he had owned dogs before (Comet, Cupid and Brenal — all mutts), though not currently — and was game for a puppy-themed spot. Next, Mr. Magnus had to cast a star pooch, which he eventually found from a Georgia supporter whom the campaign declined to name."" It remains to be seen whether Warnock’s general election opponent — who is almost certain to be former football star Herschel Walker, who leads in the GOP primary by a wide margin — will criticize Warnock for including in his campaign outreach a dog that isn’t part of his family. Black said that the beagle in Warnock’s ads ""wasn’t his dog."" Black is correct: The dog was lent to Warnock’s campaign by a supporter for the purpose of filming the ads. Warnock had lived with dogs on several earlier occasions, but not while the ad was being filmed. For the record, Warnock himself has never claimed that the dog was his own.  We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7A9340>],/factchecks/2022/may/23/gary-black/was-beagle-raphael-warnocks-2020-tv-ad-his-dog/

A misused shingles photo fuels a conspiracy theory about monkeypox
","The recent outbreak of monkeypox cases in countries where it’s not typically found has left some people spooked and others skeptical.  One Facebook post is leading some commenters to cast doubt on the virus altogether.  The May 21 post shows three images: A screenshot of a headline about shingles with a photo of a hand with lesions on it A screenshot of a headline about monkeypox with the same photo of a hand A screenshot of the date the monkeypox story was published: July 17, 2021 This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo of a hand with lesions shows a rash caused by shingles. The headline about shingles that appeared with it in the Facebook post comes from the website of the Department of Health in Queensland, Australia. The image was used to illustrate what shingles looks like. It appears this same image previously was wrongly used by an Indian website called The Health Site to illustrate what monkeypox lesions look like.  We found the headline about monkeypox that appears in the Facebook post on that website. However, when we visited the site on May 23, the photo of the hand was not there — instead, there was a different photo described as showing monkeypox. The website doesn’t say when the story was published but indicates it was ""updated"" May 23, 2022. With a little more digging, we found evidence this story first appeared on The Health Site in 2021 and was updated to remove the shingles photo that apparently was wrongly described as showing a monkeypox infection.  We found the same story published on another site with the shingles photo and the same date that appears in the Facebook screenshot: July 17, 2021. The photo has since been removed from this site, too. The story cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which on July 16, 2021 announced it had confirmed a case of monkeypox in a U.S. resident who had recently traveled from Nigeria to Dallas.  We looked for other instances of news organizations using the image of the person with shingles to illustrate monkeypox and found no credible outlets making what appears to have been a mistake on The Health Site.  Reverse image searches on Google and TinEye turned up no results, though the picture has been used before in the proper context: to show what shingles looks like.  The 2021 case in the Facebook screenshot predates the current outbreak.  Misinformation about monkeypox has been spreading since May 13, when the World Health Organization reported the first cases of monkeypox in countries where the virus is not usually found, including the United States. As of May 21, 92 cases had been confirmed in 12 countries non-endemic to monkeypox, with between one and five cases found in the U.S. Investigations into the origin of these outbreaks are ongoing.  The misused photo in the Facebook post doesn’t prove that monkeypox is a hoax. We rate claims that it does False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD81A00>],/factchecks/2022/may/23/facebook-posts/misused-shingles-photo-fuels-conspiracy-theory-abo/

It’s not true that a new benefit gives Americans up to ‘$50k in relief’
","A misleading video with millions of views on Facebook falsely implies that the U.S. government is providing new relief funds for Americans. The May 19 video says, ""Americans can get up to $50k in relief"" from a ""new benefit that just got released last week.""  The video begins by showing footage of what appears to be a television news broadcast with a CNN logo at the bottom of the screen and next to it text that says, ""Americans can now claim up to $50,000."" The footage is dated April 22 and marked ""Breaking News."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But there is not a new government benefit available to Americans. The Facebook video directs viewers to a website that provides quotes for private loans from multiple lenders. The TV news segment featured in the video appears to be fabricated. The footage is identical to a video available on the stock photography website Shutterstock. We also did not find any similar headlines or stories from April 22 in a search of CNN’s website and Twitter page. During the Facebook video, a narrator gestures to the fabricated news broadcast and says, ""This program’s been all over the news lately. So a new benefit just got released last week, allowing Americans to claim up to $50,000. You don’t need any credit history at all, no bank requirements. I did it myself and I got $8,000 in two days."" He adds, ""You just come to this website right here."" The site shown is Personal Loan Pro. Personal Loan Pro is a loan comparison website, according to FinanceBuzz, a personal finance site. It matches users to potential lenders, with quotes and terms from multiple loan providers in one place. Going to that website doesn’t automatically guarantee a loan; people still must submit an application to a lender. Any money received as a result of finding a lender via Personal Loan Pro is borrowed and must be paid back according to the terms of the loan. Despite the Facebook post’s claims, Personal Loan Pro is neither a ""relief"" program nor a new government benefit.
