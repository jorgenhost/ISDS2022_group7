Did GOP lawmakers push for independent map commission?
","During his 2018 campaign for governor, Democrat J.B. Pritzker pledged to veto any state legislative redistricting plan drawn by politicians. This month he went back on that promise, signing into law district maps created without Republican input by Democratic lawmakers who hold supermajorities in the state legislature. The plan he approved creates new boundaries for the districts that legislative candidates will compete in over the next decade, and sets up at least seven primary contests between state House Republican incumbents next year. Pritzker also approved new, Democrat-drawn boundaries for Illinois Supreme Court districts, which were last redrawn more than half a century ago. Boundaries for Illinois seats in the U.S. Congress have not yet been drawn. A day before approving the new maps, Pritzker was asked in an interview with WTTW to address GOP critics calling on him to prove he wasn’t lying to voters during his campaign by rejecting the Democrats’ maps. ""What I really want is a constitutional amendment for an independent commission to draw the maps. That is what the legislature should have done, didn’t do,"" Pritzker said. ""There are people who wanted to have legislation passed for an independent commission. It’s unclear to me whether that’s constitutional or not, but that could have been a way to do it. Then, Republicans and Democrats working together in a bipartisan fashion would have been another way to get a fair map. ""I’ll remind you that the Republicans don’t seem to want to do any of those things,"" he continued. ""They have argued that they want an independent commission, but they didn’t do anything about it."" As WTTW reporter Amanda Vinicky told Pritzker, however, GOP lawmakers filed legislation to create an independent commission this session. Pritzker did not respond to that point during the segment, so we decided to find out what the governor was talking about when he said the state’s minority party ""didn’t do anything"" to get independent maps. Over the years, citizen initiatives and lawmakers from both parties have offered plans aimed at thwarting the practice of partisan gerrymandering, where the dominant political party manipulates boundaries to benefit their candidates and, sometimes, incumbents in general. Republican lawmakers in the General Assembly filed two proposals to create an independent redistricting commission without amending the constitution this year. One of the bills they put forth was backed by GOP leaders in both chambers, but neither measure received Democrat support. While that legislation sat idle in a Democrat-controlled committee this session, the bill’s GOP proponents worked to draw attention to the measure at news conferences, framing their plan as an alternative to the map Democrat lawmakers reviewed behind closed doors this spring in the same room where party leaders met a decade ago to create the current map. It's all ""power politics,"" according to Chris Mooney, a state politics expert at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs. The Democrat majority, he said, knows the general public ""is not really exercised about this whole business and they are betting the Republicans can't make them exercised about it."" ""They [Republicans] did something, I think that’s pretty clear,"" Mooney said. ""Whether it amounted to a hill of beans, that’s another question."" So we reached out to Pritzker’s office to ask why the governor said the GOP ""didn’t do anything"" to try to create an independent commission. In response, Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh told us the GOP legislation conflicts with the state constitution, which lays out a specific process for redistricting. Whether or not the GOP legislation would prevail in court remains open for debate. The Illinois Constitution tasks the General Assembly with drawing new legislative districts in the year following each federal decennial census. Failure to pass a plan and get it signed into law by June 30 triggers a process involving a bipartisan commission that ultimately gives both parties a 50-50 chance at selecting the state’s next map, an outcome Democrats have sought to avoid. Lawmakers and the governor could pass a law creating a new commission without amending the constitution if that panel was solely advisory, according to Ann Lousin, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Illinois-Chicago John Marshall Law School. The GOP plan does not explicitly describe the bipartisan commission of 16 court-appointed members it proposes as advisory, though it does state that panel would hand off its map to the lawmaker-appointed legislative redistricting commission already empowered by the constitution to take over the process if a lawmaker-drawn map is not approved by June 30. Constitutional hypotheticals aside, however, Pritzker cited creating an independent commission through the legislative process as one of the options Republicans could have tried in his remarks to WTTW. We asked Abudayyeh to address this, but did not hear back. Pritzker said Republican lawmakers ""have argued that they want an independent commission, but they didn't do anything about it."" Republicans filed and promoted legislation this session aimed at creating an independent redistricting commission, and in his remarks to WTTW Pritzker cited creating an independent panel via legislation as one of the ways lawmakers could have tried for an independent map. Whether or not the GOP plan would have held up in court, it’s clear Republican lawmakers made at least some effort to create a redistricting commission not controlled by the legislature. We rate Pritzker’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Texas', 'Chip Roy']","
Murders are up in Austin, but little proof that's tied to police defunding
","To U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, Austin leaders' decision to cut police funding and reduce the size of the city's police force has led to skyrocketing homicides this year. The City Council voted last summer to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shift another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments. The effect has been a cancellation of a cadet class and the dissolution of some law enforcement units. In a June 3 interview with the Daily Signal, a conservative news site published by the Heritage Foundation, the Texas Republican argued that these changes have led to ""a doubling of murder"" that has been harmful to the city’s Black and Latino communities. Instead, cities should be increasing their law enforcement presence at the ground level to ensure that officers build relationships in their communities, he argued.   ""Why are we going the other way?"" Roy said. ""(Austin leaders say) 'Oh, let's reimagine police by getting rid of them.' What do you have? You have a doubling of murder in Austin, Texas. It's insane.""  ""That's not good for the communities that are allegedly being helped,"" Roy said.  The City Council’s decision to cut its police budget following massive protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death has already drawn scorn from the state’s Republican leaders. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, for instance, said that the cuts made Austin ""one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas."" We rated that claim Pants on Fire.   More than 20 major U.S. cities slashed police budgets in the aftermath of 2020’s nationwide protests against police brutality. Austin’s cuts, which amounted to about one-third of its police department’s 2020 budget, were the largest in the nation.  It’s now been eight months since Austin’s police budget cuts went into effect. Have murders in the city doubled since then?  It’s not entirely clear what Roy is comparing this year’s homicide numbers to. His office didn’t provide answers to several questions. But since he tied the cause of the rise to police budget cuts, we can infer he’s comparing this year’s levels to the year prior — before and after the cuts took effect.   We found that homicides so far this year are close to doubling the number recorded this time last year. According to monthly crime stats posted by the Austin Police Department, the city has recorded 33 murders from January through the end of May. Last year the city recorded 19 murders in the same five-month span. That’s a 74% increase.  But this increase paints a far more dramatic picture than the reality on the ground, experts say. Using a percentage increase to compare small numbers can give the impression of dramatic changes.  For instance, the city of El Paso recorded two homicides in the first quarter of 2020 and five homicides in the first quarter of 2021 — a 150% increase. By comparison, the city of Houston recorded 16 more murders in the first quarter of 2021 than the first quarter of 2020. But because Houston’s total homicides is a much larger number, 94 in the first quarter of 2021, the 16 additional murders results in a much smaller percentage increase — 20%. Gov. Greg Abbott also has used percentage increase figures to emphasize Austin’s crime numbers in his criticisms of police defunding. We rated that claim Half True. ""I’ve always been told: don’t use percentages for numbers that are under 50. If you’re looking at 30 or 45, don’t use a percentage difference because the percentage changes are so big,"" St. Edward's University criminologist Carsten Andresen said last year.  Because Austin’s homicide totals are low figures, comparing the homicide increase in that way isn’t seen by criminologists as an appropriate characterization.  Any way you measure it, Austin homicide levels are elevated so far this year. But are these numbers high because of the Police Department’s budget cuts?  ""It’s fair to say that violent crime has increased in Austin — and everywhere else,"" said Texas State criminologist Sean Roche.  According to a report released by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which combines crime data of 63 metropolitan areas across the U.S., homicides are up by 30% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020.  In many cities, homicides upticks have occurred despite increases in police funding since last year. Houston increased Police Department funding by adding $20 million to its nearly $1 billion budget, yet saw a 20% increase in murders in the first quarter of the year. Both Dallas and Fort Worth also increased law enforcement funding while recording upticks in homicides in the first quarter of this year.   Experts say it’s hard, if not impossible, to draw a direct correlation between fluctuations in police funding and crime rates when so many sociological factors are at play, the ongoing pandemic not least among them.  ""Say the police are pulling back a little bit. Does that really affect how individual people decide whether to commit murder? We know that a lot of violence is in the moment — it's not a cold-blooded decision,"" Roche said. ""Are a lot of people really going, 'normally I wouldn't try to shoot or knife this person, but I've heard that the police are defunding, so I've decided that murder is the right decision'?""  What is behind increased violent crime rates in Austin and across the nation? Crime trends often are influenced by macro-level drivers, especially during a pandemic. A cocktail of increased unemployment, the gun-buying surge, increased alcohol consumption and drug use can all combine to drive crime rates up. Unmeasurable factors, like civil unrest and political stress, also are in the mix.  All of these factors combined to make 2020 a year of high crime, and many of those factors are still present, Roche said. It’s unclear how or if those crime trends will abate as increased vaccination causes the pandemic to recede.   Roy said in an interview that police spending cuts in Austin is harmful to Black and brown communities because it has led to ""a doubling of murder"" in the city.  The city recorded 19 murders in the first five months of 2020, and 33 murders in the same five-month span of 2021, which is a 74% increase. However, experts say that because these crime totals are low numbers, using percent change comparisons can easily mischaracterize or distort increases.  Roy also connects elevated crime levels to the Police Department’s reduced budget. But it’s difficult to draw a direct causal relation between police budget changes and crime stats, and Roy doesn’t provide any evidence.   Crime rates are responsive to a number of sociological factors, and those factors are driving homicide increases in cities across the country — regardless of any increase or decrease in police department funding, experts say.   We rate this claim Half True. ","[('The Daily Signal,\xa0Why Rep.

Iowa moms with governor have QAnon ties, shared anti-vaxx conspiracy theories
","A message that widely circulated among Iowa’s political Twitter audience claims that two Ankeny mothers known for heading Iowa’s anti-mask movement, and who attended a recent bill signing by Gov. Kim Reynolds, are QAnon supporters. QAnon is pro-Donald Trump internet conspiracy theory that says a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles run the world and that Trump, under assaultby the cabal, is leading a secret fight against it. The new law signed by Reynolds states that leadership at public and accredited nonpublic schools cannot adopt or enforce mask mandates for students, employees or members of the public. It stems from House File 847 that passed in Iowa’s House and Senate along party lines, Republicans for it and Democrats opposed, during the final hours of the 2021 legislative session.  Early on May 20, Reynolds sat at her desk surrounded by clapping supporters as the bill was delivered for her signature. Next to Reynolds, in a video posted on Twitter by Speaker of the Iowa House Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, stood two women holding signs.  Responding to Grassley’s tweet, Kedron Bardwell, professor and chair of political science at Simpson College, wrote in a May 20 tweet that these two women, Emily Peterson and Kimberly Reicks, are mothers from Ankeny, Iowa, and known QAnon and anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists. Peterson held a sign stating, ""Unmask our children. #StoptheAbuse"" with a picture of Evi, her daughter, on it. Reicks held a sign stating, ""My mask caused a staph infection on my face four times. My body… my choice. Unmask Iowa."" Her sign had a photo of her daughter, Olivia. No evidenceexists that masks cause staph infection or other health problems.  Update: these 2 Ankeny moms standing next to the Governor are known Qanon and anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists. They were stars at that crazy ""Health & Freedom"" anti-mask conference in Oklahoma. The signature on her poster is Lin Wood. This who Kim Reynolds credited for her bill. https://t.co/8d6PKoIdoj We did a check on Bardwell’s claim and found that Peterson and Reicks attended the Health and Freedom conference held on April 16 and 17 in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and posted about their involvement on the Instagram page @freedom_over_umc.  Prominent QAnon sympathizers Michael Flynn, a former national security advisor for former President Trump, attended the conference. Flynn signed Petersons’ poster at the conference and spoke to the audience while holding the poster that showed Reicks’ daughter, Olivia. The moms posted a video of Flynn’s speech on Instagram. According to a video posted on TikTok by Reicks, the two women also spoke to the crowd about their daughters’ experience in school and their efforts to make masking optional.  PolitiFact Iowa reached out to Bardwell more than a half dozen times via email, phone and social media without response. It also reached out to Pat Garrett, communications director for Reynolds, more than a half dozen times via email and phone, given that Reynolds publicly has promoted getting vaccinated but making vaccinations voluntary. Garrett also declined to respond. PolitiFact also reached out to Peterson and Reicks for comment. Reicks said she is not with QAnon or another organization. She also said she is not an anti-vaxxer, but an EX-vaxxer. Reicks said masks and vaccines should be a choice and she doesn’t oppose or support the COVID-19 vaccine, but is waiting for ""more studies to be done."" ""My children have had their vaccines… they have had complications from some of them, and therefore, we no longer just go ahead and go to the doctor and get everything done,"" Reicks said. None of the vaccines was for COVID-19.  Asked directly about being part of QAnon, she said in the interview: ""No, I would say I’m not associated with anything except God-driven truth. You want to put me in a category, then I’m in the God category in that I believe in freedom over fear."" Asked about QAnon’s theories about pedophiles trying to rule, she said: ""I don’t say that I would follow it, but I do believe that there are evil people out there that are sex trafficking, and that’s been proven that things like that do happen. If there’s anybody that’s willing to stand up and fight against it, I’m willing to stand behind them because I don’t believe that should be imposed on our children, ever. So, any kind of harm that anybody does to our children, I’d stand behind somebody that wants to fight against that."" Reicks also shared a link with PolitiFact to a video of her and Peterson becoming the first recipients of Flynn’s ""Fearless Fighter for American Values"" award.  Peterson did not respond to a request for comment. A right-wing blog called Steel Truth featured a piece on the mothers, in which Peterson is quoted saying, ""All of this was a ‘plandemic’ and it was all part of an agenda. So our children are just the recipients of it and they are the ones suffering from it. We need to listen to the truth. It’s out there, but we need to look for it. We need to find it. And we need to stop listening to the propaganda media.""   In his Twitter thread, Bardwell says Peterson and Reicks had conspiracy theory posts all over their Facebook pages, but PolitiFact was not able to find all the posts mentioned in his thread. Peterson and Reicks share anti-vaccination information and posts like an anti-vaccine meme on various social media platforms. An Instagram account they share shows them at the Health and Freedom Conference and celebrating House File 847. Their private Facebook page called ""Freedom Over Fear 2"" has 2,600 members. Reicks also has a TikTok account with more than 7,000 followers, where she identifies as an ""EX-Vaxxer."" Reicks has promoted a video claiming Dr. Anthony Fauci and Bill and Melinda Gates planned the COVID-19 pandemic and made a video falsely asserting that Richard Grenell, the former nation’s director of national intelligence, is the U.S. president. After the Iowa bill on volunteering masks was signed, several accounts on Facebook and Twitter shared the same message celebrating Reicks and Peterson, including one user in a Facebook group, Moms Against Masks.  ""Meet Emily Peterson and Kimberly Reicks standing tall with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds. Emily & Kimberly stood up for all of our children and fought to bring a stop to the mask mandate for children in their state (Iowa). These two are fearless and fought at the local and state level causing GOV Reynolds to sign into Law a No Mask Mandate for our children.""  Because some posts have been deleted or taken down, PolitiFact cannot independently verify every social media claim made in Bardwell’s Twitter thread, but we did find evidence that Peterson and Reicks have supported and spread conspiracy theories, claimed the COVID-19 pandemic was planned, and support QAnon-affiliated people.  Though Reicks said she does not self-identify as anti-vaccine, she has shared anti-vaccine information while saying people should be able to decide on their own whether or not to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Peterson has shared anti-vaccine information publicly via social media.  Reicks said in the interview she does not belong to the QAnon movement, although she is connected with people known for embracing the theories. We acknowledge Reicks’ stated positions on vaccinations and not being part of QAnon but connect enough dots to rate Bardwell’s overall statement to be Mostly True.","[('PolitiFact interview with Kimberly Reicks, June 10, 2021', 'https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/education/2021/05/20/iowa-mask-mandate-law-schools-parents-families-react-covid-face-masks-kim-reynolds/5184384001/'), ('""General Flynn | IOWA Is Mask FREE!!!

No proof for speculation that COVID-19 vaccine deaths will rival COVID-19 deaths
","An Instagram post with video from a show produced by Alex Jones, who runs a website known to spread fake news and conspiracy theories, includes this headline: ""Report: Vaccine related deaths may rival recorded COVID-19 deaths."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no credible report that says this. The headline alludes only to a claim made by a guest on a Jones show who speculated that — based on what she said is data forthcoming from a man who owns a medical billing company — ""we probably are going to see deaths over 500,000"" from COVID-19 vaccines. That man says he analyzes numbers from a government database that collects and publishes unverified reports of adverse events that happen after vaccination, whether or not they’re known to be caused by the vaccine. Health officials are investigating whether one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines is linked to a rare type of blood clot that can lead to death. But there is no conclusive evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines caused any of the deaths reported to that database, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, more than 596,000 COVID-19 deaths have been recorded in the U.S. The headline in the Instagram post is the same text that appears in a June 4 tweet from Jones’ FreeWorldNews.TV account. The tweet includes video from part of a Jones show with a guest identified as Dr. Jane Ruby. Ruby, who is not a medical doctor, describes herself as a health economist and New Right political pundit with a doctorate in psychology.  Saying she has ""breaking news,"" Ruby claimed that according to projections by Albert Benavides, ""we are facing well over 1 million side effects"" from the COVID-19 vaccines, ""and I’m waiting for him to calculate the numbers of deaths, because it’s going to be far more than the 5,000. We probably are going to see deaths over 500,000,"" which would be ""more deaths from this poison than we ever did from the actual COVID flu."" Benavides has described himself as a California certified medical coder who has company that does medical billing services. He says he uses Excel spreadsheets to analyze data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, a public data collection tool run by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration. VAERS is designed so that any person can report an adverse event, and anyone can scour the reports.  But VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a dangerous breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere. For more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful.  Here’s what the CDC says about VAERS and the roughly 5,000 deaths reported as adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines: ""More than 302 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through June 7, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 5,208 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.  ""However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths."" The CDC said May 12 that its investigation had identified 28 confirmed cases of these blood clots among the 8.7 million people who received the J&J vaccine, and three of those people died. A widely shared Instagram post claimed: ""Report: Vaccine related deaths may rival recorded COVID-19 deaths."" There is no credible report saying this. The claim came from a guest on a show produced by Alex Jones, who runs a website known to traffic in fake news and conspiracy theories. The guest said she based her statement on data that soon would be produced by a California man who runs a medical billing company. The CDC says its review of data has not established a causal link between the COVID-19 vaccines and reported deaths. COVID-19 has killed nearly 600,000 people in the U.S. We rate the post False.","[('Instagram, post, June 11, 2021\xa0', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CP6lIOUnwQJ/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=2756ada3-56be-4a5f-b305-30aef246859c'), ('Twitter, FreeWorldNews.TV tweet, June 4, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Sherri Tenpenny makes false COVID-19 vaccine magnetism claim to Ohio lawmakers,"" June 9, 2021', 'https://mobile.twitter.com/fwn_tv/status/1400939878674751490'), ('U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""Selected Adverse Events Reported after COVID-19 Vaccination,"" May 27, 2021', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/jun/11/instagram-posts/no-proof-speculation-covid-19-vaccine-deaths-will-/

NC Republican ignores state's old business rankings
","To hear North Carolina Republicans tell it, they turned their state around. Democrats controlled the state government for more than 100 years before the GOP gained control of the legislature in 2010 and then the Governor’s Mansion in 2012. As state Sen. Paul Newton pointed out in his recent press conference, Republicans swiftly changed North Carolina’s tax codes in 2013 to make the state more appealing to businesses. ""Our pro-business policies moved North Carolina from among the worst business rankings in the country, to the top 10,"" Newton said as he introduced the GOP’s latest tax tweaks. This made us wonder: When it comes to business rankings, how big was this turnaround? It turns out, a credible think tank in 2011 did consider North Carolina’s tax codes to be among the least business-friendly in the country. While Republican leaders cited that think tank by name in their press release, Newton overgeneralized. And in doing so, he ignored rankings by at least three media outlets who considered the Tar Heel state to be one of the best places for business. When we reached out to Newton’s office, spokesman André Béliveau referred us to rankings by the Tax Foundation. The foundation, considered a top independent tax policy nonprofit, for years has been releasing a State Business Tax Climate Index. Béliveau pointed out the Tax Foundation ranks North Carolina 10th this year, after ranking the Tar Heel state as low as 46th in 2011. And the Republicans’ tax changes certainly played a role in the state’s rise in the rankings, said Jared Walczak, the foundation’s vice president of state projects. ""Before tax reform, North Carolina's tax rates were relatively high, with generous incentives for select industries, particularly in agriculture and textile manufacturing. These targeted incentives, however, were out of reach for firms outside these traditional industries,"" Walczak told PolitiFact in an email. ""In 2013 and thereafter, targeted incentives were pared back, tax bases broadened, and rates reduced. The individual income tax, the corporate income tax, and the franchise tax all saw rate reductions, while tax bases were revised to enhance neutrality so that the code did not put a thumb on the scale, picking winners and losers,"" he said.  As a result, Walczak said the state’s domestic product has improved. ""In the seven years prior to tax reform in 2013, state gross product only rose 1.8% in real terms, compared to a national average of 5.6%,"" he said. ""In the seven years since — which includes the downturn from the coronavirus pandemic — state gross product rose 9.5%, exceeding the 9% national average."" While the foundation obviously wasn’t keen on North Carolina’s tax policies a decade ago, other analysts saw potential in North Carolina. In 2011, the same year the Tax Foundation ranked North Carolina 46th, both Forbes Magazine and CNBC ranked North Carolina the third best state for business. Meanwhile,  Chief Executive Magazine ranked North Carolina the second-best state for business in the country. PolitiFact reviewed North Carolina’s rankings in Forbes, CNBC and Chief Executive magazine dating back to 2007. In multiple years before Republicans took complete control over state government — including 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012 — the three outlets ranked North Carolina among the top five best states for business. Only once, when CNBC rated North Carolina No. 12 in its 2013 rankings, did the state fall out of the top 10. The disparity between findings by the Tax Foundation's and the others is largely due to ranking methodology. The Tax Foundation study focuses solely on taxes, specifically: individual income, sales, corporate income, property, and unemployment insurance taxes. The foundation’s focus ""is narrower than other business indices"" that include other factors, Walczak said. Indeed, the other rankings used such factors as workforce quality, cost of living, and quality of life — elements that elected officials cannot control anywhere near as directly as tax policy. Chief Executive said in 2011 that ""more than 500 CEOs considered a wide range of criteria, from taxation and regulation to workforce quality and living environment, in our annual ranking of the best states for business."" CNBC said they ""scored all 50 states on 43 measures of competitiveness developed with input from business groups including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Council on Competitiveness."" The measures of competitiveness included everything from a state’s tax codes to its infrastructure and cost of living. Forbes said it looked at six categories: ""costs, labor supply, regulatory environment, current economic climate, growth prospects and quality of life."" By focusing solely on a rating defined by tax policy, Newton ignored other ratings that included factors having less to do with partisan control. Rankings by the other outlets are ""all measuring meaningful things and tend to be taken seriously by policymakers and business leaders,"" Walczak said. He noted that CNBC's measures of competitiveness incorporated rankings by the Tax Foundation and other groups. ""These indices can provide a helpful snapshot of a state's business climate and identify areas of improvement, though it's important to remember that not all factors they measure matter equally to all businesses,"" Walczak said. ""At their best, these indices are a valuable diagnostic tool and a shorthand way of identifying a state's economic climate and competitive standing. For businesses, moreover, the better indices are a useful rubric when considering states for expansion."" He added: ""No one is going to choose a state just because of its ranking, but these rankings might help create the list of states that merit further consideration."" Newton said ""Our pro-business policies moved North Carolina from among the worst business rankings in the country, to the top 10."" This statement gives the impression that North Carolina was ranked among the worst states for business in the country prior to 2013, when the Republicans ushered in sweeping tax reforms. That’s misleading. While the Tax Foundation ranked North Carolina’s tax structure low in 2011, three media outlets with longstanding state rankings of business environments placed the Tar Heel State among the best states for business even before Republicans took control of the legislature. We rate Newton’s claim Half True.","[('Video by WRAL on May 25, 2021, ""GOP lawmakers roll out tax cut proposal.""', 'https://www.wral.com/gop-lawmakers-roll-out-tax-cut-proposal/19695082/'), ('Email exchange with\xa0André Béliveau, spokesman for N.C.

Sherri Tenpenny makes false COVID-19 vaccine magnetism claim to Ohio lawmakers
","An anti-vaccine activist falsely claimed during a hearing with Ohio state legislators that the COVID-19 vaccines are magnetizing people who get them. Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an Ohio-based osteopathic physician who wrote a book called ""Saying No to Vaccines,"" has been identified by the news site rating service Newsguard as a ""super-spreader"" of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. A watchdog group found that she is one of 12 influencers responsible for 65% of anti-vaccine misinformation spread on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.  Tenpenny has previously pushed false claims that the COVID-19 vaccines can cause death and autoimmune disease, disrupt pregnancies and ""shed"" to affect unvaccinated people.  Her latest comments came as she testified at the invitation of Ohio’s Republican lawmakers in favor of a bill that would prevent businesses or the government from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination, according to the Columbus Dispatch. ""I’m sure you’ve seen the pictures all over the internet of people who’ve had these shots, and now they’re magnetized,"" Tenpenny said during the June 8 hearing. ""They can put a key on their forehead, it sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them, and they can stick. Because now we think that there’s a metal piece to that."" Those claims are baseless. There are no metallic ingredients in any of the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. for emergency use, from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The Food and Drug Administration has published the ingredients for each online. ""There’s nothing there that a magnet can interact with,"" Thomas Hope, a vaccine researcher at Northwestern University, previously told AFP Fact Check. ""It’s protein and lipids, salts, water and chemicals that maintain the pH. That’s basically it, so this is not possible."" PolitiFact and several other fact-checkers previously debunked the videos and ""pictures all over the internet"" that Tenpenny cited as proof, which purported to show magnets sticking to vaccinated people. The social media posts about vaccine magnetism were so widespread that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed them on its website: ""Can receiving a COVID-19 vaccine cause you to be magnetic? No. Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine will not make you magnetic, including at the site of vaccination which is usually your arm. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys, as well as any manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors. In addition, the typical dose for a COVID-19 vaccine is less than a milliliter, which is not enough to allow magnets to be attracted to your vaccination site even if the vaccine was filled with a magnetic metal."" Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at New York's Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, previously told PolitiFact the claims about vaccine magnetism were ""utter nonsense.""  Other experts told AFP Fact Check that the metal objects highlighted in various online videos and images are likely sticking for other reasons. They could have tape or another adhesive on them, for example. Or they could appear to stick because of the oil on a person’s skin. Later on in the Ohio House hearing, a nurse tried unsuccessfully to prove Tenpenny’s theory by positioning a key and a bobby pin against her neck. ""Explain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too,"" she said, even as the key she pressed to her neck did not stick.  Wow. An anti-vaccine nurse in Ohio tried to prove the Vaccines Cause Magnetism theory in an state legislative committee. The demonstration did not go to plan pic.twitter.com/0ubELst4E8 Tenpenny also claimed that there is ""some sort of an interface, ‘yet to be defined’ interface, between what’s being injected in these shots and all of the 5G towers,"" and that the vaccines have caused thousands of deaths in the U.S. Both of those claims are inaccurate. Tenpenny did not immediately respond to a request for comment from PolitiFact.

Mining lithium poses environmental risks. The Biden administration isn’t ignoring them
","If President Joe Biden is going to achieve his vision of putting millions more electric cars and trucks on America’s highways, lithium ion batteries will be a key piece of the effort. So far, these relatively lightweight energy cells are the best bet for going electric and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In a recent op-ed that skewered Biden’s budget plan as bloated and wasteful, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley highlighted one of the challenges to getting enough lithium to make that shift to electric vehicles happen.  ""The president’s budget showers hundreds of billions of dollars into federal incentives for U.S. consumers to jump on the EV bandwagon, electrify school buses and install EV chargers across the country,"" Grassley wrote June 7.  But, Grassley continued, the Biden administration ""ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining needed for EV batteries and power storage."" Biden and his Democratic Party offer themselves as environmental defenders. It would be a big deal if they sacrificed local environmental safety in the quest to meet national or global climate change goals. Most lithium mining comes with an environmental cost, and a major new Nevada project has drawn lawsuits from environmental groups. But Grassley’s claim goes too far in saying the administration is ignoring the problems lithium extraction poses in its push for electric vehicles. His staff explained that he was speaking only about Biden’s budget plan, not the administration’s policy across the board. That falls wide of the mark, too. Lithium-ion batteries are used for most plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles. Smaller versions also power our cell phones and laptops. Today, most lithium comes from Australia or South America. With demand projected to skyrocket, the U.S. has put a premium on producing more lithium at home. The Thacker Pass mine in northern Nevada has become the country’s first large expansion of lithium production in a decade.  Grassley’s staff pointed us to news stories about the Thacker Pass mine, a 1,000 acre open-pit mine, expected to produce 60,000 metric tons per year of battery-grade lithium carbonate. The Bureau of Land Management gave final approval to the mine on Jan. 15, 2021, in the final week of the Trump administration. The move drew a quick reaction from those who saw the mine as a threat. A local rancher sued to reverse the permit, as did several land conservation groups.  They argued that the owner, Lithium Americas, downplayed the millions of gallons of water it would use, and the pressure that would place on limited water supplies. They noted that the government’s own assessment showed that operations would raise the level of antimony, a toxic metal, in the groundwater, high enough to exceed state minimums. There would also be habitat loss. We asked the Bureau of Land Management if it was taking another look at the permit, and the agency said it had no comment. The government has assigned a Justice Department lawyer to defend against the lawsuits. It’s fair to say that, as Grassley complained, the Biden administration is now overseeing a project that could hurt the environment. But the administration’s policy goes beyond that one mine. The Bureau of Land Management is currently vetting another lithium mining project in Nevada, more to the south along the border with California. The Clayton Valley lithium pilot plant has an initial environmental assessment that considers the potential impacts on water, air, habitat and cultural resources. The government has not yet signed off on the permit. Based solely on where the process sits today, the administration is not ignoring the negative effects of lithium mining. The administration has also shown interest in finding alternatives to traditional mining techniques to extract lithium. One small Energy Department project offers $4 million to develop ways to get lithium out of the briny waters of geothermal aquifers.  On a larger scale, the department’s budget request asks Congress for $75 million to build a lithium battery recycling system. In its blueprint for lithium batteries, the department said the goal is to ""enhance environmental sustainability, and support a U.S.-based circular materials supply chain."" Grassley said that the Biden administration ""ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining.""  There’s not much to back that up. The administration now oversees a project approved by the Trump administration that has drawn lawsuits, but it is vetting another lithium mine proposal against a full menu of environmental considerations. If Grassley was speaking solely about Biden’s budget plan, the facts support him even less. The Energy Department is seeking $75 million to recycle lithium batteries as a strategy to increase supply with less environmental damage.  People might argue that the administration isn’t doing enough, but there’s no evidence that the administration is ignoring the downsides of lithium mining. We rate this claim False.","[('Iowa Torch, Grassley: Biden’s Bloated Budget, June 7, 2021', 'https://iowatorch.com/2021/06/07/grassley-bidens-bloated-budget/'), ('White House, FY 2022 Budget of the U.S. government, May 2021', 'No link'), ('U.S. Energy Department, Energy efficiency and renewable energy — FY 2022 budget request, June 3, 2021', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/budget_fy22.pdf'), ('U.S. Interior Department, Thacker Pass lithium mine project - record of decision, January 2021', 'No link'), ('High Country News, Nevada lithium mine kicks off a new era of Western extraction, Feb. 18, 2021', 'https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/doe-geothermal-competitions-heat-new-lithium-extraction-prize-and-teams-advance'), ('Lithium Americas, Thacker Pass, accessed June 8, 2021', 'No link'), ('Grist, The Battle of Thacker Pass, March 12, 2021', 'https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/1503166/200352542/20033308/250039507/Thacker_Pass_Project_ROD_signed_2021-01-15.pdf'), ('Interesting Engineering, The Paradox of ""Clean"" EVs and the ""Dirty"" Lithium Mining Business, April 10, 2021', 'No link'), ('Forbes, Rising U.S. Lithium Industry: A Potential Quandary For Environmental Activists, March 16, 2021', 'https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.3/indigenous-affairs-mining-nevada-lithium-mine-kicks-off-a-new-era-of-western-extraction'), ('New York Times, The Lithium Gold Rush: Inside the Race to Power Electric Vehicles, May 6, 2021', 'No link'), ('U.S. Interior Department, Environmental assessment — Clayton Valley Lithium Pilot Plant Project, March 2021', 'https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-03-16-blm-lawyer-intervenes-in-envior-case/f3974e10348c2c3c/full.pdf'), ('U.S. Energy Department, National Blueprint for Lithium Batteries, June 8, 2021', 'No link'), ('U.S. Energy Department, DOE Geothermal Competitions Heat Up: New Lithium Extraction Prize and Teams Advance in Manufacturing Prize and Collegiate Competition, March 31, 2021', 'https://grist.org/climate/the-west-has-a-new-front-in-the-war-over-electric-cars/'), ('U.S. Energy Department, Advanced Manufacturing Office FY20 Critical Materials FOA Selections Table, accessed June 7, 2021', 'No link'), ('American Lithium, American Lithium Co-recipient of U.S. Department of Energy Grant For US$4.5M Lithium Processing Pilot Plant, March 4, 2021', 'https://interestingengineering.com/clean-evs-and-dirty-lithium-mining-business'), ('Congressional Research Service, Environmental Effects of Battery Electric and Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles, June 16, 2020', 'No link'), ('University of California-Riverside, Lithium extraction research, accessed June 7, 2021', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/03/16/rising-us-lithium-industry-a-potential-quandary-for-environmental-activists/?sh=31cb27157691'), ('Sustainable Materials and Technologies, The future of automotive lithium-ion battery recycling: Charting a sustainable course, December 2014', 'No link'), ('Reuters, Trump moves to loosen mining regulations, approve projects as he exits, Jan. 8, 2021', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/business/lithium-mining-race.html'), ('U.S. District Court - Nevada, Western Watershed Project et al. vs U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Feb. 26, 2021', 'No link'), ('U.S. District Court - Nevada, U.S. Justice Department notice of appearance, March 16, 2021', 'https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/2011353/200477806/20036102/250042299/20210309_CVPilotPLant_DraftEA_PCs.pdf'), ('Sierra Club, Mining and Mining Law Reform Policy, Feb. 20, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email exchange, George Hartmann, spokesman, Office of Sen.

Lobbying group says Right to Work laws lead to faster employment growth, but evidence is mixed
","Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, has made no secret about wanting to undo the state’s right-to-work law. But he has powerful opponents. That includes the GOP-controlled Legislature, which has already stripped a provision overturning the law from the governor’s 2021-23 budget.  And Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobbying group, which on March 9, 2021 -- the sixth anniversary of Wisconsin becoming a right-to-work state -- hailed the benefits of that status. The group issued a tweet that included this claim: ""Right to Work States Have: Faster Private Sector Employment Growth.""  Right-to-work laws make it optional for workers to join labor unions. All told, there are 28 right-to-work states, with many concentrated in the south, though many midwestern states -- including Michigan, Iowa and Indiana -- also carry that status.  But what about the WMC claim? Does right-to-work status result in faster private-sector job growth? When asked for backup for the claim, Chris Reader, WMC’s senior director of workforce and employment policy, told us the group was referring to ""Right-to-Work Laws: The Economic Evidence (2018 Update)"" by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a national business lobbying group. The document is based on a report the Chamber, which supports right-to-work laws, commissioned from NERA Economic Consulting.  A WMC news release quotes an even more specific line from the report: ""Between 2001 and 2016, private sector employment in Right to Work states grew at 27 percent compared to 15 percent in non-Right to Work States."" The numbers may be on point, but the claim runs into problems within the fine print of the report itself, which notes the data can’t be used to demonstrate a causal relationship between right-to-work status and a state’s economic performance.  In 2014, when the issue was being debated in Wisconsin, we looked at a series of claims by politicians here and elsewhere about right-to-work laws and found mixed evidence for such connections.  For instance, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a 2011 claim that right to work states ""have much lower levels of unemployment than union states do""  – the levels were lower, but ""much lower"" was a stretch. And it rated True a claim from then-Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich that  ""The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states.""  But in 2013, PolitiFact Ohio rated Half True a claim that ""Six out of 10 of the highest unemployment rates are also in so-called right to work states."" The numbers were right, but it was ""misleading because it implies a cause-and-effect relationship that is bogus."" So, what do experts say about the WMC claim? ""Most recent papers use Right-to-Work status as indicating more favorable business climate generally as opposed to the policy specifically,"" Peter Orazem, a labor economics professor at Iowa State University, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""I think it would be very difficult to isolate the effect of Right-to-Work in economic growth as opposed to more favorable business climate more generally,"" he wrote. ""There is evidence that firm productivity is stronger and that entrepreneurial activity is more robust in states with Right-to-Work laws, but this may be due to a range of pro-business policies."" Gordon Lafer, a University of Oregon professor and former senior labor policy adviser for the U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Education and Labor, said there’s no evidence right-to-work status increases job growth. Lafer is a research associate with the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning institution.  ""All the claims that RTW increases job growth come from simply measuring growth in states that do and don't have RTW laws, and assuming -- based on nothing -- that RTW is the cause,"" Lafer wrote in an email. ""But really you're measuring things like the impact of warmer weather and fewer snow days, oil in Texas, tourism in Florida, and other things that have nothing to do with RTW.   ""If you line up all 50 states in order of growth over a decade, you find the states with RTW laws on both ends of the spectrum and every place in between."" Finally, Michael Childers, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Department of Labor Education, said in an email that right-to-work laws lead to negligible changes in employment and pointed to research by the Economic Policy Institute.  In its most recent report, issued in February 2021,  the institute noted Montana – which currently does not have a right-to-work law (but is considering one) – had faster job growth than neighboring right-to-work states including South Dakota, Wyoming and Idaho. In a tweet, WMC claimed right-to-work states have faster private-sector job growth than in non-right-to-work states. While the numbers may add up, the report itself says the numbers can’t prove one causes the other. And outside experts say there are many factors at work, such as other pro-business policies or an existing trend of employment growth. We rate this statement Half True.    ","[('National Conference of State Legislatures, ""Right-to-Work Resources.""', 'https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/right-to-work-laws-and-bills.aspx'), ('Tom Kertscher, PolitiFact Wisconsin, ""Right to work: How past claims have fared on the Truth-O-Meter"", Dec. 4, 2014.', 'No link'), ('Louis Jacobson, ""Bill O’Reilly says unemployment is lower in ‘right to work’ states"", Feb. 28, 2011.', 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2014/dec/04/right-work-fact-checkers-perspective/'), ('Tom Ferran, ""Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern ties right-to-work states with unemployment"", May 6, 2013.', 'No link'), ('Bill Wichert, ""New Jersey Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver says studies show right-to-work laws don’t spur job growth"", July 15, 2011.', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/feb/28/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-unemployment-lower-right-work-st/'), ('Eric Stirgus, ""Numbers back up Gingrich job growth claim"", June 21, 2011.', 'No link'), ('Allison Colburn, ""Greitens not quite right on right to work"", April 6, 2017.', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/may/06/chris-redfern/ohio-democratic-party-chairman-chris-redfern-ties-/'), ('Email from Peter Ozarem, professor at Iowa State University, May 3, 2021.', 'No link'), ('Email from Michael Childers, professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, May 3, 2021.', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2011/jul/15/sheila-oliver/new-jersey-assembly-speaker-sheila-oliver-says-stu/'), ('Email from Gordon Lafer, professor at the University of Oregon’s Labor Education & Research Center, May, 3, 2021.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/jun/09/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/lobbying-group-says-right-work-laws-lead-faster-em/

Olens: Some Georgia counties, cities lack websites, email
","
A recent statement by state Attorney General Sam Olens had PolitiFact Georgia musing on the quirks of our digital age.

Thanks to the Internet, you can track your ex’s new girlfriend on Facebook. You can watch a YouTube video of recording artist Nicki Minaj’s wardrobe malfunction, over and over again. You can even buy a 1963 Studebaker on eBay while reclining in your Barcalounger.

But email your county commissioner? That’s not so simple, Olens told attendees at an Atlanta Press Club breakfast Aug. 4.  

The subject came up as Olens talked about the state’s open records and meetings laws, which journalists use to ferret out government corruption. It’s a bad idea to require all governments to use the Internet to inform residents about meetings, Olens told breakfast-goers.     

""[K]eep in mind, we still have cities and counties where the elected officials don’t have email addresses, where there are no websites,"" Olens said.

No emails or websites? Surely, Olens jests. Nowadays, even pet cats have their own websites. Really.

It so happens that the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, a group that represents county governments, conducted a survey in July  to see which counties lacked websites. They found 30.

The state Attorney General’s Office sent us a list of those counties, as well as information from the Georgia Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns statewide. The GMA lists 217 municipalities that don’t have their own websites.

Some of these governments have a Web presence on a local chamber of commerce or regional development website but do not control or operate them, said Beth Brown, a spokeswoman for the ACCG.  

They often don’t have enough staff or money to run a website, spokeswomen for both groups told us. Others are so remote they can’t get high-speed Internet access.

Consider Taliaferro County. In 2009, an estimated 1,812 residents lived in all of its 195.4 square miles, according to census and state data. Their commissioners work part time, so officials don’t see a need to spend the resources to give them their own accounts, the county clerk told us.  

Bacon County gives email addresses to elected officials who ask for them, but not all of them in this county of about 10,600 do. Their one-man IT department hopes to get the county’s official website up soon. It just takes a lot of manpower to get it done, he said.

The city of Walthourville, population 4,000, just started its website this year and is in the process of assigning email addresses, the city clerk said.   

So Olens is right. Not only are there counties and municipalities in Georgia that don’t have websites or whose elected officials don’t have government email. State organizations place their numbers at more than 200.

Or, to put it differently, the cats of certain pet-obsessed owners have pounced across the digital divide well ahead of scores of Georgia governments.

Has Gov. John Kasich veered from his vow to use turnpike proceeds for infrastructure improvements?
","
Gov. John Kasich has made no secret of his wish to privatize a number of state entities to create new revenue for the fiscally challenged state. One idea that he has revived is leasing the Ohio Turnpike to a private concern.

State lawmakers helped pave the way in June by including an item in the state budget that allows the administration to pursue a lease or sale. The General Assembly would need to approve a request for proposals the administration is in the early stages of preparing, but the legislature will not have the opportunity to sign off on the final deal, still about 18 months off should Ohio reach an agreement.

A key selling point for Kasich is that the billions of dollars the state would get for leasing the toll road would be pumped into improvements for the state’s roads, bridges and waterways and not used to fill state budget gaps. At least that’s what the Republican governor and his minions have said on more than one occasion.

In a February speech in Columbus to the Ohio Newspaper Association, the governor said his ideal agreement would bring Ohio $3 billion. ""I can take that money and I can put a billion dollars into infrastructure,"" he said.

Kasich’s spokesman Rob Nichols told The Plain Dealer in March that the governor doesn’t favor using the onetime money to pay bills or to operate government.

In April, Ohio Department of Transportation director Jerry Wray told the Toledo Blade’s editorial board that lease proceeds would be ""dedicated"" to infrastructure improvements such as highway construction and harbor dredging focused mainly in Northern Ohio.

A fact sheet the administration prepared on the turnpike proposal in July just before Kasich visited Toledo to promote the leasing idea suggested the same: money would be used for infrastructure.

It caught PolitiFact’s ear recently when Kasich began to switch his tune a bit. During that stop in Toledo, the governor for the first time suggested the lease money could be used to support other areas of the state budget.

In an interview with The Plain Dealer last month, Kasich said: ""It is my intention to use this money for infrastructure. But I never said where all this money was going to go. I’m just saying I want to put it in infrastructure --  the bulk will go into infrastructure. But with the federal government, God only knows what those people are capable of doing. If they blow a big hole in our state, we have to look at it. But it’s not my intention.

""Look, we’re already balanced,"" he continued. ""We already have a rainy day fund. We already have money beyond the budget that is appropriate. I don’t anticipate"" having to use turnpike lease money for a budget deficit. ""But I’m also not going to say, ’no way, no how.’ You always have to have a few options.""

The governor might be correct to exercise caution and leave his options open, considering the economy continues to be unpredictable for states like Ohio trying to climb from the grips of recession and fighting to stay below double-digit unemployment rates.

But the idea of leasing the turnpike is a controversial plan opposed by many Northeast Ohio planning groups and political and civic leaders. They worry that the well-kept turnpike will suffer from higher tolls or lax maintenance if it falls into the hands of a private operator interested in maximizing profit. As far as the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency and its sister organizations are concerned, the turnpike isn’t broken, so don’t try to fix it.

Kasich is sensitive to their concerns. His administration has tried to ease the tension by dispatching ODOT officials to the area to assure leaders in Northern Ohio, where the turnpike stretches from Pennsylvania to Indiana, that proceeds from the deal will be spent on infrastructure projects around the turnpike and that any private operator would be held to standards to maintain the reputation of the toll road.

If the governor is beginning to hedge a bit, that is a concern for local leaders who believe a lease agreement is inevitable but took some comfort in expecting proceeds to be spent on roads and bridges. Kasich says he is still committed to spending lease dollars on infrastructure but has clearly left the door ajar for other spending opportunities.

We rate the governor’s position a Half Flip.","[('\nTelephone interview with Gov.

Gov. Rick Scott says rail would have cost state taxpayers $1 billion to build
","
On his second month on the job in February 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott wrote a letter to the U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announcing he had decided to reject about $2.4 billion in federal money for a high-speed train line between Tampa and Orlando. Scott said at the time that he was worried Florida would ultimately be on the hook for costs. Democrats and some Republicans criticized Scott's move, which killed a project that had been in the works for decades.

Florida's high-speed rail debate kept the Truth-O-Meter running at full speed ahead for some time as members of Florida's congressional delegation, several state lawmakers and local officials scurried to try to circumvent Scott. Supporters pitched a new plan to the governor in which cities would take over the project and a private company would assume the risk of cost overruns -- but Scott remained steadfast in his argument that the state could get stuck with huge costs.

Several months after Scott squashed the project, he still faces questions about why he put the brakes on it -- as he did during an interview on Tampa Bay's local CBS affiliate Aug. 5.

""Here is the deal. I offered it to everybody and nobody wants to do this and that's why I'm not doing it. They offered, the federal government, here's the deal. ... I'm going to give you $2.4 billion -- that sounds nice right? You've got to put up a billion dollars to finish the project. And you are going to lose money every year. And if you decide, gosh I'm tired of losing that money, you've got to give the $2.4 billion back. It's a bad deal.""

Scott made a similar claim about the $1 billion cost for Florida in an Aug. 5 meeting with Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Raheem Morris after the coach made a comment about liking rail.

Readers picked up on the line and asked us if Scott got Florida's share of the high-speed construction correct.

To start, it's worth looking at the chronology of what led up to Scott's rejection of high-speed rail.

In 2009, the Florida Legislature under Gov. Charlie Crist laid the groundwork for Florida to provide $280 million for a line between Orlando and Tampa. But after Scott took office it was clear that the project was in jeopardy.

A December 2010 fact sheet from the Florida Department of Transportation about high-speed rail stated that the federal government would pay for the bulk of the project -- about $2.392 billion. The state's portion, according to the state DOT, would be $280 million. The fact sheet stated that an industry forum in Orlando in November 2010 drew considerable interest from the private sector.

""There will be intense competition to win the first true HSR (high-speed rail) in the U.S. Individual meetings with various teams in November 2010 revealed strong private sector interest and willingness to assume ridership risk and invest in the system. Teams are very interested in right-of-first-refusal for Orlando-Miami leg."" (The Orlando-to-Miami leg was to be built after Tampa-to-Orlando. That project was more costly but also considered more lucrative in the long run.)

Where Scott got his number  
So why did the state say the rail line would cost the state $280 million to construct but Scott said $1 billion?

The answer is because Scott's source of information isn't state transportation officials. It's the libertarian Reason Foundation.

On Jan. 6, 2011, the Reason Foundation released an analysis about Florida's rail project, which concluded that capital costs to build the project would be higher than anticipated and ridership would fall short, leaving the state with operational shortfalls.

Scott relied on the Reason analysis in killing the high-speed rail project. 

While the federal government had committed $2.4 billion and the state $280 million, ""This report assumes that any cost above $2.7 billion will be borne by Florida taxpayers."" The Reason analysis goes on to cite research by European academics who looked at 258 projects in various countries over 70 years and found that cost overruns occurred in 90 percent of the projects and that the average capital cost overrun for passenger rail was 45 percent.

""If the Tampa to Orlando high-speed rail line experiences cost escalation typical of international high-speed rail projects, it will cost between $.54 billion and $2.7 billion more than projected,"" the Reason analysis states. ""Based on averages, most likely the overrun would be about $1.2 billion, all of which would be the responsibility of Florida taxpayers.""

The analysis is right to point out that many other rail projects experienced cost overruns. But there are reasons to question its methodology and objectiveness are suspect. Consider:

• The author of the study, Wendell Cox, is a known rail skeptic, and Robert Poole, a Reason Foundation director whose name was on the report, served on Scott's transition team for transportation issues. 

• Much of the expectation of cost overruns is based on a list of 258 projects studied by European academics. But those projects are not just rail projects. The study includes bridges, tunnels and highways. In fact, of the 258 projects, only 58 (or 22 percent) are actually rail projects. The projects also are predominantly based in Europe. It's also unclear what projects are included and what projects are not.

• The $1.2 billion overrun estimate is created simply by assuming the Florida rail project will cost 45 percent more than anticipated. How is that assumption made? By calculating the average overrun in 258 transportation projects considered. There is no analysis to suggest Florida will experience an ""average"" cost overrun compared with the other projects.

• The study also fails to account for the current low price of construction and materials given the problems in Florida's economy. As Scott's own DOT secretary Ananth Prasad said on Aug. 8, 2011, in advocating for more road-building projects: ""This is kind of like a buyer's market.""

• And, most importantly, the study assumed Florida taxpayers would assume the cost of all construction overruns, when that likely wasn't true.

In an interview, Cox said that he has supported rail programs when they make sense. We asked for an example and Cox said he supported an expansion of a rail project in Hong Kong in 2000. But generally, Cox said that rail projects have not been profitable. ""Every single dollar put into high-speed rail has been lost. The record couldn't be more clear.""

He said his report takes into account some more recent projects within the past decade including one in London. The rail project in London was taken over by the government in 2009 after the consortium faced financial difficulties. The report also considered a current project in California. A report by California's legislative analyst in May cited problems with the rail plans in that state. The Associated Press reported in May 2011 that while the cost for the first phase was estimated at $43 billion in 2009, estimates have grown by as much as 57 percent. Cox sent us this Aug. 9, 2011, news report about California's skyrocketing rail costs.

Cox said his study didn't guarantee cost overruns for Florida. But, he said, history shows that overruns were likely.

""We didn't say this will be the case -- what we did say was taxpayers in Florida need to be aware of the risks,"" Cox said. 
State officials said private companies would pay for construction overruns

To satisfy state legislators, who were unwilling to spend any additional state taxpayer dollars on the high-speed project, Florida transportation officials promised in early 2011 that any contract to build the rail line would include a guarantee that Florida wouldn't pay for any construction overruns.

Kevin Thibault, the Florida Rail Enterprise's executive director, said in a Jan. 11, 2011, Senate committee meeting that a private consortium -- not state taxpayers -- would be responsible for cost overruns or revenue shortfalls.

We listened to a recording of Thibault from the meeting where he stated that a private company would design and build the project and maintain and operate it for 30 years.

""The public sector would help fund the major investments of it -- the infrastructure -- and then the private sector role is to assume the ridership risk. Where we've been very clear upfront is the operation and maintenence cost is going to be borne by the private sector. There is no state funds associated with that phase of it. The only funds that's going to be available would be toward the capital end.""

And the private sector would take on the costs of any construction cost overruns, longterm operations and maintenance, Thibault said.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood also said that private companies, not the state, would be required to pay for cost overruns in a Feb. 16 statement: ""We worked with the governor to make sure we eliminated all financial risk for the state, instead requiring private businesses competing for the project to assume cost overruns and operating expenses.""

Brie Sachse, a spokeswoman for the Federal Railroad Administration, provided the same information in an Aug. 9 e-mail interview.

""Federal officials repeatedly assured Gov. Scott that Florida would not be on the hook for either cost overruns during construction or any operating cost deficits. These risks were to be 100 percent assumed by bidders of the project for design, construction, operations and maintenance responsibility, in order to insulate Florida taxpayers. Eight private teams comprised of domestic and international companies were ready to bid on this project and several of these groups said they would be willing to assume any risk associated.""

Ultimately bids were never sent out to private companies, so we can't for certain say DOT officials would have included the overrun guarantee. And we don't know if private companies would have agreed to the deal. But we do know legislators made it clear they would need a guarantee to move forward with the project.

Legislators, we should note, also wanted private companies to pony up the $280 million or so the state had committed to the project, to lighten the state's burden even more. The prospects of that, however, were never completely vetted because Scott pre-emptively killed the project.

Our ruling

If high-speed rail had moved ahead in Florida, Scott said the state would have had to pay $1 billion to build it.

Scott bases his claims on hypothetical cost overruns from a suspect study written by a libertarian think tank. While the study correctly points out that other transportation projects have experienced cost overruns, there are several flaws  with the study. Most importantly, the study assumes that the state would pay for cost overruns.

But that ignores that both the state official in charge of the rail project and the U.S. Department of Transportation secretary said that the state wouldn't be liable for overruns. And legislators were keen on having it happen that way before fully embracing the high-speed rail line.

In the end, the state's share to build the line would have been capped at around $280 million (and legislators hoped the final number would be even less).

You can't rewrite history to fit your narrative. We rate Scott's claim False. ","[('\nGov.

"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Democratic Party of Wisconsin']","
Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairman Mike Tate says Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus has ""screwed up counting the vote"" in two consecutive elections
","
On the brink of falling one victory short of taking back the state Senate, state Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate blamed a familiar punching bag late on election night.

Tate lashed out at Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus, whose April 2011 failure to include an entire municipality’s unofficial vote count in the Supreme Court contest for more than a day led Democrats to falsely believe their preferred candidate, JoAnne Kloppenburg, had won.

This time around, there was no such delay, but partial election-night returns from one community in the county were among the last reported. Those figures from Menomonee Falls, a GOP stronghold, would ultimately reverse the early ""lead"" in unofficial returns that recall challenger state Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Whitefish Bay) had over state Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills).

While the Menomonee Falls totals were still out, Tate told a WISN-TV interviewer on Aug. 9, 2011 that ""this is an election that Sandy Pasch has won"" and that Nickolaus ""at worst is conducting criminal voter fraud"" amid some ""very questionable activities.""

He didn’t stop there.

""Look, this should be a concern shared by everybody who lives in Waukesha County,"" Tate said. ""Two elections in a row she has screwed up counting the vote. Regardless if you are a Republican or a Democrat you should know that your vote is going to count.""

Those are, to say the least, pretty strong statements.

But they weren’t just off-the-cuff remarks in the midst of a live interview.

The party immediately issued a news release (Headline: ""Waukesha County Tampering"") charging that Nickolaus ""is once more tampering with the results of a consequential election and in the next hours we will determine our next course of action. For now, Wisconsin should know that a dark cloud hangs over these important results.""

Let’s pause this tape and look at the process.

Given the party’s continued criticism, we thought it was important to see if Nickolaus, as Tate claimed, ""screwed up counting the vote"" for the second time in a row.

We asked Tate what evidence he had to back his claim of tampering with the election. He said suspicions were raised because the Waukesha vote totals were among the last to come in statewide on a night with six Senate recall elections. (Democrats unseated two GOP incumbents, falling one shy of regaining control of the Senate).

The most important word in his claim is the ""counting"" part.

County clerks such as Nickolaus don’t count any ballots on election night. That’s up to the municipal clerks who supervise polls in their community.

County clerks receive reports from municipalities, which send in their unofficial returns on election night. They are double-checked later later when they are certified by the county’s Board of Canvassers.

(In the April election, Nickolaus posted one final number for the county, not municipality-by-municipality numbers, which helped conceal the missing community for days. A recount confirmed Justice David Prosser won by about 7,000 votes. Since then, Nickolaus has been posting community-by-community numbers as they come in, as she did during the Aug. 9 election)

Two Waukesha County communities are in the 8th Senate District: Butler and Menomonee Falls. Butler sent in totals within 35 minutes of close of polls at 8 p.m., and those were posted early in the evening.

But Menomonee Falls Clerk Janice Moyer told us that heavy turnout there prevented tabulation of absentee ballots in some cases until after polls closed.

""It takes time, and we want them to do it correctly,"" Moyer said of poll workers.

Nickolaus did not get most of the Menomonee Falls count until 10:36 p.m., according to Moyer. Nickolaus said results were posted on the county’s web site by 10:47 p.m. The last batch came in an hour later, and Nickolaus said she posted them within six minutes.

So the gap in reporting Waukesha County results was not due to Nickolaus, who posts and tallies the totals but does not count the votes.

What’s more, a staggered flow of returns is common on election nights, as each community finishes its count. Other communities were still out when Tate made his statement, including on turf that Pasch won in Brown Deer in Milwaukee County.

And even in the races Democrats won, all precincts had not yet reported when victory was declared.

What about Tate’s contention of a ""second time"" Nickolaus messed up a vote count?

Nickolaus admitted a mistake in the Supreme Court race, but investigators found no vote-tampering. She failed to include Brookfield in the total she released that night, but that error was not related to counting the votes -- just reporting the totals she received from locals.

It looked suspicious, and caused a firestorm.

But it involved the unofficial count only and did not affect the official vote count released days after that election.

In the state Senate race, as the realization settled in early Wednesday morning that Darling would win with 54 percent of the vote, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin issued a retraction of sorts that it ""would not pursue questions of irregularities.""

But it threw fuel on the fire about the results, contending -- erroneously -- that the race was a ""virtual tie.""

And in a day-after media conference call, Tate again criticized Nickolaus, saying she had arguably been ""sitting on these results."" In that call, Tate responded to a questioner who asked if he felt he had defamed Nickolaus.

Tate responded that he has said a lot of things in his two years as party chairman. He added: ""If that’s what’s going to be called defamatory, I guess I’m willing to stand by that.""

So, we’ll return to the original remarks as well.

In claiming Nickolaus ""screwed up counting the vote"" for the second election in a row, Tate offered no proof that the numbers that eventually came in were off. Nor did he offer proof she was ""sitting on"" votes -- much less ""tampering"" or ""conducting criminal voter fraud"" on election night.

This claim is inaccurate and, in the ""heat of the moment"" as he put it, Tate made a ridiculous claim. In this case, where there’s heat, there’s fire: Pants on Fire.","[('\nWISN TV, ""Democratic Party Chair Claims Waukesha Votes ‘Suspicious,’"" August 9, 2011\n\nDemocratic Party, press release, August 9, 2011\n\nDemocratic Party, follow-up press release, August 10, 2011\n\nConference call, Democratic Chair Mike Tate, August 10, 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Waukesha County clerk denies delaying voting results,"" August 10, 2011\n\nInterview with Sauk County Clerk Rebecca A.

Sen. Codey says 1 in 5 New Jersey families has loved one with mental illness
","
Gov. Chris Christie’s budget veto pen didn’t just hit big-ticket expenditures. Even small amounts – including $50,000 for a mental health awareness group – was trimmed from the state’s spending plan this summer.

And state Sen. Richard Codey (D-Essex) had plenty to say about it during a speech he gave July 11 on the Senate floor in Trenton.

""One in every five families in the state of New Jersey has a loved one with a mental illness, a serious mental illness, and today, we don’t care,"" Codey said in response to Christie’s line-item veto of a $50,000 appropriation for the Governor’s Council on Mental Health Stigma.

PolitiFact New Jersey checked Codey’s statistic and found that, depending on definition and methodology, the figure is generally accurate. While several national mental health-affiliated organizations cite that statistic for all states, at least one other said the ratio is 1-in-4 families.

""These days our fact sheets are using one in four (families) any day in a given year has a mental health problem,"" said Bob Carolla, spokesman for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. ""It depends on who has done the most recent study and parameters around it.""  

Codey, who was governor from November 2004 to January 2006, signed an executive order in November 2004 to create the Governor’s Task Force on Mental Health to investigate the state’s mental health system. One of the task force’s recommendations was creation of the council, with an aim to educate people about mental illness.

""The thing about mental health is it knows no barriers, rich or poor, black or white,""
Codey told us.

Codey raised more than one issue in his statement, so we’ll look at the number of people in New Jersey affected by mental illness, explain the budget cut and identify ""serious mental illness.""

First, New Jersey had 3,152,877 households from 2005 to 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If each household is considered a family, that means approximately 630,575 New Jerseyans had a mental illness during that time, based on Codey’s statistic.

Second, state Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn confirmed the $50,000 cut and said the money was used for promotional materials and expenses related to council Executive Director Celina Gray’s outreach efforts about mental illness. Quinn said Gray remains employed and the council still exists, but the work connected with it has been folded into the Human Services Department’s Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services.

The governor’s office did not respond to two email requests for comment on Codey’s statement.

Codey, Carolla and Phil Lubitz, associate director of NAMI’s state office in North Brunswick, each identified serious mental illness as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression and panic disorder.

""Loved ones also applies to immediate family members,"" Lubitz said.

Although Codey’s statement was about New Jersey, the 1-in-5 statistic is used by these organizations: the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office; the American Psychiatric Association; and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

""In 2009, there were an estimated 45.1 million people with any mental illness in the past year -- that’s 19.9 percent of all individuals age 12 and older … or, if you prefer, about 1 in every 5 individuals,"" Bradford Stone, spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said in an email. ""For serious mental illness, the rate was 4.8 percent (about 1 in every 20 individuals) or 11.0 million individuals for all individuals age 18 and older.""

NAMI has used 1 in 4 families since 2007, and the National Institute of Mental Health cites both statistics.

""The current prevalence estimate is that about 20 percent of the U.S. population are affected by mental disorders during a given year,"" according to ""Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General,"" issued in 1999 and still one of the main standards today in assessing mental illness, Carolla said.

Let’s review.

In responding to a budget cut for a council formed by the Governor’s Task Force on Mental Health, Codey said that one in every five New Jersey families has a loved one with a mental illness. Various reports from at least three organizations cite that statistic, but NAMI cites 1-in-4. Another national organization cites both. Even with the slight disparity, the overall point of Codey’s statement is that mental illness is very common. We rate Codey’s claim True.

"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Marcia Fudge']","
Rep. Marcia Fudge says 11 percent of eligible voters lack a government ID
","
Editor's note: The claim checked in this PolitiFact Ohio item was updated Aug. 15, 2011, to better address the speaker's underlying point. The change did not affect the overall rating of her statement. 
You need a photo ID to cash a check at the bank and a driver’s license or passport to get past airport security checkpoints. Annoying though this is, it reassures advocates of state voter-fraud laws that they aren’t being unreasonable to want every voter to show a government-issued photo ID before they can be handed a ballot.

It’s not for PolitiFact Ohio to say whether such a requirement, upheld in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court in an Indiana case, is necessary or wise. Ohio state legislators have discussed adopting a photo-ID voting law but have not followed through so far.

But civil rights groups are concerned about the number of states considering such laws, saying the risk of voter suppression with some citizens being denied the right to vote is far greater than the chance of fraudulent voting that changes an election’s outcome. Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights led a news conference with other Democrats and civil rights leaders on July 13 and said: ""I think that people don’t understand that across this country, 11 percent of all people eligible to vote do not have a government-issued ID. That’s 21 million people.""

She went on to say, ""I guess they think that we don't understand they're trying to keep poor people from voting, minorities from voting, the elderly from voting, students from voting.""

Her statements intrigued PolitiFact Ohio. Do more than one in 10 people over age 18 really lack a driver’s license, passport or other form of government identification? Do photo ID laws significantly undermine voting?

Fudge’s office said she got the figure from the Brennan Center for Justice, which operates within the New York University School of Law. The Brennan figure has been cited widely and comes from a 2006 survey conducted by an independent polling firm, Opinion Research Corp. Respondents were asked whether they have a current government-issued ID with their photo on it, like a driver’s license or military ID. If they answered yes, they were asked if this photo ID had their current address and current name, as opposed to maiden name.

They also were asked if they had a U.S. birth certificate, naturalization papers or passport in a place they could easily get to if they had to show it the next day and whether those documents had their current name.

According to the Brennan Center, as many as 11 percent of U.S. citizens — more than 21 million — did not have current government-issued photo identification.  This was based on a sample of 987 randomly selected voting-age citizens contacted by telephone. The pollster reported a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

PolitiFact Ohio readers might remember someone else citing this Brennan Center survey — namely, State Rep. Armond Budish. Budish used it in March to support his statement that ""25 percent of voting-age African-Americans do not have the photo ID that this bill would require."" PolitiFact Ohio noted that the specific figure that Budish cited had a rather high margin of error — 8 percentage points — because of the smaller subset of voters (African-Americans) polled on this question. That mean’t the actual statistic was probably between 17 and 33 percent. This was among the reasons Budish’s claim was rated Half True.

Fudge’s statement included all voters, regardless of race. That’s why the poll question had a much lower margin of error; it was based on a bigger sample. The actual figure could be as high as 13 percent or as low as 9 percent.

But is the survey valid?

We looked for other data and made some calls to ask. A 2005 report from a federal voting rights commission chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker said in a footnote that about 12 percent of the United States voting-age population did not have driver’s licenses. The figure came from U.S. Department of Transportation and Census Bureau data.

We also found a May 24, 2011, report from Norman Robbins, research director for Northeast Ohio Voter Advocates, that examined driver’s license data specifically in Ohio. The report concluded that 940,000 Ohioans over age 18 lacked driver’s licenses. That’s nearly an 11 percent rate, higher than figures cited by proponents of Ohio voter ID laws. Robbins said in his findings that previous figures were erroneous because they failed to take into account such factors as deceased license holders and Ohioans who had moved out of state but were still in the state license database.

Based on these studies, it appeared as if Fudge was in the right range. Yet the more we looked, the more we found that the figures are subject to debate.

Susan Myrick, an election analyst at the Civitas Institute in Raleigh, N.C., a conservative group that wants limited government, was dismissive of the figures. She noted that the trial court judge in the Indiana case that went to the Supreme Court called estimates in a similar range ""incredible"" and ""unreliable."" That judge, Sarah Evans Barker of the U.S. District Court, was criticizing a study based on Indiana drivers license data, not a national poll. But taking a very basic look at Indiana license data, the judge said the actual figure might be closer to 1 percent.

Myrick also pointed to a 2008 study from American University’s Center for Democracy and Election Management. That study asked 2,000 registered voters in three states (Indiana, Maryland and Mississippi) whether they had a driver’s license, passport or military ID. Only 1.2 percent of those surveyed said they lacked these kinds of IDs.

""These data suggest that access to IDs and the documents necessary to obtain a valid photo ID, for registered voters, is not a serious problem,"" the American University study concluded.

Note that this study involved people who were already registered to vote. The poor and minorities represent a high percentage who have not registered to vote and those who do not have government IDs, according to legal experts whose work we saw while researching this subject. This presents a chicken-and-egg question: If people do not vote when there is no stringent ID requirement, why not? And would an ID rule even have that big an impact?

""It seems clear that the requirement of photo IDs is not an impediment to voting; the problem is that not enough people register, and not all those who register vote,"" the American University study said. ""This was a problem before ID laws, and it remains a problem.""

About 64 percent of Americas voting-age population turned out in the 2008 presidential election, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And that was considered a good year by modern historical standards. Based on the American University study, lack of a government ID wasn't what kept the other 36 percent from the polls.

Americans are highly mobile, and registering to vote in a new precinct, let alone a new city, takes effort. Campaign tactics and commercials before elections turn people off. The nominating process is so front-loaded that by the time some states hold their primaries, the nominee is all but decided. (Ohio could be a good example of this in 2012.) Numerous studies and even books such as ""The Vanishing Voter ""  have examined the problem.

Asked specifically about the 11 percent figure that Fudge and others use, Robert Pastor, director of the American University center and executive director of the Carter-Baker commission, did not dismiss it entirely. But he suggested that claims like this miss the broader context.

""The problem is not the voter ID,"" he said. ""The bigger problem in America is that we have relatively low voter participation, and that is in part because we have relatively low voter registration, regardless of the reason. That is true regardless of voter ID.""

If only 11 percent of the eligible population failed to vote, it would give the country an 89 percent participation rate. This would be extraordinary.

So how do we rate Fudges claim?

We start with the fact that a number of authorities say her source is credible. Daniel Tokaji, a law professor at Ohio State University, told us that he, too, thinks the Brennan figure ""is in the ballpark."" He cited another study, ""The Disproportionate Impact of Voter ID Laws on the Electorate,"" done recently by researchers at universities in New Mexico, Arizona and Washington who used national survey data from the 2008 election. From 4,563 respondents, they found that 95 percent of registered white voters said they had current drivers licenses or state-issued photo IDs, while 90 percent of black voters, 89 percent of Latino voters and 86 percent of Asian voters did.

But when comparing these voters with specific ID requirements of states like Indiana -- licenses had to be current, and names and addresses on the IDs had to comport with the voter registration records -- the researchers found that the percentage of white voters dropped to 88 percent, and the others to 80 or 81 percent.

In other words, the figures change depending on the ID standard and the pool of prospective voters being gauged.

In the original version of this PolitiFact Ohio item, we gauged the truthfulness of the statement Fudge made about 11 percent of people eligible to vote not having a photo ID. We rated that statement Half True, partly because the data is five years old. Mainly, though, we rated the statement Half True because Fudge made the statement to emphasize that the photo ID law is a significant impediment to voting. As an impediment, however, the Photo ID law pales compared to apathy. A lot more than 11 percent of eligible voters don't bother to register, let alone vote.

But PolitiFact Ohio didn't need to look for Fudge’s underlying meaning in her statement. She flat out said the Photo ID law would be an impediment to voting. That's why we changed the claim we rated in this item.

Yes, the Brennan Center figure is widely accepted. And Fudge’s statement sounds and feels accurate to a lot of people, many of them worried that voter ID laws will be too restrictive. But the idea that the Photo ID law would reduce voting ignores an important detail -- that a lot of people just don't vote.  

When a statement is accurate but leaves out important details needed to understand fully, the Truth-O-Meter has a specific rating: Half True.","[('\nSOURCES:\n\nU.S. Rep.

Adam Hasner says George LeMieux voted against his party for 'tax-raising' committee
","
As Adam Hasner and George LeMieux debate each other's conservative credentials in the race to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, Hasner's team has picked over LeMieux's brief time in the U.S. Senate looking for signs of weakness — er, uh, moderate leanings. 
The joys of primary politics.

Thus, a Hasner news release from Aug. 8, 2011 -- the week after Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling and avoid default -- accuses LeMieux of being ""for tax-raising committees before he was against them.""

It begins:

""After weeks of equivocation and avoidance of the debt crisis in Washington, Senator George LeMieux finally tweeted his displeasure in the closing hours of the debate. But while serving as Charlie Crist's handpicked U.S. Senator, George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes."" 
And concludes:

""Time and time again, Senator LeMieux's record shows he was willing to be a token Republican vote for the Democrats, and his vote to create a tax-raising task force proves it."" 
Consider us intrigued. In just part of a sentence — ""George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes"" — we saw three issues worth a look.

• Did LeMieux vote against most Republicans and with Democrats to create a Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action?
• Was that task force proposal ""strikingly similar"" to the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, sometimes called the ""supercommittee,"" created by the Budget Control Act of 2011?
• Is the supercommittee being ""set up ... to justify massive tax hikes""?

We'll note that LeMieux did indeed tweet unhappily on Aug. 1, 2011, saying the, ""Debt deal offers no significant debt reduction & no fundamental reforms to solve DC's spending addiction"" and linking to a short post on his website that the debt deal was ""no time for celebration.""

Did LeMieux vote to create a Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action? 
LeMieux's record of support for a bipartisan committee known as the ""Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action"" is clear. He was one of 25 original co-sponsors of legislation in 2009 by Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., that would have created the task force. When it ultimately came up for a Senate vote as an amendment to an amendment to another bill in January 2010, the roll call at Senate.gov shows he voted for it. 

His ""Yea"" vote put him with about 40 percent of Republicans. The majority of his party colleagues voted against it.

That supports Hasner's claim that he ""voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats"" to create the task force. But LeMieux wasn't exactly a ""token Republican vote for the Democrats,"" as Hasner's team put it. Fifteen of LeMieux's Republican colleagues joined him. The Democrats were as divided as the Republicans, though more of them supported the plan. Meanwhile, the final 53-46 Senate vote — seven votes short of the 60 required — understates earlier Republican support for the task force.

Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell had called it the ""best hope for addressing the out-of-control spending and debt levels that are threatening our nation's fiscal future."" Then antitax activists attacked it for leaving the door open to tax increases, and President Barack Obama endorsed it the Saturday before the vote. Seven Republican co-sponsors withdrew their support. McConnell also voted against it, earning a Full Flop from PolitiFact.

Which left LeMieux in his party's minority — but on a proposal with strong bipartisan roots.

Was that task force proposal ""strikingly similar"" to the supercommittee?

Hasner accuses LeMieux of a flip-flop, saying he was ""for tax-raising committees before he was against them."" But just how similar were the committees?

In some key ways, they're the same. 

The supercommittee is ""certainly a descendant of the task force and the many other similar type(s) of special mechanisms proposed to do the hard work Congress refuses to do,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. ""... This is not a new idea."" 
The committee proposals both include members appointed by Democrats and Republicans, seek ideas to reduce the ""fiscal imbalance of the federal government"" and require Congress to fast-track recommendations to a vote with no amendments.

But LeMieux's campaign points out a key difference: The 12-member supercommittee created by Congress requires just simple majority votes — for example, a single Republican could join six Democrats to endorse a plan. Meanwhile, the task force he supported required supermajority votes both by an 18-member committee and by Congress to implement its recommendations. 

""This would have protected taxpayers since the commission's plan would have needed the support of at least four of the eight Republicans on the commission to guarantee a vote in the House and Senate,"" said campaign manager Brian Seitchik. ""This would make it highly unlikely that the commission's plan would be able to get sufficient Republican support if it raised taxes.""

So, are the committees ""strikingly similar""? Yes, but arguably with enough room for LeMieux to explain why he might vote for one, but not support the other.
  
  
Is the supercommittee being ""set up ... to justify massive tax hikes""?

Now we get to the crux of Hasner's campaign message, that LeMieux supported ""tax-raising"" committees before he opposed them.

Did Congress create the supercommittee ""to justify massive tax hikes""? And was raising taxes the purpose of the earlier task force that LeMieux supported?

Consider this a matter of vociferous debate. 
Neither the task force nor the supercommittee proposals require tax increases. The earlier task force plan explicitly allowed for the possibility, saying that recommendations may include expenditures and revenues. Meanwhile, the supercommittee legislation requires a $1.5 trillion reduction in the deficit but doesn't prescribe how to get there. Spending cuts? Tax increases? It's up to the committee, which doesn't have to be named until Aug. 16, 2011.

In fact, depending on whom you talk to, tax increases are guaranteed, likely — or, in the case of the supercommittee, not even possible.

Hasner's campaign cited a letter from antitax activist Grover Norquist, who opposed the earlier task force proposal. Norquist said that by relying on a committee that was not explicitly barred from raising taxes, tax hikes would occur. 
""Every Democrat on the commission would insist on tax increases to 'balance' spending cuts in the recommendation. There is no conceivable scenario whereby the commission would issue a report that does not contain tax hikes,"" he wrote.

George F. Will made a similar argument about the tax force proposal LeMieux supported: ""Substantively,"" he wrote, ""the task force would be a means of conscripting Republican participation in huge tax increases.""

Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense disagrees with the premise that either committee was designed to justify tax increases.

""That's irresponsible fear-mongering, which is similar to those on the left saying the committee was established to slash Social Security or Medicare,"" Ellis said. 

He points out that only half the senators who voted against the task force proposal were Republicans.

""I don't think Sen. (Bernie) Sanders, I-Vt., was voting against the committee because he was afraid it would raise taxes,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the supercommittee vote actually spawned days of debate about whether it would allow for tax increases at all, much less ""massive"" ones. (You can read some here: Sort of, Yes, Maybe)

House Speaker John Boehner told his caucus it would effectively be impossible for the supercommittee to raise taxes. The White House disagreed.

The debate turned on a technical question: How would $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction be calculated?

Some said that, because the supercommittee legislation asks for estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, it would require using CBO's typical ""current law"" baseline — one that assumes the Bush tax cuts will expire in 2012 — as opposed to a ""current policy"" or ""plausible"" baseline that assumes that what's true now stays in place whether that requires an act of Congress or not. Others said the committee could request a different baseline.

If a current law baseline were required, Democrats wouldn't get any credit toward the $1.5 trillion for stopping or limiting the Bush tax cuts, for example, which would be presumed gone. Even if they wanted to do it anyway, increasing tax rates would get sticky. 

""The practical effect of this is that the bipartisan committee will be unable to make any recommendations regarding the Bush-era tax cuts,"" wrote Nick Kasprak of the business-backed Tax Foundation. ""For example, let's say the committee proposes, among other things, raising the top marginal tax rate 3 percentage points, from 35 percent to 38 percent, which would bring in some amount of revenue that counts towards their $1.5 trillion assignment. 'Hold on,' says the Congressional Budget Office, 'According to our current law baseline, that rate is set to go up to 39.6 percent in 2013 when the Bush-era tax cuts expire, so this is actually a tax cut, and it makes the deficit worse.' ""

One more curveball: If the supercommittee deadlocks, or Congress doesn't pass what it recommends, the Budget Control Act includes an automatic trigger to cut $1.5 trillion across the board, split evenly between defense and everything else, and protecting just Social Security, Medicaid and veterans benefits. That's right: No deal means just cuts.

The ruling

Hasner's team said, ""George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes.""

LeMieux did vote against the majority of Republicans, joining with Democrats in an attempt to create a Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action — though the proposal had more bipartisan support than Hasner's full news release suggests. Meanwhile, while the task force would have been substantially similar to the supercommittee just established by Congress, it's different enough that LeMieux could explain his change of support without a change of heart. Finally, it's a serious stretch to say the supercommittee was designed ""to justify massive tax hikes."" While tax increases are one plausible outcome, they aren't required, and depending on the baseline committee members choose, may not even be likely. On balance, the claim is Half True.","[('\nAdam Hasner for U.S. Senate, ""Sen.

Ron Paul ad says Democrats only want tax increases
","
Rep. Ron Paul's first television ad hits a popular Republican theme. It says Democrats aren't serious about balancing the federal budget because they want only tax hikes, not spending cuts.

The ad’s narrator says:

""In the '80s they did it to Reagan. A debt ceiling compromise. Democrats promising spending cuts, but delivering only tax hikes. The 90s brought more compromises, more broken promises and more new taxes. This August, the next chapter will be written. A defining moment. $14 trillion in debt. Millions unemployed. The dollar in decline. We know where they stand, but will our party's leaders repeat the mistakes of the past? Will they choose compromise or conviction? One candidate has always been true: Ron Paul. Cut spending. Balance the budget. No deals. Standing up to the Washington machine, guided by principle. Restore America now.""

In this item, we'll explore Paul's claim that during the debt ceiling debate in the 1980s, the Democrats ""delivered only tax hikes.""

After all, former President Ronald Reagan himself used ""Trust, but verify,"" as a signature phrase throughout his presidency.

We didn't get a response to multiple calls to Paul's campaign, but the ad cited a source for the claim: a New York Times story on Sept. 28, 1987.

The story talks about debates over the 1988 federal budget, during which President Reagan and Congress were working on an agreement to reach a deficit of no more than $144 billion, or face $23 billion in spending cuts.

The article refers to Reagan’s ""reluctant agreement"" on the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987, which amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit and Control Act of 1985, commonly referred to as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act after its three chief sponsors.

Contrary to Paul's claim, we found Democrats were involved in that law and other efforts at cutting spending in the 1980s.

One of the sponsors of the 1985 act, Sen. Ernest Hollings, a Democrat from South Carolina, was one of the congressional leaders seeking deficit reduction in 1985. Hollings was a member of the Budget Committee in the 99th Congress, when the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act was enacted, a committee on which his co-sponsors Republican Senators Phil Gramm (Tex.) and Warren Rudman (N.H.) would later serve.

""The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings process was bipartisan, it was two Republican Senators and a Democratic Senator, and it allowed both spending cuts and tax increases,"" Stan Collender, widely respected budget analyst and writer for Roll Call’s ""Fiscal Fitness"" column said, speaking of the 1985 act.

""It didn’t distinguish"" between the two approaches, Collender said. ""The original version only had deficit targets, it didn’t tell you how to get here from there,"" Collender said. ""It could’ve been easily used to raise funds or cut spending.""

The 1985 Balanced Budget Act aimed to eliminate the deficit by requiring fixed deficit targets, enforced through sequestration -- automatic, across-the-board spending cuts made by the beginning of the fiscal year -- if necessary, to keep the estimated deficit within determined limits. Its aim was reaching a balanced budget by FY 1991.

Since the spending cuts would be automatic unless a deficit reduction plan was agreed to, it was considered a severe but effective incentive for Congress and the President to come together on budgetary goals. It passed 271-154 in the Democratic majority House and 61-31 in the Republican majority Senate before President Reagan signed the bill into law December 12, 1985.

The process for determining the amount of automatic cuts was later determined unconstitutional in the case of Bowsher v. Synar in 1986. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act violated constitutional separation of powers, giving the Comptroller General (whom Congress can remove from office) authority to order the president to carry out the automatic cuts.

The Balanced Budget Reaffirmation Act of 1987 amended Gramm-Rudman-Hollings’ sequestration procedure by giving its authority to director of the OMB. In addition, automatic spending cuts would be split, 50-50, between the military budget and other domestic spending areas -- excluding Social Security, federal pensions and many programs targeting the lower income Americans.

Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, were major supporters of the 1987 act, which is also referred to as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.

A Chicago Tribune article Aug. 2, 1987 quotes Rostenkowski as saying, ""‘I’d like to put it right on Ron`s desk and say, ‘Okay, pal, you sign the . . . bill’ or defense will be slashed.""

John B. Gilmour’s book, Reconcilable Differences?: Congress, the Budget Process, and the Deficit highlights Democrats' efforts with the 1987 amendment, where ""Prominent Democrats were among the (1987) plan's most energetic supporters while Republican leaders hung back and voiced their growing doubts...(Chiles and Rostenkowski) both supported the revival of Gramm-Rudman because they believed that the threat of defense cuts would force the president to accept tax increases.""

After the 1987 Act underwent amendments to satisfy the House and the Senate, a conference report was agreed to in the Democratic-Majority House by 230 to 176 and agreed to in the Democratic-Majority Senate by 64 to 34, before President Reagan signed the act Sept. 29, 1987.

It is not accurate to say the Democrats supported only tax increases with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and the amended version of the act of 1987, Collender said.

""It wasn’t all tax increases (with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings). That’s just campaign speech hyperbole,"" Collender said.

Not only did the 1987 act allow deficit reduction through mechanisms other than tax increases, the act was shaped in part by Republican senators and signed by a Republican president.

Reagan was reluctant to sign the amended Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation because of potential harm it could cause through automatic cuts to military spending, if they were triggered.

He ended up signing the Reaffirmation Act of 1987, however, because it included a debt ceiling increase.

Following the signing of the 1987 Reaffirmation Act, efforts resumed between the president and Congress to reach a budget deficit compromise before the act's Nov. 20 trigger for the automatic cuts. Over time, Reagan softened his stance that he would veto any tax increases.

President Reagan signed a final budget deficit reduction plan into law Dec. 23, 1987, a measure that included $9.1 billion in tax increases, spending cuts in a variety of domestic sectors and sales of some government assets.

Automatic cuts put into place by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings did take place in FY 1986, FY 1988 and FY 1990. In FY 1987 and FY 1989, deficit reduction plans exceeded the targets by $5 billion and $17 billion, respectively, and automatic cuts were not triggered.  

Our ruling

Paul claims that during the 1980 budget negotiations, Democrats only sought tax increases. But the record indicates that they supported deficit reduction packages that included significant reductions in spending. We find his claim False.","[('\n""Remarks on Signing the Bill to Increase the Federal Debt Ceiling,"" http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1987/092987c.htm\n\n""Fee Rises Suggested to Reduce Deficit,"" John Cushman, Jr., September 28, 1987, The New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/28/us/fee-rise-suggested-to-reduce-deficit.html\nRon Paul Campaign Debuts First Presidential Campaign TV ad, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUNIeOB0whI\n\nInterview with Stan Collender, July 27, 2011\n\nGilmour, John B.

GDOT: Road construction to bring 9,700 jobs
","There’s nothing like a rosy job creation estimate to light up the Truth-O-Meter.

Agencies regularly talk up these figures to show projects with big price tags have major benefits. Readers regularly wonder whether they’re true.

Recently, a reader asked us to look into this projection for the Northwest Corridor project, which will add and change lanes on I-75 and I-575 in Cobb and Cherokee counties:

""The Northwest Corridor -- a $96 million project with a projected $1.5 billion in positive economic impact -- is expected to create over 9,700 jobs statewide and provide immense benefits to metro Atlanta, the state of Georgia, and the southeastern United States,"" a July 19 press release from the Georgia Department of Transportation read.

GDOT issued the press release to trumpet that the state was invited to apply for a special U.S. Department of Transportation-sponsored loan that could lower the cost of the project.

More than 9,700 jobs statewide? Is that true?

A GDOT spokeswoman referred us to an April 2010 report issued by the Fiscal Research Center of Georgia State University’s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies.

According to estimates from a GDOT consultant, the state will spend $922 million statewide on the project. Construction will create more than 5,225 ""person-years of full-time equivalent employment"" across Georgia.

What’s a ""person-year of full-time equivalent employment,"" you ask?

We interviewed John Matthews, who was a senior research associate with GSU when he served as the study’s lead author. He told us this measure is one we’ve encountered before -- ""job years.""

""Job years"" do not represent the number of people the project will employ. PolitiFact Georgia researched this measure on a story about the Atlanta streetcar project, which will build a line downtown.

Economists use the ""job years"" measure to help them account for the employee churn that takes place during complex projects. Different phases require workers with different expertise. Early on, it might need concrete experts. Later, it will need ones that can install road signs or toll booths.

Some jobs may last days. Others could last years. Some might require part-timers, while others need full-timers.

The ""full-time equivalent"" measure counts a single position as a bundle of workers who, when you add up their hours, work what amounts to full-time. It could be a single person who works 40 hours a week or, say, four workers who put in 10 hours each.

One ""person-year of full-time equivalent employment,"" or one ""job year,"" is one year’s worth of work by a full-time equivalent.  

We ruled the Atlanta streetcar jobs figures False. Although the construction figures were close to the mark, the claim that it will take an estimated 460 jobs to run the streetcar was inflated. In fact, it would take 23 positions to run the streetcar over 20 years. Their jobs figure was 20 times too high.

Now, back to the Northwest Corridor. Construction takes place over four years, so a single job that lasts four years counts as four job years. This means that if all workers stay on for all four years, the actual number of people employed would be one quarter of GDOT’s 5,200 estimate.

But if workers come and go as they do in a more typical construction project, the number could be higher. Let’s say it takes one worker nine months to finish the job of pouring concrete. He leaves, and another joins for three months to paint stripes on the road. Bundled together, these two workers equal a single job year.

Now, GDOT says that the project was estimated to create some 9,700 jobs, not 5,200 jobs. The rest come from ""indirect"" and ""induced"" economic impacts.

Indirect jobs are the result of spending on materials for the project, such as steel or rebar. Induced jobs are created when workers use their wages to buy a cheeseburger or a Lady Gaga album.  

Add these job years to the construction ones and you get about 9,700 -- the figure GDOT used.

How do we rule?

The typical person thinks of ""jobs"" as actual positions or hires, not job years, indirect jobs or induced jobs. So when GDOT announces that their project creates about 9,700 jobs, they’re giving voters an inflated sense of the actual projections.

GDOT could have said the Northwest Corridor project is expected to create what amounts to 5,225 full-time jobs across Georgia over four years, plus an additional 4,480 with the increased spending the project creates.

Or they could say construction is expected to created the equivalent of 1,190 full-time jobs in the first year, for a total of 5,225 over four years.

None of these descriptions are as succinct as GDOT’s claim that that the Northwest Corridor highway project ""is expected to create over 9,700 jobs statewide."" But they do give a more complete sense of Georgia State’s actual projection.

GDOT’s jobs figure is based on legitimate, commonly-used economic measures, but the agency presents the data in a misleading way. Their press release makes non-experts think thousands more people will find full-time construction work than actual estimates suggest.  

We therefore rule GDOT’s jobs claim False.","[('Georgia Department of Transportation, ""Ga.

"['Ohio', 'Infrastructure', 'Tim Ryan']","
Rep. Tim Ryan says China and India outspend U.S. on infrastructure
","
As the House of Representatives discussed funding the nation’s energy and water development projects last month, Niles Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan waded into the debate to tout the need for investment in high-speed rail, highways, bridges, dams, ports and sewers, as a way to preserve the nation’s global competitiveness.

""This is the dirty little secret here in Washington, D.C.,"" Ryan said as he wrapped up his floor speech. ""We’re only spending 2 percent of our GDP on our infrastructure, while China and India are spending 10 percent of their GDP reinvesting back into their country. We will lose the future if we do not make these investments.""

PolitiFact always wants to probe Washington’s dirty little secrets, so we thought we’d check the numbers behind Ryan’s assertion that China and India spend disproportionately more on infrastructure than the United States does.

When we asked Ryan’s office where he got his statistics, his spokesman pointed us to a pair of articles that ran earlier this year in The Economist. The first, titled ""Life in the slow lane,"" claims the United States has grown stingier with infrastructure spending since the days when it funded transcontinental railroad construction and built the interstate highway system.
.
""Total public spending on transport and water infrastructure has fallen steadily since the 1960s and now stands at 2.4% of GDP,"" the article says. ""Europe, by contrast, invests 5% of GDP in its infrastructure, while China is racing into the future at 9%.""

For data on India, Ryan’s office cited a July 21 Economist piece titled ""India’s economy, the half-finished revolution."" It quotes Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya predicting that India’s infrastructure spending will ""still be an adequate 8% of GDP this fiscal year."" The article goes on to say that India’s government wants that share to rise to 10 percent over the next five years.

The numbers in those articles don’t precisely match Ryan’s, though they bolster his contention that China and India emphasize infrastructure more than the United States does. We turned to other sources to see if we could confirm Ryan’s statistics on the proportion of Gross Domestic Product that each country spends on infrastructure. All the statistics that we found backed up The Economist’s reporting, although we were not able to find all three countries’ data for a single year, so comparisons aren’t  ""apples to apples.""

To obtain U.S. figures, we consulted the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. According to a November 2010 report titled ""Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure,"" the United States spent $356 billion, or  2.4 percent of its gross domestic product, on infrastructure in 2007, the last year for which statistics were available. That matches the number cited by The Economist, and is close to the 2 percent figure that Ryan cited, though it’s not  exact.

For India’s statistics, we found a January 2011 report from the Indian government’s Secretariat for Infrastructure, which said that the India wants investment in its physical infrastructure to reach about 9 percent of GDP by 2011-2012. Tables in the report projected the number would actually be 8.37. The report estimated that India spent nearly 8 percent of its gross domestic product on infrastructure in 2010-2011, and 7.51 percent in 2009-2010. The number was 5.71 in 2006-2007 and 6.44 percent in 2007-2008. Those numbers approximate The Economist’s statistics, though they don’t reach the 10 percent cited by Ryan . All exceed the 2.4 percent ratio of GDP that CBO says the U.S. spent on infrastructure in 2007.

To get statistics on China, we examined a 2009 United Nations University research paper on infrastructure spending. It says that China spent 9 percent of its GDP on infrastructure in 2006 -  the most recent year for which it had statistics - and that India spent 3.6 percent. That number echoes The Economist’s data, and falls somewhat short of Ryan’s 10 percent figure.

Ryan’s makes a solid point that China and India outspend the United States on infrastructure, though he inflated the amount that Asia spends, and slightly understated the U.S. amount. But his exaggeration wasn’t enough to push him statement into false territory, so we rate his statement Mostly True.","[('\nThe Economist, ""America’s transport infrastructure: life in the slow lane,"" \xa0April 28, 2011\n\nThe Economist, India’s economy, the half-finished revolution,"" July 21, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure, November 2010\n\nSecretariat for Infrastructure, Planning Commission, Government of India, Investment in Infrastructure during the Eleventh Five Year Plan, January 2011\n\nUnited Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research, Economic Reforms and Infrastructure Spending, Evidence from China and India, by Pinaki Chakraborty and Yan Zhang, August 2009\n\xa0', 'https://www.economist.com/node/18620944')]",/factchecks/2011/aug/10/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-says-china-and-india-outspend-us-infr/
"['Georgia', 'Candidate Biography', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich: Twitter account has 1.3 million followers
 ","
The 2012 presidential race has thus far been filled with weighty subjects like unemployment, federal spending and America’s military interests in the Middle East.

But in the Web world, one big presidential issue that surfaced recently was whether Republican candidate and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s seemingly sizable Twitter following is legit.

The Gingrich campaign had to defend its candidate after the website Gawker published an article reporting that most of his 1.3 million Twitter followers are fake.

Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond, in Twitter-like speed, denied the claim.

""Gawker gaffed, hoodwinked their readers and insulted 1.3 million of Newt’s [Twitter followers],"" Hammond told the New York Daily News.

We were curious about Gingrich’s claim since he’s talked about his Twitter following to make a case that his campaign has a strong pulse. Politico reported a few weeks ago that Gingrich’s Twitter following far exceeded his Republican rivals, and even Sarah Palin, who frequently uses social media to spread her message. Gingrich, a former Georgia congressman, bragged about the Politico piece in a recent interview with the Marietta Daily Journal.

""It turned out I have six times as many Twitter followers as all the other candidates combined,"" Gingrich told the Marietta Daily Journal.

Politicians, some better than others, have been capitalizing on the social networking site where messages cannot exceed 140 characters as a faster way to engage supporters and potential voters and to weigh in on various issues. Gingrich embraced Twitter long before most political figures (he’s sent more than 2,700 tweets). Just a handful of American political figures, such as President Barack Obama, former Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have more Twitter followers than Gingrich.

But Gawker cited an anonymous former Gingrich staffer who estimated about 80 percent of the followers were created by agencies that are inactive or dummy accounts. But others also have picked apart Gingrich’s Twitter following.

The New York-based Web search index company PeekYou said it had done its own analysis of Gingrich’s Twitter account before the Gawker article surfaced. PeekYou CEO Michael Hussey said the company concluded only 8 percent of his Twitter followers were confirmed as ""real human beings."" The rest, he said, didn’t have real locations, used questionable names to register their Twitter accounts and/or didn’t have any other presence online.

""We noticed a lot of the stuff out there are not actual people,"" said Hussey, a self-proclaimed Libertarian.

Hussey said the other Republican presidential candidates all had a higher percentage of Twitter followers who could be confirmed. The range was from 27 to 32 percent.

Some companies will offer coupons to people to follow various social media accounts, said Amy Bruckman, an associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing.

Hussey pointed us to eBay, where people can pay companies to help them gather more Twitter followers (about $12.99 per 1,000). He’s dubious about many of these companies. He said their Twitter followers are often fake -- they use an illegitimate e-mail account.

Hammond, the Gingrich spokesman, has strongly denied the campaign has used such tactics.

With the ability of some companies to create fake accounts, does this mean that Lady Gaga, the queen of Twitter, doesn’t truly have 12.2 million followers?

""She might have [some phony followers],"" Hussey said.

The Gingrich camp has noted that the candidate is on Twitter’s list of suggested users. Some estimates say being on that list can result in an additional 500 Twitter followers a day.

Another group of researchers conducted a sample study of the Twitter followings of some of the GOP presidential candidates; Palin and Obama. The Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research looked at five categories, such as the percentage of users who never tweeted and didn’t have a profile biography.

In each category, Gingrich had the highest percentage of Twitter followers who didn’t have such information in each field. They found 33 percent of Gingrich followers never tweeted. Palin was second with 17 percent of followers who never tweeted. Obama was third at 10 percent.

About three-quarters of Gingrich followers didn’t have a profile biography. Palin and Obama were second and third, respectively, with 54 percent and 48 percent of their followers who didn’t have a profile biography. In their defense, Obama, Gingrich and Palin have the highest supposed number of Twitter followers, so it’s logical that they have a larger percentage of suspect Twitter accounts.

The Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, which is part of Indiana University, said it randomly sampled 5,000 Twitter followers of each candidate.

PolitiFact Georgia looked at 1,000 Gingrich Twitter followers and found 27 percent of them had no picture, had never tweeted and little to no profile information. Many others with pictures had no profile information.

Some social media experts note that there are well-intentioned people who join Twitter but wind up sending few or no tweets and don’t set up a profile picture. Still, Bruckman, the Georgia Tech professor, is dubious that all of Gingrich’s Twitter followers are real.

""His sheer number of followers seems out of proportion to his standing in the polls,""  said Bruckman, who’s been at school since 1997 and once talked with Gingrich about social networking. ""Those numbers should be correlated.""

In response to our questions, Hammond sent us a press release that says Twitter is solely responsible for each Twitter user’s legitimacy.

""We will now return to our efforts to confront the president about his inability to create jobs for the American economy. Thank you,"" it ended.

So, does Newt Gingrich have about 1.3 million Twitter followers? Twitter still lists the candidate as having 1.3 million followers. The Gingrich camp said the Gawker article was an insult to those followers.

But as we and others found, there is strong evidence that not all of these followers are real. There are Twitter followers and there are bona fide Twitter followers. Gingrich has 1.3 million of the former, not so many of the latter.

We rate the campaign’s claim as Mostly False.","[('\nMarietta Daily Journal, ""Gingrich: I’m not giving up,"" July 31, 2011', 'http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/14902000/article-Gingrich--I-m-not-giving-up?'), ('\nGawker, ""Most of Newt Gingrich’s Twitter followers are fake,"" Aug. 1, 2011\n\nCNN.com, ""Gingrich: Twitter followers aren’t fake,"" Aug. 3, 2011\n\nCenter for Complex Networks and Systems Research, ""Profile of the 2012 Presidential Candidates’ Twitter Followers,"" accessed Aug. 5, 2011\n\nE-mail from Newt Gingrich spokesman R.C.

"['New Jersey', 'Energy', 'Nuclear', 'Tom Kean ']","
Former Gov. Tom Kean says he built the last nuclear power plant in the state and the country
","
Former Gov. Tom Kean recently claimed he ""built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country.""

The remark, published in an Aug. 1 question-and-answer column in The Star-Ledger, was in response to the question: ""Hearings began this week on Gov. Christie’s new energy plan, which includes a nuclear component. Realistically, do you think New Jersey would accept a new nuclear plant?""

Kean, a Republican, replied: ""I built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country. It wasn’t easy politically, but Republicans and Democrats got together and acted for the future of the state. It’s almost impossible to rely totally on fossil fuels, as of now, there are not enough alternatives. If we want efficient, cheap, nonpolluting energy, we may have to accept a new plant.""

But did Kean really build the last nuclear power plant in the state and the nation?

He’s right about New Jersey, but wrong about the country -- though it’s worth noting that during his tenure as governor, one of the last nuclear power plants of its kind to be built in the United States started commercial operations.

New Jersey is home to four nuclear power plants.

The Oyster Creek plant in Lacey Township in Ocean County is operated by Illinois-based Exelon Generation. PSEG Nuclear, a subsidiary of PSEG Power, operates the other three plants -- Salem 1, Salem 2 and the Hope Creek Generating Station, all of which are in the same complex in Lower Alloways Creek Township in Salem County.

Hope Creek and Oyster Creek are two of 23 boiling water reactors in the United States with General Electric Mark I containment systems --  similar to the ones at Japan’s ill-fated Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which sparked a nuclear crisis after it sustained damage from a massive earthquake in March.  

Kean told PolitiFact New Jersey he was referring to Hope Creek and said he was basing his statement on a conversation he had with an expert at a nuclear conference he recently attended. But data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission shows -- and a spokesman for the agency confirmed -- that Hope Creek wasn’t the last nuclear plant built in the nation.

According to data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a construction permit for Hope Creek was issued on Nov. 4, 1974.

Joe Delmar, spokesman for PSEG Nuclear, said actual ""shovel in the ground"" construction began in 1976. In July 1986 --  during the beginning of Kean’s second gubernatorial term -- an operating license was issued for the plant and commercial operations began there that December, according to the federal nuclear agency’s data.

Construction hasn’t started on any new nuclear power plants in New Jersey since -- though PSEG Power and PSEG Nuclear have submitted an application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review whether its Salem County site could support another nuclear power plant.

Now, let’s take a look at nuclear power plants throughout the country.

Because Kean took office in 1982, after construction had begun on Hope Creek, we’re only going to focus on nuclear power plants that started commercial operations after Hope Creek.

Of 104 nuclear power plants in operation in the U.S., 19 started operating commercially after Hope Creek, according to federal data.

The last reactor to start commercial operations in the United States is the Watts Bar nuclear plant in Tennessee in 1996.

Scott Burnell, spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates Watts Bar, has had a valid construction permit for a second reactor at the same location, and has applied for an operating license. The federal agency expects to have a final decision on that application next year, Burnell said.

Back to Kean’s statement.

The former governor said he ""built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country.""

Hope Creek was completed during Kean’s tenure and it is the last nuclear plant built in New Jersey. So he’s right there.

But, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Hope Creek isn’t the last nuclear power plant to be built in the United States.

Kean would be correct if he had said he built one of the last nuclear power plants of its kind in the United States. But he didn’t specify, so we rate the statement Half True.

Jim DeMint says the debt-ceiling bill won't actually cut the national debt
","
After the agonizingly drawn-out negotiations to raise the federal debt ceiling, Americans may be forgiven for thinking that the enacted legislation will actually result in lower federal debt. But Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., says that such a view is mistaken.
   
""This bill doesn’t cut the debt,"" DeMint, a leading fiscal conservative, told The State newspaper. ""It will add about $7 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years on the backs of our children and grandchildren. This bill doesn’t stop deficit spending. It locks in trillion-dollar spending deficits for years to come.""

A reader asked us to check DeMint’s claim that the bill ""doesn't cut the debt,"" so we did.  
In the big picture, we found that the bill does slow the rate of growth in the debt. But we also found that the debt still rockets upward in absolute terms due to a tide of prior spending commitments. 
But we'll also note that arithmetic is only part of it: DeMint's phrasing is also somewhat off-base. He attributes the increase in the debt over the next 10 years to the bill itself, when, in fact, it is a result of the bill's inaction in curbing spending commitments already set in motion. A fine point, perhaps, but one that we think is worth pointing out. 
We'll return to this issue in a moment. First, let's take a look at the numbers. 
Doing so is tougher than it sounds, since budget experts said there is no debt estimate for 2021 that you can simply point to -- you have to estimate it from scratch. With the help of Marc Goldwein, policy director of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, we were able to navigate the spreadsheet jungle and put together these calculations, some of which we rounded for simplicity. 
First, here's our starting point for measuring the debt in 2021
   
We start with a Congressional Budget Office’s estimate from March -- long before the debt deal was signed -- of the ""baseline"" for publicly held debt in 2021, in table 1-5 of this CBO document: About $18 trillion. (All the figures we are listing here assume a 10-year extension of the policies listed.) 
Next, we adjust for other policies that are expected to reduce or increase that debt figure over the next decade 
• Subtract the approximate savings from the appropriations bill passed in March ($122 billion) plus interest savings (more than $24 billion), listed on the final page of this CBO document: Reduction of about $150 billion, leaving $17.85 trillion.
   
• Subtract savings from the military draw-down in Iraq and Afghanistan, including interest savings, listed in table 1-7 of this CBO document: Reduction of about $1.37 trillion, leaving $16.48 trillion.
   
• Add the cost of extending the George W. Bush tax cuts and adjusting the Alternative Minimum Tax ($3.82 trillion) plus interest ($795 billion), listed in table 1-7 of this CBO document: Addition of $4.62 trillion, making the running total $21.1 trillion.
   
• Add the cost of avoiding scheduled reductions in Medicare physician reimbursements, commonly known as the ""Doc Fix"" ($298 billion for a 10-year freeze) plus interest ($60 billion), in row one of table 3 of this CBO document: Addition of approximately $360 billion, making the running total -- or how much the debt was expected to grow before the debt deal -- roughly $21.5 trillion. 
Next, we subtract the 2011 debt 
DeMint was talking about how the debt would increase over ""the next 10 years,"" which is from 2012 to 2021. Take the running total of $21.5 trillion -- the estimated debt in 2021 -- and subtract the debt for 2011 ($10.4 trillion), as listed in table 1-5 in this CBO document, meaning that the increase in debt from 2012 to the end of 2021 is an estimated $11.1 trillion. 
Finally, we determine how much the debt deal changed this number 
Subtract the savings from the debt ceiling deal that are slated to accrue between 2012 and 2021 ($2.12 trillion), leaving roughly $9 trillion.
   
So by this calculation, DeMint actually underestimates the growth in the debt over 10 years -- it could be as much as $9 trillion in additional debt rather than $7 trillion. And that only strengthens DeMint’s point that ""this bill doesn’t cut the debt.""
   
We should note some caveats with our estimate. Most notably, Congress and the president could decide to cut back more aggressively than the deficit deal requires -- for instance, through a bigger military draw-down or allowing the upper-income Bush tax cuts to expire in 2012. That would reduce the additional debt accrued -- but even if that happens, DeMint still has a nice cushion for his estimate.

We should also explain that the cuts envisioned in the debt-ceiling deal are real -- they just won’t make that much of a dent in a debt that’s growing rapidly due to increases in spending on items such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as interest for previously accrued debt.

So DeMint’s numbers are actually a cautious estimate -- our math suggests that the debt could continue to grow by as much as $9 trillion. Since the senator’s main point was to warn people that the debt-ceiling deal ""doesn’t cut the debt,"" even his low-ball estimate amply supports his point.

However, as we noted, there’s a problem with how DeMint phrased his statement. Technically, the debt that will be added is not a result of the debt ceiling bill itself, as DeMint indicated. The bill didn’t ""add about $7 trillion in new debt,"" as he put it -- instead, it fails to stop that debt from being added.

We understood what DeMint’s point was -- and thought it was a valid one -- but at PolitiFact, one of our guiding principles is that ""words matter."" In this case, DeMint was wrong to say that the debt ceiling bill itself added to the debt, but he was right in his point that, despite passage of the bill, debt will continue to grow. For that reason we rate his statement Mostly False.","[('\nThe State, ""S.C. senators: Debt deal misses target,"" Aug. 3, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, analysis of the debt-ceiling deal, Aug. 1, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, ""The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2011 to 2021,"" January 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, ""An Analysis of the President’s Budgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2012,"" April 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, ""Extrapolation of Full-Year Appropriations for 2011,"" May 16, 2011\n\nCongressional Budget Office, ""Medicare’s Payments to Physicians: The Budgetary Impact of Alternative Policies,"" June 16, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Marc Goldwein, policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Aug. 5, 2011', 'http://www.thestate.com/2011/08/03/1920546/sc-senators-debt-deal-misses-target.html'), ('\nE-mail interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, Aug. 5, 2011', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2011/aug/08/jim-demint/jim-demint-says-debt-ceiling-bill-wont-actually-cu/

Huntsman says the U.S. Constitution is the oldest
","
As he toured New Hampshire last week, Jon Huntsman wore his patriotism like a lapel pin.

Even as he condemned President Barack Obama over what he labeled failed policies and leadership, Huntsman, the former Republican governor of Utah, saluted the American work ethic and the United States Constitution, which he touted as the world’s oldest.

""We've got some great things going for us here that we forget sometimes,"" Huntsman told workers during an August 2, 2011 tour of Cirtronics Corp., a manufacturing firm in Milford, New Hampshire. ""We have rule of law. We have the longest surviving constitution. … What we don't have is leadership.""

The rule of law in America is hard to question, and as for presidential leadership, we'll leave that to the candidates to debate. But, does America really have the world's longest surviving Constitution? That sounded like a question for PolitiFact.

To start, we went straight to the source, the National Constitution Center, located on Independence Mall in Philadelphia.

At 222 years old, America’s governing document is broadly considered the world’s longest surviving constitution, according to Dr. Steven Frank, the Constitution Center’s chief historian.

Ratified in 1789, it beats out Norway’s constitution, which took effect in 1814 and Belgium's, implemented in 1831, according to a list compiled by Tom Ginsburg and Rosalind Dixon, constitutional law professors at the University of Chicago.

""It's the most durable constitution in the world today,"" said Frank, of the Constitution Center. ""Historians agree. It's been around longer than any other written constitution.""

But, that left us to wonder, what constitutes a constitution?

The definition of the term is a significant question in political theory, according to Ginsburg, the University of Chicago law professor. But the term is loosely defined as a collection of laws or governing statutes that ""sets fundamental norms about the structure of government and its relationship with citizens,"" Ginsburg wrote in an e-mail. He also serves as one of the lead investigators for the Comparative Constitutions Project, a research project launched at the University of Illinois to analyze governing documents around the world.

In their study, project researchers have found that enduring constitutions are usually made easy to amend to allow for growth and re-interpretation, Ginsburg said, and they are typically written by large cross-sections of people to encompass many points of view.

""The funny thing is, the things which make constitutions endure aren't really found in the U.S. one,"" he said, pointing out that the United States Constitution was written by 100 rich, white men. ""It seems to be very exceptional, the reason it endures.""

Elsewhere around the globe, many countries don’t follow a single constitution but instead operate under what historians call a ""multi-text approach,"" in which national laws are based on different documents and statutes, many of which pre-date the United States Constitution.

The United Kingdom, for instance, derives its constitution from a large number of documents, including the Magna Carta, which dates back to 1297, according to Jef Ruchti, editor-in-chief of World Constitutions Illustrated, a publication of William S. Hein, & Co.

""All told, it is traditional to consider that the U.S. Constitution is the oldest surviving one-document constitutional text. However, the others models do outdate it,"" Ruchti wrote in an e-mail. ""And that is not even getting into the continuing debate as to whether the form of government of the Iroquois Nations had an impact on the writing of the U.S. Constitution or not.""

The republic of San Marino  is often considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect. The republic, an enclave surrounded by Italy, has no formal constitution, but instead is governed by the Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini, a series of six books, written in Latin in the late 16th Century that dictates the country’s political system, among other matters.

Our ruling:

Historians and legal scholars alike may debate the definition, but most of us are clear in our concept of a constitution as a single governing document. As long as that’s the case, there is little room for argument. The U.S. Constitution is the longest surviving constitution in the world. Still, there are other countries that have multiple governing documents that are older than the U.S. Constitution.

We rate Huntsman’s claim Mostly True.

George LeMieux attacks Adam Hasner's ""over $92.2 million in earmarks""
","
Adam Hasner, fake conservative? That's the contention being made by George LeMieux, as the two Republicans vie for the GOP nomination to take on incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. 
LeMieux, a former U.S. senator, is challenging Hasner, a former Florida House majority leader, on two core issues: taxes and spending. 
LeMieux campaign e-mails and Web posts on Aug. 1, 2011, show a cartoon Hasner wearing a joker hat and holding a mask in his hand. He is attending his own ""masquerade ball"" — one where he’s only pretending to be conservative.

""The Masquerade Ball gown Hasner has chosen on the key issues of taxes and spending is a prime example. Hasner’s rhetoric simply does not match his record. Hasner’s record includes:

• Increasing Spending – A 40% increase during his time in the legislature.
• Requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks.
• Billions in new taxes and fees.
• Voting to accept Obama stimulus money.""

The earmark claim caught our eye. Hasner, elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2002, served as majority leader from 2008-10 before term limits ended his run. That means plenty of time to rack up requests for pet projects. But did he request ""over $92.2 million in earmarks""? And if he did, how did that compare with requests by other lawmakers?

A more detailed look at Hasner’s record at GeorgeForFlorida.com clarifies the LeMieux campaign was talking about Florida’s twist on the earmark, the ""Community Budget Issue Request."" As we’ve written in other ""earmark"" fact-checks, it’s a way state legislators use to request funding for local projects. Lawmakers had to file requests — for a local park, say, or a new community wastewater system — and attach their names to each one. 

The Legislature stopped the practice in 2009 as budgets got tighter. But the Florida House keeps an archive of such requests, funded and unfunded, at FloridaHouse.gov.

A PolitiFact Florida analysis of lawmakers’ requests from 2003-08 shows Hasner indeed made use of CBIRs to ask for state funding for everything from a community child care center in Delray Beach ($25,000) to support for a medical cluster and research institute in the Miami area ($20 million). He requested $1 million for ""manatee avoidance technology,"" made regular requests on behalf of brain injury prevention efforts among seniors ($199,450) and asked for taxpayer aid for drainage improvements, boardwalk replacements and reclaimed water systems.

Over six years, his requests total just over $92.2 million.

We’ll mention that the archive doesn’t make it clear which projects ultimately won funding, and indeed some requests may have been made year after year precisely because they failed to attract lawmaker support. 
Rep. Adam Hasner’s Community Budget Issue Requests 2003-08
  

That means the amount of local funding Hasner requested for his district was in the bottom half of lawmakers in four out of six years, though it jumped to the 60th percentile in 2006, the year before he served as deputy majority leader, and the 86th percentile in 2007, the year before he took the top seat.

But even in 2007, the amount Hasner requested was eclipsed by top CBIR filers, such as Rep. Marti Coley, R-Marianna, who wanted $202.3 million for projects in her district — nearly four times Hasner’s total.

A couple of other notes. 

First, we feel we should at least mention that LeMieux has a record of voting for earmarks while he was in the U.S. Senate. LeMieux, who hadn’t held elected office before he was appointed to U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez’s seat in 2009 by his former boss, Gov. Charlie Crist, has claimed he never requested a single earmark. But he didn’t have to: Earmarks bound for Florida were already packed into appropriations bills before LeMieux took over for Martinez. LeMieux voted for several such bills. He also actively lobbied for local stimulus projects. Later, he voted for a moratorium to ban federal earmarks through 2013 — but so did Sen. Bill Nelson.

Meanwhile, as the Florida economy faltered, Hasner cut his own local funding requests in 2008 to a single item — $385,000. That put him last among more than 100 lawmakers who made local funding requests. And he was in the leadership when the decision was made to stop such requests altogether. Hasner’s campaign, for the record, thinks it’s unfair to call Community Budget Issue Requests ""earmarks,"" which campaign spokesman Douglass Mayer said evokes last-minute congressional handshake deals.

""The difference here is transparency,"" Mayer said. ""CBIRs are submitted with full accountability and voted on in the light of day. Earmarks are snuck in the backdoor of the federal budget process to avoid accountability.""

But CBIRs are often referred to as Florida’s version of the earmark, and documentation from the LeMieux campaign makes the reference clear. 

Where does this leave us?

LeMieux’s campaign says that ""(Adam) Hasner’s record includes … requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks."" On the numbers, LeMieux is right -- from 2003-08 Hasner requested $92.2 million for projects through a process called Community Budget Issue Requests. But we think there are a couple of caveats worth noting. 
First is the CBIR process itself -- which was open and transparent. Legislators made requests for dollars in writing and were forced to explain what the money would be used for. Second, it's important to note that Hasner wasn't particularly aggressive in requesting money through CBIRs and more than 100 House members asked for more than he did in 2008. Lastly, it strikes us as hypocritical for LeMieux to attack competitors over earmarks when his own record — where it exists — shows votes and personal lobbying for local spending.

State Sen. Tim Grendell claims more water flows into Lake Erie than flows out
","
Who knew water could be so political?

It's happened this year in Ohio as a debate over how to best use -- or not use -- the fresh water supplies of Lake Erie and the Great Lakes as a whole has raged in the hallways of the Ohio Statehouse.

The debate has focused on House Bill 231, a piece of legislation that was supposed to implement the eight-state Great Lakes Compact that Ohio agreed to be a part of in 2008. The legislation was approved by the General Assembly, but then vetoed July 15, 2011, by Gov. John Kasich.

Environmental groups as well as former Govs. Bob Taft and George Voinovich have fought the legislation, saying it allows businesses to use too much water without permits and could cause Lake Erie water levels to drop, leaving it  prone to algae problems.

Leading the charge for the legislation has been Sen. Tim Grendell, a Chesterland Republican, who has used a steady stream of statistics about water flowing in and out of Lake Erie to suggest that criticisms are overblown.
 
On June 28, before the Ohio Senate voted, Grendell gave a floor speech in support of the bill that suggested Lake Erie takes in more water than the amount that flows out. In fact, Lake Erie actually had a surplus of water, therefore diminishing the arguments of those concerned about water withdrawals made by businesses, Grendell claimed.

""You might be surprised to know that 137 billion gallons flows in every day,"" Grendell said. ""You might be surprised to know that only 86.3 billion gallons flow out. . . . Leaving us a net surplus of approximately 50 billion gallons a day.""

We were surprised to hear more water was flowing into Lake Erie than flowing out. So we decided to check and see if Grendell's figures were high and dry.

Grendell told us that he got his information about the water flowing into the lake  from the Ohio Environmental Council, which in turn got it from a May 2009 summary of a draft report of the International Upper Great Lakes Study prepared by the International Joint Commission.

He said he got his information about the water flowing out from U.S. Geological Survey official Dick Bartz as well as from an unnamed expert with the New York state parks who calculated the amount that flows over Niagara Falls. The expert was contacted by an aide to Rep. Jim Buchy, according to an e-mail Grendell gave to Politifact Ohio. The aide, Justin Barnhart, said the expert was actually Angela Berti, marketing and public affairs coordinator for New York’s state office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, which operates the U.S. side of Niagara Falls.

We dug out the summary of the draft report from the International Upper Great Lakes Study. We quickly found the key document section. But the numbers in the report are measured in cubic meters per second and in thousands of cubic feet per second. In order to convert those numbers into gallons per day, we needed some math help, as we were clearly out of our depth. (Hard to fathom, we know.).

So we turned to Bartz, the U.S. Geological Survey official who was a former Chief of the Division of Water of ODNR under Gov. Taft.

Bartz calculated the numbers in the report to show that about 137 billion gallons of water flows into Lake Erie from the Detroit River and from runoff to the lake and smaller tributaries. That's exactly the number Grendell used on the Senate floor.

So Grendell was right on how much flows in?

Not so fast. There is also about 16.8 billion gallons worth of rainfall that make it into the lake, according to Bartz's calculation of the report's numbers. So the average daily total amount of water flowing into Lake Erie is about 154 billion gallons.

To figure how much flowed out of the lake each day, Grendell took a pair of calculations that Bartz did for evaporation (16.8 billion gallons a day) and the amount used by Ohioans each day (3.54 billion gallons a day) and added to them the 66 billion gallons a day that New York’s Berti said flowed over Niagara Falls.

Berti confirmed to us that she gave Buchy’s office ""commonly accepted"" numbers of gallons of water a second that go over the falls collectively known as Niagara Falls. Her gallons per second estimates, taken from the state’s website, work out to 65.5 billion gallons a day.

That math gave Grendell about 86 billion gallons, roughly 50 billion gallons a day less then what he said was flowing into Lake Erie.

However, Bartz said that equation is off.

He agreed that Grendell has accurately quoted him as saying there is 16.8 billion gallons of water evaporation. However, he said the 66 billion gallons that Berti calculated flowed over Niagara Falls doesn’t equal all the water that flows from Lake Erie into Lake Ontario.

Bartz said that along with the 66 billion gallons a day that Berti calculated are huge amounts of water diverted to power plants above the falls and then discharged back into Lake Ontario below the falls. In all, Bartz said about 131.8 billion gallons of water flow into Lake Ontario from Lake Erie both over the falls and from the diversions to power plants. Additionally, Bartz calculated that about 5.8 billion gallons of water are diverted by a pair of canals, the Welland Canal in Ontario and the New York State Barge Canal.

Bartz said most of the water that Ohioans use every day eventually makes its way back into the Lake Erie basin so it’s not a key number to use in the equation.

Add it all up -- the water over Niagara Falls, the water diverted around Niagara Falls, the water funneled into two canals canal and the water that evaporates -- and on the average about the same amount of water flows out of Lake Erie as flows into it, Bartz said -- roughly 154 billion gallons a day.

""It's basically about the same,"" Bartz said.

If Grendell's theory were true that more water was flowing into Lake Erie than flowing out that there would be a noticeable effect., Bartz said. ""If there were more coming in than going out we would have seen lake levels rise.""  

Actually, Bartz said Lake Erie water levels were at their highest in the 1970s and have dropped slightly since that time.

So awash in these watery figures, what do we have?

Trying to make his case that Ohio has more water than it could ever use, Grendell asserted that about 137 billion gallons of water a day flowed into Lake Erie and only 86 billion gallons a day flowed out.

However, the acknowledged expert in this area said that Grendell’s math is all wet. The expert calculates the amount of water flowing into lake Erie as roughly the same amount flowing out each day (about 154 billion gallons a day.) If that wasn't the case, we would see a spike in overall Lake Erie water levels rise, which hasn’t happened.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Grendell's claim rates as False.","[('\nInterview with Sen.

Chambliss: Debt ceiling deal creates largest increase in U.S. history
","
The compromise to raise the debt ceiling unleashed bipartisan laments from Capitol Hill lawmakers. One Democrat called it a ""Satan sandwich."" Another grumbled, ""It's evil, or more evil.""

Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss expressed his disappointment with more sober rhetoric. He said he voted against Tuesday’s debt deal because it didn’t do enough to fix the problem.

""I cannot vote for the largest debt-ceiling increase in America’s history without significant assurances that the bill’s proposed spending reductions will actually be realized, and without reforms to the way our government budgets its spending of taxpayer dollars,"" Chambliss said in a press release the day the Senate passed the deal and President Barack Obama signed it.

Is this the ""largest debt ceiling increase in America’s history""? Sounds like a job for the Truth-O-Meter.

Chambliss is a member of the so-called ""Gang of Six,"" which has fought for months for a bipartisan solution to cut the nation’s burgeoning federal debt. They floated a plan last month to end the stalemate on the debt ceiling, but it didn’t go far.

The plan that did pass Tuesday calls for a debt limit increase of up to $2.4 trillion,accompanied by at least $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

PolitiFact Georgia contacted Chambliss’ press office to get evidence backing his claim. A spokeswoman sent us a July 26, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of the U.S. Congress, and a list of debt ceiling increases from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.

Federal laws have limited specific types of debt since 1917, according to the Congressional Research Service. But they did not exist as they do now, as a single limit that covers nearly all debt held by the public, until 1939. The list of debt ceiling increases from the Office of Management and Budget covers 1940 to the present.

If you compare debt ceiling increases by their dollar amount, Chambliss is right. The only increase that rival’s Tuesday’s debt deal is a $1.9 trillion hike in Feb. 2010. A 2003 increase at $984 billion takes third place.

We decided to nose around a little more. From our past research, PolitiFact Georgia knows that when economists talk about the size of the national debt, they often express it as a percent of the nation’s economy, or gross domestic product. This comparison gives a clearer sense of the debt’s scale.

Tuesday’s deal increases the debt limit by up to $2.4 trillion, which amounts to about 16 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.

We found two other occasions where the increase was greater: World War II and the mid-to-late 1970s.

During the 1940s, the cost of the massive war effort pushed debt limit increases to higher than 47 percent of GDP.

The 1970s increases were blips. During these years, the debt limit spiked repeatedly, peaking at more than 17.9 percent of GDP. In these instances, debt limits expired and returned to prior, much lower amounts. After a few days, Congress restored them to levels only slightly higher than the expired limits.

How do we rule?

Chambliss is correct by one measure -- the dollar amount of debt limit increase. He wasn’t that far off by another -- debt limit increases by percentage of GDP.

In the case of this second measure, the only times the debt limit rose by an amount that exceeded this year’s increase were the result of highly unusual situations: a world war and legislative blips.  

We won’t count the ‘70s data against Chambliss as they resulted in small overall increases. But since Chambliss missed out on World War II, we’ll give him a Mostly True.  ","[('\nU.S. Sen.
