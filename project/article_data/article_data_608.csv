Issa says oil royalties trail only taxes in generating revenue for the federal government
","The major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has focused attention on a low-profile federal office and how it manages offshore oil leases.In a May 4, 2010, interview with MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., suggested that there may be a conflict of interest between the government's reliance on revenue from oil leases and its need to be a tough regulator. He focused on the Minerals Management Service, an office within the Interior Department that handles royalties, rents and other revenues from oil, natural gas and coal on federal land or in federal waters.""MMS can't be all things to all people,"" said Issa, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""It should come out from underneath the Department of Interior. It should be like the IRS, responsible for revenue generation and for reporting. And the Department of Interior needs to be very, very diligent in protecting our wildlife, our wetlands, and all of our natural resources.""Issa added, ""I think it's a unique conflict of interest when you're dealing with two critical areas, the safety to the environment and the revenue. This is the second-largest revenue source to the federal government after the IRS. So it's very clear, the stakes are high. This is an organization that brings in enough revenue to pale by comparison any procurement officer"" at the Defense Department.We won't take a position on Issa's larger points about how well MMS is protecting the interests of the American taxpayer or whether a conflict of interest exists, since those are matters of opinion. But we do think it's worthwhile looking at whether Issa's right that the money flowing into MMS represents the second-largest stream of federal income behind tax revenue collected by the Internal Revenue Service.First, let's look at how much money MMS brings in.For the most recent year -- 2009 -- MMS says it received $7.6 billion in combined royalties for oil, natural gas and coal, plus roughly $2.3 billion more in other revenues, for a total of $9.9 billion.Because of accounting quirks, figuring out which other non-IRS revenue streams are bigger than that is trickier, but we did find a number of revenue sources collected by agencies other than IRS that seemed to qualify:• Deposit of earnings from the Federal Reserve System (deposited by the Fed): $34.3 billion • Alcohol and tobacco taxes (collected by the Treasury Deptartment's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Bureau): $22.7 billion • Customs duties (collected by Customs and Border Protection): $21.3 billion• Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insurance premiums and recoveries (collected by the FDIC): $20.5 billion• Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund (collected by the Commerce Department): $16.7 billion• Energy sales by the Tennessee Valley Authority (collected by TVA): $11.1 billion This would rank MMS no higher than eighth among entities generating revenue for the government. Some experts we talked to suggested a few other revenue sources, but others disagreed, so we've erred on the side of caution and left them out of our rankings. These include stamps and other fees collected by the U.S. Postal Service ($69 billion) and Medicare premiums, which are withheld from checks cut by the Social Security Administration ($57 billion).Because the volatile pricetag of oil can affect the size of the government's lease revenues, we also looked at MMS figures for 2008, when oil prices were at historical highs.In 2008, MMS collected a substantially larger amount -- $24.1 billion. But that was still exceeded by two other revenue streams beyond the IRS -- $33.6 billion from the Fed and $26 billion in customs duties collected by CBP. So while MMS ranked higher in 2008 -- fourth rather than eighth -- it still wasn't as high as the second-place Issa ascribed to it.Just to cover our bases, we also checked to see whether mineral revenues have grown as a share of federal receipts in recent years. As expected, they reached their peak in 2008 with just under 1 percent of federal receipts. But other than that year, the percentage has bounced around in a pretty narrow range since 2001, between 0.31 percent and 0.53 percent.A spokesman for Issa, Frederick R. Hill, argued forcefully that Issa was on solid ground.One point Hill made is that Issa ""was referring to net, not gross, revenues that MMS contributes to the federal budget."" In other words, Issa was pointing out that MMS delivered the federal government's second-largest haul of income after substracting operational costs.In our view, that kind of calculation refers to what economists consider ""profit,"" rather than ""revenues,"" which is the word that Issa clearly used. Still, we decided to see what the numbers were when calculated under those rules.According to the Treasury Department, the operational costs for MMS in 2009 were $163 million. So, the margin at MMS was indeed extremely high -- about 98 percent after expenses -- and the net amount collected was about $9.7 billion.It's true that TVA's operational costs wiped out essentially all of its $11.1 billion in energy sales. But several of the other agencies on our list produced margins and revenues that were just as impressive as MMS's. (While budget quirks make it tricky to craft fair comparisons, we'll do our best. )Operational expenses at the Fed were $367 million, meaning a 99 percent margin and almost $34 billion collected for the government. Meanwhile, it cost $99 million to run the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Bureau, producing a 99 percent margin and $22 billion collected.The costs of collecting trade duties is complicated, since duty collection is only one part of the job done by CBP, a $12 billion agency. We made an estimate by combining the budget lines for CBP's administrative operations and its ""border security inspections and trade facilitation at ports of entry"" -- an amount that worked out to $3.9 billion in 2009. That would make CBP's margin 82 percent and its total collections $17.4 billion. Even if that cost estimate is low, it's still comfortably above the amount MMS contributed.Another point Hill made was that some of the other revenue producers did not generate income for general government use but rather to foot the bill for specific uses.On that he's correct -- for instance, the FDIC uses its money to insure banks, and much of the television money is earmarked for digital converter box coupons and interoperable communications equipment grants for first-responders.But a large chunk of MMS's money is spoken for as well. By statute, portions must be distributed to neighboring states, conservation trust funds and Indian tribes. Only about $5.7 billion actually made it to the federal treasury for general purposes in 2009 -- an amount that, if we were to use it instead of the $9.9 billion figure, would push MMS even further down the list of revenue producers for the federal government.We'll grant Issa that this is a complicated fact to hash out during a rapid-fire interview, and we think any error he made in offering this factoid doesn't necessarily undermine his broader argument. We'd go so far as to suggest that Issa would have been perfectly on target if he'd simply said that MMS is ""one of the largest"" revenue sources to the federal government after the IRS. But he added more specificity than the facts justify. So we rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2010/may/06/darrell-issa/issa-says-oil-royalties-trail-only-taxes-generalti/

Gov. Rick Perry says the term 'act of God' is a legal term prevalent in state law
","
Two Texas Republicans have invoked God's ways in dramatic fashion recently. State Rep. Leo Berman of Tyler called Democratic President Barack Obama ""God's punishment on us"" April 24. And this week, Gov. Rick Perry suggested the April 20 British Petroleum oil rig explosion on the Gulf Coast could have been an ""act of God."" 
Perry, speaking Monday at a governors conference about job creation sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, warned that banning offshore drilling could hurt the economy. ""From time to time, there are going to be things that occur that are acts of God that cannot be prevented,"" he said. 
Critics howled that Perry was dismissing the situation's seriousness. A day later, Perry defended the comment. He told reporters: ""Here's what I said, and I think it's an interpretation issue with one reporter, is what I think. If you will go look up the definition of 'act of God,' we've used it in legal terms for a long time in this state and the — nobody knows what happened, and I said that in my remarks, that there were, you know, a lot of speculation. It could have been an act of God, it could have been, you know, who knows?"" 
Texas law works in mysterious ways? 
Barron's Law Dictionary defines ""Act of God"" as the ""manifestation of the forces of nature which are unpredictable and difficult to anticipate; 'the result of the direct and immediate and exclusive forces of nature, uncontrolled or uninfluenced by the power of man and without human intervention, [which] is of such character that it could not have been prevented or avoided by foresight or prudence.' Examples are tempests, lightning, earthquakes and a sudden illness or death of a person."" 
The legalese dates back to Roman law, and judges have since continued to rule that an act of God doesn't depend on divine influence. In 1609, a British court ruled that a fire caused by lightning was an act of God. In 1785, a court ruled a fire not caused by lightning wasn't, according to a 1996 article in the American Journal of Public Health. 
Steve Bickerstaff, an adjunct law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that when someone who has previously expressed a strong religious affiliation — like Perry — calls an oil rig explosion an act of God, it sounds like that person is suggesting the disaster is celestial retribution. Bickerstaff said: ""My first reaction was, 'Oh, no — we're back to God taking revenge on us. But, actually, the term act of God has very prominent historical significance, very commonly used in contracts."" 
Bickerstaff concurred that the term has had historic uses in Texas and the United States, and it's in most contracts, particularly between big businesses. 
Take a house knocked down by an earthquake. Did someone cause that? ""Well, if they didn't build the house adequately according to code and requirements, then yes,"" Bickerstaff said. ""But the earthquake itself is an act in which they have no control."" 
And the oil rig explosion? No way to know yet, Bickerstaff said. ""Was the company negligent? Was it BP, or the company operating the rig? I don't know. Was the system flawed in some way? We don't know."" 
We're not endeavoring to judge, so to speak, whether the rig explosion was an ""act of God."" That said, we quickly found several state laws that use the phrase. 
It's illegal for a railway company to obstruct a street, railroad crossing or public highway for more than five minutes, but ""it's a defense to the prosecution under this section that the train obstructs the street, railroad crossing or public highway because of an act of God or breakdown of the train,"" according to a transportation law that took effect in 1995. 
An insurance carrier isn't liable to pay for an employee's injury if, among other exceptions, the injury ""arose out of an act of God, unless the employment exposes the employee to a greater risk of injury from an act of God than ordinarily applies to the general public,"" according to a 1993 law about workers' compensation. 
An agriculture-related law that took effect in 2003 protects people who violate rules about artificially controlling the weather if they can prove the violation ""was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe."" A law enacted in 1997 similarly protects people who violate certain state water laws. 
Summing up: We're not judging whether the BP explosion was an ""act of God."" That said, Perry's follow-up statement reflects the term's prevalence in law. We rate that statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/may/06/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-oil-rig-explosion-could-have-b/

Anitere Flores says Floridians have sent $3 billion less in taxes
","As they prepared to send next year's $70.4 billion budget to Gov. Charlie Crist, Republican lawmakers said their plan protects important priorities such as education while the state is still emerging from the recession. In a floor speech on the last day of the 2010 legislative session, state Rep. Anitere Flores, the chief education budget writer in the House, noted that per-pupil spending slightly increased this year – despite the tough times.  ""The facts are very clear,"" said Flores, a Republican from Miami. ""We all knew going into this year that we were going to have to cut over $3 billion.  ""At a time when Floridians had less … At a time when Floridians have sent us $3 billion less of their funding, to be able to say that we kept our promise to you guys – funding education – I think it’s something we should be proud of.”  We were curious if she was right about Floridians sending $3 billion less. We contacted her office for clarification but she did not return our calls.  Her underlying point -- that lawmakers had a difficult budget year -- was correct. As lawmakers cobbled together the 2010-11 budget, the deficit -- the difference between state revenues and the money needed to pay for key services -- was $3.2 billion. (If you only include what lawmakers termed the ""critical needs,"" the deficit shrunk to $1.1 billion.)  But the reason for the budget squeeze wasn't because Floridians were sending $3 billion less in tax money. The amount of general revenue actually went up from $21 billion in last year’s budget to $22.9 billion for the new budget -- an 8 percent increase.  That's largely because last year lawmakers balanced the budget by hiking taxes and fees to the tune of $2.2 billion. So contrary to what Flores said, Floridians sent more money to Tallahassee, not less.  In fact, the reason for this year's budget crunch was that expenses -- particularly mandatory ones such as Medicaid -- went up substantially.  The largest built-in cost increase is for Florida's Medicaid system, which serves the poor and disabled. To qualify for federal stimulus money, the state had to keep services at roughly the same level. As the ranks of the poor swelled during the recession, more people were added to Medicaid. Spending on that program jumped $1.8 billion this year, for a total of more than $19 billion.  We should note that the budgets were propped up with stimulus cash from the federal government: $5 billion last year and $2.4 billion this year. But we don't think that's what Flores was referring to when she mentioned the $3 billion reduction. So to recap, looking at the overall budget, it's clear spending has increased. Last year, lawmakers passed a $66.5 billion budget. This year, the spending plan totaled $70.4 billion – almost $4 billion more.  Bottom line: the state can still have a deficit while bringing in more funding, which is just the case this year. Flores misspoke when she said Floridians have sent the government less money. They've done just the opposite. Her statement earns a False. UPDATE: Flores e-mailed PolitiFact after this item was published and said she inartfully worded her statement and meant to refer to the budget shortfall, not the amount of revenue the state brought in.",/factchecks/2010/may/05/anitere-flores/anitere-flores-says-floridians-have-sent-3-billion/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'J.D. Hayworth']","
Rival says he's forced John McCain to drop amnesty for illegal immigrants
","During a recent interview on the Fox Business Network, J.D. Hayworth, the former U.S. representative who is running against incumbent John McCain for U.S. Senate from Arizona, said McCain has recently changed his tune on immigration.""Up until two weeks ago, John McCain was a leading proponent of amnesty. Now with me challenging him, suddenly he has changed,"" Hayworth told host Neil Cavuto on April 28, 2010.Hayworth made the comment during a larger discussion about Arizona's new immigration law, one that would make it a state crime to be an illegal immigrant. Immigration reform has many components, and we found McCain has changed his position on at least one of them. But did he change positions on amnesty after Hayworth entered the race? That's the question we're setting out to answer. For those of you who don't know about McCain's record on immigration, here's the skinny: Back in 2007, McCain made waves by pushing an immigration reform bill that would have created a pathway to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally. Such a plan has been unpopular with many Republicans, who frequently criticize it for providing ""amnesty"" to illegal aliens. Since then, McCain's rhetoric on the issue has shifted.For instance, in a Jan. 30, 2008, presidential debate, McCain was asked whether he would still vote in support of his 2007 proposal. He dodged the question, and instead said border security should come first. ""We will secure the borders first when I am president of the United States,"" he said.Indeed, McCain was long against the idea of sending National Guard troops to the border. In 2001, he told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly that it was a bad idea because troops are not trained for the job. He solidified his change of heart on March 26, 2009, when he posted a statement on his Web site that said, given violence along the U.S.-Mexico border, ""I support sending National Guard troops to assist with securing our southern border and stemming the flow of violence spilling over into the United States.""He reiterated that stance during a field hearing in Phoenix on Monday, April 20, 2009. And exactly a year later, McCain joined with fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to introduce a 10-point plan to secure the border. The proposal includes sending 3,000 National Guard troops to the border, but says nothing about a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens.McCain has even acknowledged the change of heart, telling O'Reilly on April 19, 2010, that, ""I changed [my mind] over a year ago, as you know. The violence on the border is incredible.""At the same time, McCain has come out in favor of the Arizona immigration law, which has generated some flack from immigration reform advocates. They say he's bowing to campaign pressure. Furthermore, McCain has not stepped forward to support a Democratic immigration reform proposal that includes a pathway to citizenship similar to the plan included in McCain's 2007 bill. So, we can safely say that McCain has decided that putting National Guard troops on the border is a good idea after all. But that's not a new development; he changed course on the issue over a year ago. We can also say that McCain has endorsed the Arizona law, which has surprised immigration reform advocates who have typically seen McCain as an ally. And we can say that he's not endorsed a Democratic immigration reform effort. But does McCain now think a pathway to citizenship is no longer an option he'd support?No, says Brian Rogers, McCain's campaign spokesman. ""He's said that once the borders are secure, then we should look to other elements of reform, including a path to citizenship, to be addressed,"" Rogers said. Indeed, over the past few weeks, McCain said just that.""After the border is secure, then we need to look at a temporary legal guest worker program and a path to citizenship and all that. But first, the border has to be secured,"" he said.We asked Hayworth's campaign to pinpoint the flip they say McCain made in recent weeks, and Hayworth's spokesman, Mark Sanders, said that he believed that McCain was running ads that indicated a change of heart. We did find several recent campaign ads and radio spots on McCain's campaign Web site; they all tout McCain and Kyl's border security plan, but say nothing about immigration reform or a pathway to citizenship. And Sanders could not give us further information on the ads he told us about.Sanders also pointed us to an ad put together by Hayworth's campaign. It pieces together clips of McCain recently talking about border security with comments he made previously about immigration reform. The first clip is from a speech McCain gave in 2008 to the National Council of La Raza, according to the Hayworth campaign. The second, which features the late Meet the Press host Tim Russert reading a positive statement McCain made about immigration reform in 2003, is at least two years old (Russert died in June 2008). The third is from a debate during the presidential campaign.But none are recent statements. So let's recap: McCain was once a vocal proponent of a pathway to citizenship. And for years, he rejected the idea of sending more National Guard troops to the border. But during the 2008 campaign, he started to shift his stance on the issue, saying that securing the border was his first priority. We found that he's maintained that stance since 2008, most recently with a new plan that would send 3,000 National Guard troops to the border. All the while, McCain has never fully backed away from further immigration reform, though we do concede that he's clearly put the issue on the back burner.But there is nothing to substantiate Hayworth's claim that, ""Up until two weeks ago, John McCain was a leading proponent of amnesty. Now with me challenging him, suddenly he has changed."" And his campaign could point to no solid evidence to back him up. In fact, McCain started favoring border security over a pathway to citizenship years ago, long before Hayworth was a contender. As a result, we find Hayworth's claim to be Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/may/05/jd-hayworth/rival-says-hes-forced-john-mccain-drop-amnesty-ill/

Republican Mike Pence says Obama cut budget for illegal immigration effort
","While many Democrats have criticized Arizona's tough new immigration laws, it's many of those same Democrats who have made the illegal immigration problem worse in Arizona, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on May 2, 2010. ""This administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control,"" Pence said. Later, Pence was more specific. ""Here's the numbers,"" Pence said. ""Fiscal 2007, the last year Republicans wrote a budget, $1.2 billion for border security and fencing. By 2010 that was cut to $800 million ... I mean, the Democrats have cut three-quarters of a trillion out of this, and the president wants to go to 50 percent of the level that Republicans spent on border security. We have got to take border security seriously."" Pence toggles between two statistics here, spending on border security and a subset of that, spending on border fencing. The fact is, between 2007 and now, while spending on border fencing has gone down, overall spending on border security has increased. Let's get to some numbers. In 2007, discretionary spending on border security was $6.3 billion. As Pence noted, that was the last year of full Republican control. After that, while George W. Bush remained in the presidency, Congress was controlled by Democrats. But discretionary spending on border security continued to rise year after year. It went to $7.9 billion in 2008; to $9.8 billion in 2009; and to $10.1 billion in fiscal year 2010. President Barack Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for a slight decrease in discretionary spending on border security, but even at the proposed level of $9.8 billion, that's a 55 percent increase between 2007 and 2011. A spokesman in Pence's office said Pence was focusing specifically on funding for the border fence. Spending under the budget heading ""border security, fencing, infrastructure and technology"" has gone down -- from $1.2 billion in 2007 to $800 million this fiscal year. Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for trimming the fence budget again, to $574 million. Funding for new border fencing surged in 2007 and 2008 after Republicans passed the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of hundreds of miles of new border fencing. Much of that fencing has been completed. The other major piece of the fencing budget is the so-called ""virtual border fence"" championed by Bush. Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was freezing funding for the ""virtual border fence"" along the U.S. Mexican border. The virtual fence -- which includes cameras, radar and ground sensors to detect illegal border crossings -- has been plagued by cost overruns, missed deadlines and technical bugs, such as the radar motion detector being unable to distinguish between humans and animals crossing the border. The program had gotten several dreadful reviews from the Government Accountability Office. So Pence is correct that border fence budgets have been trimmed since 2007. But Pence repeatedly said that funding for border security has been steadily cut by Democrats since 2007. And as we noted earlier, spending on border security has actually risen steadily. That's because Obama has focused more funding in other border security areas, such as increasing the number of border patrol officers. The 2011 proposed budget, for example, includes $94 million to expand the number of Customs and Border Patrol officers -- putting the country on target to reach Bush's goal of 20,000 officers. Between 2007 and 2011, the Border Patrol budget increased from $2.3 billion to $3.6 billion. The budget for inspections at ports of entry increased from $1.8 billion in 2007 to $2.9 billion in 2011. In addition, Obama's proposed 2011 budget calls for $1.6 billion for customs enforcement programs to identify and remove illegal aliens who commit crimes; and $137 million to expand immigration-related verification programs. ""I would not say the Obama administration has cut back on border enforcement in general,"" said Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Rather, Democrats have shifted funding from border fencing to other border security items, such as increasing the number of border patrol officers. ""Most immigration experts will tell you that adding personnel is much more important than additional fencing,"" Rosenblum said. ""No one thinks building fences, in and of itself, is very effective."" That's a policy debate. But when Pence said ""this administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control,"" that's wrong. Funding for fencing is down, but funding for border security is up. In fact, discretionary spending on border security is up 55 percent between 2007 and 2011, even with a small proposed cut in 2011. We rate Pence's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c10a8d81-2441-48cd-8144-d3c5f7a1fdcd",/factchecks/2010/may/05/mike-pence/republican-says-obama-cut-budget-illegal-immigrati/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Gov. Rick Perry says in 2003, Texas cut $10 billion from the budget yet increased spending for public education and health and human services
","
Though state lawmakers could confront a projected revenue shortfall of more than $11 billion when they come into session in January, Gov. Rick Perry rejects ""the idea that Texas is going to hell in a hand basket."" 
Been there, done that when the state closed a similar gulf in 2003 and cut ""$10 billion out of the entire budget,"" Perry said in an April 15 interview with the online Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine. 
""Yet,"" Perry said, ""we put $1.8 billion more into public education. We put $800 million more into health and human services."" 
That's some triple play: $10 billion in budget cuts while pumping an additional $2.6 billion into schools and health and human services. Are those numbers on the money? 
Perry has talked up those cut-and-spend results before, although the spending totals he floated were lower. In a June 2003 opinion piece sent newspapers, for instance, Perry wrote that despite the ""tough budgetary times, we increased spending on vital health care programs by $1.1 billion and on public education by $1.2 billion."" 
Let's start with the budget cuts he proclaims in the Tribune interview. 
Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's re-election campaign, told us Perry was referring to closing the $10 billion revenue shortfall that Texas faced in 2003 — ""not literally cutting those funds from the budget."" 
In January 2003, lawmakers started the legislative session in a ditch after State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn issued a grim forecast, saying state revenues for the 2004-2005 budget period would fall short of estimated expenditures by $7.4 billion. Add looming expenses — a health plan for local school district employees plus projected health and human services needs — and the state was facing a $9.9 billion state revenue shortfall, Strayhorn said. 
To cover the projected shortfall in the months remaining in the 2003 fiscal year, the Legislature trimmed $1.4 billion in budgeted state spending, while spending $450 million from the rainy day fund. 
Lawmakers also passed a 2004-2005 budget that appropriated $1.8 billion less in state funds than had been spent during 2002-03, according to the Fiscal Size-up published by the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on state spending. They added $811 million from the rainy day fund. And they used $1.3 billion in federal aid, part of fiscal relief made available to states in response to economic difficulties in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001. 
Other steps: Members voted to extend a tax on telephone customers originally levied to pay for technology in schools and hospitals, raise fees for certain state services and use creative accounting to defer state payments to the next budget period.. 
So, the Legislature closed the $10 billion shortfall in 2003 via various mechanisms. Their cuts in state spending totaled $3.2 billion. 
Next, let's look at whether the 2004-2005 budget gave additional aid to public schools ($1.8 billion) and health and human services ($800 million), as Perry says. 
Frazier noted that the state ended up spending $34.8 billion on public education in 2004-05, up $1.9 billion from 2002-03, according to the Fiscal Size-up. 
Unsaid: the 2004-05 budget signed into law by Perry in 2003 only provided for an $893 million increase in public education spending. The additional $1 billion he touts wasn't available when the Legislature was balancing that budget — it came from supplemental appropriations and additional federal aid doled out by the 2005 Legislature. 
Another wrinkle: State funds don't account for any of the $893 million increase that Perry mentions. In fact, the 2004-05 budget cut state expenditures on public schools by $1 billion. According to the Fiscal Size-up, the budget made up for that cut (and more) thanks to a $1.3 billion infusion of federal education aid. 
Next, let's look at health and human services. 
Frazier pointed out that overall spending on health and human services increased by $1.3 billion in the 2004-2005 budget, according to the Fiscal Size-up, which is more than what Perry said in his recent interview. Some 77 percent of that increase was federal funds (for items like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program). According to the Fiscal Size-up, lawmakers appropriated $6.8 million less in state funds for health and human services than was spent in the 2002-2003 budget. 
Whew. Where does this leave Perry's recent statement? 
As Perry's campaign notes, Perry did not sign off on $10 billion in budget cuts in 2003, contrary to what he said in April. All in all, the Legislature trimmed $3.2 billion in total spending for the 2004-2005 budget cycle, counting $1.4 billion cut from the 2003 budget. 
What about Perry's claims about boosting the budget for education and health and human services together by $2.6 billion? We find that total funding in those categories in the 2004-05 budget increased by $893 million and $1.3 billion, respectively — not quite what Perry claims. Federal funds fueled the increases, enabling lawmakers to appropriate $1 billion less in state money to public education and $6.8 million less to health and human services. 
We rate Perry's statement as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/may/05/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-2003-texas-cut-10-billion-budg/

The release included an open letter to Cannon and Haridopolos: For the past year, you've relentlessly championed efforts to allow oil rigs as close as three miles from our coast. The human, environmental and economic catastrophe happening now in our Gulf shows the folly of that effort. Although you've expressed new concerns in light of this tragedy, neither of you have publicly abandoned your effort to pass legislation next year that would sell off Florida's coastal waters to British Petroleum, Exxon, Chevron and other oil companies.It's been reported in the media that you want to further study what happened in the Deepwater Horizon accident, as if there is a possible cause that would make drilling in Florida's state waters still Okay? As many experts told you before this massive spill, it's not a matter of ""if"" there will be an oil spill catastrophe, but ""when."" As concerned Floridians, we demand to know, ""YES"" or ""NO"", do you still plan to allow oil drilling off Florida's coast? For this item, we decided to check Progress Florida's claim that Cannon and Haridopolos have said they plan to push drilling legislation when they come to power in the 2011 legislative session. So let's explore where the two incoming leaders stand on drilling.Cannon, R-Winter ParkIn 2009, Cannon filed a bill in the Florida House that would have permitted the state to lease drilling areas (at $1 million per application) that are 3 to 10 miles off Florida's coast. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate.He brought the bill back in 2010 with provisions that would give the military veto power over drilling leases (it uses the Gulf of Mexico for training exercises) and would prevent, Cannon said, visual impact to Florida's beaches. But without support in the Senate, the bill again died.Before the spill, Cannon said he intended to try a third time in 2011, when he is speaker.On April 17, Cannon stopped the drilling discussion for the year, but said the bill would return. ""What we will do today is leave this issue in the best posture it can be -- in a position that reflects our collective work and our collective concerns,"" Cannon said. ""So when the time is right -- hopefully that is next year -- we take that issue up and deliberate further."" After the spill, however, Cannon called for a timeout.""Until we have all of the facts and all the answers about what happened and why, we shouldn't move forward,"" Cannon said on April 27.And on May 2: ""'I think it definitely is a game changer.""Haridopolos, R-Merrit IslandHaridopolos, the incoming Senate president, also has been a proponent of oil drilling in state waters. ""We will enhance Florida’s economic sovereignty by considering legislation that would allow the state’s Cabinet officials to open the waters off of Florida’s west coast to oil and natural gas production,"" Haridopolos wrote in an editorial published Sept. 24, 2009. ""Florida can no longer afford to sit idly by as competing Gulf Coast states, and even foreign nations, reap the Gulf’s economic benefits. We can’t count on Washington to understand our energy needs, and Floridians need to take steps to reclaim our economic independence.""Haridopolos published a pre-session constituent survey that he said found that 76.7 percent support legislation to allow offshore oil drilling on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The poll was unscientific.Haridopolos also filed legislation in the Senate in 2010 that would have allowed drilling in state waters. The only reason it didn’t move, the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald reported, was because of opposition from President Jeff Atwater. Like Cannon, Haridopolos has made offshore drilling a priority for Florida's 2011 session, hoping money from oil leases could bring new sources of revenue to Florida.That may not change, even in the wake of the spill.""Anytime you look at any exploration, whether it's energy or space, there are inherent risks,"" Haridopolos said in Florida Today on April 28. ""We just saw 29 miners killed in West Virginia, getting coal.""Next year, we want to know what happened in Louisiana -- was it sabotage, human error, how could it be prevented,"" Haridopolos said. ""This is a big change in policy and something like this gives us pause.""On the same day in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune Haridopolos said: ""One incident should not put the idea to death.""The ruling Florida Progress claims that both have said they plan to bring up oil drilling during the 2011 session, allowing drilling perhaps as close as 3 miles from Florida's shore. They have. We rate Progress Florida's claim True. UPDATE: On May 4, after this item was published, Cannon told the Orlando Sentinel that opening Florida waters to offshore drilling has been ""permanently tabled"" due to concerns over the gulf oil spill. Cannon said he will not push drilling during his two years as Speaker. “An accident like this hasn’t happened in my adult lifetime,” he said. “I doubt we’re going to get adequate answers [as to the cause] in two years, and as a matter of term limits, I’m done in two years. So as far as I’m concerned, it’s off the table.”",/factchecks/2010/may/04/progress-florida/florida-offshore-oil-drilling-cannon-haridopolos/

Under Arizona immigration law, overgrown lawns, barking dogs could trigger questioning, lawmaker says
","The controversy over a hard-line immigration law signed by Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, shows no signs of ebbing -- despite a last-minute change to the law's language designed to placate critics. The law, which would go into effect in 90 days, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status.One of the key questions has been what standard law enforcement officers must use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Critics have argued that trivial justifications could lead to immigration status checks that could get someone deported.On April 30, Brewer signed a package of changes to the law that were intended to clarify what sorts of actions could trigger immigration-related questions. Here's the new version of the language telling police the circumstances under which they will be expected to check on an individuals' immigration status:""For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town in this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation.""By replacing the broader phrase ""lawful contact"" with ""lawful stop, detention or arrest,"" the new version may have eased one worry expressed by critics of the bill -- that police could use such innocuous pretexts as someone asking an officer for directions or being a victim or a witness of a crime to trigger an immigration status check.But some say that a different addition to the law may actually expand the grounds for questioning people about their immigration status. The new version added the phrase ""in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town in this state."" Before this change was made, the law did not specify that police could use the enforcement of county, city or town laws or ordinances as the trigger for asking immigration-status questions.Brewer's office did not return a request for comment. But Paul Senseman, a spokesman for the governor, told the Arizona Republic that such changes simply clarified the law's original intent. ""What we were always talking about and have always been talking about are things like discharging firearms, alcoholic beverages in the park or speeding in a school zone,"" he told the newspaper.But critics -- including Arizona state Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, appearing on the April 30 edition of MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- seized on the change as significant and worrisome. Sinema told Olbermann that the final round of changes ""actually make the law more onerous and even more unconstitutional, if that can even be imagined.""Olbermann brought up the idea that ""police contact over violations for local civil ordinances can trigger questioning on immigration status. You've identified that as a major problem with this. What is the problem?""Sinema responded, ""Well, that's the key problem, because, previously, the sponsors of this legislation indicated that it was solely to apprehend people who were suspected of committing criminal acts. But now, when police officers encounter someone whose lawn is overgrown or who perhaps has a dog that's barking too loudly, they'll be required to inquire into their immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe they may be undocumented. That is incredibly concerning and a massive expansion of this law.""We decided to focus on whether something like an overgrown lawn or a loudly barking dog could trigger an immigration check. For background's sake, this is our second attempt in a week to analyze the Arizona law. We first addressed the law in a pair of rulings on April 28, 2010, before the most recent changes were made. We're now attempting another pair of rulings -- this one, and a separate one on racial profiling.We believe that checking Sinema's claim requires an answer to two questions. First, are overgrown lawns and loudly barking dogs the type of violations typically covered by municipal laws or ordinances in Arizona? And second, if the answer is yes, could such violations serve as the trigger for an immigration check?To answer the first question, we called Ken Strobeck, the executive director of the League of Arizona Cities and Towns. Strobeck told us that such violations are indeed common in Arizona municipal codes. He said that while such violations are ordinarily enforced by unarmed code enforcers rather than by armed, trained police officers, there is nothing in the Arizona law to prevent a police officer from using an unmowed lawn, or some other civil violation for which they make a stop, detention or arrest, as the trigger for an immigration status check.The expansion of the law to municipal ordinances gives police ""virtual carte blanche to ask for documentation,"" said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, adjunct law professor at Cornell University.The language on municipal ordinances may be new, but the original version of the law had already established a low threshold for asking immigration-related questions.For instance, the law would have allowed police to use traffic stops as a justification to ask immigration questions. Traffic stops are a well-used, and legal, way for police officers to enforce other laws. They can be used to test for drunken driving, or to catch violators of vehicle laws, such as those against broken taillights.""Someone who has committed no crime -- and indeed, for whom there is no reasonable suspicion of a crime -- could be subject to a lawful 'stop' at such checkpoints, and under the Arizona law could, upon reasonable suspicion, be asked for identification,"" said Jennifer Chacon, law professor at the University of California-Irvine.And what might constitute ""reasonable suspicion""?""Officers can use traffic stops to look for people who have invalid licenses, and invalid licenses for people who do not speak good English will be proxies for reasonable suspicion that the person is an illegal alien,"" said Stephen Saltzburg, law professor at George Washington University. In 1996, he said, the Supreme Court ruled in Whren vs. United States that it was permissible to use traffic laws to enforce drug laws. Similar stops for immigration laws, Saltzburg said, are ""also likely to be upheld"" if challenged under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against improper search and seizure.Meanwhile, in an effort to curb day-laborer gathering points -- the ad-hoc spots where illegal immigrants have often offered themselves as informal laborers -- both versions of the law have made it unlawful for illegal immigrants ""to knowingly apply for work (or) solicit work in a public place,"" including through ""verbal or nonverbal communication by a gesture or a nod that would indicate to a reasonable person that a person is willing to be employed."" So, anyone making a gesture or a nod in a public place could fall under suspicion of violating these laws -- which in turn could open the door to questioning about one's immigration status.But on the narrower question Sinema raised -- about overgrown lawns or loudly barking dogs triggering an immigration check -- our experts say that she is on pretty safe ground. She exaggerates when she says that such violations could require law enforcement officers to ""inquire into their immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe they may be undocumented."" The law has a few more hurdles than that. It says that ""a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation."" And of course, there's no way of knowing yet whether law enforcement officers will actually use the full extent of their powers. Still, she's correct that relatively minor violations could open the door to immigration questioning. So we rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/may/04/kyrsten-sinema/under-arizona-immigration-law-overgrown-lawns-bark/

Arizona immigration law rewrite 'lays to rest' worries about racial profiling, Brewer says
","The controversy over a hard-line immigration law signed by Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, shows no signs of ebbing, despite a last-minute change to the law's language designed to placate some of the laws' critics.Generally speaking, the law, which would go into effect in 90 days, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. One of the key questions to emerge during and after its passage has been what standard law enforcement officers will need to use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Drawing special attention is the role played by ""racial profiling"" -- that is, the use of racial or ethnic characteristics as a justification for police questioning.Critics had said that the original version of the law permitted racial profiling. But the changes signed by Brewer on April 30 were intended to blunt those charges.The new version of the law says: ""A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution.""The prior version had said that an official ""may not solely consider race"" in such circumstances.The change appears to limit the scope of the law. The previous wording left open the possibility that race could be used as a factor -- just not the sole factor -- in deciding to stop someone.In a news release issued after signing the changes to the law, Brewer said, ""These changes specifically answer legal questions raised by some who expressed fears that the original law would somehow allow or lead to racial profiling. These new amendments make it crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal, and will not be tolerated in Arizona. I am proud that the Arizona Legislature has listened carefully to everyone’s concerns, and, in a gesture of statesmanship, acted swiftly and appropriately to lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling.""We wanted to judge the accuracy of Brewer's statement that the new wording will ""lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling.""This is our second attempt in a week to analyze the Arizona law. We first addressed the law in a pair of rulings on April 28, 2010, before the most recent changes were made. We'll now attempt another pair of rulings -- this one on the question of racial profiling, and a separate item on whether police need to suspect or witness something illegal before proceeding to ask someone about their immigration status.While the new phrasing on racial profiling seems straightforward -- and while the new language will provide opponents of racial profiling a useful weapon in court -- legal experts we spoke to said that it's not ""crystal clear and undeniable"" that racial profiling will be impossible under the law.Rather, the Arizona law, even in its revised version, sets up a clash of constitutional principles that could be fought over in the courts for years to come. Indeed, the law almost demands court involvement by expressly authorizing police to consider race ""to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution"" -- something that is far from nailed down.A big reason for uncertainty is that there is Supreme Court precedent for allowing racial profiling under similar circumstances to those envisioned in the Arizona law.In 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a case called United States vs. Brignoni-Ponce. In that case, a roving unit of the U.S. Border Patrol stopped a vehicle near the Mexican border and questioned the occupants about their immigration status. In this case, the court wrote, ""the only ground for suspicion is that the occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry."" In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled that ""because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer, whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country, may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances; but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause.""In the majority opinion, Justice Lewis Powell continued, ""The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor,"" even though ""standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens."" In other words, racial factors can be legitimately used in profiling, just as long as they are not the only factors -- language that's similar to the Arizona law's original wording.Complicating matters further, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- the federal court that includes Arizona -- has issued a more restrictive ruling than the Supreme Court on the use of race in profiling. Unlike the Supreme Court, the 9th Circuit ruled that consideration of Hispanic appearance in a stop is impermissible, said Jennifer Chacon, law professor at the University of California-Irvine. This tracks closely the new language added to the law.Legal experts we spoke to said that, at a minimum, this difference of opinion sets up a judicial conflict that needs to be sorted out.In the meantime, even if racial profiling is officially banned, the new Arizona law continues to permit non-racially based profiling, such as profiling based on clothing or behavior. Yet many legal experts we spoke to saw a hazy, and perhaps unenforceable, line between permissible profiles and illegal ones.Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis and a specialist on immigration law, said he worries that local police inadequately trained in immigration law could engage in profiling, either unwittingly or intentionally. ""My fear is that, with the new addition to the law or not, racial profiling will result, with untrained local law enforcement officers – perhaps unconsciously – relying on racial and/or class stereotypes"" when determining whether there's ""reasonable suspicion"" about one's immigration status.For defendants who feel they were stopped unfairly due to racial profiling, ""it may be virtually impossible to show, at least for many months if not several years"" that the police made their decision illegally on racial or ethnic grounds, said Stephen Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington University. Brewer's office did not respond to a request for comment.  Ultimately, the late changes do bolster Brewer's contention that the law prohibits racial profiling. But our legal experts say that it is far from the done deal that she suggests. There are simply too many legal loose ends to be settled in court to be able to say that the late changes to the law will ""lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling,"" as Brewer put it. We rule Brewer's statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/may/04/jan-brewer/arizona-immigration-law-rewrite-lays-rest-worries-/

Vanden Heuvel claims the energy industry isn't investing much in research and development
","With thousands of gallons of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico, conversation on the May 2, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week quickly turned to U.S. energy policy.

Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation, argued that one way to prevent such spills in the future is to transition to a clean energy economy -- which she said will be difficult given how little energy companies invest in research and development.

""At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D. We can do better. We are a nation which should do better ... and not rely on dirty energy, which just compounds the problem affecting this country and the planet,"" vanden Heuvel said.

We thought that would be a relatively easy statistic to track down, but it led to a wild op-ed goose chase.

Vanden Heuvel told us she got the information from a David Brooks column in the New York Times last week. His April 29 column lamented the minuscule amount of funding energy companies invest in R&D compared with other industries.

""Technology companies spend 5 percent to 15 percent of revenue on research and development,"" he wrote. ""Energy companies, on the other hand, spend only one-quarter of 1 percent. The federal government spends $30 billion on health research, but only $3 billion on clean energy research.""

But that, in turn, came from another opinion article: Brooks' assistant told us that he got it from an op-ed by Bill Gates and Chad Holliday, former chairman of DuPont, published a week earlier in the Washington Post. Here's what the duo wrote:

""Our country is neglecting a field central to our national prospect and security: energy. Although the information technology and pharmaceutical industries spend 5 to 15 percent of their revenue on research and development each year, U.S. companies' spending on energy R&D has averaged only about one-quarter of 1 percent of revenue over the past 15 years.""

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to our request for more background on the claim. But we found two sources that indicate vanden Heuvel is very close:
  
We also ran vanden Heuvel's claim by two experts who told us that it's pretty accurate.

""It's close to correct,"" said Nate Lewis, a professor at California Institute of Technology who assisted on the Brookings Institution report. ""As a percent of revenue, (the amount the energy industry spends on R&D) is a really small number. The pharmaceutical and intelligence industries spend between 10 and 12 percent on R&D. We're not even in the same ballpark here.""

So, even though vanden Heuvel was relying on another pundit for her claim (and he, in turn, was relying on an op-ed), the number is very close to numbers published by Brookings and the National Science Foundation. We find her claim True.",/factchecks/2010/may/03/katrina-vanden-heuvel/vanden-heuvel-claims-energy-industry-isnt-investin/

Bill McCollum ""always"" favored transparency in RPOF credit card mess
","""Right now the party matters are totally internal … I don’t think it’s good for any political party to be having everything that’s done inside the party open to the public and the press.""Feb. 9, 2010""I think we need to have as much transparency as possible in the party. Always have thought that.""April 27, 2010----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Republican candidate for governor and Attorney General Bill McCollum says he always favored transparency when it comes to answering questions about the Republican Party of Florida's financial problems.Speaking to St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo in the state Capitol courtyard on April 27, 2010, McCollum said that ""I think we need to have as much transparency as possible in the party. Always have thought that.""That's not what Florida Democrats say. They have accused McCollum of trying to sweep the state party's problems under the rug. ""Why is Bill McCollum so scared of putting some sunshine in these dark corners?"" Florida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Jotkoff said. ""Good things never come out of shady places.""The back and forth gives us an opportunity to use our Flip-O-Meter. In this item, we wanted to examine McCollum's statements on transparency.First, if you've missed the RPOF credit card saga, here's a recap:In August 2009, court records were released showing that indicted former House Speaker Ray Sansom charged $173,000 on his Republican Party-issued credit card, taking his family on a trip to Europe, making visits to Best Buy and spending thousands on flowers, clothing, meals and hotels. The records prompted some Republicans to criticize then-party Chairman Jim Greer. Greer cut up his party American Express to help mollify critics. But then, more credit card statements were leaked to the press -- statements from Greer, former House Speaker and U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and RPOF executive director Delmar Johnson. The new statements led to more questions and led some party leaders to call for Greer's ouster. In January 2010, he resigned. Then came questions about questionable contracts to a business Greer and Johnson had an interest in, then more questions about credit card spending, then reports that the U.S. Attorney's office, the FBI, the IRS and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement were investigating. The RPOF kicked Greer out of his state committee post. Greer sued. The party leaders still standing faced questions about transparency -- specifically, when would they release all the financial records.Starting in February, McCollum was asked whether 1) The RPOF should release all of its credit card statements so party donors could see how their contributions were being spent, and 2) If he, as attorney general, should launch an investigation in the RPOF's spending practices.You can see the evolution of his answers over two weeks in February. The St. Petersburg Times noted after the Feb. 20 appearance that McCollum had ""switched gears.""""If there is any illegal or criminal behavior they discover - and they may or may not - I stand ready to assist you (Thrasher) in directing that to the appropriate law enforcement agencies,'' McCollum said at a news conference.On March 15, McCollum referred the results of the audit to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for further investigation. On April 23, the state GOP executive committee voted to release all credit card statements to the public from party and elected officials.McCollum spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said McCollum has consistently pushed for greater transparency with members of the party and with the public and that McCollum ""has taken a prime leadership role in working to address issues to regard lavish spending and fiscal mismanagement."" And though it may not have happened happened right away, the party credit card statements from January 2007-February 2010 are being released and public investigations are under way. It should also be noted that Gov. Charlie Crist, not McCollum, had been the de facto leader of the state party until he decided to pursue an independent run for the U.S. Senate on April 29.But, we're here to judge McCollum's comments. For McCollum to say in April that he always has supported ""as much transparency as possible"" about the state party's spending records doesn't match his statements from February. Back then, he rejected calls to ask for the release of party credit card statements and said specifically that it's not good for all of the inner workings of a political party to be aired in the public. Only later did he say the state party's audit of its financial problems should be released to the public. And only after a private party audit suggested wrongdoing did he refer the case to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.We rate McCollum's statements on transparency a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2010/may/03/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-transparency-rpof-credit-card/

Facts on illegal immigrants show nuances of ""enforcement actions""
","Janet Napolitano, secretary of Homeland Security, appeared on ABC News' This Week and discussed a new law in Arizona that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status.Napolitano is not a fan of the new law, saying it could invite racial profiling and was bad for law enforcement.And, she said, statistics are against the need for a new law.""And actually, the numbers, if you step back and look at it, the numbers actually are down in terms of apprehensions, which indicates fewer illegal crossings, but also up in terms of actual enforcement actions. So the numbers actually are countered to what the action of the legislature is,"" Napolitano said. ""But you know what? There's still a frustration out there. It's a frustration, ultimately, that will only be solved with comprehensive immigration reform.""Here, we're checking Napolitano's statement that apprehensions of illegal immigrants are down while enforcement actions are up. We asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about her statement, and they sent us two sets of numbers for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009. The numbers they sent us showed that border apprehensions were down. On the southern border, apprehensions dropped from 858,638 in 2007 to 705,005 in 2008 and to 540,865 in 2009.For evidence that enforcement actions are up, the department sent us statistics on removals, which include deportations as well as people who leave the country without a formal order. Those numbers increased from 291,060 in 2007 to 369,221 in 2008 and 387,790 in 2009.We then asked a couple of independent experts for their thoughts of the numbers.The numbers of apprehensions at the border are going down because there are fewer people trying to get across the border since the U.S. economy soured in 2008, said senior demographer Jeffrey Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization that collects statistics on Hispanics and immigration. ""Immigration to the U.S. from Mexico is down, and it's down a lot,"" he said. Over the past several years, enforcement action on the border has tightened, he said. It is more difficult to get across the border, and people in Mexico have to pay more to smugglers to get them across. ""It's harder to get in, and it's more dangerous,"" he said.As for the second statistic, counting removals as a proxy for enforcement action is problematic, Passel said. Some people who are being removed are in the interior of the United States, such as criminals who served a prison term and are being deported upon release. Still, those numbers have been going up, as Napolitano indicated.The Obama administration appears to be conducting fewer raids on job sites where illegal immigrants work, Passel said, because the adminsitration seems to prefer workplace audits, which result in fewer immigrant arrests.""At one level, the results are often the same, in that the workers lose their jobs,"" he said. ""But the workers aren't getting picked up.""We also spoke with Mark Krikorian, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan research group that supports lower levels of immigration. Krikorian agreed that there has been an overall drop in people trying to cross the border, and an increase in the number of removals. But he too cautioned that using removal numbers as a proxy for ""enforcement action"" can be misleading. ""They're part of a picture, but that's all they are,"" he said.He also said the trend in removals may be coming to an end. The Washington Post reported that immigration officials were setting quotas for deportations because they wanted to avoid a steep drop-off in the numbers for 2010.So Napolitano said that the numbers ""are down in terms of apprehensions, which indicates fewer illegal crossings, but also up in terms of actual enforcement actions."" We agree that apprehensions are down, which indicates fewer illegal border crossings. Removals are also up. But we question whether removals are the same thing as ""actual enforcement actions."" The picture there is a little more nuanced. So we rate Napolitano's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/may/03/janet-napolitano/facts-illegal-immigrants-show-nuances-enforcement-/

Land commissioner says state getting most ever in oil and gas proceeds though oil production topped out in 1970s
","UPDATE, May 3, 2010: Oil production totals below for 1972, 2007 and 2008 have been corrected to make up for our initial misreading of a state chart. As originally noted, however, oil production in Texas still topped out in 1972. The corrected production figures don't affect our rating of Commissioner Patterson's statement. Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner seeking a third term this November, refers to the the state’s oil-soaked history in a recent column extolling renewable energy. In his article, published Tuesday in the Austin American-Statesman, Patterson writes: “We’re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it’s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.” Even though oil production has been declining, state revenue from oil and gas is the tops? When we sought background, the General Land Office shared a chart showing state oil and gas income reached a historical high of $495 million in 1982 that wasn't exceeded until 2008, when it hit $533 million. The state's oil-and-gas-related proceeds dropped to $381 million in 2009, the land office says. Counting revenue during the first seven months of this fiscal year, we calculate it will reach $279 million by the end of the 2010 fiscal year Aug. 31. Total state take during Patterson's seven-plus years as commissioner: $2.7 billion. And when did oil production peak? According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which tracks in-state oil production, the peak year for crude oil production was 1972 when more than 167,000 wells produced nearly 1.3 billion barrels. As of 2007, production had ebbed to about 336 million barrels. In 2008, production increased for the first time since 1991 to more than 346 million barrels, before falling in 2009, according to the commission. R.J. DeSilva, spokesperson for the State Comptroller's office, offered this analysis for the surge in state income from oil and gas surged well after oil production peaked: ""Oil and natural gas production are taxed on the value of oil and natural gas that’s produced. Oil and natural gas prices were higher in the early ‘80s than in the ‘70s (and reached all time highs in 2008)."" So how does Patterson’s statement shake out? He gets the peak-production timing right; it was the '70s. But he's off in saying state government is making more than ever from oil and gas ""right now."" That was true for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2008, but in 2009 state oil and gas revenue fell 29 percent from the year before and it's on pace to register another decline this fiscal year.

Rules vary, but 35 states require some form of ID to vote
","Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served as United Nations ambassador under President Donald Trump, implied in a recent Facebook post that Americans have to show an ID to do dozens of routine things, but not to vote — an interesting claim since she signed a voter photo ID requirement into law in her home state over a decade ago. ""Things that make you go (thinking emoji),"" reads a June 7 Facebook post by Haley. The post shared an image from Stand for America, an advocacy group she founded, that shows a lengthy list of activities that require presentation of an ID — including buying alcohol or cigarettes, getting married and boarding an airplane — and a list of what an ID is not required for, which just says ""to vote."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Ken Farnaso, a spokesperson for Haley, said that although Haley obviously knows that voter ID laws exist, having signed one into law, she believes they should be used to safeguard every election. ""While we recognize that some states do have voter ID laws, the vast majority of Americans are not required to abide by strict voter ID laws,"" he said. ""Strict voter ID is only required in 11 states, covering 18% of the U.S. population."" Haley’s post, shared and liked by more than 1,000 people, made no such recognition and included no caveats.  Farnaso’s numbers are correct according to a definition of ""strict"" that means that people who show up without a voter ID are allowed only to cast a provisional ballot. But voter ID laws requiring some form of ID covered about 6 in 10 registered voters in the 2020 election. Sean Morales-Doyle is acting director for voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school. He said ""voter ID"" laws come in many forms, from a federal law that requires people registering to vote by mail for the first time to provide ID, to a variety of state laws with differing requirements. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 35 U.S. states have laws that require or request some form of identification to vote. Those laws applied to about 59% of registered voters in the 2020 election, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The laws vary in terms of whether they are strictly applied and whether a photo ID, or other forms of documentation, are accepted. Fifteen states, along with the District of Columbia, have no ID laws, but use other methods, such as matching signatures, to verify a voter’s identity. Two of those states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, passed ID laws that have been struck down by courts. These states made up about 41% of registered voters in 2020. RELATED: As extremes shape voter ID debate, the rules keep getting stricter Because each state runs its own elections, ID laws vary, as do acceptable forms of identification. Seven states — Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Wisconsin — have what the NCSL labels ""strict"" photo ID laws, meaning those without one must vote on a provisional ballot and take later steps in order for their votes to count. Four states —  Arizona, North Dakota, Wyoming and Ohio — also have ""strict"" ID laws to vote, but a photo ID is not the only form accepted. Ohio, for instance, allows a utility bill or paycheck among acceptable forms of ID. All allow voters without an acceptable ID to cast provisional ballots. The other states with ID laws fall into a category the NCSL calls ""nonstrict"" states, meaning at least some voters can cast ballots even if they can’t provide the requested ID. South Carolina falls into this category. These state laws applied to nearly 40% of voters in 2020. The Missouri Legislature, which has passed several voter ID laws that failed to withstand legal challenges, passed a new, strict law last month that would require voters to show a government-issued photo ID to vote. It would allow a provisional ballot to be counted if the voter returned the same day with the ID or if election officials can verify their signature. Republican Gov. Mike Parsons said he plans to sign the bill, but had not as of June 9. New Hampshire recently passed a bill awaiting Gov. Chris Sununu’s signature that would require voters who register at the polls to use a provisional ballot if they don’t provide identification Haley’s post did not specify a form of voter ID, but she has long supported photo ID laws. In South Carolina, under a law she signed in 2011, voters are asked for a photo ID, but can vote on a provisional ballot and have it count as long as they show an ID to the county elections office before votes are certified. That law also provides residents with free photo IDs, but voters who can’t get one for reasons like religious objections or a disability can still cast a provisional ballot by ""signing an affidavit stating you have a reasonable impediment"" to obtaining a photo ID. During the bill signing, Haley made an argument similar to the one in her Facebook post, saying, ""If you can show a picture to buy Sudafed, if you can show a picture to get on an airplane, you should be able to show a picture to make sure that we do what is incredibly inherent in our freedoms and that is the ability to vote.""  In a 2015 speech at the National Press Club, Haley said, ""Let’s figure out ways to make it easy, and cost-free, for every eligible voter to obtain a photo ID."" More recently, she promoted voter ID laws in 2021 on The Daily Signal podcast. After the 2020 election, which former President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans baselessly argued was fraudulent, Republican leaders in many states, such as Texas and Georgia, have worked to tighten ID laws, particularly when voting absentee. Despite criticism by some Democrats and voting rights advocates that ID laws may inhibit minority voting, advocates told PolitiFact last fall that they do not oppose such laws if enough methods of ID are available to voters. And polls show wide support from voters for ID laws. A Facebook post by Haley suggested that no ID is required to vote in America. Although some states do not require voters to present ID to vote, most do. At least 35 states have laws that request or require voters to present some form of ID to cast a ballot, including South Carolina’s photo ID law signed by Haley. These laws applied to about 6 in 10 voters in the 2020 election. Some are stricter, requiring a photo ID, but many accept other forms, such as a utility bill. The remaining states use other methods to verify a voter’s identity. A spokesperson for Haley said she knows such laws exist, but believes that voter ID laws should be used in every election. Her post suggested a total absence of voter ID laws; therefore, we rate this claim Mostly False. RELATED: Trump says Democrats are trying to 'ban voter ID.' That’s misleading.

No evidence Pelosi ‘rejected’ Trump’s authorization for ‘20,000 National Guard’ before Jan. 6 attack
","Twenty million Americans tuned in June 9 as the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol described how then-President Donald Trump fueled the mob with bogus claims of a stolen election. The audience watching Fox News got a different story from its hosts: a litany of conspiracy theories from Tucker Carlson and a defense of Trump by Sean Hannity. Hannity repeatedly claimed that Trump authorized 20,000 National Guard troops for the Capitol before the riot, and that the former president’s efforts to secure the building were thwarted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""If Donald Trump authorized up to 20,000 National Guard troops to protect the Capitol, how does it make sense that they are there on national television blaming Donald Trump for wanting to start an insurrection?"" Hannity said on his June 9 show. He repeated the claim several times in the hour, often blaming Pelosi and Schumer, and again the following night.   Trump similarly claimed on June 9 that he ""offered up to 20,000 National Guard"" prior to the event and that ""crazy Nancy Pelosi turned down the offer."" There was no evidence to support such a claim in February 2021, when Trump said on Fox News that he had requested 10,000 National Guard troops but was rebuffed by Pelosi. There’s still no record of any such authorization being made, or of Pelosi standing in the way. The D.C. National Guard reports ""solely to the president of the United States,"" per its website. ""This is not true,"" Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, told PolitiFact June 10. ""The Speaker of the House doesn’t have the power to do this. No request was made for the National Guard before Jan. 6."" ""No congressional official, or body, has the authority to activate the National Guard to the U.S. Capitol. Only the president,"" added Jane. L Campbell, president and CEO of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society. ""If the president calls the National Guard to the U.S. Capitol, no congressional official has the authority to decline its service."" In fact, about 20 minutes before Hannity went on air, the House committee noted that then-Vice President Mike Pence had called for the National Guard on Jan. 6 — not Trump. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment. As PolitiFact previously reported, what Trump described in February 2021 as a formal request for 10,000 troops was actually an offhand remark to then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Miller said he took it as hyperbole based on Trump’s expectation for a massive crowd. There’s no evidence the remark was handled as an official authorization. A Vanity Fair reporter who followed Miller during the last week of Trump’s administration detailed the remark in a report. The report said that on Jan. 5, 2021, Miller and his chief of staff Kash Patel were meeting with Trump about an issue related to Iran. (A Defense Department inspector general’s report appeared to place the meeting on Jan. 3.) The Vanity Fair report said the conversation suddenly ""switched gears"": ""The president, Miller recalled, asked how many troops the Pentagon planned to turn out the following day. ""We’re like, ‘We’re going to provide any National Guard support that the District requests,’"" Miller responded. ""And (Trump) goes, ‘You’re going to need 10,000 people.’ No, I’m not talking bullshit. He said that. And we’re like, ‘Maybe. But you know, someone’s going to have to ask for it.’"" At that point Miller remembered the president telling him, ""‘You do what you need to do. You do what you need to do.’ He said, ‘You’re going to need 10,000.’ That’s what he said. Swear to God."" Miller chalked it up at the time to Trump being ""hyperbolic,"" Vanity Fair reported. He told lawmakers months later that D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for 340 members of the D.C. National Guard for traffic and crowd control was approved, but the Defense Department ""received no further request for different or additional support until the Capitol was breached."" Before the attack, Miller had signaled opposition to stationing the military outside the Capitol, according to the Defense Department’s inspector general report. ""No other requests were made,"" then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said the day after the riot. The Washington Post reported that the 10,000 figure did not get relayed to anyone outside of the Defense Department, citing unnamed former officials. A Defense Department spokesperson previously told PolitiFact that there was ""no record of such an order being given"" by Trump. It’s not clear how or when the number claimed jumped from 10,000 to 20,000 — a number of troops that would have rivaled some of the largest National Guard deployments in history.  Texts between Fox News host Sean Hannity and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany are displayed at the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, hearing on June 9, 2022, in Washington. (AP) On his show June 9, Hannity brought on Patel, who has helped drive falsehoods in the past and has shared social media posts related to the QAnon conspiracy theory. In contrast to what Miller told Vanity Fair and lawmakers, Patel told Hannity that in the pre-Jan. 6 meeting between Miller and Trump, Trump officially authorized up to 20,000 National Guard troops. Patel then claimed that they went to Pelosi and ""she refused it all,"" but he spoke only in vague terms when Hannity pressed for more information. When PolitiFact emailed Patel for evidence that Trump had formally authorized 20,000 troops and Pelosi had refused it, a spokesperson pointed to the Defense Department’s IG report and to the department’s timeline for security planning on Jan. 6, 2021.  Those documents, along with a bipartisan report from the Senate, indicate that members of the Capitol Police Board did have conversations in advance of the Jan. 6 attack about the possibility of seeking more National Guard support. The Pentagon communicated with the Capitol Police to see if they would require further assistance, the documents show, but no additional requests were made; the Senate report said the Capitol Police Board members ""did not appear to be fully familiar with the statutory and regulatory requirements for requesting National Guard support."" The Capitol Police Board includes the Capitol Police chief and the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, who report respectively to the House speaker and the Senate majority leader. But neither document makes any reference to a request or authorization of 20,000 National Guard troops, or to Pelosi blocking one.   Paul Irving, then the House Sergeant at Arms, testified in February 2021 that he did not speak with congressional leadership about potentially bringing in National Guard support until Jan. 6. Plus, the Senate majority leader at the time was Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. — not Schumer. ""Had President Trump ordered 20,000 National Guard soldiers to the Capitol before Jan. 6, it would have happened,"" said Dwight Stirling, the founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy. ""No one can prevent a presidential order from being followed with regard to where troops go or what they do. That it didn’t occur is evidence that no such order was issued."" Hannity said, ""Donald Trump authorized up to 20,000 National Guard troops to protect the Capitol"" before Jan. 6, 2021, but was ""rejected"" by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. There is no record of Trump formally authorizing 20,000 National Guard troops prior to the Jan. 6 attack. There is also no record of Pelosi rejecting such an authorization — and experts said she would not have had the authority to do so as House speaker.  We rate Hannity’s claim False.

Gaetz mischaracterizes Bennie Thompson’s stance on rioting
","U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said members of the House committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, have ""insurrectionist roots,"" namely Democratic chair Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. Thompson used the select committee’s June 9 primetime hearing to show Americans new footage of rioters overwhelming police officers guarding the Capitol as they clobbered their way into the building. Thompson introduced Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, who testified about her experience of fighting rioters in battle-like conditions. But Gaetz said Thompson is in no position to criticize attacks on police. ""Bennie Thompson actively cheer-led riots in the ’90s,"" Gaetz said during a June 7 appearance on U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s podcast. ""So, he had no problem with violence against the police then."" We wondered whether Gaetz’s characterization of Thompson’s background was accurate. So, we put his comments on the Truth-O-Meter.  Gaetz’s claim about Thompson being a cheerleader for riots in the ’90s is similar to one made in an article published by Breitbart on June 6 about how Thompson ""declined to oppose riots in 1992."" The story referred to an ""unearthed"" 1992 report in the Clarion-Ledger, a local Mississippi newspaper, which described correspondence between the leader of the Hinds County Bar Association and Thompson, then a district supervisor for Mississippi’s Hinds County. The association’s president, Hal Miller Jr., asked Thompson to speak out ""in favor of the principle of law"" and push back against the philosophy that ""if I do not agree with the law, I may take it into my own hands,"" per the Clarion-Ledger. Miller’s letter invoked unrest that erupted in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of four police officers who were captured on video severely beating Rodney King, a Black man.  Miller feared that Hinds County could experience similar unrest if Byron De La Beckwith — a white supremacist who murdered civil rights leader Medgar Evers — was acquitted. (Beckwith was convicted, and PolitiFact found no evidence of riots.) According to the newspaper story, Thompson said, ""I do not understand what the Hinds County Bar requests of me in your June 23 letter … so please provide me with another letter explaining your request in greater detail.""  Thompson also asked that Miller explain the association’s record of inaction regarding the lack of Black elected officials and trial judges.  The 1992 report did not show Thompson supporting violence in response to a judicial decision. Nor did Breitbart.  When we asked Gaetz about his remark, a spokesperson pointed to the Dec. 2, 2021, episode of Gaetz’s podcast, Firebrand.  In it, Gaetz referenced a purported connection between Thompson and a Black liberation movement called the ""Republic of New Afrika,"" which was prominent in the 1970s and had several armed confrontations with the police.  The podcast largely relied on reporting from John Solomon, a journalist whose reports have given false credence to conspiracy theories about President Joe Biden and Ukraine. The bulk of Solomon’s evidence comes from news clippings and archival footage that show Thompson pushing back against an attempt by law enforcement to, in Thompson’s words, ""stop the republic from building their community."" ""My position is that people are entitled to live as they choose, so long as they are law-abiding and peaceful,"" Thompson said in footage from 1971, published online by Just the News. When Gaetz asked whether Thompson was a member of the group, Solomon said, ""At this point, the public evidence is that he sympathized with the group, he stood up for them — but he wasn't a member."" Thompson’s involvement with the group is distinct from Gaetz’s reference to Thompson encouraging riots in the 1990s. Gaetz said, ""Bennie Thompson actively cheer-led riots in the ’90s."" We found no evidence to suggest that Thompson praised the unrest that erupted in Los Angeles in 1992. Gaetz’s assertion mirrored one made in an article by Breitbart, which highlighted an exchange between Thompson and the president of a bar association in Mississippi. However, Thompson did not express support for rioting in his correspondence with the bar association — he questioned its inaction regarding a lack of Black elected officials and judges.

No, North Carolina doesn't grow 25% of the nation's hemp
","Advocates for medical marijuana secured a small victory recently when North Carolina state senators passed a bill to legalize it, sending legislation to the state House. While the bill had broad support in the Senate, an Asheville-area senator called on lawmakers to amend it so that more local farmers can grow and sell the product. Sen. Julie Mayfield, D-Buncombe, said proposed regulations would exclude a large swath of local farmers because the bill requires licensees to produce the drug, process it and sell it at its own dispensaries. ""Indeed, a quarter of the entire acreage in the country that is under hemp production is here in North Carolina,"" Mayfield said in a speech on the senate floor. ""A quarter of the entire production in the country. These farmers and small business owners literally plowed the ground in North Carolina to make it fertile for the legalization of marijuana when we got to that point."" Mayfield’s claim suggesting that North Carolina is home to 25% of the nation’s hemp-producing acreage was included in stories by WRAL, the News & Observer, the North Carolina Insider newsletter and others. But it’s not true.  Shortly after emailing Mayfield, PolitiFact NC was contacted by a hemp policy advocate who took responsibility for the inaccurate statistic.  Nicolette Baglio, who owns a hemp business in western North Carolina, said she and other hemp advocates have been tracking North Carolina’s proposal. Baglio said her group didn’t learn about the Senate’s scheduled vote until just hours beforehand. In a rush to compile information about North Carolina’s hemp industry, Baglio said her team miscalculated the state’s hemp production and then included it in an email sent to every senator. Speaking to PolitiFact, Mayfield argued that, despite the error, her broader point is valid because, although her percentage was off, North Carolina remains a top producer of hemp. ""This bill, while taking a long overdue step, shuts out N.C. businesses and farmers and will make already large, wealthy, out of state companies larger and wealthier at the expense of small hemp farmers and businesses,"" Mayfield said in an email. ""We should work harder to figure out a way to let our homegrown businesses benefit from this new market and keep our dollars in-state rather than let our dollars flow to out-of-state cannabis corporations."" The U.S. Department of Agriculture in February released a report on hemp production across the country during 2021. The department tracked hemp that was planted and harvested in each state. North Carolina planted 4% of the nation’s industrial hemp last year – accounting for 2,150 of the U.S.’s total 54,152 acres of hemp planted. Seven other states planted more: Colorado, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, California, Minnesota and Utah. North Carolina was an even larger producer of harvested hemp. North Carolina harvested 5.5% of the nation’s industrial hemp — 1,850 of the nation’s 33,480 acres. North Carolina and Oregon are tied for sixth in harvesting industrial hemp, behind Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, California, and Utah.  Baglio said her team initially thought that North Carolina accounted for 25% of U.S. hemp production because they compared a statistic from Hemp Industry Daily — which said the state has 14,016 acres available for hemp growth — with the USDA report that 54,152 acres of hemp was planted last year.  Mayfield said she wrote Baglio’s talking point in her notes, which she can be seen reading from in video footage of the senate debate. Baglio apologized for providing Mayfield with the wrong stat, saying the rest of the group’s information is accurate and that Mayfield is a trustworthy lawmaker. ""She has truly been one of the only legislators that I feel like has listened to her constituents and has taken up some of the main issues at hand and that [the bill] is essentially cutting out the entire industry that paved the way"" for medical marijuana, Baglio said. Mayfield said ""a quarter of the entire acreage in the country that is under hemp production is here in North Carolina."" That’s not true. North Carolina has planted about 4% of the nation’s hemp and harvested about 5.5% of it, according to a USDA report released in February.

Many toothpaste brands contain fluoride, a substance known to prevent cavities. But because fluoride can cause illness if ingested alone, such products are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which limits how much fluoride is allowed.  So we were intrigued by a recent Facebook post that is being shared widely online.  ""Public health warning issued for fluoride toothpaste,"" the June 6 post said. ""Avoid these brands at all costs.""  That’s also the title of a blog post the Facebook poster provided a link to.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, the blog post is from August 2018, which would make this warning nearly four years old. But reading the post, it becomes clear that the blog is talking about a warning label that the FDA started requiring on fluoride toothpaste in 1997.  ""According to the CDC, children should use no more than a pea-sized amount and kids younger than 3 should use no more than the size of a rice grain,"" the blog post says. ""The warning by the agency has to do with the fluoride most conventional toothpaste brands contain. If you look closely, you will notice that fluoride toothpastes have a warning on their label stating ‘If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional help or contact a poison control center immediately.’""  General warnings started appearing on toothpaste tubes in 1991, cautioning people not to swallow toothpaste and to ""use only a pea-sized amount for children under age 6,"" according to the Washington Post.  The FDA warning that followed in 1997 was ""not because some new study suggested more serious side effects,"" the New York Times said at the time, ""but because it believes that any product that contains a substance classified as a drug should be labeled with a recommendation to seek professional help in cases of excess ingestion.""  PolitiFact looked at a recently-purchased fluoride toothpaste from Colgate and saw this warning: ""Keep out of reach of children under 6 years of age. If more than used for brushing is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away."" Of course, people generally don’t eat and swallow toothpaste. But as we’ve previously reported, even if they did, it would take a massive amount to be at risk from fluoride poisoning, and experts say children would vomit out the toothpaste long before that point. This post gives the misleading impression that a recent public health warning was issued for fluoride toothpastes, but that’s not the case. Rather, 25 years ago the FDA started requiring companies to put a warning on such products to advise people to seek help if they swallow more toothpaste than was used to brush their teeth.  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2022/jun/10/facebook-posts/no-public-health-warning-wasnt-recently-issued-flu/

Grothman mostly right on who would benefit from student loan debt forgiveness
","President Joe Biden and his administration are once again revisiting the idea of student loan forgiveness, a controversial idea that could allow for some – or even all – student debt to be erased.  While some have pushed for debt forgiveness, seeing it as a potential injection of money into the economy, others – including U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin — have questioned the idea.  ""Nearly 60% of all student loan debt is held by the rich and upper-middle class,"" he said in a May 21, 2022, newsletter. ""So, by forgiving student loan debt, we would be handing the wealthy a financial windfall while low income Americans suffer further from inflation and rising costs.""  For this fact-check, we’re going to look at the portion of the claim about who holds student loan debt, and whether or not forgiveness would help low-income people.  Wealthier majors tend to make more money after college, spend more on degrees  When asked for backup for the claim, Grothman’s office shared a couple of sources of information with us.  The first was an analysis from EducationData.org, a group of researchers who collect data and statistics about U.S. education. According to the May 8, 2022, report, Americans with income over $74,000 hold about 60% of the total public student loan debt, while households that earn $35,000 or less a year hold about 20% of the total public student loan debt.  According to the group, those earning $74,000 or more are considered middle to upper-middle class, while those earning $35,000 or less are considered lower-middle class or poor. So, Grothman is mischaracterizing the data a bit, inasmuch as he’s labeling that group the ""rich and upper-middle class."" Looking further at who has student debt, many of those who pursue graduate degrees owe more money, according to a Jan. 21, 2022 article from Forbes. That’s perfectly logical, in that there is more education to pay for. For example, a young doctor may owe about $200,000 in medical student debt, but medicine is also one of the best-paid professions in the U.S. That means the student’s lifetime income prospects would allow them to pay off their loans.  Grothman’s office also shared a Brookings article from February 2022, which outlined how those who stand to see the most money forgiven would be higher income, better educated and white.  ""Beneficiaries of across-the-board student loan forgiveness would be higher income, better educated, and more likely to be white than beneficiaries of just about all other programs designed to reduce hardship and promote opportunity and targeted to those who need help,"" the article said. ""Prioritizing spending on targeted programs would therefore be a more effective way to achieve progressive goals.""  The article then highlights the child tax-credit program as an example of a program that might directly benefit more people living in poverty than student loan debt forgiveness.  In any case, Grothman is largely right on the numbers. But he misfires a bit in suggesting that loan forgiveness would not matter much to low-income people. For college graduates in lesser-paying jobs, it might make a huge difference in terms of their finances. Adam Looney, executive director of the Marriner S. Eccles Institute at the University of Utah and a nonresident fellow in economic studies for the Brookings Institute, noted that wealthy people aren’t the only ones to attend college.  ""Some low-income people also have student debt, so they would also be helped by forgiveness. It’s just that they are less likely to have debt at all (because they are less likely to have been able to go to college in the first place) and have less debt if they go to college (often because they haven’t finished a degree or went to a low-cost community college,)"" he said in an email. ""So I think poor people do not benefit as much as higher-income households from across-the-board debt forgiveness policies.""  Grothman claimed that most student loan debt is held by wealthier people, meaning that student loan debt forgiveness would be a ""windfall"" for the rich and not make much difference for low-income people.  It is true that people with higher incomes hold more debt — often because they attended graduate school and, if the loan is bigger, it would be more of a ""windfall"" to them.  But people with lower incomes also attend college, and on an individual level may benefit proportionately more from student loan debt forgiveness. For those, it could be a game changer.  We rate this claim Half True.   ",/factchecks/2022/jun/10/glenn-grothman/grothman-mostly-right-who-would-benefit-student-lo/

Fact-checking whether Jan. 6 committee chairman Bennie Thompson objected to the 2004 election
","As the House Jan. 6 Committee was beginning its first prime-time hearing on June 9, the House Republican Conference sought to undercut the legitimacy of the panel and its chair, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. In a tweet highlighted by four siren emojis, the House Republicans’ official caucus said, ""REMINDER: Bennie Thompson objected to the 2004 Presidential election."" 🚨🚨REMINDER🚨🚨Bennie Thompson objected to the 2004 Presidential election, Thompson was a member of the House on Jan. 6, 2005, when a joint session of Congress met to formally count the electoral votes from the 2004 presidential race, in which the incumbent, George W. Bush, defeated his Democratic challenger, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.  This is the same task that would be undertaken 16 years later to the day, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol and disrupted the certification of the election — the event that prompted the House select committee’s hearing. The 2005 election was close; a shift of 118,601 votes in Ohio from Bush to Kerry would have flipped the state to Kerry and enabled the Democrat to win the Electoral College.  A Democratic House member from Ohio, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, offered an objection during the counting of the electoral vote. She was joined in the objection by a member of the Senate, Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., which is enough to trigger a formal vote by each chamber on whether the electoral votes in question were valid. This was the last time an objection vote was held prior to 2021. Then-Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, presents an official objection to the certification of Ohio's electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2005. (AP) The motion to object said, ""We, a member of the House of Representatives and a United States senator, object to the counting of the electoral votes of the State of Ohio on the ground that they were not, under all of the known circumstances, regularly given.""  The critics behind the motion had cited a report by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee that had found ""numerous, serious election irregularities,"" particularly in Ohio, that led to ""a significant disenfranchisement of voters."" ""How can we possibly tell millions of Americans who registered to vote, who came to the polls in record numbers, particularly our young people ... to simply get over it and move on?"" Tubbs Jones told reporters, CNN reported. When the House cast its votes, the motion failed by a large margin: Only 31 Democrats voted to object, with 88 Democrats joining all 178 Republicans in opposing the motion.  Thompson was one of the 31 Democrats who voted to object, so on this point, the Republicans have a point. But that’s not the end of the story. One problem is that the wording of the Republicans’ tweet is a bit off-base. Officially, the 31 Democrats did not vote to object to the ""2004 presidential election"" but rather to object to the electoral votes of one state, Ohio.  A more important difference has to do with the context surrounding the vote. The 2005 objection was essentially a protest opportunity. Some Democrats were frustrated: It was just four years after the weeks-long Florida recount of 2000, which had resulted in Bush becoming president despite Al Gore’s victory in the popular vote, the first time that had happened in more than a century. This, combined with Kerry’s narrow loss, led some Democrats to publicly vent their frustration with the Electoral College, using the counting of the electoral votes as a forum. All parties in 2005 knew that this vote was moot. That’s because two days after the polls had closed in November, Kerry conceded the election to Bush, saying, ""I spoke to President Bush and I offered him and Laura our congratulations on their victory. We had a good conversation, and we talked about the danger of division in our country and the need, the desperate need, for unity, for finding the common ground, coming together. Today I hope that we can begin the healing."" And not long before the counting of the electoral votes, Kerry made clear that he did not support an electoral-vote challenge. ""Our legal teams on the ground have found no evidence that would change the outcome of the election,"" Kerry said in the letter. The contrast with the weeks after the election of 2020 were stark. Trump never conceded his election loss. To the contrary, he aggressively pushed a legal battle to overturn the election, offered regular statements that claimed widespread voting fraud, and tried to convince his vice president, Mike Pence, to throw out slates of electoral votes. Pence refused. In the middle of the count of the electoral votes, rioters overran the Capitol building. They finished the job after the building was cleared. The bottom line is that the possibility of an impact from electoral vote objections was real in 2021 in a way that it was not in 2005. On Jan. 6, 2021, six Republican senators objected to counting the Biden slate for Arizona, joined by 121 Republican House members. A second objection, involving Pennsylvania, drew the support of seven GOP senators and 138 GOP House members. The House Republican Conference tweeted, ""Bennie Thompson objected to the 2004 Presidential election."" Thompson was one of 31 Democrats who voted to object to Ohio’s slate in 2005, when the electoral votes from the 2004 election were officially counted in a joint session of Congress.  That said, the 2005 objection had different implications, since Kerry had both conceded the election to Bush and had stated his opposition to the objection effort in Congress. By contrast, the loser in 2020, Trump, was aggressively pursuing a campaign to overturn the election, including by efforts to convince Pence to reject electoral vote slates. As a result, the objections in 2021 could have overturned the presidential election. With that clarification, we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2022/jun/10/house-republicans/fact-checking-whether-bennie-thompson-objected-200/

Washington Commanders’ Jack Del Rio downplays Jan. 6 attack as a ‘dust-up’
","Washington Commanders defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio joined a chorus of denial and deflection about the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, when he dismissed the assault as a ""dust-up.""  In the 18 months since the attack, some conservatives have downplayed the riot as nothing more than a protest or even a ""normal tourist visit."" PolitiFact named these claims the 2021 Lie of the Year. Del Rio’s claim came a day before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack prepared to hold its first hearing of the summer. Reporters covering the NFL team asked Del Rio after practice about a recent tweet he made that questioned why racial justice protests over the 2020 death of George Floyd were ""never discussed but this is???"" Del Rio doubled down. ""Let’s get right down to it. What did I ask, a simple question,"" Del Rio said in the June 8 interview.  ""Why are we not looking into those things? I can realistically look at it. I can see the images on T.V. People’s livelihoods are being destroyed. Businesses are being burned down. No problem. And then we have a dust-up at the Capitol. Nothing burned down, and we’re gonna make that a major deal. I just think, it’s two standards. And if we apply the same standard and we are going to be reasonable with each other, let’s have a discussion."" His claim that the events that unfolded at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, amounted to ""a dust-up"" is disproven by evidence of violence described in hundreds of court filings against participants that day, hours of video footage, and testimony from police and other witnesses who were overtaken by rioters and sustained injuries.  The summer protests that swept across the country in the wake of Floyd’s death resulted in over 13,500 arrests, according to the Prosecution Project. Del Rio apologized for the ""dust-up"" comment later in the day, calling his remark ""irresponsible and negligent."" A spokesperson for the Commanders told PolitiFact that the team had no further comment. Here are some of the things that rioters did on Jan. 6, 2021: They scaled walls, forced their way through barricades and past law enforcement to breach the building. They smashed windows and broke doors. They ransacked offices. They chanted ""Hang Mike Pence!"" They attacked police officers. They caused the House and Senate to shut down for several hours on the day they were certifying the presidential election.  Court documents outlining conspiracy charges show members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group, posted messages on social media discussing plans to show up on Jan. 6 ""incognito."" Some of the rioters grabbed a police officer, dragged him and struck him in the head and body with various objects, according to charging documents. Another rioter used a metal flagpole to attack a police officer. Over 850 people across the U.S. face charges in the riot that include obstruction, assault, violence with a deadly weapon and destruction and theft of government property. Del Rio dismissed the breach of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as a ""dust-up."" It was much more than that. Extensive evidence shows that the crowd of Trump supporters broke down barricades, attacked police, scaled walls, shattered windows and broke into offices in a violent effort to disrupt the transition of presidential power.  We rate this claim False.

Autism, allergies and other diseases and disorders afflicted baby boomers, too
","We accepted a challenge put forth by a recent Facebook post suggesting that children today suffer from more diseases than baby boomers did when they were kids.  ""Baby boomers had measles, mumps and chicken pox,"" said a post shared in a group advocating for ""vaccine rights."" ""Today’s kids have SIDs, autism, seizures, allergies, diabetes, cancer, speech delay, colic, ear tubes, HFMD, eczema and RSV. Time to start researching why…"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s get to it.  Measles, mumps and chickenpox Before measles vaccines became available in the United States in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people caught the virus each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Widespread use of a vaccine protecting against the measles virus has led to a greater than 99% reduction in cases compared with the pre-vaccine era, the CDC says.  Mumps is a similar case. Once a common childhood disease, caes decreased more than 99% after its vaccine program started in 1967.  Chickenpox was also once common in the United States. In the early 1990s, about 4 million people in the U.S. caught it each year. Now, fewer than 350,000 people get it annually. That’s because a chickenpox vaccine became available in the United States in 1995, drastically cutting the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths.  Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) The term ""sudden infant death syndrome"" was first proposed in 1969, but it’s not a modern phenomenon, according to a book by a neuroscientist and a forensic pathologist about the past, present and future of SIDS. Today, SIDS refers to the death of a seemingly healthy infant younger than 1 who dies under inexplicable circumstances, even after an investigation and autopsy. Cases of sudden death of healthy infants have been recorded for thousands of years, the book says. Some academics cite as the example of an Old Testament story about an argument between two mothers, one of whom discovered her baby dead in the night.  Autism Autism has been a diagnosis for decades, though its definition has changed over time, and it didn’t feature in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, a handbook used by clinicians to diagnose illnesses and disorders, until 1980. Donald Triplett, born in 1933, was the first person diagnosed with autism, appearing in child psychiatrist Leo Kanner’s 1943 paper ""Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact"" as ""Case 1, Donald T.""  Hans Asperger, a pediatrician at the University of Vienna, described numerous children he observed as ""autistic"" in 1938. Other cases elsewhere in the world went undetected. The Smithsonian describes a man from the mid-1800s who was considered an ""idiot"" in the parlance of the time but who today would likely be diagnosed with autism.  Autism is being diagnosed more today than in previous generations, but it wasn’t foreign to the baby boomers.  Seizures Anti-epiletic drugs, used to combat seizures, have been around since the early 1940s, when baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) started to come on the scene. But children were having seizures well before that. In England, for example, children were first admitted to a colony for people with epilepsy starting in 1909.  Child neurology is a relatively new medical specialty, according to a 2003 article in the journal Pediatric Research, but it ""traces its origins to the Hippocratic descriptions of seizures and other neurologic conditions in children. Its true beginnings can be traced to the 1600s and 1700s with classical descriptions of chorea, hydrocephalus, spina bifida, and polio.""  Allergies In 1859, a doctor in England who suffered from what were then called ""summer colds"" — seasonal sneezing, runny nose — experimented on himself and discovered his symptoms were caused by pollen, according to a 2018 National Geographic article on the history of allergies. Our understanding of allergies has changed over time, particularly in the early 1950s with the discovery of mast cells that are packed with different chemicals, such as histamine, which produce symptoms of an allergic reaction. But ""allergies are not new,"" the article says. ""Such reactions have been described in historical documents with asthma symptoms recorded in ancient China, Rome, Egypt and Greece."" Still, food allergy rates among children have risen in recent decades, the BBC reported, and some researchers suspect this is because of diet and pollution, among other factors.   Diabetes Diabetes dates back to 1500 B.C., though instances of childhood Type 1 diabetes started increasing in multiple countries around the late 1950s. Type 2 diabetes, meanwhile, was previously unheard of in children and teenagers, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine but is increasingly being diagnosed in young people. Many public health experts say childhood obesity is the culprit.  Cancer Cancer did not skip the baby boomer generation when they were children. There are well-documented accounts of cases in the 1940s.  According to the National Cancer Institute, incidence of childhood cancer has been rising slightly in recent decades. (Survival rates have also increased by 18 to 27%, depending on the age of affected children and teens, from the mid-1970s to the 2010s.)  Speech delay Speech pathology as a field has grown over the years, but language delay is not a new condition. Before 1940, according to a 1990 dissertation on the development of speech pathology in the United States, nine states recognized speech delays legislatively, and in 1925, four universities had awarded 20 degrees to graduate students with theses focusing on the scientific aspects of speech.  ""Speech and its defects have been treated or mistreated for centuries by a variety of professions,"" the paper says. ""Records describing defective speech and its treatment have been traced back to the fifth century B.C."" Colic Colic, or intense and frequent fussiness in infants, also isn’t new. Opium was once used to treat excessive crying, and in the 1800s, it was an ingredient in a syrup used to quiet babies.  Ear Tubes Ear tubes, developed to relieve infection in the middle ear, were first used in the late 1890s and reinvented in the 1950s, the Virginian-Pilot reported. In 2007, NPR warned that while about 500,000 children have ear tubes implanted surgically every year, experts think about one-third don’t need them.  Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) HFMD was first reported in New Zealand in 1957, and the first recognized outbreak happened in Singapore in 1970. It’s a common and usually mild childhood illness.  Eczema  The term atopic dermatitis — better known as eczema — dates back to 1933, but ""despite its recent introduction into our medical lexicon, historical precursors of atopic dermatitis date back to at least as early as 69-140 CE,"" according to a 2017 paper on its history. That was during the Roman Empire, well before baby boomers were born.  A 2003 study found that the rate of children who suffer eczema had tripled since the 1970s, though the reason was unclear, according to the Guardian. ""Improvements in hygiene may mean that there are fewer chances for babies to develop immunity to the condition, and genetics, environment and diet may also be factors,"" the paper said.   Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) RSV, a common respiratory virus that can be dangerous for infants and older adults, was first discovered in 1956 ""and has since been recognized as one of the most common causes of childhood illness,"" the CDC says. In the United States, hospitalization rates have risen during previous decades, according to a 2016 history of the disease.  Our ruling This post wrongly suggests that baby boomers only suffered measles, mumps and chickenpox while children today endure a slew of new ailments. While cases of some of these diseases and disorders are more prevalent now than they were in children born in the 1940s to the mid-1960s, these are not new illnesses.  Some people commenting on the post also connected the supposed new medical problems to vaccines, but there’s no credible evidence to support that. Meanwhile, vaccines have reduced cases of measles, mumps and chickenpox among children today.  We rate this post Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/jun/09/facebook-posts/autism-allergies-and-other-diseases-and-disorders-/
