Land documents claiming Ukrainian officials bought fancy properties in Switzerland are forged
","Did top Ukrainian officials spend lavishly on fancy homes in Switzerland as Ukraine received billions of U.S. dollars to help defend itself in a war with Russia?  No, and documents that supposedly support this claim are forgeries, a Swiss official said.  A headline from Newspunch, a site that has spread misinformation in the past, states: ""High-ranking Ukrainian officials caught splurging on luxury real estate in Switzerland.""  The headline spread to Facebook, and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article said its claims are based on a ""fact-checked"" Newspunch investigation. It links to tweets from @AZMilitary1, which has previously spread misleading information about Finland’s ties to Nazis and other topics. Newspunch’s article and the related tweets claim to show Swiss land registry documents and allege that three people who have ties to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased multimillion dollar properties in Gstaad, a Swiss resort town. The officials named are Dmitry Razumkov, a politician, Oleksandr Danyliuk, a former National Security and Defense Council secretary, and Lyudmila Denisova, a former human-rights official. Denisova has since said that her firing was initiated by Zelenskyy.  But the documents are fake. The Land Registry Oberland in Bern, Switzerland, keeps records about properties in Gstaad. Adrian Mühlematter, the Land Registry Oberland’s managing land registry administrator, told PolitiFact that the documents about the Ukrainian officials were forgeries.  Mühlematter sent us an article from the Swiss German-language newspaper Berner Zeitung that said the claim began with a blogger loyal to the Kremlin, who tweets in German under the alias Gagarin. A Berner Zeitung reporter discovered that the documents were forged because they contain inconsistencies, including land registry property numbers that do not match the addresses and identifying numbers that have insufficient digits. The documents also claim to be the first page of a five-page document. But Mühlematter said that typically only agricultural properties, because of listed easements, have documents that long.  Newspunch’s article used the fake documents to try to convince readers that Ukraine’s government is corrupt and therefore undeserving of foreign aid. The article said: ""Did anybody stop to think that sending billions of dollars in no-strings-attached aid to one of Europe’s poorest countries — that also happens to be one of the world’s most corrupt countries — might be a poor use of U.S. taxpayer funds?"" However, the article also said there is ""no evidence"" that U.S. funds were used to purchase these Swiss properties.   PolitiFact asked Newspunch for evidence to support its claims but received none.  A website claimed that three high-ranking Ukrainian officials had purchased luxury property in the resort town of Gstaad, Switzerland. A Swiss land registry official said the documents cited as evidence were forged; errors in them prove that they did not come from the registry, the official said.  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F1F300>],/factchecks/2022/jul/13/blog-posting/land-documents-claiming-ukrainian-officials-bought/

Fact-checking Charlie Crist's claim that DeSantis 'hasn’t condemned' Jan. 6
","U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, criticized Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, for his ""silence"" on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Although Florida is the state with the largest number of people arrested in connection with the attack, DeSantis has referenced the Jan. 6 riots sparingly. That reticence led his Democratic opponents for re-election to suggest he endorsed the attack. ""Just your weekly reminder that Ron DeSantis still hasn't condemned the Jan. 6 insurrection OR denounced the election Big Lie,"" Crist tweeted on June 29. ""Is it just me, or do you agree that his silence = endorsement?"" Crist has repeated such rhetoric at least seven times on Twitter. With the House select committee hearings on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot underway, we wanted to look at DeSantis' comments about the incident. Let's review. Immediately after the attack, lawmakers — both Republicans and Democrats — publicly criticized the people who incited the violence.  DeSantis issued a statement on Jan. 6, 2021, condemning the Capitol riot: ""Violence or rioting of any kind is unacceptable, and the perpetrators must face the full weight of the law."" He reiterated the message during a coronavirus briefing on Jan. 7, 2021.  ""It was totally unacceptable and those folks need to be held accountable,"" DeSantis said. ""It doesn't matter what banner you're flying under — the violence is wrong, the rioting and disorder is wrong."" PolitiFact found no other direct condemnation of the riot by DeSantis in Google search results or the Nexis news database. When we asked Crist's campaign about his claim, press secretary Sam Ramirez said DeSantis has remarked on the violence at the Capitol, ""but not the insurrection itself."" ""The governor refuses to acknowledge it even was an insurrection,"" Ramirez said.  Although DeSantis denounced the violence and disorder on Jan. 6, 2021, he hasn't called it an insurrection and has decried the media's coverage.  On the anniversary of the Capitol riot, DeSantis likened Jan. 6 to ""Christmas"" for ""D.C.-New York media,"" saying the incident lets news outlets create ""narratives that are negative"" about former President Donald Trump's supporters. ""They are going to take this and milk this for anything they could to try to be able to smear anyone who ever supported Donald Trump,"" DeSantis said at a press conference.  ""When they try to act like this is something akin to the Sept. 11 attacks, that is an insult to the people who were going into those buildings,"" DeSantis said. ""And it's an insult to people when you say it's an 'insurrection' and then a year later, nobody has been charged with that."" Still, DeSantis maintained that holding Jan. 6 participants accountable for their actions was appropriate: ""Look, if you obstruct a proceeding, you've got to hold people accountable, hold rioting accountable.""  However, referring to House Select Committee hearings, DeSantis said Democrats were ""beating a dead horse"" and trying to ""divert attention"" from inflation.  ""Gov. DeSantis stands for law and order,"" Christina Pushaw, DeSantis press secretary, told PolitiFact. ""He has always condemned all rioting and unlawful behavior, regardless of any political affiliations."" Crist said DeSantis ""hasn't condemned the Jan. 6 insurrection."" That's wrong. He has condemned the riot on at least two occasions.  After the attack, DeSantis called the violence ""unacceptable,"" adding that the rioters should ""face the full weight of the law."" During a coronavirus briefing the following day,  he reiterated that regardless of ""what banner you're flying under,"" rioting is wrong. More recently, DeSantis has been careful not to characterize the incident as an insurrection. On the riot's anniversary, DeSantis said labeling the incident an insurrection and likening it to ​​the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is ""an insult."" In the same remarks, however, he said rioting needed to be held accountable. We rate Crist's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B55300>],/factchecks/2022/jul/12/charlie-crist/fact-checking-charlie-crists-claim-desantis-hasnt-/

Claims that Russia bombed Ukraine’s Snake Island have not been independently verified
","Russia’s losses throughout the invasion of Ukraine have been characterized as humiliating defeats for the country, and a Facebook video suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the bombing of Snake Island in the Black Sea following the retreat of Russian forces from the territory.  Ukraine has been striking the island to eliminate Russian outposts; news outlets reported that Russian forces left after Ukraine said it bombarded the island with artillery. ""EXTREMELY TERRIBLE,"" the July 2 post says. ""PUTIN humiliatingly blows up all weapons and facilities of the Russian Army after being defeated."" A video with the post claims Putin was unwilling to see ""tens of hundreds of dollars"" of military equipment left behind by Russian forces land in the hands of Ukrainians, and sent warplanes to drop phosphorus bombs on the island. ""A humiliating setback for the Russian military, Putin was pushed to the brink when no one could save the Russian army on Snake Island,"" the video said. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Snake Island, though occupying just 0.06 square miles (42 acres), has played a significant role during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The island, also called Serpent Island or Zmiinyi Island, is around 22 miles off the coast of both Ukraine and Romania, which is a NATO member.   It became the site of a conflict early in the invasion on Feb. 24 when a group of Ukrainian soldiers stationed on the island refused to surrender to a Russian warship. The Ukrainian soldiers were fired upon by the Russians and eventually turned themselves over to the warship because they lacked ammunition to continue their defense. The takeover of Snake Island by Russian forces effectively led to a naval blockade on Ukraine and prevented the export of wheat and corn from the country. Both Ukraine and Russia are considered Europe's breadbasket, accounting for 30% of the world's wheat exports and 20% of corn exports. The invasion halted those exports, through the blockade against Ukraine and trade sanctions placed against Russia.   Snake Island remained under Russian control until June 30, when the country’s defense ministry announced it was withdrawing troops from the area as a ""gesture of goodwill"" following increasing attacks on the island from Ukrainian troops. Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, went on the messaging service Telegram to accuse the Russians of dropping phosphorus bombs on the island at 6 p.m. July 1, a day after the withdrawal. ""Today at around 18:00 ... Russian air force SU-30 planes twice conducted strikes with phosphorus bombs on Zmiinyi island"" Zaluzhnyy said, using the Ukrainian name for the island. The Ukrainian government shared black-and-white footage reportedly showing the island being bombed by Russian planes. Media outlets reporting on the bombing have been unable to confirm the veracity of the video or the attack. The Russian government has not commented. Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukraine defense minister, told The New York Times the bombing footage looked weird, as it appeared most of the shots missed destroying anything of value on the island. That’s a far cry from the Facebook post's claim that ""all weapons and facilities"" were blown up.  The Ukrainian government has previously accused Russian troops of using white phosphorus bombs, which can cause severe, long-lasting skin burns. Instances in which Ukraine has claimed Russia used white phosphorus bombs have not been independently verified.   A Facebook post claims Russia used white phosphorus bombs on Snake Island off the Ukrainian coast after withdrawing troops from the area. The post said the attack was intended to destroy all Russian military weapons and facilities that were left behind. The Ukrainian military announced the attack and provided footage apparently showing the island being bombed, but the footage has not been independently verified and Russia has not responded to the accusation. A preliminary analysis of the video found the attack didn’t destroy much of anything on the island.  Because Russian troops did withdraw from the island, we rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CA3D80>],/factchecks/2022/jul/12/facebook-posts/claims-russia-bombed-ukraines-snake-island-after-t/

Fluoride is safe in your toothpaste and drinking water, experts say
","Can a substance that requires crews to wear hazardous materials gear to clean it up after a spill be safe to drink or use to brush your teeth? Well, yes, experts told PolitiFact as we checked a claim about the safety of fluoride, a subject of misinformation we’ve tackled several times over the years. ""Fluoride exposed,"" reads the caption on a Facebook reel posted on June 24, 2022. The video’s narrator said he’s heard a lot about fluoride safety, so he went to the website of Colgate, the maker of toothpaste and other consumer hygiene products. He sarcastically highlighted the site’s claim that fluoride is ""safe and effective."" ""Now when this very safe chemical spills, this is who comes to clean it up,"" the narrator said, showing an image of workers in hazmat suits cleaning up what he said was a spill in Ohio. He said the chemical ""will literally eat a hole through a road if it’s spilled on, but it’s for your teeth,"" implying that it’s not safe to use. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A reverse image search shows that the images of crews in hazmat gear o are from a 2011 video report from WQAD — an ABC TV station in Moline, Illinois — about a spill of hydrofluorosilicic acid in nearby Rock Island (not in Ohio, as the video claims). An article on that station’s website said the chemical leaked from a tanker truck at a water treatment plant, where it was being used to add fluoride to the plant’s water supply. A fire official in the report described the chemical as a ""corrosive agent,"" and the article said it had begun eating through concrete before crews safely contained the spill.  The claim that because the chemical that spilled is corrosive, it’s not safe in your toothpaste is wrong on a couple of points, experts told PolitiFact. It misunderstands both the process used to fluoridate drinking water and what type of fluoride is in your toothpaste. ""​​This type of misleading information is commonly spread by fluoridation opponents who have little or no understanding of the science of water fluoridation,"" said Steven Slott, a spokesperson for the American Fluoridation Society, a group promoting community water fluoridation. First, the hydrofluorosilicic acid, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is one of three types of fluoride additives used in U.S. water supplies, arrives at water treatment plants in concentrated form. Like any chemical, hydrofluorosilicic acid can be dangerous to people who come into contact with it, such as in the spill referenced in the video, experts said. But water treatment plants are equipped to handle such chemicals, and HFA doesn't actually reach consumers. The fluoride produced by it is then diluted to safe levels in the water supply. ""One drop of that fluoride additive in its concentrated form is diluted by 250,000 drops of water. The resultant fluoride concentrations delivered to homes and businesses for the community is at a concentration that is at 0.7 parts per million,"" said Dr. Howard Pollick, a spokesperson on fluoridation for the American Dental Association. Pollick is also a consultant on fluoridation for the California Department of Public Health and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry. ""This has been established as the effective and safe concentration of fluoride in drinking water to help prevent tooth decay, which can be a very serious disease if it's not prevented or taken care of,"" Pollick said. Water fluoridation has been happening in the U.S. since 1945, and studies in the decades since have shown it to be safe for Americans, the CDC and the ADA said. Hydrofluorosilicic acid is actually not fluoride, said Slott, who described fluoride as an anion, or a negatively charged atom, of the naturally occurring element, fluorine. Here’s how he explains the science behind water fluoridation with this particular additive. ""HFA is a compound containing this ion, which is used as a vehicle to add these ions to water that has an insufficient amount of existing fluoride ions to prevent dental decay. The fluoride ions added with HFA are identical to those which already exist in water naturally. They are all sourced from the same rocks in nature,"" Slott said.  Once it’s added to water, the acid ""immediately and completely hydrolyzes,"" or dissociates, into fluoride ions and an insignificant amount of trace contaminants, he said. ""At this point, HFA no longer exists in the water. It is gone prior to leaving the treatment plant. HFA therefore does not reach the tap and is not consumed by anyone,"" Slott said. Pollick said fluoride is just one of several additives used in water treatment. Others are used ""to regulate bacteria, to regulate viruses, to regulate other kinds of substances that get into water."" He added that water treatment plants have safeguards to ensure that levels of fluoride or any other additive do not exceed safe levels. The fluoride in your toothpaste does not contain the hydrofluorosilicic acid used to add fluoride to drinking water, Pollick said.  ""It's very different. There are many, many different kinds of fluoride compounds,"" he said. ""The compounds in fluoride toothpaste are typically stannous fluoride or sodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate."" Those are added to the products at safe levels, ""about 1,000 parts per million,"" Pollick said.  Colgate’s website lists all three of those as ingredients in its products. A Facebook video claims that because a chemical used to fluoridate water supplies spilled and required crews in hazmat gear to clean it up, fluoride isn’t safe to use in toothpaste. The chemical spill referenced in the video was hydrofluorosilicic acid, which can indeed pose a danger in concentrated form to someone who touches it. But when it’s used to fluoridate water supplies, the acid turns into fluoride ions and is diluted to safe levels. The hydrofluorosilicic acid doesn’t leave the treatment plant, experts said. Also, toothpastes do not use hydrofluorosilicic acid, but rather one of three types of fluoride compounds, again diluted to safe levels. We rate this claim False.  UPDATE, July 13, 2022: This story has been updated to add more details about the process through which hydrofluorosilicic acid is used to fluoridate water. The rating remains the same.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097266400>],/factchecks/2022/jul/12/facebook-posts/fluoride-safe-your-toothpaste-and-drinking-water-e/

The weapons bought by the July 4 Highland Park shooter were purchased legally
","A high-profile shooting that killed seven people and wounded many others on July 4 called attention to Illinois’ gun laws, which are considered some of the more restrictive in the U.S. Some social media users claimed Robert Crimo III, the 21-year-old who authorities say confessed to opening fire during an Independence Day celebration in Highland Park, obtained his firearms illegally. ""He bought the gun illegally,"" the July 5 post read. ""You FBI better step up on your game."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The overall post is riddled with misinformation and debunked narratives about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting in May. The post’s initial claim is wrong, too. Crimo’s weapons were purchased legally.  Crimo had a history of encounters with local police, but he was not barred from buying guns. In April 2019, police responded to a report that he had attempted suicide. In September 2019, he made threats that prompted local law enforcement officials to temporarily seize knives and a sword Crimo had kept in a closet.  In December 2019, Crimo applied for a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card, which is needed to legally buy firearms in Illinois. This was about three months after Highland Park police had filed a ""clear and present danger"" report about Crimo because of his threats. Because he was younger than 21 at the time, Crimo’s application included a legal guardian affidavit signed by his father.  Crimo legally obtained his FOID card in 2020 after his application was reviewed, The Chicago Tribune reported. He also passed four background checks when purchasing firearms between June 2020 and September 2021. His criminal history included a possession of tobacco violation and he had no ""mental health prohibitor reports,"" according to law enforcement.  From 2020 and 2021, authorities say Crimo legally purchased five guns, including the one he used during the July 4 attack, Reuters reported. Illinois has a red flag law that would have allowed Crimo’s family or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily prevent Crimo from possessing or obtaining firearms because he was considered dangerous. In this case, however, neither law enforcement nor any family members filed a petition seeking to prevent Crimo from acquiring guns. A Facebook post claimed that Crimo ""bought the gun illegally."" Investigators told news outlets that Crimo obtained the proper identification to legally purchase firearms and passed several background checks before ultimately buying his weapons legally.

Anti-abortion group exaggerates how states regulate late-term abortions
","Focus on the Family cheered the toppling of Roe v. Wade, declaring the Supreme Court’s decision ""the most consequential legal ruling of our lifetime."" Several days later, the evangelical Christian group bought ads on Facebook and Instagram warning about late-term abortions in several states where the procedure remains legal.  One ad claimed:  ""Did you know that abortion is available all nine months of pregnancy in New Mexico — even up until the moment before birth and for any reason?"" Besides New Mexico, ads with the same text singled out Oregon, Alaska, Vermont and New Jersey. The ads urged viewers to sign online petitions against the ""extreme abortion law"" in each state. Earlier Focus on the Family ads claimed that Colorado’s law ""allows for abortion at any point of pregnancy — right up to delivery, no questions asked!"" Laws in those six states, as well as in the District of Columbia, do not explicitly prohibit an abortion from being performed at any stage of pregnancy. But abortions later in pregnancy are rare, and are generally not being done ""up until the moment before birth and for any reason.""  These abortions are performed on a case-by-case basis when there are maternal or fetal complications, said Laurie Sobel, associate director of women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, an authority on heath care information.  ""People cannot opt for an abortion instead of child birth when they are full term,"" she said. The overall number of abortions done each year in the United States is difficult to peg. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research organization, contacts abortion providers and uses other data to make estimates every three years. The group estimated in its latest report that there were 930,160 abortions in 2020, an increase of 8% from 2017.  The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest count, published last November, that there were 629,898 abortions in 2019, up 2% from 2018. That’s based on reports by health agencies, though a few states, including California, did not report.  The vast majority of abortions are performed early in pregnancy, according to the CDC report. Nearly 93% of abortions in 2019 were done during the first trimester, at or before 13 weeks gestation, and about 6% occurred between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. Less than 1% were performed at 21 weeks or later. A CDC spokesperson said the agency does not have more detailed statistics on abortions performed at or after 21 weeks. When PolitiFact asked Focus on the Family to back up its claims, a spokesperson referred us to a WorldPopulationReview.com article. The article said the District of Columbia and seven states ""allow for late-term abortions with no state-imposed thresholds."" (The Focus on the Family ads focused on six states, not including New Hampshire.) ""Thresholds"" was a reference to how late in a pregnancy an abortion could be performed. We reviewed research from Guttmacher and KFF and found that in New Hampshire, as part of the state budget that took effect Jan. 1, abortion is generally banned after 24 weeks.  Abortion is not prohibited at a specific gestational age before fetal viability in the District of Columbia and in the other six states cited in the article. However, these abortions are rare in each state.  Here are their regulations and a look at how often abortions are done at or after 21 weeks, which is one marker the CDC and states use in reporting on abortions: Alaska: There is no law permitting or banning abortion, meaning it likely will remain legal there, at least in the immediate future. The Alaska Supreme Court recognized the right to abortion under the state constitution. Two of the 1,226 abortions (0.2%) performed in Alaska in 2021 were done at or after 21 weeks, according to the state. Colorado: The state passed a law in 2022 directly allowing access to abortions. An anti-abortion activist falsely claimed that the law was ""legalizing abortions through all nine months, up until the moment of birth."" In 2021, 1.5% of abortions in Colorado were done at or after 21 weeks, according to the state. New Jersey: The state passed a law in 2022 directly allowing access to abortions. Even though the law does not prohibit abortions at any stage of pregnancy, New Jersey’s providers do not perform them after 24 to 26 weeks, Dr. Glenmarie Matthews, director of the Reproductive Choice Program at New Jersey Medical School, told PolitiFact. Any procedure near the end of pregnancy, she added, would be induced labor, not an abortion. ""No one’s doing that. It doesn't exist. People are just using their wild imaginations,"" she said.  New Mexico: The state has no law permitting or banning abortion, meaning it likely will remain legal there, at least in the immediate future. The latest state figures show that in 2019, 1.8% of abortions were done at 21 weeks or after. University of New Mexico Health offers first- and second-trimester (after 14 weeks) abortions. It does not provide third-trimester abortions, a spokesperson said.  Oregon: The state passed a law in 2017 directly allowing access to abortions. In 2020, about 1.57% of abortions were performed at or after 21 weeks, according to the state’s latest figures. An anti-abortion group said following the Roe reversal that it plans to bring a bill to Oregon lawmakers to ban abortion later in pregnancy.  Vermont: The state passed a law in 2019 directly allowing access to abortions. The latest available state data shows that 1.5% of the abortions performed in 2019 occurred at or after 21 weeks. No providers in Vermont perform elective abortions after 22 weeks, Stephanie Winters, deputy director of the Vermont Medical Society, told PolitiFact. When these abortions are done, ""it is not because of an unwanted pregnancy, these are medical reasons,"" she said. Focus on the Family said in ads that abortion ""is available all nine months of pregnancy"" in Alaska, Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon and Vermont, ""even up until the moment before birth and for any reason."" Under laws in those six states, abortion is not specifically prohibited at any stage of pregnancy. But late-term abortions are rare and usually for urgent medical reasons. Nationally, less than 1% of abortions are performed at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy, and they are roughly as rare in the states where there is no time prohibition on abortion. Near full term, contrary to what the ads suggest, abortions are not done, experts say. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Milwaukee’s hotels and restaurants would benefit from RNC visitors, despite community concerns
","While the mayor and Milwaukee political leaders have welcomed the possibility of hosting the 2024 Republican National Convention, a group of liberal community groups from across the state has decried the effort. The coalition includes Voces de la Frontera Action, Never Again is Now, SEIU Wisconsin State Council, Freedom Action Now and Black Leaders Organizing Communities. The groups issued a statement on June 2 , 2022, urging Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson not to seek the convention.  The statement listed a series of disadvantages to the convention, including this claim: ""Milwaukee’s hotels and restaurants are already filled during the summer. The RNC convention will simply replace those who normally visit our city."" Is that accurate? VISIT Milwaukee, the city’s convention and visitors bureau, spearheaded the bid for the 2024 RNC and has noted that winning it would put Milwaukee in the national spotlight and elevate the city as a convention destination. According to VISIT Milwaukee, the city should anticipate visitors reaching about 45,000 during the convention – a figure that includes 2,551 delegates, plus family members, media, operations personnel and more. A spokesperson said the city will need to secure 16,000 rooms for the convention. (For the 2020 Democratic National Convention, which mainly went virtual due to COVID, local organizers were able to secure 17,000 rooms.)  Peggy Williams-Smith, president and CEO of VISIT Milwaukee told WISN-TV in a March 22, 2022 report that there are roughly 19,000 hotel rooms in the City of Milwaukee. The main argument by the liberal groups is that during the convention period, these hotel rooms are typically already booked solid anyway. Therefore, the convention itself would create a substitution effect and not really bring new people – and their money — to the city. We’ll set aside the fact that it is a major part of VISIT Milwaukee’s job to fill those very rooms (by bringing conventions to town and promoting Milwaukee as a tourist destination), and zero in on the numbers. If Milwaukee wins the bid, the convention could be held during one of three proposed windows: from July 9 to July 25, from Aug. 13 to Aug. 29, or from Aug. 20 to Sept. 5. During the same time periods in two recent years from before the pandemic, 2017 and 2018, occupancy rates hovered around 76% and 77% — with rooms costing anywhere between $140 and $175 per night, according to data from VISIT Milwaukee.  So, the groups are off on that point. As envisioned, the RNC would fill the rooms entirely. Much like the overall $200 million ""economic infusion"" expected if Milwaukee wins the bid, VISIT Milwaukee based total hotel room revenue projections on a study by Cleveland State University on the economic impact of the 2016 RNC in Cleveland. In Cleveland, the hotel occupancy rate went up 20.2% because of the convention, according to the study, and hotels had an average nightly rate at $290. VISIT Milwaukee has estimated a total economic impact of $200 million from the convention (we rated a claim from the mayor about the size of the impact Half True). Williams-Smith now says hotel revenue alone could tally $23.2 million over the five days – a much smaller figure than the $32 million estimate she provided for that earlier item. Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, who has studied the economic impact on cities that hosted the Republican and Democratic national conventions between 1970 and 2004, said it is important to note that some of the rooms would be full with or without the convention. ""Every hotel room is full and it’s full of delegates,"" Matheson said of estimates of the economic impact. ""This has a huge economic impact, but they forget to note that even if the RNC wasn’t in town, hotels are typically at 60% or 70% occupancy anyway. So they assume that those hotel rooms that are full of delegates would have been completely empty in the absence of the event. But of course we know that’s not true."" In any case, for purposes of this check, we are mainly interested in how full the rooms are – and all agree that they would not otherwise be at capacity during a typical week in August. So on the hotel side of the equation, the groups opposing the RNC are overstating their claim. The impact on restaurants is similar, but more anecdotal. According to the study of the 2016 Cleveland RNC, restaurants there saw much success and many visitors. The Cleveland study, which was carried out by a four-person team at Cleveland State University’s Center for Economic Development, conducted two case studies of restaurants in the Cleveland area – both reported that they thrived during the convention. As with hotel rooms, though, some of that business would be there with or without a convention. And the report did not mention how many diners were local residents versus conventiongoers. ""Hotel bars are going to do well,"" Matheson told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""If you’re a server and a hotel bar, your tips are likely to be pretty good."" While restaurants, bars and hotels may fare well during a megaevent such as a national political convention, safety concerns due to potential protests and heightened security may ""dissuade casual shoppers and diners and result in major disruptions for local residents,"" according to the study of past conventions. One example cited in the study was that during the 2004 RNC in New York City, attendance at Broadway shows fell more than 20% compared with the same week a year prior despite the influx of thousands of visitors attending the convention. ""Anyone in their right mind who works in and around downtown Milwaukee is going to take that week off,"" said Matheson. ""They’re not going to go to their usual happy hour place."" Liberal groups opposing the 2024 RNC in Milwaukee claimed: ""Milwaukee’s hotels and restaurants are already filled during the summer. The RNC convention will simply replace those who normally visit our city."" The groups have a point, in that the baseline is not zero. There are visitors who stay at hotels, and diners who eat at restaurants with or without a convention. But they vastly overstate the point by suggesting there would be no increase or benefit at all from the RNC. Statistics have shown a typical Milwaukee hotel occupancy rate of about 76% in August. And clearly all restaurants are not 100% full either. So there clearly would be some economic benefit to bringing the event to the city, even considering the substitution effect.   Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3DCFC0>],/factchecks/2022/jul/12/politifact-group/milwaukees-hotels-and-restaurants-would-benefit-rn/

In Virginia, 97.5% of abortions occur 15 weeks into pregnancy or sooner
","U.S. Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) is urging Republicans to protect life from the moment of conception and reject Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s efforts to strike a compromise with Democrats that would ban most Virginia abortions at 15 weeks.   ""Ninety-two percent of abortions in Virginia take place before 15 weeks,"" Good said Saturday during a rain-soaked rally on Capitol Square. Further angering Good, Younkin has also said the limit might have to be stretched to 20 weeks to gain needed bipartisan support in the General Assembly. ""Ninety-nine percent of abortions in Virginia take place before 20 weeks,"" Good said. He accused Youngkin and a panel of Republican negotiators of being open to a deal that would ban only 1% of abortions in Virginia. We fact-checked Good’s percentages and found that they are slightly understated.  Good’s campaign says his statistics come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most current CDC data shows there were 15,601 Virginia abortions reported in 2019 and 15,201 of them — or 97.5% — occurred at 15 weeks of pregnancy or earlier. That’s 5.5 percentage points higher than Good’s figure. CDC records show 15,511 Virginia abortions in 2019 — or 99.4% — occurred at or before the 21st week. Rounded down, that matches Good’s figure. Another way of stating this: 90 of 15,601 abortions in Virginia — or 0.6% — occurred after Youngkin’s potential 20-week fallback position. Here are the full CDC statistics on the number of 2019 abortions in Virginia based on weeks into pregnancy. Gestation, in this case, was determined by a clinician’s estimate of the date of conception. Six weeks or less, 7,917, or 50.8%; Seven to nine weeks, 5,215, or 33.5%; 10 to 13 weeks, 1,938, or 12.4%; 14 to 15 weeks, 121, or 0.8%; 16 to 17 weeks, 131, or 0.8%; 18 to 20 weeks, 179, or 1.1%; 21 weeks or more, 90, or 0.6%; 10 unreported conception dates. Nationally, women have abortions slightly later than in Virginia: 42.9% of abortions occur during the first six weeks; 98.9% in the first 20 weeks. The U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision in June has given states new power in limiting or banning abortions. Before the court’s recent ruling, states had to allow abortions until the point of fetal viability — the time when a fetus could survive outside the womb — which occurs at about 23rd week of pregnancy. Virginia allows abortions during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, or up to about 26 weeks. Third-trimester abortions are permitted only when three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would likely cause the death of a woman or ""substantially and irremediably impair (her) mental or physical health."" Youngkin has consistently stressed that he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when a woman’s life is endangered by a pregnancy. Although he has mentioned drawing lines at 15 and 20 weeks, the governor said he would be willing to sign ""any bill … to protect life.""  Virginia’s General Assembly is split, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats ruling the Senate. Youngkin has asked a group of four Republican legislators to propose an abortion bill that could win needed bipartisan support. Leading Senate Democrats have vowed that no new abortion limits will make it to the floor. Good, although not a member of the General Assembly, is urging no compromise on the opposite end of the abortion spectrum. In Congress, he is a co-sponsor of ""The Life at Conception Act,"" which would recognize rights from the ""moment of conception.""  Seeking to protect life from the moment of conception, Good said, ""Ninety-two percent of abortions in Virginia take place before 15 weeks."" He slightly understated his case. According to CDC, 97.5% of Virginia abortions in 2019 — the latest year for which data was available — occurred at 15 weeks or earlier. Good also said, ""Ninety-nine percent of abortions take place in Virginia take place before 20 weeks."" The actual figure is 99.4% and Good accurately rounded it down.

No evidence Shinzo Abe was assassinated over his response to COVID-19
","Authorities in Japan are working to piece together how and why a gunman assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe using a homemade firearm on July 8. Police said Tetsuya Yamagami, the 41-year-old shooter, denied having a political motive and told investigators he wanted to kill Abe because he believed Abe was affiliated with an organization he disliked, according to reports from the Guardian and other outlets.  Police did not identify the organization, but Japanese media reported it was a religious group that the shooter’s mother donated money to before she went bankrupt. The leader of the Japan branch of the Unification Church, whose members are colloquially referred to as ""Moonies"" and are believed by some experts to act like a cult, said Yamagami’s mother was a member.  The investigation into Abe’s assassination is continuing as of July 11. But amid the information gap, misinformation over what happened is spreading online. One conspiratorial Instagram post baselessly suggested that Abe was killed for shunning the COVID-19 vaccines and embracing the drug ivermectin as he led Japan’s pandemic response. ""Assassinated Japanese P.M. didn’t follow (World Economic Forum) orders,"" said the July 10 post. ""Didn’t mandate vaccines, sent 1.6 million doses back and gave citizens ivermectin. Make sense now?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is unsubstantiated and factually misleading; there’s no evidence Abe was killed over his COVID-19 response, and that response did not involve promoting ivermectin over vaccines. The notion that Japan under Abe had abandoned its vaccine rollout and started treating COVID-19 patients with ivermectin gained traction in October 2021 thanks to a false blog post from far-right radio host Hal Turner, who has a history of pushing conspiracy theories.  The Japanese government does not mandate COVID-19 vaccination. Japan in September 2021 recalled about 1.63 million doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines after a human error in production led to contamination. But Japan never stopped all vaccination efforts. The country has administered more than 280 million vaccine doses as of July 11, according to Our World in Data and Reuters. About 81% of the country has been fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data.  Ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, is not listed among the medications approved for COVID-19 by the Japanese government. (U.S. federal health agencies also do not approve ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19.) An Instagram post claimed that Abe was assassinated because he ""didn’t mandate vaccines, sent 1.6 million doses back and gave citizens ivermectin."" There is no evidence that Abe was killed for this reason; the investigation into his assassination continues, but police have said the shooter denied a political motive, according to reports. The Instagram post built on previously debunked allegations that Japan scrapped its vaccination efforts to focus on prescribing ivermectin for COVID-19.

Workman says Turner claims her homestead exemption in Fort Worth
","
Businessman Paul Workman, one of three Republicans vying for a Texas House seat representing the southwestern portion of Travis County, has lived in the county about 25 years longer than opponent Holly Turner, whose campaign says she moved to Austin from Forth Worth in July.

Workman has denounced her as a ""carpetbagger,"" and started airing a radio ad Feb. 18 that suggests Turner is too new to the district to hold office. Among his claims: She ""still takes her homestead exemption in Fort Worth.""

Does Workman have it right?

Craig Murphy, a spokesman for Turner's campaign, flatly denied the charge, saying: ""She doesn't have a homestead exemption in Forth Worth — she doesn't have a homestead exemption at all.""

Eric Bearse, a consultant for Workman's campaign, shot back: ""She is trying to disown the downtown Fort Worth condo she bragged about just five months ago in a publication.""

According to Murphy, Turner's husband, Chris, has owned a condominium in downtown Fort Worth since April 2006 — eight months before he and Turner married. The two are featured in the September 2009 issue of Fort Worth Magazine enjoying the digs.

Murphy said, however, that the couple moved to Austin in July 2009. Their son, Carter, started school in Austin in August.

Still, the Turners met the state's criteria to qualify for the exemption on their 2009 property taxes. That is, Chris Turner owned it and they occupied it as their primary residence on Jan. 1, 2009. Also, neither spouse claimed a homestead exemption on another property (legally, they can only claim one homestead exemption between them).

Holly Turner's name isn't on the deed, according to the Tarrant County property tax record — her husband's is, so he's the only one who can legally apply for and claim a homestead exemption for the property, said Mark Hutcheson, a partner at the Austin-based property tax law firm Popp, Gray & Hutcheson, LLP.

The exemption cut about $900 from his property taxes, which were paid from the couple's joint checking account Jan. 31, according to tax records.

Hutcheson said it's too soon to know if Chris Turner can claim a homestead exemption for 2010 because the Tarrant County Appraisal District won't re-evaluate whether the property qualifies for one until about April.

Murphy said the Turners have been trying to sell the Fort Worth property for about a year, though it's not currently on a multiple listing service. Jo Ann Hicks Royer, the director of relocation at Williams Trew in Forth Worth, a real estate company that listed the Turners' condominium for about six months, called the condo market ""very very slow.""

Hutcheson suggested it's appropriate for Holly Turner to say it's her husband's homestead exemption, not hers. Since her husband owned the condo since before they were married (we couldn't independently confirm this, but Murphy said they were married in New Zealand in December 2006), it's not community property, Hutcheson said.

But Judon Fambrough, an attorney at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University, suggested that regardless of who legally owns the property and seeks the homestead exemption benefit, Holly Turner still enjoys the resulting reduction in taxes. That's a common reality.

""Community... separate... it don't matter,"" Fambrough said. ""He'll get the tax statement so he can claim the homestead exemption and the wife will benefit.""

Until July, the Fort Worth condo was Holly and Chris Turner's primary residence. As such, it qualified for the state's homestead tax exemption.

While Holly Turner can't personally claim the exemption, it would be disingenuous to maintain that she didn't benefit from the tax break.

By the same token, to suggest that she doesn't live in Travis County because her husband received a home exemption for 2009 is misleading.

Workman could safely say his opponent enjoyed the tax benefits of her household's Tarrant County homestead exemption. He overreaches by saying Turner personally takes the exemption.

We rate Workman's statement as Barely True.

Reid calls nuclear waste issue 'solved'
","Nuclear power re-emerged as a hot-button issue earlier this month, when President Barack Obama announced that the Department of Energy was offering conditional loan guarantees worth $8.33 billion to support the construction and operation of two nuclear reactors in Burke, Ga. -- the first new nuclear generators to be built in nearly three decades. A return to nuclear power means new questions about the nation's long-term strategy for handling the nuclear waste created by electricity generation. Today, much of the nuclear waste produced by the electricity industry is stored where it was generated. But for years, the federal government has been planning to construct a single long-term storage facility where all of that waste can be consolidated. That site was to be at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. But the project has faced numerous technical, bureaucratic and political obstacles, and Obama made clear by the funding priorities in his fiscal year 2010 and 2011 budgets that the Yucca Mountain facility won't be the solution during his presidency. For many years, one of Yucca Mountain's most prominent -- and influential -- opponents has been Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. In a Feb. 19, 2010, television interview with Reid, Las Vegas-based political analyst Jon Ralston asked the senator about what the administration's interest in promoting new nuclear plants means for nuclear waste generally and Yucca Mountain specifically. ""What about the issue of everyone being so gung-ho now on nuclear power, including the president, when you still have not solved the waste problem?"" Ralston asked the senator. Reid responded, ""That's where you're wrong -- we have solved the problem."" Ralston interjected, ""It's sitting around at all these sites."" Reid replied, ""Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is, in deep ground storage. And when I say deep ground, (I mean) 10 feet underground. The new nuclear power plants are going to be built, and it's terrific that the president stepped forward on this. I'm not against nuclear power. I'm against bringing nuclear waste to Nevada. Scientists say leave it where it is. That's what we have to do."" We acknowledge that there's a raging political debate about what to do with nuclear waste. But in checking on Reid's statement, we were interested in whether there's a technical consensus about the most promising approach.We asked an array of nuclear waste experts -- in the nuclear power industry, in academia and in nuclear-skeptical nonprofit groups -- whether they thought that scientists generally agreed with Reid that the best way to store nuclear waste is at the scattered sites where it is produced.  Reid is correct that most nuclear scientists -- as well as the federal agency responsible for the industry, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- agree that storing nuclear waste on-site at a power plant or an off-site facility can be safe for 100 years. It's called ""dry cask storage."" According to the NRC, the system allows spent fuel -- a type of radioactive waste produced in the electricity-generation process -- that has already been cooled in water for at least one year to be surrounded by inert gas inside a container called a cask. In a ""confidence decision"" first made in 1990 and reaffirmed in 1999, the NRC declared dry casks to be safe for the storage of spent fuels for at least 100 years. As recently as May 12, 2009, NRC chairman Dale E. Klein stated that using the dry cask storage system, ""spent fuel can be safely and securely stored on site, without significant environmental impact, for at least 100 years."" Some industry watchdogs argue that the NRC's regulations should be more stringent, and there is professional disagreement on some of the technical issues of how, and for how long, dry-cask storage should be implemented. But experts we spoke to said that Reid is generally correct that dry-cask storage is a credible solution that can work effectively for many decades.  But the senator did not bring up a key qualifier -- that dry-cask storage is not typically envisioned as a long-term solution. While 100 years may seem like a long time to most people, in the life of radioactive decay it is but a blink in time. Most scientists agree that, over the longer term, one of two possible courses should be considered -- deep-geologic repositories, such as Yucca Mountain, or reprocessing, a technique that essentially recycles spent fuel into new material that can be used for power generation and other uses. The industry, for one, sees far broader support for the geologic solution than for Reid's approach. ""The scientific consensus since 1957 is that the best place for high-level radioactive waste, whether in the form of glass logs from reprocessing or used fuel, is deep geologic disposal,"" said Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry trade group. ""Even scientists, and there are only a few, who don’t like Yucca Mountain as a disposal site agree with the need for deep geologic disposal. No scientist we have ever heard of thinks that on-site storage at reactor sites is the best place for this material in the long run."" Edwin Lyman is a physicist and senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group that often crosses swords with the Nuclear Energy Institute. But asked about Reid's comment, Lyman agreed with the industry group, saying he is ""unaware of any significant support in the technical community for leaving spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites indefinitely. There is a broad consensus that interim storage of spent fuel in dry casks can be managed at reactor sites for at least several decades."" Lyman, like the Nuclear Energy Institute, says that deep-geologic storage eases security worries. Today, the security of on-site storage locations is relatively easy, since the adjoining nuclear generators have to be protected from intruders anyway. That becomes harder once a plant is decommissioned after a few decades of use. ""In the long run, institutional control over these sites cannot be assured,"" he said. ""Therefore, spent fuel, which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years, will need to be disposed of in a deep geologic repository that in theory is able to isolate the waste from the biosphere without the need for active controls.""  Other experts we spoke to agreed with Reid that a Yucca Mountain repository isn't a good answer -- but not even they join the senator in advocating scatter-site storage.  John Poston Sr., a nuclear engineer at Texas A&M University, said he favors reprocessing rather than using geologic storage, noting that it reduces the amount of waste that needs to be stored. (For the record, Reid told Ralston that he opposes reprocessing as well. ""How do you get the stuff to reprocess? Does it just show up one morning? ... You have to bring it there. ... We don't want to haul through here 77,000 tons from around the country."") Ultimately, our sources agreed, Reid jumps to an unjustifiable conclusion. ""I would say he's wrong in saying 'we have solved the problem,' "" said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear policy specialist at Harvard University. Dry casks are ""not a really long-term solution, and it ultimately needs to go underground."" They also agreed that Reid introduced a puzzling concept into his comments -- the idea that dry-cask storage typically occurs underground. In fact, in most cases today, the casks are stored above ground. ""The casks emit heat from their surface, produced by the radioactive decay of the material inside,"" said Clifford E. Singer, a professor of nuclear, plasma and radiological engineering at the University of Illinois. ""They can be located below grade but thus still need air circulating around them for many years, so 10 feet underground is possible but not the same as 'buried.'"" Jon Summers, a spokesman for Reid, defended the senator's statement. He argued that the dangers of transporting radiological materials around the United States outweigh the risks of keeping them where they are. He added that since the spent fuel needs to cool before being transported, these sites need to have technical and security infrastructure in place anyway. And he said that having a cushion of 100 years ""buys time"" to improve the technology to deal with radioactive waste. ""Sen. Reid agrees that dry-cask storage is not the permanent solution,"" which is why he supported creating a blue-ribbon commission to come up with recommendations for permanent disposal, Summers said. He added, though, that ""dry-cask storage is already securing waste at over half of the nation’s nuclear sites."" But even if you accept that Reid was merely advocating dry-cask storage as something less than a permanent solution -- an interpretation we did not make when saw the interview -- Reid's comment suggests a finality on this debate that simply isn't there. Using the word ""solved"" to describe a hard-fought and highly technical debate strikes us as inadvisable. So we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809755F180>],/factchecks/2010/feb/23/harry-reid/reid-calls-nuclear-waste-issue-solved/

Shami says White has major stake in Barnett Shale drilling company
","
Gubernatorial hopeful Bill White doesn’t shy away from energy issues — after all, he was mayor of Houston, a city that many oil and gas companies call home, and was deputy energy secretary for about two years during the Clinton administration.

More unusual by Houston — and Texas — standards, White touts initiatives undertaken during his six years as mayor to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals emitted by Houston's petrochemical industries.

But now Farouk Shami, White's leading Democratic opponent, is trying to use an energy issue against the former mayor, touching on concerns among residents and officials about the environmental and health effects of drilling in populated areas of the Barnett Shale, a natural gas field that stretches west and south from Dallas and covers more than 20 counties.

Shami released a statement Feb. 9 with this headline: ""Mayor White Has Major Stake in Barnett Shale Production Company."" In it, Shami concluded that ""it's a conflict of interest at best and utter hypocrisy at worst.""

First things first. Is White really connected to a company drilling for natural gas in the Barnett Shale?

Shami’s statement links White to the drilling through the former mayor’s ownership of stock in Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving. The oil giant is in the process of buying Fort Worth-based XTO Energy Inc., one of the leading producers of gas in the Barnett Shale. XTO says on its Web site that the area accounts for more than 20 percent of its total oil and natural gas production, and it has plans to expand its drilling there.

Shami's press release says White ""has at least $2.2 million invested in oil and gas stocks, with a substantial position in the giant Exxon Mobile"" (sic).

Asked how it calculated the size of White's investment, Shami's campaign provided a chart based on a federal financial disclosure form White filed in May 2009 when he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate. The campaign counted 14 energy companies in White’s portfolio during 2008, including Exxon and ConocoPhillips. Then it added up the reported values of White’s energy stock holdings.
 
Therein lies a problem. Instead of exact dollar amounts, the disclosure form lists a range of values for each stock, and some are pretty wide. For example, the reported value of White’s investment in BJ Services Co., an oil and gas services company on whose board he sits, is between $500,001 and $1 million – a difference of a half-million dollars. Totaling the high numbers yields $2.2 million; using the low numbers, $1 million.
 
In text with the chart, the Shami campaign used different language from the press release, which states that White has ""at least $2.2 million"" invested in oil and gas companies. The chart wording states White has ""as much as"" that amount.

A more definitive measure of White's holdings came from his campaign, which said his oil and gas stocks were worth $1.1 million to $1.3 million in 2009. They are in several accounts personally managed by White and account for about 25 percent of his total portfolio.

The White campaign said the candidate has owned Exxon stock for more than five years and disclosed to us the number (700) and value (about $45,000) of the shares. Since Exxon is valued at about $310 billion, White owns far less than 1 percent — a figure that Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for the White campaign, suggested does not constitute the ""substantial position"" in Exxon that Shami claims.

Besides, Exxon’s $31 billion purchase of XTO, announced in December, is still pending, subject to approval by XTO stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. That means that as of right now, owning stock in Exxon does not equal owning stock in XTO.
 
However, we discovered White does have an interest in Barnett Shale drilling through another company in his portfolio. According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, ConocoPhillips — in which White reported owning stock valued between $100,001 and $250,000 in 2008 — is currently active in the Barnett Shale through a subsidiary, Burlington Resources.

So much for assessing White's stake in the Barnett Shale. A more problematic issue is whether the investments constitute a conflict of interest, as Shami claims.

During the debate, both Shami and a reporter asked White whether he supported a proposed moratorium on new drilling in the Barnett Shale. White said he did not, arguing that emissions and other violations should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. ""I think it would be unfair to shut down operations of all operators based on what some operators do,"" he said.

In the news release, Shami, who is in favor of a moratorium, says that ""it’s disturbing to think Mayor White’s conflict of interest could be putting people’s lives at risk.""

Brian Roberts, a professor of government at the University of Texas, said the ethical concerns raised by Shami are speculative and could become an issue only if White, as governor, were to participate in decisions related to oil and gas. But Roberts said the regulation of those industries largely belongs to the Railroad Commission, whose members are elected.

Putting aside the conflict issue, where does this leave us?

Shami is correct that White has a financial interest in Exxon, as well as other oil and gas companies. And it's true that Exxon is acquiring XTO, a $27 billion company that's a big player in the Barnett Shale. But Shami's assertion that White's $45,000 investment in Exxon constitutes a ""major stake"" in XTO is off the mark.

Though we found that White has a larger interest in ConocoPhillips, which owns another company drilling in the Barnett Shale, that too is a tiny piece of a multinational oil company's action.

We rate Shami's statement as Barely True.

Gomez says she stopped Capital Metro from raising fares for seniors and people with disabilities
","
Margaret Gomez, a Democrat up for re-election as Travis County's Precinct 4 commissioner, has positioned herself as a candidate for the people. Lately, she's boasted about stopping Capital Metro, Austin's public transit authority, from increasing bus fares for seniors and people with disabilities. 

From a campaign flier distributed after the South Austin Democrats endorsed Gomez on Jan. 12: ""Margaret Gomez has delivered results for Southeast Travis County... (she) stopped Capital Metro from raising fares for senior and disabled citizens.""

Gomez, a commissioner since 1995, served as the county's appointee to the board that oversees Capital Metro from 1997 through 2009 including a closing 19-month run as the board chair. 

Gomez's campaign pointed to the successful motion she made during a November board meeting to exempt seniors and people with disabilities from a bus and rail fare hike. The board voted 4-1 to increase the fare for a one-way bus ride to $1 and increase other discounted fares — like the 31-day adult bus pass — by more than 100 percent.

The new fares kicked in Jan. 18. Thanks to the exemption initiated by Gomez, older and disabled riders continue to ride for free.

Before the vote, Gomez had posted a statement posted on a pro-Democratic blog, the Burnt Orange Report: ""I do not believe that we should balance the agency's budget on the backs of the elderly and disabled citizens, which is why I will ask the board to exempt seniors and disabled citizens from any fare increase.""

Yet Gomez wasn't always committed to sparing those riders from paying fares, as her record on the transit agency board shows. 

In May 2008 board members — including Gomez — twice voted unanimously in favor of a two-step fare increase plan that would have doubled the price of bus fare to $1 by 2011. Seniors and people whose disabilities weren't severe enough to qualify for the special door-to-door transit services required by federal law would have started paying 50-cent fares.

The plan went to the Local Government Approval Committee, an ad hoc body of elected officials — Gomez not included — which amended the board's proposal and opted not to charge seniors and disabled citizens while it raised other Capital Metro fares that year..

In August 2009, Capital Metro staff members proposed to the board steeper fare increases that it wanted to kick in several months sooner than the original hikes were planned to go into effect, including charging 25 cents for single rides for seniors and people with disabilities. 

That's the proposal that was later amended, at Gomez's motion, to spare seniors and the disabled from the fare increase. 

So did Gomez get it right? Did she stop the fare increase?

Sure she did, along with most fellow board members. She also earlier voted twice to advance plans subjecting seniors and the disabled to fare increases. But fares never raised for seniors and disabilities on her watch.

We rate Gomez's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809719C280>],/factchecks/2010/feb/22/margaret-gomez/gomez-says-she-stopped-capital-metro-raising-fares/

Judicial aspirant Eve Schatelowitz Alcantar says Democratic special interests demanded money for support
","Deep inside a voters guide circulated in the Austin area by the League of Women Voters of Texas, a judicial candidate makes a sit-up-quick claim.Eve Schatelowitz Alcantar, seeking the Democratic nod for Travis County’s 299th District Court, says: “In this judicial race, special interest groups have demanded money from me, in exchange for endorsement and support.”Demanded? That got our attention. Schatelowitz Alcantar told us her claim traces to the first question asked of candidates on a written survey distributed before a Jan. 28 forum at which Austin Democratic groups weighed endorsements.Such endorsements can be pivotal; they're touted by candidates in their advertising. Schatelowitz Alcantar said she didn't get any at the forum, which involved more than half a dozen Democratic clubs.In the question singled out by Schatelowitz Alcantar, the Travis County Democratic Party notes that the party pays for a coordinated campaign benefiting the Democratic ticket on the November ballot. It doesn't pussy-foot in asking candidates to pitch in, saying the party “would like to know if you, a 2010 Democratic primary candidate, will be willing to fully contribute to the coordinated campaign and if you are willing to make that pledge right now. This is a yes or no question.” The amounts sought, per office, range from $2,500 for justice-of-the-peace candidates up to $7,500 for candidates for district judge and county judge.Schatelowitz Alcantar conceded the survey question made no direct link between a candidate's commitment to give money and endorsements from Democratic clubs.“There is nothing explicit,” she said. “But let me ask you this: Why do you think they ask that question in the first place?... The purpose of asking that question was to gain the endorsements of those clubs.”We didn't find any clubs that acknowledged such a quid pro quo at work. Natomi Austin, president of the Black Austin Democrats, said answers to the question did not affect her club's endorsements. ""When it comes to asking for money, people always consider it to be heavy handed,"" Austin said.Fred Cantu, president of the Austin Tejano Democrats, said the only complaints he heard about the question came from ""people who had never participated in the process or had never contributed.... Schatelowitz Alcantar is maybe a little naïve about the process, if anything. If she was to get nominated and she had a Republican opponent, I guarantee she’d feel very different in the fall.""Schatelowitz Alcantar said two other candidates for state district judgeships were appalled by the question: William Gammon and Keith Lauerman. Both reported getting no endorsements at the forum.Gammon said he found the donation question heavy-handed, but didn’t assume his negative reply would drive endorsement decisions. “The implication is you either pony up or nobody’s going to like you,” Gammon said. “It wasn’t a demand. That would be overstating it.”Lauerman said the question initially confused him because he thought it meant he was expected to donate before knowing if he’d won the March primary. He said he agreed to the pledge after a consultant assured him otherwise.Austin lawyer Andy Brown, who chairs the Travis County Democratic Party, said candidates' answers to the question don't affect the party's support: “There’s no action we’re expecting because of it. The bottom line is we (the countywide party) don’t endorse in the primary.""Brown noted that in 2008 about one third of some $560,000 raised by the party was donated by candidates.“The goal here is for people to realize that the campaign in the fall does not run itself,"" Brown said. ""Travis County is not inherently a Democratic county unless we put a lot of resources into getting the vote out this fall.""Neither Brown's predecessor as party chairman, Austin lawyer Chris Elliott, nor leaders of several of the Democratic clubs that made endorsements in connection with the forum, saw anything inappropriate in asking candidates if they'd pledge to pitch in for the fall campaign. Elliott said: ""Maybe that's a good way to get people committed.""Clearly, Schatelowitz Alcantar didn't soft-pedal her objections to the way the Democratic Party's question puts a squeeze on candidates to contribute to the fall campaign.But Schatelowitz Alcantar overreached in saying the query was a demand for money in return for endorsements. No one we contacted--including the judicial aspirants recommended by Schatelowitz Alcantar--shared her interpretation.We rate Schatelowitz Alcantar's statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096766B80>],/factchecks/2010/feb/21/eve-schatelowitz-alcantar/judicial-aspirant-eve-schatelowitz-alcantar-says-d/

McConnell claims stimulus includes $219,000 to study the sex lives of female college freshmen

In this item, we look at McConnell's claim that the stimulus includes ""$219,000 to study the sex lives of female college freshmen."" We couldn't resist checking this one out.Especially after reading a Sept. 8, 2009, story in the (Syracuse) Daily Orange, that begins, ""Five hundred Syracuse University freshmen will divulge the details of their sex lives as part of a women's health study"" ... paid for with $219,000 in stimulus funds.Alas, the academic rendering of the study on the government's stimulus Web site, recovery.gov, doesn't read nearly as provocatively:""Scientific Rationale: The transition from adolescence to adulthood involves important developmental challenges. Events during this key developmental phase can profoundly shape and influence academic and occupational achievement as well as affect health outcomes. During this time, women are particularly vulnerable to a number of health threats including depressive, anxiety and eating disorders; psychosomatic conditions; intimate partner coercion and violence; and sexually transmitted infections. Understanding gender-based health disparities is an important public health goal. Preliminary scientific reports suggest that intimate encounters between partners who have no expectation of a romantic commitment may be increasing and that these encounters may be partly responsible for gender-based health disparities. However, little research has investigated the health consequences of such encounters using a large sample, a longitudinal design, reliable and valid measures, and sophisticated data analyses.""Later, it's translated more plainly: They will study the physical and mental health consequences of hookups.In other words, this is a public health study (funded through the Department of Health and Human Services), not a submission to Penthouse.The two-year survey will track health-related behaviors such as tobacco use, alcohol use, exercise and physical activity, sleep and sexual behavior as well as psychosomatic and mental health symptoms. The findings will be used ""to inform parents, educators, medical and public health professionals, and to guide the development of more effective health promotion and disease prevention programs.""In the Daily Orange story, the man conducting the study, Syracuse University professor of psychology and medicine Michael Carey, defended it as a worthwhile study that will help improve approaches to intervention in women's health. ""The Women's Health Project includes sexual behavior … because of the increasing recognition that social and health problems are linked to sexual behavior … and that there has been little scientific study of the topic despite its potential health implications,"" Carey said.""Women have been traditionally neglected in health research, even though they are disproportionately vulnerable to a number of health threats,"" such as sexually transmitted diseases and eating disorders, Carey said. Although Carey applied to the National Institutes of Health for funding long before the stimulus was even being considered, he said stimulus funds are appropriate for the study.""The funds invested in this project do help to support jobs and will quickly find their way back into the local economy,"" Carey said. ""Moreover, investing in health and health research is as important to the revitalization of our economy as are investments in our physical infrastructure.""As for the jobs, there won't be many direct ones. According to the recovery.gov synopsis, the study will involve a half-time research assistant and part-time temporary assistants.

It appears on Boehner's list as well and has been cited by several Republicans as an example of stimulus waste.The short answer on this one is that it's true, or used to be. This claim refers to two projects in St. Joseph, Mo., that were awarded Community Development Block Grants by the city, with funds from the stimulus. The martini bar owner, who had been awarded $25,000 to expand his existing business, withdrew his application for the federal funds on Jan. 21, 2010, after it was discovered that the company had liens placed against it by the IRS and the state for failing to pay a little more than $8,000 in taxes, said St. Joseph's Community Development Manager Gerald McCush.""You get no funds from the stimulus if you owe the IRS money, sorry,"" McCush said.So, the martini bar is getting no stimulus.As for the steakhouse, a city committee awarded $75,000 in Community Development Block Grant recovery money to ECBG LLC, a private company, to build a Brazilian steakhouse downtown.""We are trying to revitalize the downtown,"" McCush explained. ""That is a priority for the City Council. We have a pretty blighted downtown.""In all, the city received $475,000 worth of Community Development Block Grant funds from the stimulus. A city committee that included two City Council members, two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, a city planner and some other city residents decided on the projects from among $2 million worth of requests.The steakhouse was selected not only because it met the city's priority for revitalizing the downtown, McCush said, but also because it would result in a number of new jobs. The steakhouse will anchor a downtown building that includes several other retail spaces. Construction of the building employed roughly 60 construction workers, McCush said, and the restaurant is expected to employ 30 people full time. The restaurant is scheduled to open in April. McConnell is largely on target with his claim about the projects and the money they were awarded in stimulus funds. The application for money related to the martini bar has since been withdrawn, though it did initially receive the award.

 Boehner says stimulus includes $7 million for bridge over railway to town of 168

And he attached a list of 19 ""real world"" examples. We took a look at several items on Boehner's list to see if they were as billed. In this item, we examine the claim that the stimulus includes ""$7 million to build a bridge in Thedford, Nebraska, to help 168 residents avoid a 30-second wait at a local train crossing. Not one full-time job will be created.""This one leaped to national fame thanks to a Jan. 28, 2010, report on CNN. Based on the population of Thedford, the reporter stated, ""That means the project cost of $6.9 million breaks down to $41,000 per resident on paper.""It's true that $7 million in stimulus funds was awarded to build a viaduct allowing traffic to pass over BNSF Railway tracks on U.S. 83 in Thedford, instead of crossing directly on the tracks. And it's fair to say, based on those quoted in the CNN report as well as in the Omaha World-Herald on July 19, 2009, that a lot of locals think it's a huge waste of money. But the two-sentence description in the Boehner release presents a slightly distorted picture. While the population of Thedford is 168, about 1,273 vehicles a day cross the tracks and about 60 trains a day pass through, according to the World-Herald. And while some locals say the wait for a train passing is sometimes as short as 20 seconds (or as long as 3 minutes), Nebraska Department of Roads officials cited safety, not convenience, concerns as the impetus for the project (though no accidents have been reported at the crossing).Nebraska officials told the Omaha World-Herald that U.S. 83 serves as a main route between two cities, and that a train derailment or track maintenance could shut the crossing down for an extended time. The nearest north-south route is at least 25 miles away. ""It’s a project that qualifies under our rules and regs, and it's a good project. It eliminates a lot of exposure, and it provides some tremendous continuity to our highway system,"" Ellis Tompkins, rail and public transportation engineer with the roads department, told the World-Herald.We're not going to weigh in on the merits of the project, but we did want to point out one other distortion in the Boehner claim, that ""not one full-time job will be created"" by the project. The CNN report notes that only a few locals were hired as temps, including a woman who worked part-time for a couple of months for $10 an hour waving a flag. A Colorado contractor won the bid for the project and is using its own out-of-state workers. So locals complained that it wasn't creating jobs for people in Thedford. But that doesn't mean it didn't create any jobs -- only that those jobs went to people in Colorado, less than 100 miles away. So Boehner has the project and the pricetag correct, but we think it's misleading to claim the bridge only leads to a town of 168, when it is crossed more than 1,200 times a day. And the claim that it has not created any jobs is wrong. It might not create any full-time jobs for Thedford residents, but it will for those employed by the Colorado company that got the multimilion dollar contract.

Kinky Friedman says Texas agriculture commissioner allowed tainted beef to reach school cafeterias
","
Kinky Friedman, seeking the Democratic nod for state agriculture commissioner, suggests the Republican incumbent, Todd Staples, let down his guard a couple years ago. 
Responding to a question from the League of Women Voters of Texas, Friedman said: ""The current commissioner allowed tainted beef to be sent to school cafeterias."" 
His stomach-churning charge drew our attention. 
The candidate’s campaign pointed us to a February 2008 press release issued by Staples giving clearance to school districts to comply with a nationwide recall of more than 765,000 pounds of tainted beef. The release states: ""Currently, 462 Texas school districts and other entities enrolled in the school breakfast and lunch programs have reported to have meat on hold and now can begin the disposal process."" 
The release doesn’t say if or how Staples allowed the tainted beef get to Texas schools. But Friedman spokesman Jason Stanford said it shows ""this was allowed to happen on Staples’ watch."" 
We wondered what role the Texas Department of Agriculture plays in determining what foods get delivered for school meals. 
Staples’ spokesman Bryan Black confirmed that the Texas department distributes food commodities purchased by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Black conceded too those deliveries would have included the beef that was later targeted for disposal. 
Yet Black insisted that nothing in state law permits the commissioner to tell districts what foods to order or not. 
His point: Staples couldn't have stopped--or disallowed--schools from taking the beef; the state department is responsible only for ensuring that food ordered through the USDA's commodity program--whatever the foods are--gets delivered. 
Spokeswoman Jean Daniel of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, which administers USDA's food nutrition programs, echoed Black's claim. 
Daniel said state officials such as the Texas agriculture commissioner don't determine which suppliers provide food either through federally purchased commodities, which account for 15 to 20 percent of the food in school meals nationwide, or local purchases from commercial suppliers, handled by school districts. Daniel said she didn't know of any instance of a state-level official intervening in school district food purchases unless they were alerted to a recall. 
In 2008, Black said, Staples acted because the federal government told states that the beef was unfit for human consumption. The state agency helped ensure the disposal of the beef and reimbursements to districts. 
It's true that the Texas agriculture commissioner is responsible for overseeing the distribution of federal commodities for school meal programs. 
But we found no evidence that Staples had the authority to allow districts to get the bad beef. 
We rate Friedman's statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4BB9C0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/19/kinky-friedman/kinky-friedman-says-texas-agriculture-commissioner/

Boehner claims $15 million from stimulus going to an Alaskan airport that serves a village of 165
","In an address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, President Barack Obama boasted that despite the massive and rapid spending in the $862 billion package, you're not hearing about money being misspent.

And he attached a list of 19 ""real world"" examples. We looked at several of the items on this list to see if they were as billed. Here, we will examine the claim that ""$15 million (in stimulus) dollars went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, population 165.""This project landed in the national spotlight when it was singled out in a CBS Evening News report on July 13, 2009. ""That's roughly $90,000 dollars per resident,"" the report said.""Consider that Los Angeles International doesn't have the money to install critical taxiway warning lights,"" the CBS report states. ""And a third of the nation's largest airports -- 11 of the 30 biggest, handling over one-fourth of the nation's passenger traffic -- have substandard safety areas for when planes veer off the runway.""A lengthier story three days later in the Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror included some defense of the project. To put the project in perspective, some locals said, you have to understand Ouzinkie, and the importance of air travel. Ouzinkie is a small, island village peopled predominantly by Native Alaskans called Alutiiq.Or as ProPublica.org put it in an article titled Tiny Airports Take Off With Stimulus: ""The village of Ouzinkie is one of the remotest outposts in the United States — home to a mere 165 people on an island off another island off the coast of Alaska. There are no stores, no gas stations and no stoplights.""Because of its remoteness, villagers depend on its airport as a lifeline for mail, medical evacuations and supplies. The location of the existing airport, local officials told the Kodiak Daily Mirror, is exposed to fierce crosswinds that often make it impossible for planes to take off and land, and the site does not meet FAA-mandated runway length. The new project includes a runway, taxiway, airport lights, a snow removal equipment building and 2 miles of access road. ""I’m sorry the airport has to cost so much, but essential services are essential air services,"" Ouzinkie Vice Mayor Tom Quick told the Kodiak Daily Mirror. ""They are essential, whether you’re talking about five people or 5,000.""Quick also said planes have been much more convenient in transporting the dead, who otherwise were transported via skiff. ""I feel this is very necessary in case somebody needs to get a medevac out,"" added Jill Boskofsky, vice president of the Ouzinkie Tribal Council and environmental director. ""I feel it's for the safety of our community.""In an opinion piece for the Anchorage Press, Krestia DeGeorge called the CBS report ""sensationalizing"" and told people to ""quit picking on Ouzinkie."" Airports in Alaska are a more important part of the basic transportation system than they are elsewhere, she wrote, and, ""The point is that we should think carefully about what’s really involved before criticizing something. ... Otherwise (things) such as Ouzinkie’s lifeline will continue to be someone else’s taxpayer waste."" On this one, Boehner has his facts straight. It's worth noting that the one-sentence synopsis of the project leaves out important contextual information, such as how important a lifeline an airport is to this small island community. But Boehner is right. And so we rule his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096682A00>],/factchecks/2010/feb/19/john-boehner/boehner-claims-15-million-stimulus-going-alaskan-a/

Scott Brown says stimulus 'didn't create one new job'
","A major theme in Republican complaints about the $862 billion stimulus program is that it didn't deliver enough jobs. Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts took that view to an extreme, claiming that it didn't create any new jobs. Here's what he said during a Feb. 4, 2010, news conference, shortly after he was sworn in.“The last stimulus bill didn’t create one new job, and in some states the money that was actually released hasn’t even been used yet,” Brown said.ABC's Jonathan Karl immediately followed up. “It didn’t create one new job?” Karl asked.“That’s correct. We lost another 85,000 jobs again, give or take, last month,” Brown responded.  “And in Massachusetts, it hasn’t created one new job and throughout the country as well. It may have retained some, but it hasn’t created any new jobs.""There are two ways to analyze this question -- looking at jobs created directly by the stimulus, and looking at jobs created in the broader economy since the stimulus bill took effect.We'll look first at jobs funded directly by the stimulus.According to Recovery.gov -- the Obama administration's Web site that tracks the stimulus effort -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created or saved 634,042 jobs between Feb. 17, 2009, and Sept. 30, 2009, and it funded 595,263 jobs between Oct. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2009. The data come from reports filed by the primary recipient of stimulus funds such as state and local governments and private-sector companies.These numbers aren't perfect. They meld bits and pieces of part-time jobs into ""full-time equivalent"" jobs, and the two periods use different criteria for job counting, due to a change dictated by the Office of Management and Budget in December 2009. (For the earlier of the two periods cited above, the number refers to jobs created or saved; for the later of the two periods, it refers to the number of jobs funded by the stimulus without reference to whether that funding created or saved a job.) Also, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded in November 2009 that ""there are a range of significant reporting and quality issues that need to be addressed"" in this reporting system.So these statistics may overstate the actual number of jobs created. But not by enough to make Brown's zero-jobs claim accurate.So there's strong evidence that the stimulus has created lots of jobs directly through federal spending. What about the economy as a whole?Economists have been estimating the impact of the stimulus on jobs by comparing two numbers: current employment statistics and an estimate of what those employment numbers would have looked like had there been no stimulus.In a report released on Jan. 13, 2010, the president's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 1.77 million jobs and 2.07 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009.Separately, the council's report cited four independent analyses of the same question. These estimates were by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as well by three private-sector economic-analysis firms. Here's what those groups found:• CBO: Between 800,000 jobs (low estimate) and 2.4 million jobs (high estimate) saved or created.• IHS/Global Insight: 1.25 million jobs saved or created.• Macroeconomic Advisers: 1.06 million jobs saved or created.• Moody's economy.com: 1.59 million jobs saved or created.A couple of caveats: These estimates are based on economic models that vary somewhat from study to study, and not everyone buys the idea that it's possible to measure how the economy would have fared in the absence of a stimulus.Indeed, some economists, including many conservatives, believe that the multiplier effect from the stimulus is small or nonexistent. ""Every dollar Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy,"" writes economist Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""No new purchasing power is created; it is merely transferred from one part of the economy to another. ... Removing water from one end of a swimming pool and pouring it in the other end will not raise the overall water level -- no matter how large the bucket. Similarly, borrowing money from one part of the economy and redistributing to another part of the economy will not create new growth -- no matter how big the stimulus bill.""We acknowledge that there's some dispute on this question. Still, the independent estimates we've seen have credibility, and they all agree that at least 1 million jobs have been created or saved. That, in combination with the hundreds of thousands of jobs cited on recovery.gov as being funded directly by the stimulus, contradicts Brown's assertion that the bill ""didn’t create one new job.""But if Brown had chosen his words more carefully, he could have scored better on the Truth-O-Meter.He's right that the economy as a whole has been losing jobs almost every single month since January 2008. According to a chart prepared by the Obama White House, there has been positive job growth in only one month during that period -- November 2009. (In his news conference comment, Brown actually underestimated the net job losses in December 2009, which was the most recent month for which data was available before he spoke; it was about 150,000, rather than 85,000.)So if Brown had said that the national economy hasn't seen any net gain in jobs since the stimulus bill was passed, he would have earned himself a True.A spokesman for Brown, Eric Fehrnstrom, made that point to us in an interview. ""The fact is that we have lost jobs every month since the stimulus passed,"" Fehrnstrom said. ""No amount of political spin can change that fact.""But that's not what Brown said. He said the stimulus bill ""didn’t create one new job"" and, when asked to clarify, he said it ""hasn’t created any new jobs."" It's perfectly reasonable to question whether the $862 billion was well spent and whether it is good economic policy. But that money has clearly resulted in tens of thousands of jobs that wouldn't exist otherwise. It's preposterous to claim that no new jobs came out of it. We find his claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B97CC0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/18/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-stimulus-didnt-create-one-new-job/
"['Economy', 'Texas', 'Farouk Shami']","
Shami said Houston lost 43,000 jobs while White was mayor
","
Farouk Shami, the Houston businessman running for governor, has guaranteed a job to every working-age Texan if he's elected. He even said he'd pay the state, ahem, $10 million if he hasn't created 100,000 jobs during his first two years in office.

Former Houston mayor Bill White, running against Shami, also trumpets his job record. But Shami suggests that voters can't expect as much from his opponent, arguing that Houston lost jobs during the White administration.

""My capability and my experience is to create jobs, unlike my opponent, who... lost 43,000 in Houston since he took over,"" Shami said during the Feb. 8 Democratic primary debate. ""We are losing jobs.""

Indeed? We decided to check the facts.

Kelly Johnson, Shami's former communications director (she resigned with four other campaign staffers Feb. 17), said he was citing the change in the number of unemployed people in Harris County from January 2004, when White was sworn in as mayor, to December 2009, White's last month in office. Johnson said they used county data, which is not seasonally adjusted, because the Texas Workforce Commission's available numbers for the city didn't date to the beginning of White's tenure.

Using the same data, we calculated that after six years, 42,325 more people were unemployed in Harris County than when White took office. 

But that doesn't mean Houston lost 42,325 jobs.

Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, advised us that unemployment data is used to track how many people are out of work, but it's not the right way to determine how many jobs have been gained or lost. Because a working person can have more than one job — and can lose a job but remain partially employed — the number of workers does not equal the number of jobs.

To gauge how many actual jobs are on the books, Abbot directed us to nonfarm wage and salary employment numbers. The Texas Workforce Commission doesn't track that data by county, but by metropolitan area. We found that the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown area gained 278,700 jobs between the month White took office and December 2009, when he left.

Johnson said Shami's campaign didn't use the raw number of nonfarm jobs gained or lost because that approach doesn't take into account population growth over time. Houston's population surged by nearly 288,600 between 2000 and 2008, according to the U.S. Census Bureau — and some of those folks did not have jobs.

""The population massively grew when White was mayor, so it's far more accurate to look (at) an unemployment rate (or the) number of people unemployed from when he took office to when he left,"" she said.

So let's take another look at the number of Harris County residents recorded as unemployed while White was mayor.

The county's annual unemployment rate dropped from 6.8 percent in 2003 to 4.8 in 2008. The 2009 rate isn't available yet, but some 107,403 people were unemployed in December 2008 — when the national economy was reeling. By December 2009, the ranks of the unemployed had grown in Harris County with 164,717 people out of work.

We also found that 137,179 more people were employed in Harris County from the time White took office to when he left.

The upshot?

Shami erred in a couple ways.

First, he distorted unemployment in the Houston area. It's true that the raw number of unemployed people increased by more than 42,000 (not 43,000, as Shami claimed) while White was mayor. But the number of unemployed people doesn't translate to the number of jobs lost in Houston.

Second, Shami chose not to factor in the share of Harris County residents who were employed, which increased during White's tenure.

We rate his claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BA2B80>],/factchecks/2010/feb/18/farouk-shami/shami-said-houston-lost-43000-jobs-while-white-was/
"['Economy', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
White says Houston led the nation in job growth
","
Former Houston mayor Bill White, running for governor, frequently touts his experience leading the country's fourth-largest city, which he casts as an economic powerhouse.

""As Houston's mayor, I helped our area lead the nation in job growth,"" White wrote responding to a questionnaire from the League of Women Voters of Texas, a nonpartisan group that encourages active participation in government. The league published White's and other candidates' responses in its primary election Voters Guide for the March 2 party primaries.

Houston led the entire country in job growth? Sounds wondrous. We wondered if White was rightfully bragging.

Katy Bacon, White's spokeswoman, pointed us to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics that White's campaign used to compare the job growth in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown area to growth in the rest of the United States.

You're reading right: The White campaign compared Houston's job growth to job growth in other states. And it found that over his six years as mayor, Houston gained more jobs than any state outside Texas.

The skinny: Some 244,100 jobs were added in the Houston area during the period, compared to 156,800 in Washington, the state with the second-highest increase in jobs. Texas was first with 943,000 new jobs.

We confirmed those numbers — and found a wrinkle the White campaign overlooked. It turns out that Dallas, which gained 265,800 nonfarm jobs from 2003 through 2009, led the country in job growth.

When we noted that that put the Houston area in the number two spot — in contrast to leading, as White says in the voter guide — Bacon said: ""Even if we're number two or number three, we're still leading the nation.""

Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, guided us to the way she said most economists gauge job growth — by the rate at which jobs increase, instead of the gross number of jobs added. By that calculation, Wyoming led the nation with nearly 12 percent job growth during White's mayoral tenure, followed by Houston (about 10.6 percent), Utah (10.2 percent), Dallas and Texas (both about 9.9 percent).

Abbot's approach seemed reasonable. After all, counting raw job gains for any community or state would give areas with more residents a natural advantage in the competition. 
By the same token, relatively few jobs in a place with a small population can have an outsized impact, percentage-wise. Take Odessa, with 21.5 percent job growth, or Grand Junction, Colo., with 14.2 percent. 

Another example of the numbers game: Farouk Shami, a Houston businessman and White's opponent in the Democratic primary, has said that the ranks of Houston's unemployed increased by 42,000 people on White's watch. By singling out the raw number, Shami downplays factors including whether employment increased too as population grew, not to mention a devastating recession that affected the entire country.

No matter how the job numbers are sliced, Houston experienced significant job gains while White was mayor. It added more nonfarm jobs than any other state during that time — but still, fewer jobs than Dallas. By percentage, Houston boasted the second highest rate of nonfarm job growth (San Antonio was first) among the 10 biggest cities in the country.

Houston was among the national leaders. But it wasn't No. 1.

We rate White's statement as False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280967268C0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/18/bill-white/white-says-houston-led-nation-job-growth/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says stimulus is responsible for 2 million jobs saved or created
","When the anniversary of the signing of the economic stimulus bill arrived on Feb. 17, 2010, it was accompanied by a blizzard of statements, speeches and interviews in which Republicans attacked the law and Democrats defended it. Given the widespread public belief that job creation under President Barack Obama has been unacceptably low, some of the most heated debate over the stimulus plan has focused on how well the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as it is formally known, has promoted job creation.President Barack Obama, joined by other leading Democrats, boiled down the plan's jobs-related achievements in a Feb. 17 address from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington.""So far,"" he said, ""the Recovery Act is responsible for the jobs of about 2 million Americans who would otherwise be unemployed. These aren't just our numbers; these are the estimates of independent, nonpartisan economists across the spectrum. ... [And] the Recovery Act is on track to save or create another 1.5 million jobs in 2010.""This is quite a different picture from the one painted by Republicans, who have focused on the stubbornly high (and until recently, consistently rising) unemployment rate. So we thought we'd check the accuracy of Obama's comments on the stimulus and jobs.As anyone with a passing familiarity with economics might expect, economists are far from unified on their estimates of how big an effect the stimulus has had on jobs.First let's explain how economists have been estimating the impact of the stimulus on jobs. Essentially, they have been comparing two numbers: the actual employment statistics from the federal government, and an estimate of what those employment numbers would have looked like had there been no stimulus. We'll get into more detail about how this is done below. But for now, the important thing to note is that the gap between these two figures represents the number of jobs that economists believe were created or saved by the stimulus.In a report released on Jan. 13, 2010, the president's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 1.77 million jobs and 2.07 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009.Separately, the council's report cited four independent analyses of the same question. These estimates were by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' nonpartisan number-crunching arm, as well by three private-sector economic-analysis firms. Here's what those groups found:• CBO: Between 800,000 jobs (low estimate) and 2.4 million jobs (high estimate) saved or created.• IHS/Global Insight: 1.25 million jobs saved or created.• Macroeconomic Advisers: 1.06 million jobs saved or created.• Moody's economy.com: 1.59 million jobs saved or created. In the report, Obama's economic advisers argue that their estimates ""are consistent with a broad consensus of numerous professional forecasters. The fact that such a range of public and private forecasters broadly agree with our assessment should increase confidence that the act is having a substantial stimulative effect."" But focusing on the 2 million figure, as Obama does, is a somewhat generous view of the data.For the president to be right about 2 million jobs having been created or saved would mean using the highest end of the administration's own range, or the highest end of the CBO's range. Indeed, leaving the Obama advisers' analysis out of it and looking only at the independent estimates produces an average of 1.38 million jobs created or saved -- about 30 percent lower than the president's 2 million-job benchmark.The numbers creep closer to what Obama and other Democrats are suggesting if you fast-forward the employment estimates by one quarter, to the first quarter of 2010. Using updated estimates provided to PolitiFact, IHS/Global Insight estimates that 1.7 million jobs will be created or saved by the first quarter of 2010. And Moody's economy.com estimated that 1.9 million jobs will be created or saved by that quarter. (These figures are cumulative, meaning that a total of 1.7 million or 1.9 million jobs will have been created or saved since the stimulus bill took effect, rather than that many jobs being created or saved in the first quarter of 2010 alone.)So, depending on which time frame you use, Obama's 2 million number is either on the high end of the scale, or just about right.Now let's look at Obama's second statistic -- that the stimulus ""is on track to save or create another 1.5 million jobs in 2010."" By saying that, Obama was repeating a CEA claim from its Jan. 13, 2010, report. To see if the administration is right, let's look at the independent analyses.Both IHS/Global Insight and Moody's economy.com provided us with forward-looking projections for jobs created and saved. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2010, IHS/Global Insight estimates that the gap between employment with and without the stimulus will be 2.45 million jobs, while Moody's economy.com finds the gap to be 2.5 million jobs. If you subtract from these figures the jobs that had already been created or saved through the fourth quarter of 2009, you'd end up with 1.2 million jobs newly created or saved in 2010 under the IHS/Global Insight model, or a little under 1 million additional jobs saved in 2010 under Moody's economy.com model.So again in this case, the president is somewhat generous in his estimates, at least for the data provided by these two private-sector analyses.Economists say there's room for honest disagreement over the size of the multipliers they use and the impact that the stimulus will have on the larger economy. ""There's a lot of uncertainty around these estimates, because the numbers aren't precise,"" Faucher said. Some of the key assumptions, he said, involve how much of the extra income from bonus Social Security payments, extended unemployment benefits, higher food stamps, and tax cuts are spent by consumers, and how infrastructure spending translates into jobs and income.Some scholars, including many conservatives, believe that the multiplier effect from the stimulus is small or nonexistent. ""Every dollar Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy,"" writes economist Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""No new purchasing power is created; it is merely transferred from one part of the economy to another. ... Removing water from one end of a swimming pool and pouring it in the other end will not raise the overall water level -- no matter how large the bucket. Similarly, borrowing money from one part of the economy and redistributing to another part of the economy will not create new growth -- no matter how big the stimulus bill.""But Gus Faucher, the director of macroeconomics with Moody's economy.com, said he disagrees ""very strongly"" with Riedl, arguing that in a weak economy, the government isn't displacing other economic activity but is instead creating new economic activity.With the notable exception of conservatives, the independent economists who have produced studies agree that the stimulus has saved or created upwards of 1 million jobs, and that the bill will likely create another million or so jobs in 2010. These numbers are based on a ""counterfactual"" study that is an estimate subject to some professional disagreement. And within this broad range of expert opinion, Obama chose a number on the high side. The numbers could easily be less than what he suggests. So we rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A44A140>],/factchecks/2010/feb/18/barack-obama/obama-says-stimulus-responsible-millions-jobs-save/
"['National', 'Stimulus', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden says job losses have fallen from 750,000 per month to 35,000 per month
","The stimulus bill is one year old. To celebrate its anniversary, administration officials are touting its successes.Vice President Joe Biden is among those talking up the bill. In a USA Today op-ed, he wrote that the success of the stimulus legislation, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, can be measured by the number of jobs it has created.""We think the Recovery Act is working because of the progress we've made in slowing job loss,"" Biden wrote on Feb. 17, 2010, exactly a year since the stimulus bill was signed by President Barack Obama. ""In the three months before the act took effect, America lost 750,000 jobs a month. In the last three months, we've lost about 35,000 jobs a month. That's progress — not good enough, not where we need to be, but progress. And most economists agree that that progress is thanks in a very large part to the Recovery Act.""For this item, we'll focus on whether Biden is correct that America lost 750,000 jobs a month before the stimulus bill went into effect and only 35,000 a month in the last three months.Jay Carney, Biden's communications director, said that the numbers cited in the op-ed came from monthly job losses reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in January, February and March of 2009, as well as the last three months. On average, the economy lost about 752,000 jobs per month in the first three months of 2009, which is close to the 750,000 that Biden wrote in his op-ed. But Biden specifically wrote that job losses averaged that amount ""in the three months before the act took effect,"" which was officially Feb. 17, 2009, the day the bill was signed. So, that time frame includes November and December of 2008, and January 2009. For that time period, the average was about 726,000 jobs. So, when it comes to job loss averages in the months before the stimulus bill officially went into effect, Biden is off by about 26,000 jobs. Carney said that the stimulus bill had very little effect on the economy until April 2009, so that's why they included March in their calculations.Next, we turned to average job losses for the last three months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not published data for February yet, so we focused on November and December of 2009, and January 2010. In this case, Biden is spot on: The average number of job losses over the last three months has been about 35,000.Whether the stimulus is entirely responsible for slowing job losses is a matter of opinion, and the subject of heated debate between conservative and liberal economists.Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that knowing whether the bill has helped stem job losses requires knowing how the economy would have performed had the stimulus bill never been put into law. He argues that the economy may have actually lost jobs as a result of the stimulus bill. For every job that's created through government spending, the government has to take money away from another part of the economy, which can produce job losses, he said.""At best, it's a zero-sum game."" Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says that it's difficult to say exactly how many jobs have been created by the stimulus.""You can't look at a job and say, 'This job would not have been here without the stimulus.'""But you can measure the stimulus bill's impact on employment by looking at aggregate demand, Horney added. People have been buying more groceries, clothes and other goods, which indicates a stabilizing job market. So, back to Biden's claim. He said that job losses averaged about 750,000 in the three months before the stimulus bill went into effect. Including job loss statistics for the month of March 2009, Biden is correct. But the bill was signed Feb. 17, 2009, and officially went into effect that day. And using that measure — November and December of 2008, and January 2009 — Biden is off by about 26,000 jobs. Biden also said that job losses averaged about 35,000 for November and December 2009, and January of 2010, which is also correct. Because Biden is not quite right on the first part of his statement, we'll knock him down a point. As a result, we find his claim to be Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2FBC80>],/factchecks/2010/feb/17/joe-biden/biden-says-job-losses-have-fallen-750000-month-350/

Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst says Pelosi and others cost taxpayers nearly $10,000 each for trip to Copenhagen travel summit
","
In an e-mail blast, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, told supporters that spending in Washington is out of control.

Dewhurst spiced his Tuesday e-mail with a reference to the Democratic House speaker, stating that ""during the recent global warming summit in Copenhagen, Nancy Pelosi and others stayed at a five-star hotel on a trip costing nearly $10,000 per person.""

The House speaker living large in Denmark? We checked into that.

Dewhurst’s campaign pointed us to a USA Today post online reflecting on a report by CBS News, which reviewed travel vouchers filed by Pelosi’s office after the international climate summit in December. A summary of the travel vouchers filed by Pelosi’s office states that air fare, food and lodging costs for 57 people including Pelosi added up to $553,564. That works out to $9,711 per person.

CBS found that a factor in the travel costs was that the host hotel, a five-star Marriott, required guests to pay for six nights’ stay even if they were staying two nights, as Pelosi did. CBS also said that in fairness, ""many attendees told us they did a lot of hard work, and laid the groundwork for a future global treaty.""

Pelosi's food and lodging expenses totaled $4,406 (she, like many, took a military jet to the summit). She declined to discuss the trip costs, CBS said.

Pelosi personally accounted for less than 10 percent of the costs reported by her office for dozens of individuals. Still, Dewhurst correctly summarized the overall per-person travel costs.

Challenger Ben Bius casts Sen. Ogden as force behind plans driving up property taxes and hurting small businesses—and he says Ogden is against gun freedoms
","
Huntsville businessman Ben Bius, challenging state Sen. Steve Ogden of Bryan in the March 2 Republican primary, doesn’t think much of Ogden’s performance.

In a Bius radio ad that aired recently on Austin’s KLBJ-AM, a narrator suggests Ogden, who chairs the pivotal Senate Finance Committee, is an out-of-control tax-and-spender.

The narrator says: ""Steve Ogden was the driving force behind a new business income tax that hurt small business. He crafted the Robin Hood school finance scheme that made our property taxes skyrocket. And Steve Ogden wrote a budget that will result in a $14 billion deficit for Texas … Ogden even voted against our Second Amendment freedoms on right-to-carry legislation.""

The spot could make listeners wonder how Ogden got elected in his conservative district.

But is it correct?

Bius, referring us to research footnoted on his campaign Web site, told us: ""We stick strictly to the facts. It’s exactly the truth.""

Let's look at the facts behind Bius’s first claim, which refers to Ogden's role in 2006 as Republican lawmakers scrambled to finance the cost of reductions in school property tax rates.

That year, Ogden was the Senate sponsor of a House-initiated plan replacing the corporate franchise tax with a tax based on gross receipts, part of a package backed by GOP leaders including Gov. Rick Perry.

Bius says in his ad that the tax hurt small businesses. He pointed us to a Dallas Morning News article published last year quoting Laura Stromberg of the National Federation of Independent Business: ""Small businesses operate on smaller profit margins. By taxing them on their gross receipts, small businesses are unfairly hit."" Stromberg reaffirmed the criticism when we reached her, noting the federation continues to favor repeal.

The revamped tax did draw in some small businesses that hadn't been subject to such a tax previously. However, early last year the state released its first study of the tax, which found that while it had shifted the tax burden between some business sectors, overall it wasn’t hitting small businesses unfairly.

Franchise ""tax liability increased for all sizes of taxpayers except the very smallest,"" State Comptroller Susan Combs said, and the tax ""now reflects the economy more closely than it did before... At the same time, the change in the base and the inclusion of newly taxable entities shifted the relative burden of the tax to firms at the middle of the size spectrum, while the share of tax paid by the very largest and smallest of taxpayers declined.""

Last year, legislators including Ogden raised the annual business income threshold for being subject to the tax from $300.000 to $1 million, a move described as eliminating the burden on smaller businesses.

Ogden, defending the tax, said: ""We changed the business tax to make it fairer and more broad-based,"" Ogden said. ""The increased revenue was used to help pay for the $14 billion cut in school property taxes--and small businesses pay a lot of property taxes. So it didn’t hurt them.""

Bius's Web site doesn't list evidence for his second claim, that Ogden crafted the school finance scheme which Bius says drove up property taxes.

But here's the background: In 1993, fearing court intervention to equalize funding among the state's public schools, lawmakers created the so-called Robin Hood approach. It requires school districts that are home to vast property wealth to share resources with less fortunate districts.

Ogden was among a few House members listed as co-sponsors, and was the the sole Republican named to the House-Senate conference panel that finalized the finance plan.

But the legislation was initiated by Sen. Bill Ratliff, who chaired the Senate Education Committee. Ratliff and former Rep. Paul Sadler, who served on the conference committee, each told us that Ogden did not craft the plan.

And two longtime analysts, school finance expert Dan Casey and tax expert Dale Craymer, each disputed Bius's claim that the  funding plan caused property taxes to rocket, as Bius says in his ad.

Craymer, who heads the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a nonprofit group representing businesses, was then-Gov. Ann Richards' budget director in 1993. Craymer said: ""There really is no single bill that caused school district taxes to skyrocket, although a number of bills in combination have contributed to a steady increase in tax rates (and sharp increases in some districts) since 1984.""

Bius’s third claim—that Ogden wrote a budget that will result in a $14 billion deficit—reflects Ogden’s longstanding role as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

Bius cites a 2009 article in the Fort Worth Business Press quoting Ogden saying: ""In order to balance the budget this biennium, which is $182 billion, we used $14 billion in federal stimulus money to balance it. We’re not expecting a similar amount of similar money to be available in the next two years because the federal government just doesn’t have it. So, assuming that’s true, you go into the next session with a $14 billion hole.""

Ogden told us he wishes he hadn't said ""hole"" in that context. ""We don’t have a deficit,"" he noted correctly -- a reminder that when observers refer to a shortfall, they mean that without making changes, the state might not have enough income to fund anticipated future expenses, not current ones.

""That has nothing to do with the budget I crafted,"" Ogden said, suggesting instead that it largely reflects state sales tax revenue lagging what Combs projected it would be by this time. Ogden also insisted he’s not convinced there’ll be a shortfall when lawmakers gather next year to write the next budget. ""It’s very accurate to say the (next) budget is going to be very tight,"" Ogden said, with lawmakers likely to tap the state’s so-called rainy day fund to cover costs.

Bius traces his ad’s last claim, that Ogden voted against Second Amendment freedoms, to Ogden's vote last year against a proposal removing a state bar on individuals carrying concealed weapons onto Texas college campuses.

Ogden, whose district includes Texas A&M University, was among 11 senators (and three Republicans) to vote against final passage of Senate Bill 1164, which later died in the House. Ogden said of his vote: ""I voted to maintain the status quo. What’s that got to do with the Second Amendment?"" He noted that the Bill of Rights in the Texas Constitution states that every citizen ""shall have the right to keep and bear arms in the lawful defense of himself or the state, but the Legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the wearing of arms, with a view to prevent crime.""

So how does Bius’s barrage shake out?

He’s right that Ogden carried the measure launching the new business tax. But it’s at least debatable that the tax ""hurt"" all small businesses; that was not the conclusion of the state study.

Bius fairly gives Ogden major credit -- or, rather, blame -- for writing the state budget, though he overlooks that Ogden shared that responsibility with House and Senate colleagues.

Bius's ad misuses the ""deficit"" descriptive, taking advantage of Ogden's rued reference to lawmakers facing a $14 billion ""hole"" unless there's more federal stimulus aid. 

Finally, Bius ties his Second Amendment claim to a single Ogden vote. That's a well-worn way of casting aspersions. But without more instances of such behavior by Ogden, it’s a stretch to say his one vote proves him soft on gun rights.

The ad's claims mostly misrepresent Ogden's record.

We rate Bius’s statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BBF2C0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/17/ben-bius/ben-bius-says-sen-ogden-was-force-behind-hurtful-b/
