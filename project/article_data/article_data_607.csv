Tony Evers ad misleads with claim slamming Gov. Scott Walker's sex offender monitoring
","The topic of sex offenders is a hot button issue in any year. In an election year? Crank the rhetoric up to 11. In Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has used several ads to hammer Democratic challenger Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent, about a case involving a Madison-area middle school teacher viewing pornography at school. In return, the Evers campaign released an ad slamming the state Department of Corrections under Walker. The ad stars former Corrections Secretary Ed Wall, who was appointed to the post by Walker. ""Under Scott Walker, the Department of Corrections has only 18 people tracking 25,000 sex offenders"" and ""there are nearly 3,000 sex offenders that are unaccounted for,""  Wall says in the ad for Evers. Wall is one of four former officials in Walker’s administration who have publicly denounced the governor as he seeks a third term. Is he right? In the ad, as Wall speaks, his words are echoed by snippets from a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article that appear on the screen. The footnote says the story ran Sept. 18, 2017, but there is no such story on that date. Instead, Evers campaign deputy communications director Britt Cudaback pointed to an Aug. 27, 2018, Journal Sentinel article and the Aug. 21, 2018, Legislative Reference Bureau report cited in the article. The article does note there are more than 25,000 sex offenders on the registry, but the characterization of 3,000 as ""unaccounted for"" comes from a Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Sondy Pope, not the report itself. And that number has problems. So does the notion there are only 18 people tracking all 25,000 offenders. Let’s dig in. How many offenders? In response to a request from Pope, D-Cross Plains, the Legislative Reference Bureau released its Aug. 21, 2018, report, titled ""Sex Offender Registrants, August 2018."" According to the report: As of Aug. 20, 2018, of the 25,159 offenders on the state's sex offender registry, 16,219 were considered ""compliant"" and 2,735 were considered non-compliant. That’s where the ""nearly 3,000 unaccounted for"" phrase comes from. According to Department of Corrections regulations, an offender is classified non-compliant if he or she, for instance, has reported an incorrect address to the department or they haven't updated their place of employment with the state. Among those who were non-compliant, the report found a much smaller number, 308, had absconded. That is, according to the reference bureau analysis, they were refusing to keep in touch with DOC agents.  That’s a vital distinction. It’s that smaller group that could more correctly be described as ""unaccounted for."" Corrections department spokesman Tristan Cook said ""generally, even if a sex offender is not compliant, we know exactly where they are living and working and are waiting for them to provide updated or missing information required by state statute."" Many, he said, will quickly respond once they are told the information is out of date or missing. Cook cited a more recent count, as of Oct. 22, 2018, that showed 25,205 registered sex offenders. Of those: -- 6,205 (approximately 25 percent) are incarcerated, generally in an adult prison. -- 5,856 (approximately 23 percent) are supervised by a probation or parole agent. -- 13,144 (approximately 52 percent) who have completed supervision requirements. Cook said that in 2017 the department referred 709 cases of non-compliance to local district attorneys for possible prosecution. Those cases, he said, represent those who knowingly or intentionally refused to provide required information. So far in 2018, the department has referred 510 such cases. Who is tracking the offenders? Perhaps the more important number in the claim is the idea that there are only 18 people tracking all 25,000 sex offenders. The first thing to note is that roughly half of that number are either in prison or on probation. So, clearly there are more than 18 people involved in tracking them. According to Cook, there are more than 4,000 members of the security staff in the prisons and more than 1,100 probation and parole agents. Another 500 Department of Health Services employees work at the Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center, which houses the program for sexually violent offenders. Additionally, there are 90 corrections employees who staff an around-the-clock electronic monitoring center. Where does the 18 figure come from? There are 18 ""sex offender registration specialists,"" whose job it is to work to keep sex offenders in compliance. So, the 18 is a real number -- but the ad claims those 18 are the only ones responsible for monitoring all 25,000 sex offenders. That’s way off base. Our rating The Evers ad claims that ""under Scott Walker, the Department of Corrections has only 18 people tracking 25,000 sex offenders"" and ""there are nearly 3,000 sex offenders that are unaccounted for."" But the ad uses real numbers to create distortions. There are 18 sex offender registration specialists, but thousands more are involved in keeping tabs on the 25,000 offenders -- many of whom are still behind bars. There are nearly 3,000 offenders deemed ""non-compliant,"" but that is different than ""unaccounted for."" A report offered a much smaller figure for those who had absconded -- that is, were refusing to keep in touch with DOC agents. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.","[('YouTube, ""Tony Evers for Governor, ‘3,000’"" Sept. 26, 2018.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkUUnzTJ3NE&feature=youtu.be&list=UULAJhzBAUEUvrLiLp1gbvyQ.'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin, ""Third attack ad vs. Tony Evers in teacher porn has some of the same problems,"" August 16, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Fourth former Scott Walker administration officials blasts the governor ahead of election,"" Oct. 19, 2018.', 'https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2018/aug/16/third-attack-ad-vs-tony-evers-teacher-porn-has-som/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Wisconsin corrections officials don’t have current info for nearly 3,000 sex offenders,"" August 27, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Vote Smart, Facts Matter, ""Governor Doyle Announces Sex Offender Apprehension and Felony Enforcement Initiative,"" Sept. 20, 2005.', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/18/4th-former-walker-administration-official-throws-support-evers/1682929002/'), ('Email, Tristan Cook, Department of Corrections, communications director, October 23, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Email, Britt Cudaback, deputy communications director for Tony for Wisconsin, Oct. 25, 2018.', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/27/corrections-officials-dont-have-current-addresses-photographs-3-000-sex-offenders-state-analysis-sho/1107136002/'), ('Legislative Reference Bureau, ""Sex Offender Registrants, August 2018,"" August 21, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin State Legislature statute 301.45 ""Sex Offender Registration.""', 'https://votesmart.org/public-statement/125617/governor-doyle-announces-sex-offender-apprehension-and-felony-enforcement-initiative#.W9Cn5fZOlaQ'), ('Department of Health Services, ""Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/oct/29/tony-evers/ad-challenger-tony-evers-slams-gov-scott-walker-se/

McCaskill isn't popular, but the GOP's claim that she's the worst doesn't check out
","The GOP wants to position Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., as unable to represent more conservative ideals in this firmly red state. ""Congrats to @clairecmc for being named most likely to be the most unpopular senator in the United States for four months in a row! Quite an accomplishment! #MOSen,"" the party tweeted Sept. 10 as part of its support for challenger Josh Hawley. Being named as the least popular senator in the country would be an unwanted title, so we wanted to check into the Missouri GOP’s claim. We reached out to the Missouri Republican Party multiple times by email and received no reply. But small text in the tweet’s photo credited the claim to a Morning Consult poll. Morning Consult is a technology company that works in collecting and understanding data. It has a newsroom section that focuses on data reporting, like data from senator approval rating polls. The Morning Consult poll in question shows the 10 top-ranked and bottom-ranked senators in the country. Each senator’s percentage rankings have a different margin of error, ranging from 1 to 6 percentage points. The margin of error for McCaskill’s is 1 percentage point. Morning Consult’s methodology has various aspects to it. Surveys are sent out online to registered voters in each state. The questions asked of each respondent only included subjects about their voting preferences and specifics about their state’s senator. For Missouri, each poll received between 7,000 and 9,000 responses from registered voters. Party affiliation of the voters is not broken down by state. The poll is conducted quarterly, not every month, as readers of the GOP tweet might think. And it doesn’t rank which senator is the ""most likely to be the most unpopular senator."" The polls contain approval, disapproval and unknown/undecided ratings. McCaskill was the fourth-least popular senator in the nation in the July 25 poll. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the least popular. In Morning Consult’s April and July quarterly polls McCaskill had a 44 percent disapproval rating. Her approval rating dropped by 1 percentage point to 39 percent from April to July. Morning Consult more frequently updates the poll for the 10 incumbents in highly competitive races. The September update, released before the tweet, showed McCaskill had a 46 percent disapproval rating, the highest among the other selected senators on the ballot in 2018. The poll also has a question in which voters are asked if they think it is time for someone new. McCaskill received the second-highest ranking of respondents saying yes, at 53 percent. That was behind Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, another Democrat, at 54 percent. The tweet is more than a month old, so we wanted to look at the most recent ratings. As of the most recent update Oct. 3, McCaskill was up to a 48 percent disapproval rating. McCaskill’s disapproval rating has been increasing since the 44 percent in July, but has never eclipsed McConnell to be the senator with the worst disapproval rating. McCaskill’s time for a new person rating has also gone up to 54 percent from the October update, but it is still behind Nelson’s by one percentage point. Morning Consult has also released its third-quarter senator rankings, and McCaskill is now the third-least popular. Although they do show that McCaskill has climbed up one rank, she is still not the most unpopular senator. Polling experts we talked to noted that registered voters are more likely to be Republican, which could lead Democrats on Morning Consult polls to have inflated disapproval statistics. Cliff Zukin, Rutgers University professor of political science and public policy, brought up that the results from the surveys are brought from volunteer responses, which is not as accurate as a true scientific sampling method. Because the respondents would volunteer to answer the survey, it is not as representative of the underlying population as a completely random sampling method would be. Claiming that disapproval rating and being the ""worst"" are not as linked as one might think. Kenneth D. Wald, University of Florida professor emeritus of political science, claimed that politicians making decisions on polarizing topics will usually increase their disapproval rating as they would upset a some group of people. The Missouri GOP said, ""Congrats to @clairecmc for being named most likely to be the most unpopular senator in the United States for four months in a row!"" The tweet is sloppily worded as there is no such designation for being named ""most likely to be the most unpopular senator."" McCaskill’s popularity is low among her peers up for re-election. But she isn’t the most unpopular. McConnell held that position in July and has kept it through to October. When compared to certain vulnerable incumbents, she does have the highest disapproval rating in the country. The Missouri GOP tweet said that she is the most unpopular senator in the country, which does not reference solely incumbents running for re-election. We rate the statement Mostly False.","[('Email exchange with Cameron Easley, Morning Consult reporter, Oct. 2-5, 2018', 'https://morningconsult.com/2018/04/12/americas-most-and-least-popular-senators/'), ('Email exchange with Anthony Patterson, Morning Consult communications director, Oct. 16, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Andrew Gelman, Professor of Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University, Oct. 2, 2018', 'https://morningconsult.com/2018/07/25/americas-most-and-least-popular-senators-2/'), ('Email exchange with Cliff Zukin, Professor of Political Science & Public Policy, Rutgers University, Oct. 23, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Brian Schaffner, Newhouse Professor of Civic Studies, Tufts University, Oct. 23. 2018', 'https://morningconsult.com/2018/10/10/americas-most-and-least-popular-senators-10-10/'), ('Email exchange with Kenneth D.

"['Health Care', 'Illinois', 'Peter Roskam']","
Roskam fibs about facts — and fact checks — of his health care record
","In their final televised debate ahead of the November midterms, U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam of Wheaton and Democratic challenger Sean Casten tussled over a wide range of disagreements and accusations, but one about health care policy stood out. Roskam, seeking a seventh term in his west suburban district, was asked by debate moderator Carol Marin of WTTW to reconcile repeated votes to repeal Obamacare with his claim that he strongly supports insurance safeguards for those with pre-existing conditions. ""Well, like many people have said, let’s take the good things out of it and embrace those and shun the bad things. And that’s exactly what we did,"" Roskam responded, referring to a Republican substitute for Obamacare that was narrowly defeated. ""Sean has falsely accused me of being against protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and that was fact-checked by the Washington Post who gave that four Pinocchios."" Did fact checkers at the Washington Post indeed side with Roskam? And has Roskam always championed those pre-existing protections, as he claimed? The short answer is ""no."" No such fact check exists. PolitiFact and Washington Post fact checkers have also determined that the Republican health plan Roskam backed would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The longer answer involves a concerted effort by several congressional Republicans, as well as President Donald Trump, to misleadingly recast the GOP as defenders of one of the most popular elements of the very health care law that they have attempted to dismantle for years. First a word about Pinocchios. Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker use a different rating system than PolitiFact’s ""Truth-O-Meter"" to measure degrees of distortion and mendacity, with Four Pinocchios being the worst rating someone can receive. ""Egad,"" was the initial response from Glenn Kessler, the Post’s lead fact checker, when we notified him about Roskam’s claim to have been exonerated by the paper. Kessler told us no such fact check exists. At the same time, he pointed to recent Four Pinocchio ratings he had given to Rep. Jeff Denham, a Republican from California, and Rep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, for making essentially the same claim Roskam made. Since we first contacted Kessler, he has told followers on Twitter that at least three other Republican House members have joined Denham, Brat and Roskam in repeating the false assertion, among them Rep. Rodney Davis, who is locked in a tight re-election battle in the central Illinois 13th District. Kessler called them all out on Twitter following our inquiry. ""Lawmakers, if you voted for AHCA, defend your decision, but do not try to hide behind our Pinocchios,"" he wrote after quoting Roskam specifically. [From the Washington Post: These Republicans are misleading voters about our Obamacare fact checks] In support of Roskam’s claim, the Republican’s campaign pointed us to a Washington Post fact check of a statement from Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California that took her to task for significantly inflating the number of people with pre-existing conditions that would be put at risk by the GOP plan, called the American Health Care Act. It passed the House but died in the Senate last year. That’s the same fact check Denham erroneously cited. Nowhere does the piece about Harris credit the Republican substitute health plan backed by Roskam and the others with protecting pre-existing conditions. Indeed, Kessler authored a more recent piece likening the GOP pledge to protect pre-existing conditions to former President Barack Obama’s unsustainable promise that under Obamacare, ""if you like your plan, you can keep it."" In 2013, PolitiFact named that Obama promise its Lie of the Year. PolitiFact recently revisited the pre-existing condition coverage debate, explaining why Republican proposals on pre-existing conditions are inferior to those contained in Obamacare. Like Obamacare, the GOP plan guaranteed that those with pre-existing conditions could not be denied coverage outright. But it would allow for insurers to charge some with pre-existing conditions significantly more for coverage, potentially making policies too expensive to afford. Roskam said his Democratic opponent had falsely accused him ""of being against protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and that was fact-checked by the Washington Post who gave that four Pinocchios."" No such fact check exists. Roskam’s campaign did point us to a fact check of a claim made by a Senate Democrat that greatly overestimated the number of Americans with pre-existing conditions who might not be able to access coverage if Obamacare were replaced by GOP substitute. But that fact check had nothing to do with Roskam or his stance. Roskam voted for the substitute, which would have weakened the pre-existing condition protections of Obamacare. We don’t hand out Pinocchios, but we have a similar measure for whoppers like Roskam’s.

Like Beto O'Rourke, NC Democrat Kathy Manning claims no corporate PAC donations in her campaign
","The campaign for a U.S. House seat representing parts of Greensboro and surrounding areas has frequently focused on money: Who’s getting the most outside funding, and who is or isn’t beholden to special interests. The two main candidates are Republican incumbent Ted Budd and Democratic challenger Kathy Manning. In a recent debate they sparred once again over the questions of money and influence. Manning criticized Budd for taking thousands of dollars from special interest groups, but Budd defended himself, saying: ""If anybody wants to support me, that’s great."" Manning retorted that she will act differently if elected. ""When a corporation or corporate special interest makes a campaign contribution, they do it because they’re looking for you to support legislation that will help (its) bottom line,"" Manning said in the debate. ""That’s why I’m not taking any corporate PAC money. I don’t want to be beholden to corporations. I want to go to Washington to fight for the people of our district."" She reiterated that talking point in her closing statement, saying, ""I haven’t taken a dime of corporate PAC money because I want to represent the people."" Manning is technically correct that she doesn’t take money from corporate PACs. But her claim ignores the fact that — like nearly all politicians — her donor list is full of CEOs, lobbyists, real estate developers and other corporate bigwigs. She also takes money from other types of non-corporate PACs, some of which are funded by corporate PACs and other business interests. ""She’s got a lot of money from unions,"" said Sarah Bryner, the research director for campaign finance watchdog group Center for Responsive Politics. ""Lots of PAC money. Just not what most of us would consider corporate PAC money."" Many types of PACs Corporate PACs are one of three different types of political action committees (the others are labor PACs and political PACs) that can give directly to candidates. There are also super PACs, which can’t give to candidates but can spend money on their behalf. The Manning-Budd race has drawn more than $3 million in outside spending so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, in addition to the nearly $5 million the candidates have raised. Data from the Center for Responsive Politics on its website OpenSecrets.org shows Manning’s $2.9 million in fundraising includes more than $180,000 from PACs as of Oct. 16. Budd’s $1.8 million in fundraising includes nearly $800,000 from PACs in that same period. For both candidates, their single largest donor is a political PAC. Bryner said donations like this make it hard for candidates to truly say their campaigns are free from corporate influence, since political PACs are often funded by corporate PACs or other corporate interests. For instance Manning took $10,000 from the New Democrat Coalition, a pro-business Democratic PAC that gets much of its funding from donors in industries like defense contracting, pharmaceuticals, insurance, energy and health care. And it’s far from the only PAC with business connections. ""If you take money from a political party, that money may have come from a corporation,"" Bryner said. And then there’s the fact that corporate PACs are not funded from corporate revenues at all. It’s illegal for businesses to give money directly to candidates. Instead, corporate PACs are funded voluntarily by employees of the corporation. For that reason, Joseph Albanese, a researcher at the pro-PAC group Institute for Free Speech, wrote in March that it’s misleading and unfair for candidates to imply that taking money from corporate PACs is inherently worse than taking money from people who work for that company. ""This is essentially equivalent to saying that donations from anyone who works for a corporation are a corrupting influence on our democracy,"" Albanese wrote. Manning’s big donors As one example, Manning has not taken any money directly from the PAC run by Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and other tech companies. That’s perhaps not too surprising; earlier this summer the magazine The Atlantic reported that ""most nonincumbents don’t receive any corporate PAC donations."" Manning has, however, taken money from at least three political PACs (the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, BRIDGE PAC and AmeriPAC) that are funded in part by the Alphabet PAC. Manning has also taken money from Alphabet employees, including $10,800 from the CEO (and his wife) of an urban development company Alphabet owns called Sidewalk Labs. ""The idea that by rejecting corporate PAC money — which by the way is also money from people — that you’re rejecting corporate influence, is a little silly,"" Bryner said. The list of Manning’s most generous donors contains a lot of corporate bigwigs. The maximum donation a couple can give is $10,800, and some of the couples giving that amount include: ▪ Daniel Doctoroff and his wife Alisa. Daniel Doctoroff is the CEO of Sidewalk Labs. ▪ Kay Hagan and her husband Charles. Kay Hagan is a former U.S. senator and bank executive, and Charles Hagan is a Greensboro attorney. ▪ Doug Baker and his wife Julie. Doug Baker is the CEO of EcoLab, a Minnesota chemical company that owns the North Carolina cleaning supply company Swisher Hygiene. ▪ Seth Klarman and his wife Beth. Seth Klarman is the CEO of Baupost Group, one of the world’s biggest hedge funds. ▪ Bobby Long and his wife Kathryn. Bobby Long is a prominent Greensboro businessman who’s involved with the investment firm Granville Capitol, whose CEO Steve Hassenfelt also gave Manning $5,400. ▪ Norman Samet and his wife Sylvia. Norman Samet is the former leader of both the Triad and High Point chambers of commerce and owns a construction and development company, Samet Corp. A growing trend Despite the difficulties in avoiding corporate influence in elections, many politicians like Manning have recently been pledging to not take money from corporate PACs. Some of the politicians making similar claims have been urged on by End Citizens United, a PAC that is dedicated to opposing super PACs and corporate influence in politics. End Citizens United endorsed Manning and donated $8,500 to her campaign, writing: ""Voters are fed up with the way Washington does business, and they’re demanding reform. By rejecting corporate PAC money, Kathy is taking bold steps to address the problem before she even gets to Congress."" Perhaps the most notable member of this trend is Democratic Texas Senate challenger Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke, who has raised a whopping $60 million in his attempt to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, has done so without any corporate PAC money. But for similar reasons as laid out in this fact-check, PolitiFact previously ruled O’Rouke’s 2017 claim about avoiding corporate cash as Half True. Our ruling Kathy Manning said ""I’m not taking any corporate PAC money. I don’t want to be beholden to corporations."" Manning is technically correct that she hasn’t taken any corporate PAC money. But she has taken money from other PACs, including from non-corporate PACs that are funded by corporate PACs. Furthermore, what Manning fails to mention is that corporate PACs are not funded by corporations themselves, but rather by the employees of those corporations. And she has taken plenty of money from employees of large corporations, including the CEOs of companies in industries like investment banking, real estate, chemicals and tech. We rate this claim Half True.","[('Phone interview with Sarah Bryner, research director at the Center for Responsive Politics', 'https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/376507-politicians-saying-no-to-corporate-pac-donations-are-pulling-a-stunt'), ('Joseph Albanese op-ed, March 3, 2018, ""Politicians saying \'no\' to corporate PAC donations are pulling a stunt""', 'No link'), ('Endorsement of Manning by End Citizens United', 'http://endcitizensunited.org/press-releases/end-citizens-united-endorses-kathy-manning-nc-13/'), ('OpenSecrets.org summary of campaign donations in the Budd-Manning race', 'No link'), ('News & Observer article, Oct. 23, 2018, ""Budd, Manning clash over campaign accusations in debate for closely watched House race""', 'https://www.opensecrets.org/races/contributors?cycle=2018&id=NC13&spec=N')]",/factchecks/2018/oct/28/kathy-manning/beto-orourke-nc-democrat-kathy-manning-claims-no-c/
"['New York', 'Marc Molinaro']","
Molinaro says Cuomo's spending not as good as he claims
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his Republican rival, Marc Molinaro, argued about the condition of New York state’s finances during their only one-on-one debate of the campaign. Molinaro pushed back against Cuomo’s claim that he has increased spending by only 2 percent per year, lower than it has been in modern political history.  ""Your budgets have increased spending at about an annual rate of 4 percent each year,"" Molinaro said. ""So, despite the fact that you continue to suggest that you’ve been able to hold the two percent, you haven’t."" Since taxes and spending are a hot topic for New Yorkers, we decided to check Molinaro’s claim. Cuomo has said that he would keep spending increases to 2 percent every year. This is a voluntary cap, and is not part of state law. In 2016, PolitiFact New York  checked Cuomo’s claim that he had kept spending increases to 2 percent, and found his claim to be True. But in the last two years, the rate of state spending has changed, according to experts. The state Division of Budget and independent budget analysts have agreed that when evaluating Cuomo’s pledge to keep state spending growth at 2 percent, expenditures in the State Operating Funds should be considered. Those funds are for state operations, funded by state resources. They exclude federal funds, which the state does not control, and capital spending. Spending included in State Operating Funds go beyond the state’s General Fund, however, and also includes things such as state-funded special revenue funds and some debt service.    The independent Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research organization, analyzes state budgets and found that the 2018-19 budget, which began April 1, calls for increased spending of 4.5 percent. The commission found that, despite state leaders’ proclamations that spending growth had stayed at 2 percent, ""after adjusting for shifts of certain types of spending out of state operating funds or across fiscal years, the budget actually increases 4.5 percent from fiscal year 2018."" A commission analysis of the 2017-18 budget found that spending would rise by 3.7 percent, despite the administration’s claim that it would rise by only 2 percent. The administration moved spending around to other funds or other years in order to maintain 2 percent growth, according to the commission. The author of both of those reports, David Friedfel, spoke about the governor’s record on spending increases during a post-debate podcast from the commission and Gotham Gazette. For the first six years of his administration, Cuomo is right to say that he kept spending growth at 2 percent, said Friedfel, director of state studies at the commission. But in the last year and in the current year, that’s not the case, he said. ""The 2 percent certainly isn’t accurate, and to continue to push that is problematic, just from a transparency perspective,"" he said.   State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli had similar findings. DiNapoli, who is independently elected and whose staff analyzes every budget, reports that increases in spending in the 2018-19 budget is more than double Cuomo’s state spending cap. DiNapoli’s budget analysis, released in July, stated that though the Cuomo administration had claimed that it stuck to a spending increase of 2 percent, when budget management actions are accounted for, such as taking $1.4 billion in spending for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority off-budget, ""the Office of the State Comptroller estimates State Operating Funds spending growth at more than 5 percent."" For the 2017-18 budget, DiNapoli found that after adjusting for budget actions that allowed the administration to claim only a 2 percent increase, that spending was actually set to increase by ""approximately 4 percent."" Molinaro said that state spending under Cuomo has increased beyond the 2 percent cap, despite Cuomo’s claims. Cuomo has been in office since 2011. In the first six years, as PolitiFact New York and others have pointed out, Cuomo kept the growth in state spending to 2 percent.    But in the last two years, state spending has increased beyond 2 percent, though the Cuomo administration has shifted spending in the budget to make it appear as if the 2 percent cap has been honored, according to experts. We rate Molinaro’s claim True.  ","[('Debate between Andrew Cuomo and Marc Molinaro, CBS2, Oct. 23, 2018.

Holding misleads on Obamacare premium increase during Monday night debate
","No matter where you’re voting this November, chances are you’ve heard your fair share of talking points on health care. Across the country, Democrats and Republicans have been trading blows about the Affordable Care Act and Republicans’ efforts to chip away at it. The story is no different in North Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnston, Wake, Nash and Harnett counties. In a debate Monday night, Republican Rep. George Holding sounded off on the ACA, also known as Obamacare, for raising premiums. ""Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent, and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we’re all paying 100 percent more,"" Holding said. Holding’s complaint was a popular refrain for Republicans last year, so PolitiFact has already checked similar claims from President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. James Lankford. But the race between Holding and Democrat Linda Coleman, a former member of the state legislature, has morphed into one of the nation’s more competitive contests, so we decided to put Holding’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. In short, Holding’s claim that ""we’re all paying 100 percent more"" is highly misleading because it conflates the whole insured population with the 2 to 5 percent of people who buy their coverage on the individual market. The Holding campaign declined to comment, but Republicans making similar claims last year often cited a 2017 report from the Department of Health and Human Services, which compared premiums from 2013 — a year before the ACA took full effect — to premiums in 2017. That report looked at policies purchased on the individual market and found that premiums were 105 percent higher on average in 2017 than they were four years earlier. A recent press release from the HHS’s Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed that premiums had more than doubled since Obamacare was put in place. ""Average individual market premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on HealthCare.gov in 2017, an increase of $2,928 or 105 percent,"" the press release said. Experts agree that premiums have gone up, but some have said the 2017 HHS report should be taken with a grain of salt. David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the 2013 and 2017 figures in the HHS report are not an apples-to-apples comparison. ""Their comparison is based on two totally different universes of individuals who are being covered,"" Anderson said. ""The ACA market is significantly more morbid, which means more sick, which means higher claim levels than the pre-2014 market."" That’s because before ACA regulations took full effect, people who had pre-existing conditions or other risk factors could be denied coverage or charged higher rates, Anderson explained. Additionally, the HHS report ignored subsidies provided under Obamacare, which lowered out-of-pocket expenses for many policyholders in 2017. These post-subsidy costs are more important anyway, since that’s what they actually have to pay. The HHS study also listed several limitations to its findings, such as: A note that Obamacare imposed many new regulations not fully in place until 2014. ""In most states, these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans,"" the report said.  A note acknowledging that ""older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool (in 2017) than in 2013."" The report said this change was likely ""a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market."" A note explaining that the report did not factor in premium changes in states that set up their own online exchanges, such as California. ""To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges, the national average increase may differ,"" the report said. With these limitations in mind, Anderson pointed instead to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care, which he said shows how premiums have changed within the individual market as defined by the ACA. That data compared monthly premiums from 2014 and 2018 and showed that they rose from $273 to $481 during that period for a slightly smaller increase of about 76 percent. For the record, Anderson also said Holding was right that 91 percent of people are currently insured. But even still, the numbers were not the biggest problem with Holding’s statement. Anderson said Holding’s claim that ""we’re all paying 100 percent more"" was ""extremely problematic"" because most people do not get insurance on the individual market, which typically provides coverage that is less comprehensive but more costly. ""This is, in my opinion, a very deceptive statement by Rep. Holding, as he is conflating the ACA created and regulated individual market with general experience in other, non-ACA regulated group and government market segments,"" he said. More than 55 percent of Americans have employer-based health insurance plans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Approximately 19 and 17 percent are insured through Medicaid and Medicare, respectively, and a final 5 percent have military-provided coverage. That means the Affordable Care Act’s individual market covers only about 5 percent of the population, and the percentage that does not receive help from subsidies is even smaller. ""The ACA premium increases that (Holding) references are relevant for 2 to 5 percent of the population in the individual market,"" Anderson said. ""They are not reflective of what 86 to 88 percent of the population pays in premiums, where premiums have increased at a far slower rate."" Citing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the State Health Access Data Assistance Center, Anderson said premiums for people covered by their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid have risen at a much slower rate. Employer-sponsored insurance premiums, for example, jumped about 14 to 17 percent between 2013 and 2017. So Holding has cherry-picked the worst example that covers the smallest number of people and implied that everyone is paying 100 percent more for their coverage. Holding said, ""Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we’re all paying 100 percent more."" There are fragments of truth in that, but the way he’s constructed that statement makes it a significant distortion. While a 100 percent increase is what was reported in 2017 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the comparison distorts the truth that the vast majority of Americans encountered. Holding’s claim that ""we’re all paying 100 percent more"" was especially misleading because only 2 to 5 percent of people are affected by premium increases on the Affordable Care Act’s individual market. Holding cherry-picked the smallest market for insurance and suggested that everyone was suffering that way. But for most people, the premium increases have not been nearly as steep as he said. In particular, it’s simply not true that ""we’re all paying 100 percent more."" In fact, the vast majority of Americans get their coverage from employers, Medicare or Medicaid. We rate this statement False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Budd relies on Manning's husband for claim about her donations
","Many political candidates try to portray their opponents as more radical than they really are. Republicans portray Democrats as left-wing and Democrats portray Republicans as right-wing. In North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District, incumbent Republican Ted Budd has accused Democrat Kathy Manning of being a ""left-wing political insider"" who was ""hand-picked"" by House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. Budd, a first-term congressman from Davie County, has focused on Manning’s donations to Democrats. He has accused Manning of donating ""nearly $1 million"" — but his claims have varied. In an interview for a McClatchy story published earlier this month, Budd said ""nearly $1 million (of Manning’s money) has been given to Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein."" In the Spectrum News debate on Oct. 23, Budd said ""Over the last 10 or so years, she and her husband donated nearly $1 million to Nancy Pelosi."" And on Oct. 24, Budd announced his launch of a TV ad that on the screen accuses Manning of donating ""nearly $1 million to liberals."" The actors say she gave ""big money"" to Pelosi and Clinton. So which is it? The candidates’ math Has Manning given ""nearly $1 million"" to Pelosi? What about Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein? Overall, has she donated nearly $1 million to liberals? PolitiFact reached out to the Budd campaign for clarification on the claim. Budd’s claim relies on donations from Manning’s husband, Randall Kaplan, to get to what they consider to be nearly $1 million. Together, they say Manning and Kaplan have given a combined $887,053 to liberal candidates and causes. Manning has given $307,428, they say, while Kaplan has given $579,625. Meanwhile, the Manning campaign says she’s given $256,550. And Manning’s campaign opposes the notion that she and Kaplan’s respective donations should be counted together. But we’ll get back to that later. What do campaign finance records show? What records show Donations are difficult to track to the exact dollar. Donors don’t always use the exact name when they sign a check — they may sometimes use a middle initial and sometimes not — and there’s sometimes more than one donor with the same name. But a PolitiFact review of donations on the Federal Election Commission website and data provided by OpenSecrets.org, run by a nonprofit that tracks money in politics, found that each of Budd’s claims falls short. To Pelosi specifically, FEC records show Manning and her husband have given a combined $3,000. Manning has given $1,500 — $1,000 in 2004 and $500 in 2002. Kaplan gave $1,000 in 2006 and $500 in 2002. To former Sen. Boxer and Sen. Feinstein, the couple has given a combined $2,250. Obviously, the couple’s donations to that trio of Democrats comes nowhere near $1 million. So what about total donations? The Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, found that the couple has donated a combined $545,500 to federal candidates and political action committees. Manning has donated $196,950, while Kaplan has given $348,550. For donations to state-level candidates and committees, PolitiFact consulted the N.C. Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement website. At the state level, the couple has donated a combined $224,021. Manning has given $46,796, while Kaplan has given $177,225. Separate donations Manning’s campaign opposes the notion that she and Kaplan’s respective donations should be counted together. Manning is successful independent of her husband and their political interests don’t always align, said Hailey Barringer, spokeswoman for Manning. Manning went to Harvard, then Michigan Law School and practiced immigration law in Greensboro before starting her own firm. In some cases, they’ve shared the same political goals. Each has donated thousands to national and state party organizations. Each donated to Gov. Roy Cooper, Attorney General Josh Stein and former U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan. But Kaplan has made donations to some candidates that Manning didn’t help and vice-versa. Candidates that got money from Kaplan but not Manning include congressional candidate Ryan Watts, former NC Senate leader Marc Basnight and former Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton. Candidates that got money from Manning but not Kaplan include U.S. Rep. Alma Adams and the late Republican U.S. Rep. Howard Coble. In total, the OpenSecrets.org and NC elections board data shows the couple has given a combined $769,521 in federal and state-level donations. Manning has given $243,746 and Kaplan has given $525,775. Our ruling Budd says Manning has given ""nearly $1 million to liberals."" That math relies on contributions by her husband. She hasn’t given anywhere close to that, doesn’t need to rely on her husband’s money to give to candidates, and their varied donations show they can have separate political interests.

Tammy Baldwin partially accurate in claiming 83% of GOP tax law benefits go to top 1%, corporations
","One of the statistical claims Tammy Baldwin likes most, in debates or elsewhere on the campaign trail, is a slam on the tax reform measure that President Donald Trump signed into law in December 2017. Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, is running against Republican Leah Vukmir in the Nov. 6, 2018 election, aiming to win a second term in the U.S. Senate. Baldwin recited the statistical claim again on Oct. 22, 2018 during a rally for Democrats in Milwaukee that featured U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Referring to Vukmir, she said: All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. ""You know, my opponent backed that plan, where 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of individuals and large multinational corporations on the corporate side."" Is the GOP-backed law that favorable to the rich? Our colleagues have three times rated as Half True claims that are similar to Baldwin’s. Each claim cited an analysis of the tax law by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The analysis found that by 2027, the law would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different, as PolitiFact National reported: For instance, in 2018, according to the center’s analysis, the bill would deliver 20.5 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent — vastly less than the 83 percent figure the DNC touted.  And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on. (The Tax Policy Center said its work doesn’t allow for figuring out the cumulative gains and losses over the 10 years of the tax law. Its study published only single-year results and only for three years.) Baldwin’s statement is slightly different in that she refers not only to the top 1 percent of individuals but also large multinational corporations as enjoying 83 percent of the benefits of the law. But she, too, relies on the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. As it turns out, Baldwin’s phrasing doesn’t really make her claim materially different than the similar ones we’ve fact checked — at least with regard to how the analysis that she relies on was done. Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, told us: ""Corporations legally pay taxes. But a corporation is just an entity that is truly owned by individuals who bear the economic burden of the tax."" Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, had a similar take. He told us: ""When thinking about the distributional impact of tax changes, you should only look at how it ultimately affects people, as corporations are little pieces of paper in a filing cabinet somewhere — they can’t really feel the burden of any tax."" In other words, despite the variation in phrasing, Baldwin’s statement isn’t any more accurate than the previous statements we’ve checked. Baldwin says that under the Republican tax reform law, ""83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of individuals and large multinational corporations."" Even though her statement mentions corporations, it isn’t materially different than three similar statements we’ve checked. In a nutshell, the analysis that all four statements rely on found that by 2027, the law would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different, with much smaller percentages of the benefits  — 20 to 25 percent — going to the top 1 percent. Baldwin’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details  — our definition of Half True.","[('YouTube, Tammy Baldwin campaign rally remarks (1:12:30), Oct. 22, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOTj1tYAn_I'), ('Email, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt, Oct. 26, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email, Leah Vukmir campaign spokesman Jahan Wilcox, Oct. 25, 2018', 'https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/oct/20/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-80-percent-republican-sought-ta/'), ('PolitiFact Texas, ""Lloyd Doggett says 80 percent of Republican-sought tax cuts flow to wealthiest 1 percent,"" Oct. 20, 2017', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact National, ""Nevada TV ad cherry-picks tax cut benefits to top 1%,"" July 10, 2018', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/10/tax-march/nevada-tv-ad-cherry-picks-tax-cut-benefits-top-1/'), ('PolitiFact National, ""DNC offers one-sided view on who gets tax bill\'s benefits,"" Jan. 16, 2018', 'No link'), ('Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, ""Distributional Analysis of the Conference Agreement for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,"" Dec. 18, 2017', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/16/democratic-national-committee/dnc-offers-one-sided-view-who-gets-tax-bills-benef/'), ('FactCheck.org, ""Democrats’ Misleading Tax Line,"" Jan. 26, 2018', 'No link'), ('Interview, Joseph Rosenberg, senior research associate with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, Oct. 26, 2018', 'http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act'), ('Email, Cato Institute director of tax policy studies Chris Edwards, Oct. 26, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email, Tax Foundation economist and Center for Quantitative Analysis director Kyle Pomerleau, Oct. 26, 2018', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/democrats-misleading-tax-line/')]",/factchecks/2018/oct/26/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-partially-accurate-claiming-83-gop-t/

It also paused admission of all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely stopped the entry of refugees from Syria. ""This is wrong,"" the ad shows Donnelly saying, emphasizing each word. But footage from that same speech shows he was actually quoting Republicans to support his position — not the ""radical left"". ""(Senators) John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) came out today and said: This is wrong. This does not make us safer. And so I say to all of you here, thank you. Thank you for standing up for America and American values,"" Donnelly said. Donnelly was paraphrasing a joint statement McCain and Graham released on Jan. 29, 2017. ""This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,"" they wrote. ""That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security."" Trump produced three iterations of the ban. The first two were struck down by the courts. The third was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump's travel restrictions currently apply to nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela. NRSC did not respond to multiple requests for comment. NRSC said, ""We know dangerous criminals can slip through immigration at airports just like ours. Yet Joe Donnelly stood right here with the radical left against all efforts to secure our most vulnerable entry points."" Donnelly has mostly stood with Republicans when it comes to immigration. He stood with Democrats and several prominent Republicans, whom he quotes in the video, in decrying Trump’s executive order to halt the entry of people from countries impacted by terrorism. That’s not the ""radical left"".

Photo of bloodied police is from 2012, not caravan
","Rumors about the caravan of Central American migrants making their way across Mexico are rampant. Even the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas seems to be chiming in.

False report of Democratic, CNN ties to pipe bombs
","In the world of right-wing conspiracy fans, the series of bombs sent to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, CNN and other targets of President Donald Trump’s barbs is nothing more than a left-wing Democratic feint –– a false-flag operation designed to undermine Trump’s message. An outfit called Stranger Than Fiction News posted a video on its Facebook page Oct. 25. Over footage of a group of masked protestors burning an American flag, the post has the bold news headline ""‘MAGA bomber’ identified as former CNN employee who donated to heavily to Hillary Clinton."" (The video matches an antifa flag burning in Portland, Ore.) The video had over 30,000 views, and if the comments are any guide, it reached a receptive audience. Comments included ""The Democratic Party is a terrorist organization,"" and ""The fake pipe bomb fiasco that has gripped America for the last two days is rapidly unraveling as a political hoax."" A couple of people asked ""Is this for real?"" To which we say, no. This is pure, 100 percent certified fake news.

Bloggers, Trump, Gaetz offer no evidence that caravan was funded by Democrats
","The 7,000 people trying to make their way to the United States-Mexican border, a trek that originated with a smaller group from Honduras, continues to be the source of misinformation. A key theme being promoted by conservative pundits and websites is that is is being financed by the Democratic Party as an attempt to influence the November elections and undermine President Donald Trump. That concept is summed up by an Oct. 21, 2018 post on the Facebook site Conservative World Daily that has received more than 34,000 shares. It reads, ""Over 7000 Hondurans are now headed to our border, with camera crews and support vehicles, two weeks before the midterm elections. If you don't know that this was funded by Democrat activists, then you're not paying attention."" Here at PolitiFact, we do pay attention. So far, we haven't seen any hard facts to back up the assertion that the migration ""was funded by Democrat activists."" We're not alone.This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Some of the argument in favor of the migrant march being funded by Democrats seems to be completely made up, while some is based on video footage that falls short of qualifying as evidence. The video was posted in a tweet from Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Oct. 17. 2018. It shows a man handing out individual slips of currency-sized paper to women and girls. Gaetz characterized it as ""Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & srom the US border @ election time. Soros? US-back NGOs? Time to investigate the source!"" Trump later retweeted the video with the message, ""Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?"" The footage is from Chiquimula, Guatemala, not Honduras, and shot outside a store that sells auto parts. On his Twitter feed, Guatemalan journalist Luis Assardo reported, ""I managed to talk to locals and they told me that among merchants in the sector they collected money and gave it to people from #CaravanaDeMigrantes.""   ""Some have asked me about the money and it is important to say that we do not know its denomination,"" Assardo said. ""But in Guatemala the tickets with the highest denomination are Q200 ($ 25 approx) and Q100 ($ 12.5). That is, the most they could have received (if that were the case) are between $ 12 and $ 25."" Gaetz later acknowledged on his Twitter feed that he got the location wrong. He has offered no evidence that the handout was being coordinated by a non-government organization (NGO) or Soros, a reference to George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist widely reviled in conservative circles for supporting Democrats and promoting progressive causes. (For example, during the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, Trump accused Soros, without evidence, of paying protesters to oppose the nomination.) No NGO -- Democratic or not -- has acknowledged financing creation of the caravan, and bloggers have not specifically named any group. Soros' philanthropic Open Society Foundations released a statement Oct. 18 saying, ""Neither Mr. Soros nor Open Society are funding this effort."" And bloggers have offered no evidence to the contrary. Thus, the claim that the Honduran exodus ""was funded by Democrat activists"" is all talk and no walk.

No, equestrian statues don't have a secret 'code of hooves'
","Google ""war statues"" and the first suggestion the search engine makes to finish the query is ""horse legs."" That might have something to do with a longtime claim that’s again making the rounds on social media. ""Did you know?"" says a Sept. 10 Facebook post showing photographs of three statues. ""If a statue of a person in the park on a horse has both front legs in the air, the person died in battle. If the horse has one front leg in the air, the person died as a result of wounds received in battle. If the horse has a (sic) all four legs on the ground, the person died of natural causes."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post has been shared more than 89,000 times as of Oct. 25. The original poster attributed the information to A-Z Facts, but a web search for that source only turned up websites for children with facts about animals and the state of Arizona. The first of the three images used in the Facebook post appears to be of the Bronze Horseman, a monument in St. Petersburg, Russia, to Peter the Great. The horse has its front legs in the air but Peter the Great died of gangrene, not in battle. The second image appears to be of the Virginia Washington Monument, showing George Washington on a horse with one leg aloft. But Washington didn’t die from battle wounds—he fell ill after working in cold, wet weather. The final image appears to be a statue of King George IV on a horse with all four feet on the ground in Trafalgar Square in London. It’s true that George didn’t die in battle, or afterward from wounds. He consumed ""prodigious amounts of drugs"" and cherry brandy before his death, according to the BBC.

Reid claims O'Connor had no previous judicial experience
","In a recent Senate floor speech, Democratic Leader Harry Reid likened Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan to another woman who sat on the court, Sandra Day O'Connor.""One of my favorite Supreme Court Justices in recent years has been Sandra Day O’Connor, not because she’s a Republican, but because she was a good judge. I think one reason she was a good judge is she had no judicial experience,"" Reid said on May 11, 2010.He pointed out that O'Connor served in the Arizona state legislature, giving her a different perspective on legal matters.""I think Solicitor General Kagan will bring a lot of those same views ... to the bench. That is, she has fresh ideas, she's been out in the real world recently,"" Reid said. Indeed, before taking a role in Obama's administration, Kagan was the dean of Harvard Law School, a law professor and an advisor to former President Bill Clinton. Prior to that, she served as a clerk for Judge Abner Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. But Kagan has never been a judge, something her critics are quick to point out. O'Connor, who retired from the court 2005, also had a variety of jobs, serving as Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo County, California, and as an Arizona state senator.But unlike Kagan, O'Connor had been a judge. In 1975, O'Connor was elected a judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court, where she served until 1979, when she was appointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals, according to her biography on the U.S. Supreme Court Web site. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated O'Connor to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court. We asked Reid's spokesman, Jim Manley, if we were missing something, and he wrote that Reid had simply misspoken.So, O'Connor had six years of judicial experience before she was nominated for a seat on the highest court.

Will says Greece's economy is same size as Dallas-Fort Worth's
","During the May 9, 2010 edition of ABC's This Week, commentator George Will sought to add some context to one of the previous week's biggest stories -- the financial troubles in Greece, which prompted a bailout by its European neighbors that drew protests in Athens and shook financial markets across the world.

This Week host Jake Tapper introduced the topic by asking Will, ""Why should the American people care about this?""

Will responded, ""Because it's an early heart attack that ought to alert us to the fact that we could have a bigger heart attack. Greece is not too big to fail -- it has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. It's too connected.""

We wondered whether the Dallas-Fort Worth's gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services produced -- could really be larger than that of an entire European nation.

According to the World Bank, Greece's gross domestic product in 2008 was $355 billion, ranking it 26th in the world.

Meanwhile, statistics calculated for the same year by the U.S. government's Bureau of Economic Analysis determined that the metro area consisting of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington, Texas, had a gross domestic product of $379 billion -- close enough in our view to make Will's statement correct.

Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington actually ranked sixth among highest-GDP metro areas in the United States. Will could have just as easily pointed to five other metro areas that have bigger GDPs than Greece -- the ones based (in ascending order) in Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. New York City's economy, in fact, was about three and a half times the size of Greece's in 2008.

Just to be sure, we also compared statistics for GDP adjusted by ""purchasing power parity"" -- a tweak that eliminates distortions based on the relative value of currencies and the local costs of commodities. The adjusted GDP for Greece is $330 billion, which is smaller than Greece's unadjusted GDP, but only by a modest amount. (The adjusted GDP uses the U.S. as its yardstick for comparison, so its GDP number does not change.)

All in all, we rate Will's comment True.","[('George Will, comments during a roundtable discussion on ABC\'s This Week, May 9, 2010\n\nWorld Bank, ""Gross domestic product 2008"" (table), accessed May 11, 2010\n\nWorld Bank, ""Gross domestic product 2008, PPP"" (table), accessed May 11, 2010\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis, ""News Release: GDP by Metropolitan Area, Accelerated 2008, New 2007, and Revised 2005-2006"" (table attachment), Sept. 24, 2009', 'https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-holder-giuliani/story?id=10596448&page=4')]",/factchecks/2010/may/12/george-will/will-says-greeces-economy-same-size-dallas-fort-wo/

Sen. John Cornyn questions Elena Kagan's absence of judicial experience, but celebrated 2005 nominee's lack of bench time
","U.S. Sen. John Cornyn has qualms about President Barack Obama’s nomination of the nation’s solicitor general, Elena Kagan, for the U.S. Supreme Court — including her lack of bench experience. In a statement issued Monday, Cornyn doesn't say he's against confirming her for the vacancy to be left by Justice John Paul Stevens, who's retiring this summer. But Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calls Kagan “a surprising choice because she lacks judicial experience. Most Americans believe that prior judicial experience is a necessary credential for a Supreme Court justice.” Then again, Cornyn previously came to terms with a nominee without judicial seasoning. In 2005, he championed President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the court, casting the absence of a judgeship on her resume as a woman-of-the-heartland quality. On Monday, he took issue with Kagan's ""rarefied"" background, notable for her ties to Harvard University, where she was a student and later the dean of its law school, and steepage in Washington, where she was a Supreme Court clerk and, later, a White House aide before becoming solicitor general. Has the junior Republican senator from Texas reversed himself on justices needing a background robed in black? Cornyn's comments -- then and now -- give us a chance to test the PolitiFact Texas Flip-O-Meter. First, a look back. In October 2005, Cornyn took the occasion of Miers' nomination to praise the Texas lawyer then serving as a White House adviser. On Oct. 3, Cornyn said: “Some have said that perhaps we don't know very much about her because she hasn't been a judge before, but the fact is more than 40 Supreme Court justices were nominated and confirmed to that position without prior judicial experience,” according to a transcript by the Federal News Service. Cornyn said that day on PBS’s “NewsHour” that 41 of 109 justices served on the court without prior judicial experience — a ratio he rehashed in an opinion article published two days later in the Wall Street Journal. Cornyn wrote: “These (previous non-judges) include several luminaries from the school of judicial restraint, including the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist.” Earlier in the piece, Cornyn said “some have criticized the president because he did not select an Ivy-League-credentialed federal appeals court judge for the open seat. I think this criticism is misplaced. For one thing, there is no evidence that service on the federal court of appeals is a prerequisite for distinguished service on the Supreme Court…” On Oct. 27, at Miers' request, President Bush withdrew her nomination, which was imperiled by opposition from the right and from the left. On Monday afternoon, Salon.com posted an item quoting from Cornyn’s press conference that day when he was asked if Miers’ nomination showed it’d be almost impossible for someone to serve on the court if they hadn't been a judge. The Dallas Morning News also noted the contrast between Cornyn now and Cornyn then. According to the Political Transcript Wire, Cornyn said he hoped not, adding that he'd thought Miers’ qualifications, which were rooted in decades as a Dallas lawyer, “would fill some very important gaps in the Supreme Court. Because right now you have people who've been federal judges, circuit judges most of their lives, or academicians. And what you see is a lack of grounding in reality and common sense that I think would be very beneficial.” And what of his comments now about Kagan? After issuing his statement noting Kagan's lack of judicial experience, Cornyn told Texas reporters Monday: ""We really don't know anything about how Ms. Kagan would perform as a judge if she was confirmed because she has no record."" Cornyn also aired several concerns about Kagan including her decision as dean of the Harvard law school not to allow military recruiters on campus. In a Tuesday interview with MSNBC, Cornyn stressed what he said is Kagan's lack of practical legal experience. Asked if he thought Miers was more qualified than Kagan, Cornyn replied: ""Certainly, by virtue of her practical legal experience, Ms. Miers had more experience."" He noted that neither one was previously a judge. He then said: ""I don't think that should be a disqualifier."" His spokesman, Kevin McLaughlin, separately suggested there's no inconsistency in Cornyn's statements about judicial experience. We disagree. Cornyn wholeheartedly praised Miers' lack of judicial experience in 2005. Now he sees such a gap as one of Kagan's weaknesses, though not (as of Tuesday) reason alone to deny her confirmation. That's at least a Half Flip.","[('U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, “Sen.

Lieberman says president can approve killing a U.S. citizen who affiliates with terrorists
","On May 6, 2010, Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., joined three fellow lawmakers -- two Republicans and one Democrat -- to propose the Terrorist Expatriation Act, which would allow the United States to revoke the citizenship of an American citizen who affiliates with an officially designated foreign terrorist organization.In comments at a news conference -- later aired on the May 9, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week -- Lieberman cited a paradox to make the case for the bill. He cited news reports that President Barack Obama had authorized the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born extremist Muslim cleric who is believed to be hiding in Yemen. U.S. intelligence sources have reportedly linked al-Awlaki to an al-Qaida affiliate and say he has recruited new terrorists.The paradox, Lieberman said, is that while it is legal for the U.S. to kill al-Awlaki, it is is not legal for the U.S. to impose a more limited sanction -- the removal of citizenship.""As many of you know, it has been reported that President Obama has signed an order authorizing the assassination of al-Awlaki,"" Lieberman said. ""That has not been confirmed, but no one argues that a president doesn't have the right to issue such an order. If the president can authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen who fights for a foreign terrorist organization -- in this case al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- we can also have a law that allows the U.S. government to revoke al-Awlaki's citizenship.""We won't delve into the question of whether passing Lieberman's bill is a good idea, since that's in the realm of opinion, but we did think it worthwhile to examine the factual premise of Lieberman's claim -- that the president can ""authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen who fights for a foreign terrorist organization.""We'll address the question on two levels. First, does the administration believe it has this power? And second, is the administration's legal justification for such targeting solid and widely recognized?The first question is relatively straightforward. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair has testified to Congress that if intelligence officials believe there's a need to kill an American citizen operating with a terrorist organization, a process exists to authorize such an action.""We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community,"" Blair told the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 3, 2010. ""If ... we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that.""Under questioning from the panel's ranking Republican, Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, Blair declined to discuss details about the process of approving the targeting of an American citizen. ""Primarily it has to do with ... whether that American is involved in a group that is trying to attack us, whether that American is a threat to other Americans,"" Blair told the committee. News reports, citing unnamed administration officials, have offered conflicting details about what steps are taken during the approval process. (On This Week, Attorney General Eric Holder said, ""Well, I'm not going to assume that what has been said there about ordering anybody's assassination is necessarily true."") Also unconfirmed, but widely suspected, is the specific targeting of al-Awlaki under these rules. On April 6, 2010, the New York Times, citing ""intelligence and counterterrorism officials,"" reported that he had been, but no administration official has publicly confirmed that.Still, despite uncertainty about the details, Blair's comments have widely been understood as confirmation that the Obama administration stands ready to kill terrorist-affiliated U.S. citizens overseas.The answer to the second question -- whether the White House's position is legally supportable -- is more in dispute.On the one hand, legal experts told us it's permissible to kill someone engaged in battle against the United States, even if that person is an American citizen. Such killings have occurred in contexts as varied as the Civil War and the Cold War, based on powers vested in Article II of the Constitution (which makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces) and upheld by the 1866 Supreme Court decision Ex Parte Milligan (which confirms that ""command of the forces and the conduct of campaigns"" rests with the president).International law does pose some limits; the 1907 Hague Convention, for instance, prohibits combat tactics that cause ""unnecessary suffering."" And in the 1970s, President Gerald Ford issued an executive order banning the CIA from any involvement in assassinations. But targeted killings of the kind Lieberman is referring to are considered exempt from that executive order, and after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush signed what's known as an ""intelligence finding"" that enabled the CIA to pursue terrorists around the world.Congress gave its consent as well. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress passed an ""Authorization to Use Military Force,"" a measure short of a formal declaration of war but carrying essentially the same authority. In it, Congress explicitly gave the president the power to ""use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons."" Meanwhile, in 2006, Bush reportedly expanded the 2001 ""finding"" beyond al-Qaida and Afghanistan.Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said that ""since terrorists qualify as combatants, the president can use deadly force, if necessary, to stop a terrorist. The ability to use force against such combatant is not affected by his or her citizenship. In World War II, if an American citizen chose to fight for Germany or Japan, he or she would still have been a legitimate target as an enemy combatant.""At the same time, however, the post-Sept. 11 world has added some complications.One is that it's often not easy to determine whether an individual has taken up the fight against the United States, since there is no regularized, uniformed army to join.It's hard to determine ""whether we are really in a war with al-Qaida in the legal sense,"" said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. ""Our government assumes so, but not all countries buy that argument, because it's neither a war between states nor a typical civil war.""Another problem is one of geography. In past wars, the battle lines were fairly straightforward. But when facing terrorist attacks, virtually anyplace can become a battlefield.""It's pretty clear that if you have an American citizen on a traditional battlefield shooting Howitzers at American forces, you can take the guy out,"" said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor. ""On the other hand, you have the 1957 Supreme Court decision Reid vs. Covert, which ruled that American citizens take their constitutional rights wherever they go. So in the case of someone like al-Awlaki, do you consider Pakistan to be part of the battlefield? If you do, it looks like a pretty comfortable call. If you don't, you could object that you're depriving a citizen of their life without due process.""Some scholars argue that the kinds of attacks discussed by Lieberman are clearly illegal because of their location away from a battlefield.""The fighting or hostilities of an armed conflict occurs within limited zones, referred to as combat or conflict zones,"" University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O’Connell said during congressional testimony in April. ""It is only in such zones that killing enemy combatants or those taking a direct part in hostilities is permissible. Because armed conflict requires a certain intensity of fighting, the isolated terrorist attack, regardless of how serious the consequences, is not an armed conflict.""Others express a more nuanced view. In the same hearing as the one where O'Connell testified, William C. Banks, a Syracuse University law professor, told lawmakers that while the current legal framework is imperfect and merits updating to keep up with the changing nature of terrorism-related combat, it does provide justification for the sorts of killings Lieberman is referring to.""The president’s intelligence finding does not make any exception for Americans,"" Banks testified, adding that ""the defensive use of force — targeted at a known al-Qaida leader, for example — also has firm legal roots in customary international law.""To recap, the Obama administration has not only claimed the authority to target and kill U.S. citizens linked to terrorist groups but may in fact be using that power already to target al-Awlaki. Many of our experts see ample justification for such actions in both domestic and international law, and both for political reasons and practical legal reasons (including finding someone with standing to file a court challenge) the president is unlikely to be curbed by the courts anytime soon. Still, even those who see strong arguments for this presidential prerogative acknowledge that a number of legal uncertainties could limit or undermine those powers in the future if court challenges were to be raised. So Lieberman is probably overstating his case when he says that ""no one argues that a president doesn't have the right to issue such an order,"" but we still find his statement Mostly True.","[('Joe Lieberman, remarks on introducing the Terrorist Expatriation Act, May 6, 2010Transcript of ABC\'s This Week, May 9, 2010Transcript of a House Intelligence Committee hearing, Feb. 3, 2010 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)New York Times, ""U.S. Approves Targeted Killing of American Cleric,"" April 6, 2010\xa0Newsweek, ""A License to Kill Our Own?""

Countdown host says Founding Father reached out to Muslims
","On Countdown With Keith Olbermann, Monday, April 19, 2010, Olbermann took on former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin for complaining about President Barack Obama's outreach to Muslims. And he did it by citing the Founding Fathers. He noted a remark from Palin to a Women of Joy conference in Louisville, Ky.: ""Hearing any leader declare that America isn't a Christian nation . . . It's mind-boggling to see some of our nation's actions recently."" Olbermann said that wouldn't be mind-boggling to the founders.

""President John Adams, of course, signed the Treaty of Tripoli, his outreach to Muslims,"" Olbermann said. ""Quote, 'The government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.' That was ratified by the United States Senate without debate unanimously in 1797.""

We wondered if Olbermann was correct to characterize the treaty as an outreach to Muslims. We found that while that was a small element of the treaty, he ignored the overriding purpose of the treaty: to protect American ships from pirates.

A little history: When the American colonies were under British rule, the Royal Navy protected American commercial shipping in the Mediterranean Sea from privateers financed by the North African Muslim states on the Barbary Coast who were terrorizing commercial shipping in the region. During the Revolutionary War, an alliance with France allowed for continued protection.

Once America gained its independence from Britain, though, it was on its own against the dreaded Barbary pirates from Morocco, Tunis, Algiers and Tripoli.

In 1785, two years after the signing of the Articles of Confederation, two American ships were captured and held for ransom. Over the years, the situation worsened, with more American ships being captured and sailors being sold into slavery. Eventually, the United States began negotiating treaties with the Barbary States. ""The treaty with Tripoli, and those with the other Barbary Powers, were for the purpose of making the Mediterranean safe for American ships,"" Ian W. Toll, author of the book Six Frigates, told PolitiFact. Still, Olbermann is right that there was a mention of the Muslim religion in the treaty. Here's the full text of Article 11: ""As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen [Muslims], -- and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan [Muslim] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.""

Alana Russo, a spokeswoman for Olbermann, cited that passage to explain the talk show host's claim. ""This was indisputably outreach not just to Tripoli, but a declaration of intentions regarding ""any Mahometan [Muslim] nation,"" she said in an e-mail interview. But others say that language indicates the United States of America was merely neutral on religion in a treaty that was all about protecting U.S. ships.

Article 11 ""makes clear that this was a commercial treaty and that religion played no part,"" said Frank Lambert, author of The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America, a book that argues the Founding Fathers were more concerned with religious freedom than any one religion being the best. ""I don't know what Olbermann meant by 'outreach to Muslims,' but Adams signed the treaty to secure American commercial rights in the Mediterranean.""

So why did the Founders include Article 11 in the first place?

""The Barbary Powers often declared that they were 'at war with all Christian nations' unless and until a treaty was signed,"" said Toll. ""In diplomatic communications and in some cases in the treaties themselves, the Americans would say they had nothing against Muslims, or even (in one celebrated and controversial instance) that the U.S.A. was not a Christian nation, and I have no reason to say that those sentiments were not genuine. But to the extent that Adams or the other early presidents reached out to Muslims, it was always for the same reason -- to obtain agreements shielding American ships from attacks in the Mediterranean.""

By characterizing the treaty as an ""outreach to Muslims"", Olbermann exaggerates the importance of Article 11 and implies that the central focus of the treaty was to engage with Muslims. In fact, President John Adams wanted to secure commercial shipping rights, and the countries he wanted to negotiate with happened to be Muslim, and happened to justify piracy by declaring war on Christian nations. Adams addressed that declaration by claiming that the United States was not Christian, and was not at war with Muslims. There is some truth in Olbermann's claim in that the clause essentially ""reaches out"" to Muslims, but he exaggerates its importance. So we find his claim Half True.","[('Keith Olbermann, ""Countdown with Keith Olbermann"", MSNBC, Apr. 19, 2010.\n\nNathan Miller, The U.S. Navy: A History, U.S. Naval Insitute Press, 3rd ed., 1997.\n\nYale Law School, ""The Barbary Treaties 1786-1816"", The Avalon Project.\n\nE-mail interview with Ian W.

Florida Dems say Bill McCollum out of touch on subprime mortgage crisis
","Florida Democrats say Attorney General Bill McCollum's recent South Florida Mortgage Fraud Community Forum was little more than a political stunt crafted to help the Republican running for governor.The truth, they say, is that for years McCollum has been negligent when it comes to dealing with the state's mortgage and foreclosure crisis.""Although Bill McCollum holds a 'mortgage fraud forum' in Miami today (May 8), his election-year attention to the foreclosure and mortgage fraud crisis is too little, too late for millions of Florida homeowners,"" Democratic Party spokesman Eric Jotkoff said in a May 8, 2010 news release. ""Florida's families have been dealing with the fallout of misleading loans and irresponsible lenders for years, while Attorney General McCollum has not paid attention to the issue. ""Just two years ago McCollum admitted he didn't think that the subprime mortgage crisis was a big deal, telling reporters he thought that the subprime collapse had been exaggerated by the media and investors and that 'it's not the end of the world'.""The forum, which was co-hosted with the Florida InterAgency Mortgage Fraud Task Force, a group McCollum established in 2009, was held to help homeowners prevent mortgage fraud and avoid or deal with a foreclosure. McCollum said that ""helping Floridians suffering from this severe foreclosure crisis is a top priority,"" in a posting on Twitter after the event. Florida has ranked first in the nation in mortgage fraud every year since 2006. For this item, we wanted to check the Democratic Party's claim that McCollum said he didn't think the subprime mortgage crisis was a big deal, that it had been exaggerated by the media and said that ""it's not the end of the world."" A subprime mortgage is a home loan granted to people with poor credit histories or other financial issues that prevent them from qualifying for a conventional mortgage. A subprime mortgage has higher interest rates and represents a bigger risk to lenders. But lenders were liberal in issuing the loans from 2004-2006, largely due to lower interest rates and a booming housing market. When the housing market started to decline along with the economy in 2007, the rate of subprime foreclosures skyrocketed, shaking the entire American financial system. Florida Democrats say McCollum was late to realize the severity of the problem, claiming that he sat in a Nov. 15, 2007, meeting of the Florida Cabinet and declared the crisis mostly a media creation. At that meeting, Cabinet members heard a report that the state investment pool had taken a $2.28 billion hit as a result of the subprime crisis. State Democrats pointed to an account of the meeting published in the Fort Myers News-Press to back up their claim.The last two lines of the News-Press story include the only mention of McCollum: ""Attorney General Bill McCollum thinks the subprime collapse has been exaggerated by the media and investors,"" the News-Press article said, and then quoted McCollum as saying ""it's not the end of the world."" We couldn't find the quote in any other story. But the state does keep typed transcripts of Cabinet meetings online.We went to the transcript from the Nov. 15 Cabinet meeting to see the context of McCollum's statement.Coleman Stipanovich, the then executive director of the State Board of Administratrion, which oversees the state's investments, ended the Cabinet meeting with a discussion of risk exposures to the state's investment portfolio. He provided the Cabinet with a report, based on a request from Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, identifying risks and the state's monitoring activities due to the collapse of the subprime residential market.As the News-Press reported, Stipanovich said the state's investment pool -- which was then about $188 billion -- had lost about $2.28 billion as a result of the subprime crisis through something called ""write-downs."" A write-down is when someone reduces the paper value of an asset because it is overvalued when compared to the market value.When he got a chance to speak, McCollum asked Stipanovich to explain the write-downs, which McCollum called downgrades, saying he believed that they were not so much losses as a reflection that the state would be earning less. From the transcript (starting on page 93): McCOLLUM: ""What's the meaning of a downgrade in practical terms? If a paper is downgraded, does that mean that we're going to earn less on it? It doesn't mean it's worthless.""STIPANOVICH: ""No, it's certainly not worthless, but you do have the potential -- and this is why we're trying to work through these issues. You do have the potential of earning less on it. We're optimistic that that's not the case. We have dug down into these holdings and looked at the collateral, and the collateral looks good to us. The collateral, you know, has a very high rating.""McCOLLUM: ""That's my point. I'm just trying to make a point to anybody observing this out there who might not be as sophisticated in the world of finance that this is not the end of the world. You would rather see us have higher ratings than we have on some of the paper that has been downgraded or some of the holdings, but it doesn't mean that we're going to necessarily lose money because of that."" After McCollum's remarks, Stipanovich -- not McCollum -- says the subprime mortgage crisis was being sensationalized by the news media, according to the transcript. ""This has been exaggerated. It has been sensationalized, and you're probably going to see more in print that's, you know, going to be sensational possibly,"" Stipanovich said.Interestingly Sink, a Democrat running for governor, didn't have that different of a take from McCollum when it came to the state investment report. She said that if the state took any losses as a result of the 2007 subprime write-downs, they would be ""de minimis,"" according to the transcript. (De minimis, a Latin word, means of little or no significance, inconsequential.) The transcript differs with the news account in two critical ways.First, McCollum didn't say the subprime mortgage crisis was being sensationalized by the media, that was Stipanovich. McCollum did say however during the meeting that he believed many subprime mortgages were functioning properly.Second, and more important to our analysis, when McCollum said it's ""not the end of the world,"" he was referring to the specific $2.28 billion in write-downs in the state's investment portfolio and not the subprime crisis in general. So Florida Democrats are being incorrect and misleading. They attribute one quote to McCollum that was actually said by Stipanovich. And when they use McCollum's actual words, they quote him out of context. They portray McCollum as a callous state official who belittlies the overall impact of the subprime crisis. But his comment was referring to the impact on the state's investments, not on homeowners. That's a big difference.

Attorney General Abbott says EPA's endangerment finding based on outsourced science from scandal-plagued group
","Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general seeking re-election this year, announced a state challenge in February to a judgment that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide endanger the health of Americans. At a Feb. 16 press conference, Abbott also said the Environmental Protection Agency, which issued the endangerment finding, ""outsourced the scientific basis for its greenhouse gas regulation to a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy."" We saw his statement in a press release issued that day by Gov. Rick Perry, who attended the news conference with Abbott. We wondered if Abbott's salvo, echoed at an April forum by a delegate for Perry's campaign, accurately captured the EPA’s approach. Some background: The EPA’s finding, issued in December, came out after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants covered by the federal Clean Air Act and that the agency must determine whether or not emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare. The EPA said its scientific conclusions were based on work by three groups: the U.S. Global Climate Research Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Research Council, which synthesize thousands of studies, conveying a consensus on what scientific literature shows about climate, according to the agency. ""No other source of information provides such a comprehensive and in-depth analysis across such a large body of scientific studies, adheres to such a high and exacting standard of peer review, and synthesizes the resulting consensus view of a large body of scientific experts across the world,"" the agency said. ""For these reasons, the (EPA) administrator is placing primary and significant weight on these assessment reports in making her decision on endangerment."" The report adds that EPA scientists previously gave ""significant input"" to the groups. The state’s 38-page petition for the EPA to reconsider its finding says that rather than do its own assessment, the agency's ""administrator outsourced the actual scientific study, as well as her required review of the scientific literature necessary to make that assessment."" ""That is, EPA’s conclusion depended on summaries of existing reports that were provided by third parties,"" the petition states, ""rather than on an analysis that was within EPA’s own quality control."" Also, the petition says, the groups that the EPA cites for scientific back-up interweave; two have quoted the third, which is misidentified in Abbott's petition as the United Nations International—it’s actually Intergovernmental—Panel on Climate Change, which we delve into below. First, we tried to ask the EPA about the outsourcing descriptive. Spokeswoman Catherine Milbourn pointed us to an EPA website that calls the science behind greenhouse gas pollution ""settled""; it says too the finding drew upon the works of ""highly respected, peer-reviewed sources"" around the globe plus hundreds of thousands of public comments. So the EPA acknowledges leaning on others' existing research, which it considers tip-top sound. What of the second part of Abbott’s statement--that EPA leaned on a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy? He’s referring to the Geneva-based IPCC, which became the leading international body for the assessment of climate change after its formation more than 20 years ago by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to ""provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences,"" the panel says online. In 2007, the panel shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore, the former vice president with a long interest in global warming. The Norweigan Nobel Committee said the panel created ""an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming."" Its 2007 review of research, cited by the EPA, was its latest look at climate science over all. Another is due in 2014. The Fox News Channel has reported that the panel's ""reputation for accuracy and fairness, to a large degree, was responsible for building a consensus around the world that global warming was both real and a potentially devastating phenomenon largely caused by man."" Of late, however, the panel has drawn fire, mainly from skeptics that the planet is rapidly heating. The latest outcry emerged after e-mails surfaced last year involving scientists including researchers at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, many of whom have participated in IPCC work. The e-mail back story (detailed by PolitiFact here): On Nov. 20, more than 1,000 e-mails and 3,000 documents came to light. Dating as far back as March 1996, they include exchanges between scientists indicating shaky practices, intentions to withhold public information and even, in one instance, a desire to punch a critic. Over all, though, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change found  the e-mails largely routine and innocuous, writing: ""Although a small percentage of the e-mails are impolite and some express animosity toward opponents, when placed into proper context they do not appear to reveal fraud or other scientific misconduct."" In December, PolitiFact rated False a statement by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, saying the hacked e-mails debunked the science behind climate change. At a hearing, Inhofe later asked Lisa Jackson, the EPA’s administrator, about the agency leaning on flawed science from the IPCC. Jackson disagreed the panel was discredited, according to video posted online by C-SPAN. ""It’s important to understand that the IPCC is a body, that it follows impartial and open and objective assessments,"" she said. The state's petition for reconsideration mentions the e-mails, noting that Phil Jones, director of the Anglia-based climate research center, was the lead author of the IPCC's 2007 report's ""Summary for Policy Makers,"" and his research is cited 39 times (in 21 chapters) in the panel's report. The petition says the Anglia center is the primary provider of temperature readings used in the IPCC report. So what? So, the state says, the panel's conclusions are flawed because they rely on data from scientists with an agenda, some of them exposed in the e-mails. ""Dr. Jones and his colleagues were far from objective,"" the petition states. ""To the contrary, there is overwhelming evidence of outcome-oriented conduct that severely undermines the objectivity of their scientific research."" The petition specifies scientists whose impartiality the attorney general questions. To plumb Abbott's point, we reviewed news and opinion articles about the panel and its 2007 report shared by his office. Some highlights: The report misstates the year by which Himalayan glaciers are expected to melt (an error, for which the panel offered a correction this year, that looks like a typo); incorrectly overstates how much of Holland rests below sea level; doesn't support an assertion that global warming could soon cut rain-fed north African crop production in half; and includes a statement about rain forests in South America shrinking for lack of rain that might not be proving out. Broadly, critics including some American scientists have called for the panel to open its next report to doubts about the science and to scientists who point out uncertainties. Separately, an arm of the United Nations agreed in February to review the panel; a report is expected in August. Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme's Governing Council, was quoted in The Telegraph newspaper saying the IPCC faced a crisis of public confidence. Amid the hubbub, there's no sign of nations forsaking the panel. Two leading British and American scientists have been among onlookers to stress that nothing has undermined the panel's 2007 conclusion that human activities are almost certainly contributing to global warming. Robert Watson, environment minister for the British government and a former head of the IPCC, was quoted by The Telegraph saying: ""It is concerning that these mistakes have appeared in the IPCC report, but there is no doubt the earth’s climate is changing and the only way we can explain those changes is primarily human activity."" Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academies of Science and chairman of the National Research Council, wrote in Science magazine that the exposed e-mails ""raised concern about the standards of science and has damaged public trust in what scientists do."" Yet his ""reading of the vast scientific literature on climate change is that our understanding is undiminished by this incident."" Later, Cicerone was quoted telling scientists they need to redouble their efforts to share the implications of climate change with the public. ""A lot of what we need to do,"" he said, ""is translate basic information into terms the public can understand."" At the same meeting, Jerry North, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, was quoted saying there ""has been no change in the scientific community"" in the consensus that global average temperatures have been steadily climbing since the mid-20th century. John Nielson-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist, recently told us he believes about 95 percent of what the panel concludes. ""It’s probably as good as it gets in terms of a comprehensive analysis done by scientists of a comprehensive... far-reaching issue,"" he said. ""If you're going to rely on something external, that’s the document to rely upon."" Where does all this leave Abbott's statement? True, instead of producing on its own research, the EPA instead relied on the work of three other entities. But calling it ""outsourcing"" is highly misleading because it suggests the agency was shirking its duties. It wasn't. In choosing to use the work of those agencies, particularly the IPCC, the EPA was relying on a large international group of scientists that has reached consensus from thousands of studies. That's a far more comprehensive review than anything the EPA could have done. Abbott also overreaches saying the panel is scandal-plagued and can't be considered objective or trustworthy. Yes, the stolen e-mails have raised questions about a small number of scientists, but the e-mails have not undercut the validity of the panel's main findings. Bottom line: There's a small bit of truth in Abbott's claim, the part that the EPA is relying on outsiders. But his statement is misleading because he implies the EPA has shirked its duties when in fact it is relying on three groups that have synthesized thousands of scientific studies -- almost certainly far more work than the EPA could ever do itself. And yes, the e-mails have raised questions about the work of a clutch of scientists, but they have not put a significant dent in conclusions reached by the IPCC. We rate Abbott's statement Barely True.","[('Greg Abbott, attorney general of Texas, ""Petition for Reconsideration of Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,"" submitted Feb. 16, 2010; Links to news and opinion articles re. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, May 5, 2010', 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/02162010_abbottpetitionepa.pdf'), ('American Association for the Advancement of Science, press release, ""Science Community Stands Behind Evidence for Climate Change, Top Scientists Say at AAAS"" Feb. 19, 2010 (accessed May 6, 2010)', 'No link'), ('The Associated Press, news article, ""Texas challenging EPA\'s greenhouse gas finding,"" Feb. 16, 2010 (Nexis search)', 'http://news.aaas.org/2010/0219post-9.shtml'), ('Austin American-Statesman, news article, ""Texas sues to stop EPA from regulating greenhouse gases,"" Feb. 16, 2010 (accessed April 29, 2010)', 'No link'), ('Ralph Cicerone, president, U.S. National Academy of Sciences, editorial, Science magazine, Feb. 5, 2010 (summary) (accessed May 6, 2010)', 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/02162010_apnewsarticle.doc'), ('C-SPAN, testimony of Lisa Jackson, administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, to U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, response to Sen.

Republicans say Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan is a product of Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway
","
Shortly after President Barack Obama nominated Solicitor General Elena Kagan to replace Justice John Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court, a number of Republicans lined up to raise questions about her qualifications. Among the most common themes from Republicans was that Kagan has the resume of a legal elitist, tied primarily to academia and inside-the-Capital-Beltway jobs. 
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, the junior senator from Texas, urged the Senate to thoroughly review Kagan's record — and aired his trepidations about it. 
""There is no doubt that Ms. Kagan possesses a first-rate intellect, but she is a surprising choice from a president who has emphasized the importance of understanding 'how the world works and how ordinary people live,' "" Cornyn said in a May 10, 2010, press release. ""Ms. Kagan has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway. These are not places where one learns 'how ordinary people live.' "" 
For the record, Harvard Square refers to Kagan's work at Harvard Law School and Hyde Park is the neighborhood occupied by the University of Chicago, where Kagan once taught. We should note that Obama himself attended law school at Harvard, and his private home is in Chicago's Hyde Park. And his current employment is about as inside the D.C. Beltway as one can get. 
Putting aside the political argument that working in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway is not a good way to learn how ordinary people live, we decided to check Kagan's resume to find out if Cornyn is correct that the entirety of Kagan's career was spent in these three places. 
A judiciary committee questionnaire Kagan filled out after Obama nominated her for the solicitor general position in 2009 provides an accounting of her professional career. 
Working our way back from the present, here's Kagan's employment history (and, in parentheses, where they fit into Cornyn's definition):  
March 2009-present: U.S. solicitor general (D.C. Beltway) 
1999 -2009: professor and dean, Harvard Law School; 2003-2009 as dean; 2001-2009 as professor focusing on constitutional and administrative law; and 1999-2001 as visiting professor (Harvard Square) 
1997-1999: deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton for domestic policy (D.C. Beltway) 
1995-1996: associate counsel to President Clinton (D.C. Beltway) 
1991-1994: assistant professor at University of Chicago Law School, primarily teaching constitutional law (Hyde Park) 
Summer 1993: special counsel, Senate Judiciary Committee, working on the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court (D.C. Beltway) 
1989-1991: associate at Williams & Connolly in Washington, D.C., doing mix of commercial, First Amendment and white-collar criminal law (D.C. Beltway) 
1988: staff member, Dukakis for President campaign, Boston, mostly preparing responses to attacks on Gov. Dukakis' record. 
1987-1988: judicial clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall (D.C. Beltway) 
1986-1987: judicial clerk for Judge Abner Mikva, U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. (D.C. Beltway) 
Summer 1986: research assistant for Professor Laurence Tribe at Harvard Law School (Harvard Square) 
Summer 1985: summer associate for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York City 
Summer 1984: summer associate at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson in New York City 
Summer 1983: paralegal at Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy in New York City 
Some may quibble that when Kagan worked as a staff member on the Dukakis campaign in 1988, the campaign headquarters was in Boston, not nearby Harvard Square (though one could argue that working on a presidential campaign is by definition D.C. Beltway-related) or that she worked for three summers during graduate school at New York City law firms. 
And White House officials argue Kagan's roots as the granddaughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants, the daughter of a public school teacher and a tenant lawyer, and her career as an accomplished lawyer and well-regarded teacher solidify her ""ordinary people"" cred. Asked about this issue, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs cited Kagan's ""diversity of experience"" and noted that as solicitor general, Kagan ""represents the American people before the Supreme Court."" 
But it's fair to say that Kagan has spent the bulk of her professional career in academia at the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School, and at various positions inside the Beltway. Again, whether that puts Kagan out of touch with ""how ordinary people live,"" is a political discussion. But Cornyn's claim that Kagan ""has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway"" is True.","[('\nSen. John Cornyn website, News release: Sen.

Supreme Court rejected arguments Kagan promoted
","One of Elena Kagan's top credentials -- that she was dean of Harvard Law School -- created some controversy on the day that President Barack Obama announced her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. As dean, Kagan took a lead role in trying to keep military recruiters off campus because of the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. Several Republicans pointed to that episode in their initial comments on Kagan, calling the incident troubling. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., also pointed out that the incident put her on the losing side of a Supreme Court ruling.At Harvard Law School, Barrasso said, ""She took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" Barrasso said he was keeping an open mind on the nomination. We were interested in fact-checking his statement that the Supreme Court ""ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" The controversy over military recruiters began even before Kagan became dean of Harvard Law in 2003. Harvard was one of several top-tier law schools that attempted to ban military recruiters because of the policy that prevented gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. In 2003, Kagan penned a letter to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue: ""I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. The importance of the military to our society -- and the extraordinary service that members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- makes this discrimination more, not less, repugnant. The military's policy deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible. This is a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order. And it is a wrong that tears at the fabric of our own community, because some of our members cannot, while others can, devote their professional careers to their country.""Congress threatened to yank federal funding for schools that banned recruiters through a measure known as the Solomon Amendment, named for Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and first passed in 1996. Schools and recruiters tried to sort out their differences in the intervening years, with some schools providing partial access. But eventually the issue came before the Supreme Court in 2004 in a case known as Rumsfeld vs. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, known as FAIR. FAIR was an association of law schools that opposed the Solomon Amendment.In her role as a professor of law at Havard, Kagan signed onto an amicus brief (sometimes known as a ""friend of the court"" brief) filed by 40 Harvard professors that argued that the federal government should not be able to withhold funding if the schools applied the same policies to all recruiters. Harvard, for example, required all recruiters to sign forms indicating they would not discriminate against applicants based on sexual orientation. The withholding of funds interfered with the schools' freedom of expression to oppose what they felt were discriminatory policies.The Harvard law professors argued in their brief that ""this case is not -- and has never been -- about whether law schools may 'discriminate' against the military or whether they must provide 'equal access' to military recruiters. Instead, the question is whether the Solomon Amendment confers upon military recruiters the unprecedented entitlement to disregard neutral and generally applicable recruiting rules whenever a school's failure to make a special exception might incidentally hinger or preclude military recruiting. The answer is 'no.'""The Supreme Court, however, disagreed in an 8-0 ruling on March 6, 2006. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled against FAIR and, in doing so, rejected the claims of Kagan and the other law professors that the school had the right to enforce non-discrimination policies against the military. ""Under the statute, military recruiters must be given the same access as recruiters who comply with the policy,"" the opinion said.The court also rejected arguments that claimed that the law schools' treatment of military recruiters could be considered expression under the First Amendment. If the action itself were purely expressive, the court reasoned, the schools would not have to issue statements explaining their actions. The court compared the situation to someone who says he won't pay his income taxes because he disapproves of the Internal Revenue Service. The disapproval is protected speech, but the non-payment of taxes is not.The opinion was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer joining Roberts. Justice Samuel Alito did not participate because he had not yet been seated to the court when oral arguments were made. Barrasso said Kagan ""took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong."" The court did reject the arguments put forward by the law schools, which included FAIR and the brief filed by the Harvard professors. All of the justices who voted opposed the law schools' arguments. So we rate Barrasso's statement True.","[('Fox News, Barrasso ready to question Kagan, May 10, 2010', 'https://video.foxnews.com/v/4186199/barasso-ready-to-question-kagan'), ('FindLaw, Rumsfeld v.

Giuliani says U.S. only questioned underwear bomber for 30 minutes before reading Miranda rights
","The government's questioning of two accused terrorists -- Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who is accused of trying to bomb an airliner on Christmas Day 2009 using explosives sewn into his underwear, and Faisal Shahzad, who is being held for the failed Times Square bombing on May 1, 2010 -- has prompted critics to say the Obama administration is too soft on the terrorists and overly concerned with their Miranda rights.  On the ABC News program This Week, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined many of his fellow Republicans in questioning the wisdom of reading the Miranda warning to suspected terrorists. Those warnings, which stem from the 1966 Supreme Court decision Miranda vs. Arizona, inform suspects in police custody that they have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Supporters say that the warnings protect suspects from being coerced to incriminate themselves. But critics have argued that such warnings can prompt an accused terrorist to stop divulging information. In an interview with This Week host Jake Tapper, Giuliani -- a federal prosecutor in the 1980s and who served as mayor during and immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- described himself as someone who has ""administered Miranda warnings probably 1,000 times."" He argued that ""it doesn't make sense to interrupt a terrorist in the middle of his confessing and talking to you."" As an example of the risks, Giuliani cited the case of Abdulmutallab, the Christmas Day bombing suspect. ""Giving him a warning after -- after 30 minutes makes no sense,"" Giuliani said. ""It makes no sense to do that. So, sure, it may work sometimes; it may not work other times. It's not the best policy to follow. And so far, two in a row, we've gotten lucky. So let's not rely on luck. Let's rely on solid policy."" At that point, Tapper interjected. ""My understanding, during the Abdulmutallab incident, is that -- is that actually after about 50 minutes they had to take him to get medical care, and that's why he stopped talking then, because he actually -- his life was in danger. But be that as it may, I hear the point you're making."" It's worth noting that earlier in the conversation, Giuliani offered a similar, but slightly different characterization of Abdulmutallab's questioning, saying, ""to cut it off after 30 or 40 minutes like they did in Detroit on Christmas Day ... doesn't make much sense."" We e-mailed Giuliani's office but did not get a reply.  We'll steer clear of the question of whether it's smart to offer Miranda warnings to terrorist suspects, because that's an opinion. But because Tapper raised a question of whether Giuliani was correct, we thought it would be worthwhile to sort out whether the former mayor's account is accurate. Right off the bat, we should acknowledge that we are hamstrung somewhat in evaluating this case independently, because the only information on Abdulmutallab's interrogation comes from the Obama administration, which is not a neutral party -- it is playing defense against Republican critics. Also, the administration's accounts of the episode came from federal officials who were not named in media accounts, although Attorney General Eric Holder did not dispute them when he testified before a House subcommittee and Republican senators have referred to the administration's timetable in a bill. That said, the administration's description of the interrogation of Abdulmutallab has been consistent on two key points: that it lasted for about 50 minutes, and that it was interrupted for medical reasons. (While the bomb in his underwear did not explode, it did catch fire, and he experienced serious burns to his groin and legs.)  There is broad agreement that Abdulmutallab's pre-Miranda questioning was allowable under what is known as the ""public safety exception."" The exception was outlined in the 1984 Supreme Court decision in New York vs. Quarles. The court ruled that law enforcement officers may ""ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety"" before they administer a Miranda warning to a suspect in custody. The media accounts have been largely consistent. Here's one timeline assembled by the Washington Post from information ""provided by administration officials, interviews and past briefings for the media"": • ""12:03 p.m.: The plane lands, and U.S. customs agents come aboard and arrest Abdulmutallab. After holding him in a special room, officials decide at 12:45 to take Abdulmutallab to the University of Michigan hospital for emergency treatment of his second- and third-degree burns. While the suspect's burns are being treated, the FBI's Detroit special agent in charge picks two agents to carry out the initial questioning of Abdulmutallab. One of the two is a veteran counterintelligence agent with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan; the other is a specialist in bomb material. • ""2 p.m.: FBI agents arrive at the hospital and discuss Abdulmutallab's physical and mental state with doctors treating him. • ""3:30 p.m.: Agents begin interrogating Abdulmutallab under rules that permit questioning about immediate threats to U.S. security without the reading of Miranda rights. The questions concern whether other bombs were on the plane, whether Abdulmutallab had co-conspirators and whether there were plans for other attacks. 'It's to take advantage of the shock of arrest,' said one law enforcement official. The interrogation produced some useful intelligence, according to this and other officials. After 50 minutes FBI agents end the questioning 'when doctors need to take him in for additional treatment because his medical condition has deteriorated,' according to the chronology."" Holder, in testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee on March 16, confirmed the 50-minute interrogation while responding to criticism from lawmakers. He said, ""That's a fairly long period of time. Certainly, not as long as what has happened subsequent to -- subsequent to that. But if you look at the report of interview that was gotten from him in that 50 minutes, hour, there was a pretty substantial amount of information that was got from him ... that proved to be actionable, that proved to be timely, and that continues to be, at least in some ways, the basis for a lot of the cooperation that he ... has shared with us."" In addition, a Senate resolution sponsored by seven Republicans relies on the same timetable, saying that ""local agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interrogated Abdulmutallab for 50 minutes, during which time Abdulmutallab disclosed information concerning his training in Yemen and the operation of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula"" and that ""after 50 minutes, the FBI stopped its interrogation of Abdulmutallab, agreeing to continue the interrogation after he received medical attention for the burns on his legs and groin caused by the failed bomb he had sewn in his underwear."" What is less certain -- and relevant to Giuliani's larger point -- is whether federal officials read Abdulmutallab the Miranda warning before it was clear that he would stop cooperating, or whether they Mirandized him only because he already had ceased to cooperate. The Senate Republican resolution agrees with Giuliani that the FBI acted first to read Abdulmutallab his rights, ""at which point Abdulmutallab stopped divulging information and remained silent."" A Jan. 24, 2010, Associated Press report, based on ""a series of interviews"" with federal officials, said that as Abdulmutallab was undergoing surgery, FBI headquarters dispatched a ""clean team"" to the hospital -- a new team of interrogators who would start the questioning anew, untainted by any pre-Miranda contact with the suspect. This is essentially a prosecutorial hedge against a subsequent adverse ruling by a judge to exclude information gathered without a proper Miranda warning. Information gathered by this ""clean team"" would likely be admissible in court even if the fruits of the first interrogation were thrown out.  The AP reported that ultimately, ""the 'clean team' of interrogators did not pry more revelations from the suspect. Having rested and received more extensive medical treatment, Abdulmutallab was told of his right to remain silent and right to have an attorney. He remained silent."" This suggests that Abdulmutallab was Mirandized first, then stopped talking. In addition, having the clean team come to interrogate Abdulmutallab without Mirandizing him would defeat the purpose of the clean team -- which is to have an interrogation without any lingering threat of Miranda problems. On the other hand, a subsequent account -- the Post's, published on Feb. 15 -- said that ""Abdulmutallab 'had begun to wind down' and 'gave indications he was going to stop talking'"" even before going into his four-hour surgery, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to the Post anonymously. When the clean team arrived, according to the Post, he ""refused to answer their questions and ""acted like a jihadi."" It was then that he was read his Miranda rights. To recap: There is some truth to Giuliani's claim. He is right that after the initial questioning, federal authorities stopped interrogating Abdulmutallab and then, ultimately, read him his Miranda rights. But Giuliani implied that authorities stopped the questioning in order to Mirandize him. Congressional hearings and news accounts indicate that the questioning went longer than Giuliani claimed -- 50 minutes rather than 30 -- and that it was interrupted because he needed medical treatment. After the treatment, he was read his rights, although the precise sequence of events isn't clear. We find Giuliani's claim Half True.","[('Rudy Giuliani, interview on ABC\'s This Week, May 9, 2010\xa0Associated Press, ""AP Exclusive: Feds detail Christmas Day attack,"" Jan. 24, 2010\xa0The Washington Post, ""Bomb suspect was read Miranda rights nine hours after arrest; White House timeline counters GOP charges of early advisory,"" Feb. 15, 2010\xa0The New Yorker, ""The Trial: Eric Holder and the Battle over Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,"" Feb. 15, 2010\xa0NPR\'s Fresh Air, interview with New Yorker journalist Jane Mayer, Feb. 9, 2010\xa0U.S. Supreme Court, decision in New York v.

Sheriffs say Perry included them in developing the spillover violence contingency plan
","
Gov. Rick Perry has expressed reservations about Arizona's hard-line immigration law which requires legal immigrants to carry documents identifying their legal status and which critics say encourages unconstitutional racial profiling. 
Boyd Richie, chair of the Texas Democratic Party, also disagrees with the Arizona law, though Richie doesn't think much of Perry. ""For 10 years as governor, Rick Perry has played politics when leadership was needed on border and immigration issues,"" Richie said in a press release issued April 30, ""from wasteful border cameras that cost $153,800 per arrest to his failure to involve border sheriffs in developing plans to prevent violence in their communities."" 
We're not gauging if the video cameras lining the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border are wasteful; that's an opinion. Besides, toss in 24 additional reported arrests attributed in some way to the cameras since The Texas Tribune developed the per-arrest estimate and the so-called cost per arrest becomes $80,000 — an average that stands to decrease as arrests mount. 
We're focusing on whether Perry has failed to involve sheriffs in border security plans — especially the ""spillover violence contingency plan"" developed last year. Perry's office earlier spearheaded two other law enforcement initatives on the border, Operation Linebacker in 2006 and Operation Border Star in 2007. 
On behalf of Richie's claim, Democratic spokeswoman Daniela Santoni sent us a March 17 letter to Perry from Elfrain Valdez, mayor of Del Rio and chairman of the Texas Border Coalition, which advocates for security on the Texas-Mexico border. Valdez airs frustration that Perry hadn't consulted coalition members before activating the first phase of the state's spillover violence plan March 16. That move upped law enforcement, sent two helicopters to the border and put Ranger Reconnaissance and SWAT teams on standby. The day before, gunmen had killed two Americans in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, across the border from El Paso. 
Valdez writes: ""Along with my elected colleagues on the border, I have watched with interest the announcement that you are activating the first phase of your Spillover Violence Contingency Plan. We live on the border and have responsibility for our communities and our citizens. However, at this point we are learning about your plans along with everyone else."" 
Santoni also forwarded several news stories, two covering the coalition's discontent and echoing border leaders' concerns that violence hasn't spilled from Mexico into Texas. The third, a March 22 article in The Tribune, says Perry didn't alert Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino and others before activating the spillover violence plan — with El Paso being the only city alerted before the activation. 
Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger disputed the report, telling us the spillover violence plan ""was developed in early 2009 with input from our local and federal law enforcement partners to prepare for the possibility of violence spilling over into the United States."" 
Separately, Don Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, said Perry may have ""failed to include the mayors, but he certainly didn't fail to include law enforcement agencies."" Sheriffs of the 18 border counties formed the group in 2005 to lobby for funding for border security. 
We didn't attempt to reach every border sheriff, but law officers in Hudspeth County, east of El Paso, Terrell County, adjacent to Big Bend National Park, and Hidalgo County, more toward the east end of the border, said the governor's office has kept them well informed, partly through e-mails sent from their respective Joint Operational and Intelligence Centers — there are five, in El Paso, Laredo, Del Rio, Victoria and Rio Grande Valley. 
Hidalgo County Sheriff Trevino, whose community is adjacent to frequent gun battles in Reynosa, Mexico, said information flow from Perry's office could have been better when the spillover plan was implemented in March, but generally communication ""between the state and the local and the federal agencies, at least in my area, is excellent. We receive daily briefings, we are on top of everything, we have great coordination, we have very frequent meetings where we discuss trends."" 
When we told Richie's camp that at least some sheriffs disagree with Richie's statement, Santoni stood by the party's original cache of news articles. She added: ""We consider the activation of a plan a central component of the development of a plan."" 
All told, where does that leave Richie's statement that Perry failed to involve border sheriffs in developing plans to prevent violence in their communities? 
Lacking, only partly because most of Richie's evidence stems from border mayors who said Perry didn't notify them before activating the state's spillover security plan. Besides, Richie was absolute in his wording, suggesting that Perry didn't involve border sheriffs at all. 
Not so, we're persuaded. According to what we heard, the governor has worked with border sheriffs on security plans. 
We rate Richie's statement as False.","[('\nTexas Democratic Party, Press release: Richie: Arizona law threatens basic American rights, Rich Perry tries to have it both ways, April 30, 2010', 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/04302010_richie_email.pdf'), ('\nThe Texas Tribune, $153,800 per arrest, April 20, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nThe Texas Tribune, Spillover politics, March 22, 2010', 'https://www.texastribune.org/stories/2010/apr/20/texas-border-cameras-153k-arrest/'), ('\nThe Monitor, Senators call for opennes in contingency plans for violence along the U.S. Mexico border, March 18, 2010', 'No link'), (""\nPro News 8, City leaders left out of the loop of Perry's plan for the border, March 18, 2010"", 'https://www.texastribune.org/stories/2010/mar/22/spillover-politics/'), ('\nOffice of the Governor, Gov.

"['Children', 'Education', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry says 90% of students graduate, get a GED or continue schooling
","How many kids fail to finish high school in Texas? Seems like a simple question, but disagreement over the answer roils the governor's race.Democratic nominee Bill White, noting figures that suggest three out of 10 high school students leave before getting their diplomas, has criticized the state's record under GOP Gov. Rick Perry. The governor's campaign responded in an April 6 press release accusing White of using ""incorrect statistics"" and adding: “The percent of students who enter high school and eventually earn a diploma or equivalent, or who remain in pursuit of a diploma or equivalent, is 90 percent.”Even those who slept through math class can see that those dueling percentages don't compute.   Earlier, we rated as Half True U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's statement that one-third of Texas high school students drop out. We noted that there are different ways of measuring how many students make it through four years of high school or not, including graduation rates, dropout rates, attrition rates and completion rates. And those measurements can yield wildly different numbers.Considering the potency of this issue, we're revisiting the dropout debate from Perry's perspective. How does his claim -- that 90 percent of all Texas students who start high school graduate, get the equivalent of a diploma or continue to work on it -- stand up?Perry’s statement relies on the Texas Education Agency’s determination of the so-called completion rate for the class of 2008, which is the most recent available information. The agency defines the high school completion rate as the percentage of students from a class of ninth-graders ""who complete their high school education by their anticipated graduation date.""That means a student has four years to graduate, receive a GED or continue in high school to be considered a “completer.” According to the state education agency, 79.1 percent of students in the class of 2008 graduated, 1.5 percent got a GED and 8.9 percent re-enrolled in high school.Add them together, and you have a completion rate of 89.5 percent, which Perry rounds up to 90 percent. The remainder are the high-school students who dropped out. The agency says, then, that the dropout rate for the class of 2008 was 10.5 percent.An aside: Though Perry puts students who continue to pursue a GED in the same category as completers, the education agency does not. If all students still working toward their GEDs were included in the agency's calculation, the class of 2008's completion rate would probably exceed 90 percent. The completion rate is one way of looking at school success. But like every method we examined, it has flaws. One has to do with how the state reaches its final tally of the size of the graduating class -- the key number on which ""completion"" is based.Nearly 60,900 Texas students -- out of 370,703 who started ninth grade with the class of 2008 or transferred in after ninth grade -- were removed from the class count by the education agency for various reasons. About 39 percent moved to other states, 24 percent shifted to home-schooling, 17 percent returned to their home countries and 11 percent transferred to private schools. Other students, totaling to 9 percent, were removed for other reasons such as death or expulsion for criminal behavior. Obviously, many of these students don't belong in the final class count. But critics say that some of the nearly 61,000 students taken off the roster still end up dropouts. Another criticism: The agency labels all continuing students ""completers"" even though some of those drop out later. This approach, critics say, results in inflating the completion rate and lowering the dropout rate. That's one reason some academics and advocates say the agency's calculations paint an overly rosy picture of the state's education system.  In a sense, completion rates offer a glass-half-full perpective on school success. Indeed, a July 2009 report from the education agency states that one advantage of using the completion rate is that it is ""more positive"" than the dropout rate because it measures ""school success instead of failure."" Then there's the attrition rate -- a glass-half-empty measurement. It tracks the decline in enrollment between a single year and a later one: for example, the number of students in 12th grade compared with the number of students in 9th grade three years earlier. That's the approach used by Hutchison, when she was running for governor, and now White.Unlike TEA’s completion rate, which tracks individual students, the attrition rate relies on raw enrollment numbers -- and it yields much higher indications of failure than the state's dropout rate. According to the Intercultural Development Research Association in San Antonio, which has its roots in the legal fight for school funding equity, the class of 2008 posted an attrition rate of 33 percent; the class of 2009, 31 percent. Since 2000, more than 1 million Texas students have been lost to attrition, according to IDRA.The advocacy group calls attrition rates an indicator of a school’s ""ability to keep students enrolled in school and learning until they graduate.” For its part, the TEA says that measuring attrition does not distinguish students who are really dropping out from those who are being held back a year or graduate early.We can understand why Perry and other state officials would focus on the positive -- the completion rate -- since it's a key part of the system by which Texas holds public schools accountable. Whether it makes good policy sense to do so is another question, since there are other, valid measures that may cast educational performance in a clearer light.Michael Petrilli, a vice president at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute in Washington, an educational research and advocacy group, told us that a better yardstick is a simple one: how many students get a diploma.""There are a million different ways to measure graduation rates, each with their own plusses and minuses,"" said Petrilli, a former education official under President George W. Bush. ""But if we want to measure the effectiveness of the public schools, it makes sense to look at the percentage of students who actually graduate from high school, rather than those that get their GED, because the former is a better predictor of success in college and the workplace than the latter.""In fact, this is how the federal government gauges the performance of individual schools. By that measure, the graduation rate for the Texas class of 2008 was 79 percent.So how do we grade Perry's statement? Perry accurately quotes the education agency's completion measurement, which is one way of figuring out how many students get a high-school education. But like other methods, it has its faults -- and one is that it tends to overcount students who finish school, and undercount those who don't.We rate his claim as Half True.","[('Texans for Rick Perry, ""Liberal Trial Lawyer\'s Math Doesn\'t Add Up: When Wages Aren\'t Income and Graduates are Dropouts,"" April 6, 2010Bill White for Texas, ""White Challenges Perry: What\'s Happening to Texas Students?""

White says he cut tax rates five times
","Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White this week appeared in his first TV ad since winning the March primary, taking the occasion to promote his accomplishments during his six-year stint as the mayor of that city.The spot, in which White brands himself ""a man on the move,"" includes one claim that we earlier rated True, that crime rates in Houston fell to 25-year lows during White's tenure, from 2004 through 2009. For this article, another claim in the ad piqued our interest, that as mayor, White had 'cut tax rates five times.'As support for the statement, White's campaign pointed us to City of Houston financial records that show the property tax rate dropping in small increments for five straight fiscal years after White took office. (For White's final budget, the city's current one, the tax rate did not change from the previous year.)We wondered how much of a role White played in the rate-cutting.In Houston, which has a strong-mayor form of government, the annual budget proposal and tax rate originate in the city's Finance Department, which is part of each mayor's administration. The 14-member city council can offer amendments to the budget before voting on it, but city Finance Director Michelle Mitchell said that generally, the proposed tax rate doesn't change. Barton Smith, a University of Houston economics professor and director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting, said the mayor plays a ""dominant role in what's on the city council's agenda.""""To a large extent in Houston, the city council is really dependent on information they obtain from him (the mayor) and his administration, particularly on city finances.""For those five years, the tax rate dropped from 65.55 cents per $100 in assessed property value when White took office to 63.875 cents. However, in four of those five years, the city adopted a tax rate that still brought in more revenue than it had the year before.Smith said one effect of White's approach was to build up the city's reserve funds, a decision he described as ""prudent.""Cutting the rates provided some hypothetical tax savings to property owners in Houston, compared to what they would have paid had the rate stayed the same. In her letter accompanying the fiscal 2008 budget, then-Finance Director Judy Gray Johnson said, ""The combined effect of the property tax rate cuts and the annual increase in the senior exemptions during the (White) administration amounts to a $25 million cut in property taxes in FY2008 compared to the rate and exemptions in FY2004.""But lowering the tax rate doesn't always mean that property owners' tax bills go down. During good economic times, cities can often cut rates and still take in more revenue because property values -- on which the tax is based -- are rising.That's what was happening in Houston during White's tenure. (For Harris County, which includes Houston, the tax rate essentially held steady during that time.)According to the City of Houston's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for fiscal year 2009, the total value of taxable property in Houston -- including both residential and commercial property -- increased in each of the years the tax rates were trimmed. And in each of those years, the city brought in more tax revenue than the previous year.In a letter accompanying the final 2009 budget, White said, ""The rise in total property tax receipts in FY2009 -- after the rate cuts -- will be fueled in large part by new construction and the rise in commercial and industrial values."" The assessed value of commercial and industrial property rose 15.6 percent that year; the value of residential property rose 6.8 percent.Smith said: ""In many ways, (White) had it pretty easy. Other (Houston) mayors have had to struggle through real fiscal crises. During his tenure, he didn't have to face a lot of the really hard choices.""And what was the impact on homeowners during the years the rate was cut?Sylvia Shaw, manager of the Houston Finance Department's tax and revenue division, provided information on what the tax bill for the average-value home in Houston would have been in four of those five years. (Shaw said she did not have data for the first year, fiscal 2005). Those figures rose slightly each year, from $784.15 to $902.63.Summing up: White is right that the city's property tax rate was cut five years in a row on his watch, and in Houston, where the mayor has substantial power, his claim of responsibility is warranted.However, property values citywide were increasing at a faster pace. The result: The average residential tax bill rose by an annual average of 4.8 percent from 2006 to 2009.We rate his statement as Half True.","[('City of Houston, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report 2009, ""Assessed value and estimated value of taxable property""City of Houston, finance director\'s message, fiscal year 2008 budgetCity of Houston, ""Building the budget,"" spring 2010Interview with Michelle Mitchell, finance director, City of Houston, May 5, 2010Interview with Kelly Dowe, deputy budget director, City of Houston, May 5 and 7, 2010Interview with Paul Bettencourt, former Harris County tax assessor-collector, May 6, 2010Interview with Sylvia Shaw, manager, Houston Finance Department\'s tax and revenue division, May 6, 2010Interview with Barton Smith, economics professor, University of Houston, May 7, 2010', 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/040810_taxchart.pdf')]",/factchecks/2010/may/07/bill-white/white-says-he-cut-tax-rates-five-times/

Vern Buchanan says balanced budgets are rare in Washington
","U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Sarasota, joined an overwhelming majority of Congress on April 27, 2010, in voting to prevent an automatic cost-of-living pay raise for members of Congress.The measure, which passed the House 402-15 and the Senate on a unanimous voice vote, marks the third consecutive year Congress will go without a pay increase.Before the vote, Buchanan recorded a web video discussing 2009 legislation that would have prohibited members of Congress from receiving a raise unless they balance the federal budget. Buchanan's so-called ""No Balanced Budget, No Raise Act"" never received a committee hearing.Buchanan said he ran for Congress to preach fiscal responsibility.""In the last 50 years, we've only balanced the budget five times,"" Buchanan said.We wanted to see if Buchanan's recollection of history is correct.The White House Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office both track yearly federal revenues and expenditures. Technically, a budget is considered balanced when federal expenses equal federal revenues -- meaning there is no deficit or surplus. Generally speaking, however, most people consider a budget balanced when revenues meet or exceed expenditures.The federal budget is so huge -- now about $3.7 trillion -- that balancing it with revenues is almost impossible. It hasn't happened in at least the last 110 years, according to the OMB.However, in the past 50 years, from 1960-2010, the federal government took in more money than it spent five times -- in 1969, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001.Four of the surplus years came together from 1998-2001, President Bill Clinton's last three years in office, and President George W. Bush's first year in office. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the four surpluses totaled more than $559 billion.The fifth surplus -- $3.2 billion -- came in 1969, when Richard Nixon was president.The last surplus before that was in 1960, 51 budget years ago, and outside the window of Buchanan's statement.While a federal surplus is rare in modern history, that's not always been the case. A 1998 study of budget surpluses and deficits conducted for the House Joint Economic Committee found that federal surpluses outnumbered deficits 108 to 100, ""with surpluses dominating in a large majority of the years prior to 1930.""Urging increased fiscal restraint in Washington, Buchanan lamented in a web video that the federal budget has only been balanced five times in the last 50 years. While the use of the word balance isn't 100 percent right, Buchanan is correct that the federal government has been able to cover its yearly expenses just five times since 1961 -- in 1969 and from 1998-2001.

Can suspected terrorists buy guns?
","In the wake of a foiled car bomb attempt in Times Square, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg went to Washington on May 5, 2010, to lobby for legislation he hopes will keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. ""It's amazing but true: we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47,"" Bloomberg wrote in an op-ed for the Huffington Post the same day.Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., echoed the claim in a Senate hearing: ""The stark fact is that the United States Department of Justice has no authority to block the sale of firearms to suspected terrorists even when the department knows they are about to purchase guns.""Really?Between February 2004 and February 2010, FBI data shows that people on the terrorist watch list went through the background check process to purchase firearms or explosives 1,225 times; and that 1,116 (about 91 percent) of the purchases were allowed to proceed because no ""prohibiting information"" was found such as felony convictions, illegal immigrant status, those dishonorably discharged from the armed forces or people adjudicated as mentally defective or who have been committed to a mental institution.A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office shows Bloomberg is right: ""Membership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives under current federal law.""But that doesn't mean these purchases go unnoticed by the feds.When a person on the ""Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorists"" list applies to buy a firearm, it sets off notifications to various law enforcement and counterterrorism intelligence groups, according to the FBI assistant director Daniel D. Roberts' testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 5, 2010.""In this situation, in a given investigation, the attempt may, in combination with other factors, lead to enhanced investigative methods, such as surveillance,"" Roberts stated. ""What the attempt to buy a firearm means in a counterterrorism investigation, and as a result the subsequent actions it warrants, necessarily must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.""But if no ""federally prohibitive information"" is uncovered, the purchases are allowed to proceed.Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has introduced legislation to close the so-called ""terror gap"" in the nation's gun laws. Under the law, the FBI would be given the latitude to deny firearms and explosives sales to people on the suspected terrorist lists. Anyone denied a purchase could appeal to the courts to overturn it. The bill has the support of 500 mayors who are members of the bipartisan coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns. But it's not a slam dunk. Some legislators have raised constitutional issues with the proposal.""Before we subject innocent Americans who have done nothing but have the wrong name at the wrong time having to go to court and pay the cost of going to court to get their gun rights back, I want to slow down and think about it,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in the Senate hearing.""There's a difference between losing your rights based on a felony charge that has been proven in a court of law and appealed and is a conviction in the books, and being on some list that's at best suspect,"" Graham said. ""We're talking about a second amendment right,"" Graham said. ""Some of the people pushing this idea are pushing the idea of banning handguns. And I don't think banning handguns makes me safer.""Whether the law makes sense is a political matter. But unless or until the proposed law is enacted, there is no dispute that the FBI currently does not have the power to block suspected terrorists from buying dynamite or an AK-47, as Bloomberg said, unless they have some other disqualifying factor such as a felony conviction on their record. And, in fact, people on the terror watch list have been able to purchase firearms or explosives more than a thousand times in the past six years. The purchases may trigger ""enhanced investigative methods"" from the FBI, but the sales are allowed just the same.

Adam Putnam calls Scott Maddox the 'L' word -- lobbyist
","U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam has taken to labeling his possible Democratic opponent for agriculture commissioner a lobbyist.[Insert shrieks and gasps here].In fact, Putnam's campaign called Democrat and former Tallahassee Mayor Scott Maddox a ""lobbyist bottom feeder,"" in a May 4, 2010, statement.Responding to news that Maddox's Tallahassee law firm had sued British Petroleum as a result of the oil spill growing in the Gulf of Mexico, Putnam campaign manager Trey McCarley said:“When in doubt, sue. As a result of his multiple losing campaigns for 3 of Florida’s 4 available Cabinet positions, Scott Maddox has confused job descriptions for the one he’s running for this time. While oil continues to pour out of the earth at a rate of 210,000 gallons per day, Scott Maddox runs to the courthouse to sue someone, anyone, in a desperate attempt to make money from misery.""The job of the Commissioner of Agriculture is to solve problems, to reduce our dependency on countries who hate us with homegrown crops that fuel our cars and power our homes and businesses. Once again Scott proves he’s a lobbyist bottom feeder running for a job he knows little about and cares for even less.” In a separate item, we're checking a claim that Maddox lost campaigns for three available Cabinet positions. In this item, we're going to see if Maddox is indeed a lobbyist, and if so, who he has represented.Putnam's campaign provided PolitiFact Florida with links to the state's online lobbyist registry. A lobbyist, for reference, is someone who attempts to influence the policy decisions of public officials on behalf of a client or interest. State lobbyists are required to register with the Florida Legislature each year and must file quarterly compensation reports listing clients and compensation ranges. Maddox registered as a lobbyist with the legislature in 2009, listing three clients -- the Leon County School Board, the Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund and the Wakulla County Board of County Commissioners.Corresponding compensation reports from 2009 said those groups paid Maddox and his firm, Governance Inc. (it's also called Governance Services LLC), between $20,004 and $69,997 for lobbying services from Jan. 1-June 30. Maddox's name was removed as a Governance Inc. lobbyist in compensation reports starting July 1.Screven Watson, a Maddox adviser, said Maddox's work for the school board was to help get additional per-pupil funding while the police work was to protect police officer's pension plans. Watson said Maddox's work for Wakulla County was to fight proposed cuts in library funding to better Wakulla Springs.""If you want to call that bottom feeding, then have at it,"" Watson said. Maddox founded Governance, Watson said, but now is only a part owner in the consulting and lobbying business. Maddox's name and biography are listed on the Governance Inc. website.There are other instances of Maddox working as a lobbyist.In 2009, he visited several north Florida counties, asking elected officials to hire Governance to help counties fight for federal stimulus dollars.In 2008 and 2009, Maddox was registered as a lobbyist with Leon County. His lobbyist registration expired Sept. 30, 2009. His clients included Tallahassee apartment owner Arbor Properties, Inc., a Jacksonville energy company called Green Power Systems, developer Rockaway LLP and a company called M/A-COM Inc.And in 2004, Maddox received $10,000 to help a client win approval for a development proposal in Leon County that was reviled by many environmentalists. ""We just hired Scott as a lobbyist to help us communicate to the government,"" Tallahassee developer Gordon Thames said at the time. ""I thought maybe they'll listen to Scott and give him strong consideration -- maybe more so than if it was just Gordon up there."" Maddox said he was a consultant for the project, not a lobbyist. Thames said he has hired Maddox on other projects.Watson said Maddox's primary income comes from work as a lawyer, but he also has lobbied for clients when needed.Maddox was not a registered state lobbyist during the 2010 session, state records show. And his Leon County lobbyist registration expired in September 2009.Putnam's campaign called Maddox a ""lobbyist bottom feeder."" We're not touching the bottom feeder part -- you can make up your own mind based on the clients we found that were represented by Maddox.But Maddox has made money as a lobbyist off and on for several years, representing a variety of clients. And though he's not currently registered as a lobbyist, Maddox is part owner in a firm that does state lobbying. That's enough in our minds to rate Putnam's claim that Maddox is a lobbyist True.","[('Palm Beach Post, ""Putnam campaign rips opponent as a ‘lobbyist bottom feeder’,"" May 4, 2010St. Petersburg Times, Maddox worked for developer, May 19, 2005, accessed via NexisAdam Putnam campaign, interview with Trey McCarley, May 5, 2010Scott Maddox campaign, interview with Screven Watson, May 6, 2010Jackson County Floridian, ""County approves money for lobbyist,"" Feb. 11, 2009Leon County, registered lobbyist directoryArbor Properties websiteGreen Power Systems websiteFlorida Legislature, lobbyist information', 'http://www.postonpolitics.com/2010/05/putnam-campaign-rips-opponent-as-a-lobbyist-bottom-feeder/')]",/factchecks/2010/may/06/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-calls-scott-maddox-l-word-lobbyist/

Adam Putnam places perennial loser tag on agriculture commissioner candidate Scott Maddox
","Democrat Scott Maddox is using the oil spill growing in the Gulf of Mexico as an opportunity to distinguish himself in a down-ballot race for agriculture commissioner.Maddox, the former mayor of Tallahassee, has prodded U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, the Republican frontrunner, to rule out the possibility of increased oil drilling in the gulf. Putnam has been a proponent of drilling in the past, and even proposing Congress allow new oil wells within 50 miles of Florida.On May 4, 2010, came word that Maddox's Tallahassee law firm was suing British Petroleum for its role in the spill.News of the suit prompted a searing response from Putnam campaign manager Trey McCarley.""When in doubt, sue,"" McCarley said. ""As a result of his multiple losing campaigns for 3 of Florida’s 4 available Cabinet positions, Scott Maddox has confused job descriptions for the one he’s running for this time. While oil continues to pour out of the earth at a rate of 210,000 gallons per day, Scott Maddox runs to the courthouse to sue someone, anyone, in a desperate attempt to make money from misery.""Sifting out the rhetoric, we wondered if Maddox, 42, had already lost campaigns for three Florida Cabinet posts.First about the Florida Cabinet. Though Putnam's campaign said the Cabinet has four positions, it technically only has three -- chief financial officer, attorney general and agriculture commissioner. The three-person Cabinet meets with the governor and acts as the state clemency board, and oversees several other state functions. In his claim, Putnam is wrongly counting the governor as a member of the Cabinet (though it's an easy mistake).Until 2003, the Cabinet had six members plus the governor. Along with the attorney general and agriculture commissioner, Cabinet members included the secretary of state and the commissioner of education, positions that were once elected, but now appointed, and the positions of treasurer and comptroller, which merged to become CFO.Now about Maddox. He was still in law school at Florida State University in 1993, when at the age of 24, he was elected to the Tallahassee City Commission. In 1995, city commissioners elected him mayor (the commission made the decision in Tallahassee then). In 1997, Maddox was elected mayor by voters after a change of government structure. Ran for attorney general -- lost. Maddox flirted with running for governor in 2002, but instead decided to run for attorney general. He finished second in a four-way Democratic primary behind Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. Dyer went on to lose to then-Republican Charlie Crist. That's one losing campaign.Maddox continued to serve as Tallahassee's mayor until 2003, when he was elected chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. He served as the state party chairman until March 2005. Ran for governor -- dropped out.He left that job and announced he was running for governor in 2006.""I know the potential of this great state,"" Maddox said in announcing his candidacy on May 16, 2005. ""And as someone who served nearly 10 years as mayor of Tallahassee, I am the only candidate with the executive experience necessary to both offer a vision for Florida's future, and make that vision a reality for everyday Floridians.""Maddox's announcement may have been the high-water mark of his campaign for the state's top elected office.Within days of announcing his candidacy, the St. Petersburg Times reported that Maddox -- while party chairman --- had quietly been paid to help win support for a controversial development proposal reviled by Leon County Democrats.A few weeks later, the Internal Revenue Service froze the party's bank account because it failed to pay about $200,000 in payroll and Social Security taxes while Maddox was chairman. Later came news that while he chaired the Leon County party in 2004, it paid a $10,500 fine for campaign finance violations but never reported it as required.Maddox blamed the problems on a bookkeeper and longtime friend who admitted she had made a series of major mistakes and kept them hidden from her bosses. An internal investigation questioned Maddox's hiring decisions at the party, and his campaign faced two pending complaints of alleged campaign finance violations with the Florida Elections Commission, the Times reported.He dropped out of the race on Oct. 7, 2005, about 11 months before the Democratic primary. Maddox endorsed U.S. Rep. Jim Davis of Tampa, who won the party's nomination but went on to lose that November to then-Republican Charlie Crist. That's two losing campaigns (if you give Putnam the benefit of the doubt that dropping out before a vote is cast is the same as losing and if you let slide the fact that the governor isn't technically in the Florida Cabinet).We checked the state Division of Elections to see if Maddox ran for a Cabinet position or governor and lost a third time, but came up empty. Running for agriculture commissioner?McCarley, Putnam's campaign manager, said the third race is Maddox's 2010 bid for agriculture commissioner.""The three out of four I was referring to (were) attorney general, governor and the current one, which is why we referred to it as 'losing' instead of lost,"" McCarley said.McCarley's right in that he did say losing. But we don't buy his argument.We found no independent, public polling data saying Putnam is beating Maddox in a hypothetical November match-up. Moreover, we wouldn't even consider that evidence Maddox is losing (See Charlie Crist Senate poll numbers circa June 2009 as evidence). Plus the context of the quote strongly suggests that Maddox's bid for agriculture commissioner is his fourth run at a Cabinet-level post.In trying to cast Maddox as a politician who will run for anything he think he might win, the Putnam campaign said Maddox has run ""losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available Cabinet positions.""The minor offense in this case is counting Maddox's run for governor as a run for Cabinet. The governor isn't a member of the Cabinet, according to the state Constitution.But that's not what has us worried.Putnam errs in counting Maddox's 2010 bid for agriculture commissioner as a losing campaign. Maddox lost a campaign for attorney general and pulled out of a run for governor. The third race is still up in the air. We rate Putnam's claim False.","[('Palm Beach Post, ""Putnam campaign rips opponent as a ‘lobbyist bottom feeder’,"" May 4, 2010', 'http://www.postonpolitics.com/2010/05/putnam-campaign-rips-opponent-as-a-lobbyist-bottom-feeder/'), ('Adam Putnam campaign, interview with campaign manager Trey McCarley, May 5, 2010Florida Constitution, Article IV Section IV, CabinetFlorida Cabinet Affairs, Cabinet process summarySt. Petersburg Times, ""Maddox making run for governor,"" May 17, 2005, accessed via Times librarySt. Petersburg Times, ""Maddox drops out of race,"" Oct. 8, 2005, accessed via Times libraryFlorida Division of Elections, candidate and campaign databasesFlorida Department of State, election results', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2010/may/06/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-places-perennial-loser-tag-agriculture/
