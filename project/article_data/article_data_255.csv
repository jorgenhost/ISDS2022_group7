Donald Trump attacks top Democrat in Georgia race, misleads on Jon Ossoff's immigration stance
","A day before a special election in Georgia to replace former U.S. Rep. Tom Price, President Donald Trump went on Twitter to criticize the top Democratic contender. ""The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal (sic) race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!"" Trump tweeted April 17. The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes! Eighteen candidates from all parties are seeking Atlanta’s 6th Congressional District seat, which Republicans have held for decades and is now up for grabs after Price joined the Trump administration as secretary of Health and Human Services. While Trump did not explicitly name Jon Ossoff in his tweet, the 30-year-old Democrat has emerged as the leading contender in the closely-watched race. In his tweet, Trump inaccurately characterized Ossoff’s immigration stance. The candidate has spoken in favor of securing the U.S. borders. The White House did not provide comment. Ossoff dismissed Trump’s tweet. ""While I’m glad the president is interested in the race, he is misinformed,"" Ossoff said in a statement. At an April 9 candidate forum, Ossoff spoke in favor of securing the borders. He did, however, have harsh words for Trump’s immigration promise to deport all undocumented immigrants. ""The notion that we are going to massively deport more than 11 million people is absurd. There is no way a program like that could be implemented constitutionally, in a way that is fiscally responsible or in a way that is humane,"" Ossoff said. ""The only real solution is comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders and provides a path to legal status for non-felons who are here without proper documentation."" That message is also delivered in a civil rights and liberties section on his campaign website. ""America needs a strong border policy that protects American citizens and American jobs,"" the section said. ""We should welcome those strivers who, like our own forebears, seek the opportunity to work hard, play by the rules, and build better lives in America."" Ossoff also scoffed at another idea Trump floated during the presidential campaign. Ossoff’s campaign website says he believes ""it’s unconstitutional to ban anyone from entering our country on religious grounds."" Trump’s executive orders to temporarily stop the entry of individuals from certain countries have been criticized by immigrant advocates and Democrats as a ""Muslim ban."" (Those orders have been halted by courts.) NumbersUSA, an advocacy group that promotes reduced immigration, rates candidates on a wide range of issues, such as their position on amnesty, ending birthright citizenship and border security. On whether Ossoff is on the side to secure the border, NumbersUSA gave Ossoff a ""Yes"" rating. NumbersUSA said it bases its ratings on responses to its survey or on candidate statements on campaign websites and in news reports. Trump’s tweet called out Ossoff for wanting to ""protect criminals"" and ""raise taxes."" But those characterizations also misrepresent the facts. Ossoff’s campaign website said he would work to empower law enforcement with tools and resources needed to bring down organized criminals, but would also seek to reduce mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders. Ossoff also said he would work to ""reduce the tax burden on small businesses and simplify small business tax filing."" Our ruling In a tweet alluding to Ossoff, Trump tweeted that Ossoff wants to ""allow illegal immigration."" Trump’s vague attack mischaracterizes Ossoff’s stance. Unlike Trump’s plan, Ossoff’s approach to immigration includes a path to citizenship or legal status for immigrants here without permission. Ossoff has also criticized Trump’s one-time promise to deport all immigrants in the country illegally as not feasible. Trump neglects that Ossoff supports strong border security — to prevent illegal immigration. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACD700>],/factchecks/2017/apr/17/donald-trump/trump-makes-false-claim-about-jon-ossoffs-immigrat/

Fake news headline blames Texas deputy’s real death on fictitious Muslim refugees
","Several websites put a fake headline on a real news story about a Texas sheriff’s deputy being shot and killed, falsely reporting that a trio of Muslim refugees pulled the trigger. ""Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 Muslim refugee (sic),"" read an April 4, 2017, post on SouthernConservativeExtra.com. ""Do you support to deport them?"" the headline added. The post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The news story said that Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood was shot once outside a county courthouse building in Baytown near Houston. He was airlifted to a Houston hospital but died of his wound. The post actually says nothing about refugees, Muslim or otherwise. The only sentence describing a suspect read, ""Investigators said late Monday they were looking for a suspect described as a white or Hispanic male, approximately 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 6-feet-3 inches tall, with short hair and a medium to stocky build."" There isn’t much more detail on the killer than that. There is no mention of a trio of shooters. SouthernConservativeExtra.com describes itself as ""conservative news on the cutting edge, from a southern perspective."" It is registered to an address in Texas. We attempted to contact the site via email but did not receive a reply. The story appears to be a truncated version of the same article and headline posted April 3 on TrueTrumpers.com, a known fake news site. The story and the same headline also has appeared on several other suspect websites. It looks like all of them copied a real news article from April 3 by the Associated Press. The only difference is the clumsy addition of ""by 3 Muslim refugee"" and the question about deportation. This may have been done solely to inflame readers who don’t bother to get past the headline and read the details. In reality, the man who killed Greenwood turned out to be William Kenny, an area man who held a grudge against law enforcement. Authorities had conducted a manhunt for a week, but Kenny had killed himself the day after shooting Greenwood. While the post is a real news article posted without attribution, the headline is altered to stoke prejudiced sentiments toward Muslims. It’s a gross misrepresentation of the circumstances surrounding a law enforcement officer’s death. We rate the headline Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2F9880>],/factchecks/2017/apr/17/blog-posting/fake-news-headline-blames-texas-deputys-real-death/
"['New Hampshire', 'Education', 'Government Regulation', 'Jeb Bush']","
Does school competition lift all boats like Jeb Bush says?
","As New Hampshire considers the merits of a universal Education Savings Account bill, education reformers nationwide are watching - and weighing in. Senate Bill 193 would allow parents to use 90 percent of the per-pupil grant the state gives to local public schools and instead put it toward alternative educational expenses, including private school tuition or homeschooling. ESAs function basically like vouchers, but they give parents more options about how the money can be spent.   Proponents of ESAs tout them as the next evolution in school choice. If SB 193 is passed by the House (it cleared the Senate in March), it would be one of the most expansive school choice laws in the country. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose Foundation for Excellence in Education is backing market-based education reform efforts nationwide, submitted an op-ed in New Hampshire papers this week, urging passage of the bill. ""This legislation (will not) hurt public schools. In fact, a large body of research, including that done in my home state of Florida, indicates quite the opposite. When public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more,"" he wrote. Critics of choice typically say that diverting funds from public schools hurt those schools. So putting aside the question of whether vouchers actually help the kids who use them, we wondered: Does research show that school choice, and specifically vouchers, help public schools get better? ESAs, like vouchers, have traditionally been targeted to certain types of students, like those in low-performing schools or students with disabilities. But the bill in New Hampshire, as it’s currently written, is open to all. Five states so far have adopted ESA programs -- Arizona, Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida, and Nevada -- but only Nevada and Arizona have recently opened up eligibility to all, as New Hampshire is considering doing. Bush’s team at the Foundation for Excellence in Education pointed us to a compilation of 30 policy briefs and academic studies put together by EdChoice, a school choice advocacy group. In all but one of the studies cited by EdChoice, researchers found some sort of gain for public schools facing competition from vouchers or tax-credit scholarships. But most of the studies compiled by the advocacy group found only modest positive relationships between test scores in public schools and competition from voucher programs or tax-credit scholarship programs. Here’s how EdChoice explained that: ""Many existing voucher programs are limited in the number and type of students they’re allowed to serve and the amount of choice they’re allowed to offer. Narrowly constricted programs produce narrowly constricted results. To produce revolutionary results, we would need broad programs -- eligibility for all students,"" the group wrote on its website page where the studies are posted. But David Figlio -- who co-authored three of the studies cited by EdChoice -- said expanding eligibility for these programs wouldn’t necessarily produce more positive gains. ""Less responsible voucher advocates will say that this is proof positive that these programs work,"" said Figlio, who is the Orrington Lunt Professor of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. ""I think a more responsible take on this is these programs don’t seem to be hurting public schools -- at the scale that they’re at."" Figlio has studied the effects of voucher programs in Ohio and Florida and found ""modest positive gains,"" he said, for students in public schools facing competition from voucher programs. He added later: ""Key emphasis on the word modest."" Figlio said it was important to note two things about the voucher systems he had studied -- the types of students they served, and the number, and cautioned against overstating the research. ""In both Florida and Ohio, these are programs that are serving very disadvantaged students,"" Figlio said. ""I would feel very uncomfortable with taking that work and looking at vouchers for more advantaged kids."" The number of students participating in the programs Figlio studied were small. And so it makes sense, he said, that schools would have retained the capacity to make improvements  -- because they hadn’t lost that much revenue. Figlio said he wasn’t aware of domestic research that had shown negative effects of vouchers on public schools. But research in the U.S. has so far just looked at relatively small, targeted voucher programs. The program being proposed in New Hampshire would be open to all public school students. So Figlio suggested research in foreign contexts -- namely, Chile -- might be instructive here.   Miguel Urquiola is a professor of economics at Columbia University. He's published extensively about Chile, which adopted a universal voucher program in the 1980s. Urquiola said that in Chile's case, public school performance -- as measured by test scores -- got ""significantly"" worse with the implementation of vouchers. But Urquiola cautions that the main driver behind this was likely not that public schools did a worse job. Rather, the key factor was that higher-performing students transferred in large numbers from public to private schools. ""(Chile) seems to be mainly a story of affluent students and affluent families leaving the public sector,"" he said. On the whole, Urquiola said that vouchers had been a ""disappointing"" reform effort, with minor measurable effects on student performance. ""School choice and the privatization of schools are fun things to argue about. But in terms of real effects they are a bit of a red herring,"" he said. ""The evidence indicates that -- perhaps surprisingly -- such reforms do not make education really good; they do not make it really bad either."" As for the research on competitive effects of school choice policies in general -- vouchers, tax-credit scholarships, and charters all together -- the jury is still out, said David Arsen, a professor of education policy and K-12 educational administration at Michigan State University. ""The research is mixed. For the most part the competitive effects of school choice are modest. Sometimes positive. Sometimes negative. Sometimes no effect at all,"" he said. Arsen, who wrote a review of the literature on the competitive effects of choice back in 2012, warned against making ""broad, generic claims about the competitive effect."" ""Because it depends. Most particularly it depends on details of policy design,"" he said. Our ruling In urging the passage of a New Hampshire bill to establish education savings accounts, Jeb Bush said ""when public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more."" Some research shows positive gains in public schools when choice is offered, but researchers say those studies typically only show minor effects, and that the specifics of the programs matter a lot. In Florida and Ohio, where vouchers were targeted to certain types of students, researchers found minor improvements in public school performance. In Chile, where vouchers were universally available, public school test scores got worse. But Bush cited ""a large body of research,"" and ESA programs like the ones being proposed in New Hampshire have only very recently been implemented in Arizona and Nevada, and haven’t been studied. To imply that competition will lift all boats -- especially in the context of this legislative proposal -- isn’t supported by the research. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097881F40>],/factchecks/2017/apr/17/jeb-bush/does-school-competition-lift-all-boats-jeb-bush-sa/

Pro-Sheriff David Clarke group says Clarke called Black Lives Matter hate group, terrorist movement
","A committee aiming to persuade the ""people’s sheriff"" to run for the U.S. Senate is raising money by highlighting the African-American’s inflammatory statements about Black Lives Matter. It’s no secret that Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a Donald Trump supporter and nationally known conservative, has harshly criticized the group. Yet, we wondered if he has gone as far as the Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate draft committee says he has.   As reported by the liberal magazine Mother Jones, the committee sent a fundraising email on April 5, 2017 that suggested several reasons why Clarke would make a good senator -- starting with this one: ""Milwaukee’s conservative black Sheriff CORRECTLY says ‘BLACK LIVES MATTER’ is a terrorist movement, a hate group, and calls it ‘Black LIES Matter.’"" The committee also makes the statement on its website. Let’s look at each of the three parts. The committee Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate is not a committee authorized by Clarke, but is registered with the Federal Election Commission as an official draft campaign. It has attacked first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, for being a lesbian as part of its effort to get Clarke to run against her in 2018. Clarke has not ruled out a run, but hasn’t expressed strong interest, either, while a number of Republicans have.    For her part, Baldwin has said Clarke is ""being groomed"" to challenge her, and has raised campaign funds herself off his possible candidacy. While a favorite of the right, Clarke has drawn criticism for his racial remarks as well as for his performance as sheriff as he increasingly spends time on national television and traveling the country on speaking engagements. He has also said virtually nothing about four inmate deaths in the jail he manages that are under investigation. Now to the statement about what Clarke said. ‘Hate group’ Black Lives Matter formed after a Florida jury in 2013 found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen. Describing its aim as rebuilding ""the black liberation movement,"" the group has participated around the country in demonstrations, including some around Milwaukee, about police killings of black people. Clarke called Black Lives Matter a ""hate group"" in a July 2016 opinion column he wrote for FoxNews.com and has made any number of similar references such as these: ""I wish the Southern Poverty Law Center would add them (Black Lives Matter) to the list of hate groups in America … this hateful ideology of Black Lives Matter."" -- Fox News’ ""America’s News HQ,"" July 31, 2016 ""Black Lives Matter are purveyors of hate. It is a hateful, violent ideology."" -- Fox News’ ""Hannity"" show, July 17, 2016 Black ‘Lies’ Matter Clarke has used ""Lies"" instead of ""Lives"" in referencing the group many times, including in his memoir, released in February 2017, and on CNN and Fox in 2015. In the Fox interview, he elaborated on why, saying: ""The whole thing is built on a lie, the whole premise is built on a lie. But it’s a conglomeration of misfits. You have Occupy movement, you have organized labor in on it now, you have criminals, you have black racialists, you have cop haters and anarchists have now formed together this faux movement, if you will."" ‘Terrorist movement’ Clarke hasn’t used a terrorism reference nearly as often, but he does so twice in his book: Black Lives Matter does not ""care about black lives. They care about their own radical ideology of terrorism: anarchy."" ""In the five days surrounding the Dallas shooting -- which was the worst police massacre since 9/11, by the way -- there was even more Black LIES Matter-inspired violence (four attacks on police are listed)….Let me guess. You’d never heard of these incidents. That’s because the media protect and lie about this insidious terror organization."" Clarke also predicted on Twitter in 2015 that Black Lives Matter ""will join forces with ISIS to being (sic) down our legal constituted republic."" And in a July 2016 column he wrote for The Hill, he said: ""We have several forces internal and external attacking our rule of law: ISIS, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street – just the most recent iterations of the elements who brand themselves as unique but seek the same revolutionary aim: take down the West …""   Our rating The Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate draft committee says that Clarke said Black Lives Matter ""is a terrorist movement, a hate group and calls it, Black LIES Matter."" Clarke has repeatedly used Lies instead of Lives in labeling the group, and has repeatedly called it a hate group. In his memoir, he calls the group a ""terrorist organization.""

Will all the oil from the Keystone XL pipeline be exported?
","2022 coverage: RELATED: Keystone wouldn’t simply offset oil US imports from Russia RELATED: Pence falsely blames Biden’s nixing of Keystone pipeline for US reliance on Russian oil   __ President Trump’s approval of the Keystone XL pipeline brought protests from opponents who say it will not benefit the U.S. Every day the equivalent of 830,000 barrels of oil will flow through 1,200 miles of pipeline from Canada to Nebraska. ""I’ve opposed the Keystone strategy for a long time because it is an export strategy,"" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, told the Press-Republican newspaper in Plattsburgh. ""It doesn’t even have any oil for America to make our gas prices cheaper.""

""It’s literally oil from Canada taken through America, so we take all the risks of any kind of spill or any kind of problem, and then it exports it to Mexico and then straight to China or other places,"" she said. PolitiFact rated a similar claim from then-President Obama Mostly False in 2014. We checked with a few experts to see if anything has changed. Is Gillibrand right? Will the crude oil that flows through the pipeline immediately leave the U.S.? What gets exported The Keystone XL pipeline will transport crude oil from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska. The oil will then flow through another pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries, where it will be refined into petroleum products like gasoline. Gulf Coast refineries export about two-thirds of their products, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report in January. The rest is sold in the U.S. That is a marked shift since 2012, when refineries exported about 38 percent of their products. The Gulf Coast exports of crude oil -- oil that has not been refined into everything from butane to gasoline -- spiked during the same time period. Companies exported about 280,000 barrels of crude oil every day last year, compared to 4,000 in 2012. What gets imported The Gulf Coast imported more than 3.3 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2016. Most of that oil came from Latin America and the Middle East. Only 9 percent of the crude oil imported to the Gulf Coast came from Canada. The Keystone XL pipeline was designed to transport oil to the Gulf Coast because refineries in the region are already equipped to process heavier crude oils, like those found in Canada’s Alberta province. The same kind of crude oil comes to the region from Latin America. If the pipeline transfers as much crude oil to the Gulf Coast as the federal government expects, total imports would increase by about 25 percent. The State Department view The U.S. State Department did not respond to most of Gillibrand’s claim but did comment on how the pipeline could affect gas prices. ""As the final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement makes clear, gas prices throughout the United States are primarily driven by global market factors,"" a spokesperson said. ""The amount of Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) crude that makes its way to the Gulf region does not change this dynamic. Any impact on prices for refined petroleum products resulting from the approval and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline would be minimal."" What experts say Gillibrand suggests the crude oil imported through the pipeline would be immediately exported to other countries once it reaches the Gulf Coast. Experts say that is not the case. ""I don't believe that she is correct,"" said Mark Bateau, Director of the Energy Institute at the University of Michigan. ""In general, refineries designed to handle heavier crudes are the ones most likely to utilize this oil, in some cases instead of heavy crudes imported from places like Venezuela."" ""I would say it doesn’t accurately describe the likely outcome,"" said Stanley Reynolds, an environmental economics expert from the University at Arizona. ""It’s true that the oil would come from Canada and then mainly go to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining."" TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, confirmed in an email that the pipeline was designed to reach refineries in the Gulf Coast region. Experts also say it’s unlikely that none of the refined products will be sold in the U.S. once the pipeline is built. ""That refined oil product, gasoline or whatever, could be just as easily consumed in the United States as somewhere else,"" said Barry Rabe, an expert on environmental policy from the University at Michigan. ""There’s nothing on the oil coming through a pipeline from Canada that requires all of that to be sold somewhere else."" Our ruling Gillibrand said the Keystone XL pipeline ""doesn’t even have any oil for America."" Experts say the oil will not be exported straight to other countries, as Gillibrand said. It is true that exports of petroleum products from Gulf Coast refineries have increased considerably in recent years. That’s part of why PolitiFact rated a similar statement by Obama Mostly False in 2014. While the trend adds a grain of truth to her claim, it does not mean all of the oil that will come from the Keystone XL pipeline will be immediately exported.

Did the United Airlines passenger have 'every right' to stay on the plane?
","A United Airlines passenger’s forcible removal from a flight has led to plenty of armchair judicial rulings on whether it was legal. Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano said on Fox & Friends after the incident that United overstepped its authority by taking David Dao off Flight 3411 unwillingly on April 10, 2017. Dao had boarded the airplane, but then United selected him to lose his seat when the airline wanted to put four flight crew members on the flight from Chicago to Louisville, Ky. Dao refused to leave. Video widely shared on the Internet appeared to show Dao being pulled from his seat by Chicago Department of Aviation police, his face bloodied in the process. His family later announced he had suffered a concussion, a broken nose and lost his two front teeth. The officers involved have been put on leave, and United has struggled to contain the publicity disaster. ""By dislodging this passenger against his will, United violated its contractual obligation,"" Napolitano said the next day. ""He paid for the ticket, he bought the ticket, he passed the TSA, he was in his seat, he has every right to stay there."" Airline travel already is fraught with hassle and inconvenience, as most of us know, but this incident has tested legal boundaries for how passengers can and should be treated. Is Napolitano right that a ticketed passenger who has passed security and boarded the airplane has ""every right"" to stay in his seat? Without diving into the other legalities of what happened to Dao, experts we contacted say Napolitano’s argument that a passenger can’t be removed from a plane doesn’t fly. Contract of carriage Let’s start off by saying there’s a lot about the incident that would have to be decided after an investigation, and possibly even legal action. With so many arguments to consider about the legality of Dao’s removal, a lot is still up in the air (so to speak). We emailed Napolitano and two Fox News Channel media contacts for more information on this statement, but we didn’t get a reply. Timothy Ravich, an aviation law professor at the University of Central Florida, told us passenger rights are still limited by laws, regulations and policies. Airlines have the authority to decide whether passengers are breaking the rules, and can remove people at a company's discretion, even against a passenger's will. ""The suggestion that Dr. Dao had ironclad rights merely by buying a ticket, passing through TSA security, and being in his seat is incorrect,"" Ravich said. In this case, Dao was also subject to United’s contract of carriage, essentially a set of guidelines by which a passenger agrees to abide in exchange for the flight. Ravich pointed out that Rule 21 of United’s contract give about 27 reasons why the airline ""shall have the right to refuse to transport or shall have the right to remove from the aircraft at any point, any passenger."" Some of these reasons include a woman being nine months pregnant, or someone being too sick or too drunk to fly, or even if they are ""barefoot or not properly clothed."" That last one came up for United in March when two teen girls were barred from a flight for wearing leggings. (The teens were flying standby as part of the airlines’ perk of giving flights to employees and their dependents. The airline said the tight-fitting pants did not meet the company’s policy dress code for those types of passengers.) Ravich noted, as an example, that Rule 21 also said ""passengers who fail to comply with or interfere with the duties of the members of the flight crew, federal regulations, or security directives"" are subject to removal as a safety measure. One theoretical argument in this instance could be that Dao was told to leave to help United get a flight crew to Louisville. Dao broke the rule when he refused and was therefore removed. Now, before you write us angry letters, let us reiterate that we’re not judging whether a policy is fair or was applied or enforced correctly. We’re merely saying that there are rules in place that allow for passengers already on a plane to be removed, and passengers are subject to them. Embry Riddle Aeronautical University aviation law professor Stephen Dedmon agreed that United can remove passengers from planes for many reasons. He also said the specifics of Dao’s case can currently be debated but not resolved without knowing all the specifics or legal interpretations. ""It would take a court ruling to decide UA’s provisions were appropriate and properly applied,"" Dedmon said. Our ruling Napolitano said a United Airlines passenger forcibly removed from an airplane had ""every right"" to stay in his seat. Napolitano's blanket assertion is incorrect. Experts told us that airlines, including United, outline dozens of reasons why they might remove a passenger after he has already boarded. Whether the airline adhered to or executed these provisions properly is a different matter, and would have to be decided in court. Either way, you can still lose your seat once you get on the plane.

Beto O'Rourke relies on disputed rankings to call El Paso America's safest city
","Democrat Beto O’Rourke closed out March 2017 by declaring his longshot 2018 bid to deny Republican Ted Cruz re-election to the U.S. Senate--also repeatedly reviving a flawed claim about his hometown's relative safety. Confirming his candidacy before constituents, the congressman called El Paso ""the safest city in Texas, the safest city in the United States."" The same day in Dallas, O’Rourke told a crowd: ""El Paso, Texas--safest city, safest city in the state of Texas, safest city in the United States. And listen, lest you think that it’s due to walls or drones or aerostat blimps or militarization of the border--we’ve been either the safest or one of the top three safest cities in America since 1997. We are a safe city."" O’Rourke made a similar claim in Austin the next day. Hold on, pardner. We’ve identified factual flaws in such proclamations. In 2011, we found Mostly False a claim that El Paso had been named the nation’s safest large city. El Paso had topped a 2010 ""Lowest Crime Rate"" list for cities of 500,000 residents or more. But only a city press release named El Paso the nation’s ""safest"" large city--and El Paso’s police department subsequently dropped the label. In 2013, we rated Half True a claim that ""El Paso is the safest city of our size in the nation."" As in 2011, the statement was tied to calculations by CQ Press linked to crime data published by the FBI that the agency strongly counsels against using to compare communities. In 2011, the FBI said it ""strongly discourages"" using FBI Unified Crime Reporting statistics to evaluate locales or the effectiveness of police departments. That note also said: ""Despite repeated warnings against these practices, some data users continue to challenge and misunderstand this position. Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place. UCR statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale."" O’Rourke concedes rankings not perfect When we inquired, a volunteer O’Rourke aide, John Meza, told us O’Rourke relied on the CQ Press lists and related news stories to conclude that El Paso stands out as the nation’s perpetually safest city. Meza offered as O’Rourke’s backup a CQ Press document, ""City Crime Rankings 2014,"" which states that based on its analysis of 2012 FBI-collected statistics, El Paso had the ""lowest crime-rate ranking"" among cities of 500,000 residents or more (with Austin No. 3 and San Antonio No. 10):                SOURCE: Document, ""City Crime Rankings 2014,"" CQ Press, undated (web link received by email from John Meza, volunteer, Beto O’Rourke U.S. Senate campaign, April 3, 2017) By phone, O’Rourke later conceded the CQ Press lists aren’t a ""perfect way to assess a city’s relative safety."" ""There’s got to be a better way to do this,"" O’Rourke said. ""Until there is, I’ve only got what the FBI reports"" as interpreted by CQ Press. ""If you’ve got a better source, I’m all yours,"" O’Rourke said. CQ Press sticks with disclaimer CQ Press has warned against using its rankings to talk up any community's relative safety. In our 2013 fact check of the claim about El Paso being named the country’s safest city, CQ Press’s summary didn’t identify the border city as the nation’s safest big city--on purpose, we were told. A CQ Press spokeswoman, Marina Ilishaev, then told us that until 2009, it had used ""safest"" and ""dangerous"" to describe cities having the lowest and highest rankings by its analysis. ""Even though the rankings are still provided,"" she said by email, ""these terms are no longer used because perceptions of safety and danger are just that—perceptions. The data analyzed here are reported crime and population, which together constitute only two factors considered when determining safety or risk of crime victimization."" ""...We would add, as we do in our methodology section, that we mean by ‘lowest composite reported crime rate’ the largest deviation below the national median in six main crime categories, which are counted equally,"" she said. Specifically, CQ Press says its crime-rate rankings were derived from totaling each city’s violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault as tallied by the FBI plus the number of property crimes of burglary and motor vehicle theft, all in 2011. Then it follows a ""multistep process,"" CQ Press says, in which each city’s reported crimes in each category are compared to nationally reported crimes per 100,000 population rate and ""indexed to create a summary score and ranking across"" the six areas of reported violent and property crime. After O’Rourke made his claim, we reached Tiffany Medina of SAGE Publishing, which owns CQ Press, who sent an email reaffirming the company’s previous cautionary note. She also pointed us to just such a disclaimer in its 2015 report based on 2013 UCR data, which also says: ""The data analyzed here are reported crime and population, which together constitute only two factors considered when determining safety or risk of crime victimization. Thus, the analyses in this book are purely descriptive."" CQ Press analysis of 2015 statistics Further, we spotted a 2017 CQ Press web post enabling us to determine, based on its crunch of the FBI’s UCR data for 2015, that El Paso then had the lowest, or best, ""crime rate ranking"" among the 31 cities of 500,000 residents or more that drew a ranking. After El Paso, the cities of New York, Austin and San Diego had the best rankings with Baltimore ranked last in the group behind Milwaukee and Detroit, according to CQ Press. We noticed too that the CQ Press website newly makes it possible to apply a population density filter to its rankings. That is, you can group cities by how crowded they happen to be. And? El Paso and Austin fall out of the big-city rankings if you require a density of at least 2,720 residents per square mile. This approach leaves New York, San Diego and San Jose with the best ""crime rate"" rankings among 21 remaining cities of 500,000 residents or more--with San Antonio at No. 6, Dallas at No. 12 and Houston at No. 17. Requiring an even greater density (of 5,360 residents per square mile) leaves 10 cities of 500,000 residents or more in the mix. Summing up, per CQ Press, the nation’s most-crowded big cities with the lowest 2015 ""crime rate"" rankings were: New York; Boston; Los Angeles; Seattle; San Francisco; Chicago; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Milwaukee; and Baltimore--with Texas cities not making the cut. A 2017 FBI cautionary note Among several news stories noted by Meza, a February 2013 Fox News story said the FBI had no comment on CQ’s rankings, ""since the agency does not put out the safest cities report nor does it endorse it."" That story led us to spot a new FBI cautionary note in a January 2017 agency press release about the agency’s release of its UCR data for January-June 2016: ""When the FBI publishes crime data via its UCR Program, some entities use the information to compile rankings of cities and counties. Such rankings, however, do not provide insight into the numerous variables that shape crime in a given town, city, county, state, tribal area or region. ""These rankings,"" the FBI said, ""lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that can create misleading perceptions that adversely affect communities and their residents."" Crime experts and the latest FBI statistics For our check of the 2013 claim touting El Paso’s safety, criminologist Alfred Blumstein, now a professor emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University, told us by phone CQ Press’s approach--especially its weighting each type of crime the same--made its crime-rate rankings ""highly suspect as true indicators of safety."" By email, Mitchell Chamlin, a Texas State University criminal justice professor, said at the time that city-level crime rate comparisons weren’t particularly meaningful. ""Crime is local,"" Chamlin wrote, and ""most criminals work in a very small radius,"" typically smaller than a city. We then went a step further by looking at FBI statistics for 2011 to compare rates of violent crime, which includes murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, limiting our focus to El Paso and nine other cities of 500,000 or more population that were listed in the 2013 CQ Press report as having the ""lowest crime rate"" rankings. In 2011 among the selected cities, the FBI statistics suggested, El Paso had the fourth-lowest violent crime rate; the lowest murder rate; and the second-lowest burglary rate. First six months of 2016 After O’Rourke made his claim, we applied a similar filter to the UCR statistics covering January through June 2016, limiting our focus to El Paso and nine other cities of 500,000 or more population identified by CQ Press as having the lowest crime rate rankings for 2015 (though we substituted No. 11 Seattle for Boston, which evidently didn’t report crime data to the FBI for the six-month period.) Upshot: Among the cities across 10 types of crime reported to the FBI, El Paso had the lowest rates of violent crime; murder; robbery; burglary; and motor vehicle theft. El Paso had the second-lowest incidence of aggravated assault; property crime; arson; and larceny-theft. Finally, per our sort, El Paso had the third-lowest rate of rape. Our ruling O’Rourke said El Paso is the ""safest city in the state of Texas, safest city in the United States."" This declaration ties to disputed CQ Press rankings, rooted in FBI-published statistics, that appear annually despite the FBI’s advice against using its data to compare communities. The cited rankings also didn't consider every Texas burg nor did they account for differences in population density. We rate O’Rourke’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Karen Handel makes dicey balanced budget claim in Georgia race to replace Tom Price
","In the special election to fill Tom Price’s former House seat, Republican Karen Handel often reminds voters of a key line in her political resume. ""As chairman of the Fulton board of commissioners, I turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget,"" she said in an 11Alive news report. The claim is the second sentence on her biography page on her website. Which raises the question: Did Handel actually turn a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget? The short answer is that while Handel was able to help balance the county budget without raising taxes, her specific claim ignores some critical facts about the Fulton County budget process. Let’s step back in time. Diving into the ‘deficit’ Handel took over as chair of the county commissioners on Nov. 12, 2003. Two days later, she was handed a proposed 2004 budget. It was a balanced budget because by law, it had to be. But in two of the county’s largest funds, the general fund and the special services district fund, the original budget planners saw spending topping revenues by a combined total of nearly $90 million. They didn’t call those deficits; they called them shortfalls. But the concept is similar. Additional shortfalls in other funds added well over $10 million to the gap, giving us the $100 million ""deficit"" in Handel’s claim. To keep the budget balanced, that original plan took $12 million from the county’s cash reserves (to boost the general fund) and raised property taxes by about $75 million. To be clear, the difference is not that Handel took an unbalanced budget and fixed it. Rather, she took a different approach to balancing the budget — which, again, by law, the commission had to do each year. Looking at news reports in January 2004, Handel gets credit for using a mix of spending cuts and deeper draws into cash reserves to deliver a balanced budget that avoided a property tax increase. Overall, her budget plan reduced spending by $46 million from the plan she saw when she took office. But that still didn’t close the gap between spending and revenues. The gap was half of what she started with. She filled that gap, not with more property taxes, but with money saved from past years and kept in reserve. In the words of a Jan. 22, 2004, Atlanta Journal Constitution article, ""The budget calls for $49 million in deficit spending that pulls Fulton's two savings accounts below commission-mandated minimums."" (Ultimately, the funds didn't dip as low as expected.) We spoke with Handel and her spokeswoman Kate Constantini. They rejected the idea that her plan included a ""deficit"" but agreed with the numbers. ""I came in and got the budget in place so we didn't need to raise taxes,"" Handel said. ""We did that through savings and realignment across the various funds."" The Atlanta Journal Constitution praised her at the time. In an editorial, it called her plan ""reasonable and even handed."" ""In this era of cruel budget-cutting in the face of dropping revenue, it’s a rare opportunity to adopt a spending plan that supports good services but doesn’t soak the taxpayers,"" it said. Our ruling Handel said she turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget when she became chair of the Fulton County board of commissioners. Certain parts of that story add up: The expected shortfall was over $100 million. Handel’s budget was balanced, and did so without a tax increase. However, her talking point omits that the county required balanced budgets — and the spending plan she was handed was balanced in the first place. Furthermore, if Handel called the $100 million in the original plan a deficit, then the same label would apply to the 2004 budget that she spearheaded. Her balanced plan also factored in a $49 million shortfall, even after spending cuts. The biggest difference is she avoided a hefty tax hike by drawing more from reserves. Words matter. Handel’s statement ignores that she was required to balance the budget, and her definition of deficit is inconsistent. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC2180>],/factchecks/2017/apr/14/karen-handel/karen-handels-dicey-balanced-budget-claim/

Sara Stevenson of Austin says Texas Senate panel randomly called witnesses at 'voucher' hearing
","An Austin resident declared that a Texas Senate panel randomly called witnesses to testify at a crucial hearing no matter how early people turned in requests to do so. School librarian Sara Stevenson, whom we’ve fact-checked before, said in a letter to the editor in the Austin American-Statesman that about 8 a.m. March 21, 2017, she was the fifth person to submit a required paper form requesting to testify at that day’s Senate Education Committee hearing on legislation to enable public school students to attend private schools using government aid. We recently confirmed that no school voucher plan has passed into Texas law despite decades of attempts. But by the end of March 2017, Sen. Larry Taylor’s Senate Bill 3 cleared the Education Committee, which he chairs, and the Senate. Still, prospects for his proposal to launch state-funded educational savings accounts for students remained uncertain. Texas House members voted 103-44 during action on the 2018-19 state budget to bar state aid from paying for students to attend nonpublic schools. In her letter, Stevenson said that after signing up to testify, she went to work and then returned to the hearing at 2 p.m. ""My name had still not been called,"" she wrote. ""I waited six more hours until my name was finally called after 8 p.m. ""Because the order is random,"" Stevenson wrote, ""signing up to speak becomes a game of chicken or stakeout. Who can outlast whom? A random roll call suits lobbyists just fine but not your average citizen."" So, did Taylor’s committee summon witnesses at random? Asked to elaborate, Stevenson said that when she returned to the hearing, others in the audience told her she had to wait to hear her name, no telling when, which led her to conclude the order was random. ""There’s got to be a better way"" of organizing testimony, Stevenson said by phone, ""even if I’m wrong."" Other witnesses comment We turned first to Patsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, who said by phone that committee chairs control how hearings proceed. She said too that people seeking to speak at the March 21 hearing submitted paper witness registration cards to committee staff; there was no option to sign up on an electronic kiosk. Our subsequent review of more than 120 ""witness registration"" cards submitted for the hearing enabled us to phone a few witnesses to elicit their experiences. Arif Panju, an Austin lawyer who testified for SB 3, told us he attended the full hearing. To him, the order of witnesses called to testify seemed fair. Similarly, Robin Lennon, a Kingwood supporter of the measure, said she didn’t see anything random in the witness order. She spoke late, Lennon said, after turning in her witness card after midday. Others echoed Stevenson’s claim. An SB 3 opponent, Ginger Russell of Magnolia, told us she was the first person to turn in a witness card that morning yet ended up speaking about 2:30 p.m. ""There seemed to be no rhyme or reason"" about the order of witnesses, Russell said, adding that she’s sure people who signed up to speak after she’d submitted her card were called before she had her turn. Summer Wise, an Austin mother in favor of the legislation, told us she asked a committee aide if there was a particular order to the speakers and was told not. ""It appeared to be kind of random,"" Wise said. Proponent Russ Duerstine of San Angelo said he was called to testify after 4 p.m. after submitting his witness card before 9 a.m., which felt randomized. ""I do remember feeling like I had no clue who was going to be called next,"" Duerstine said. Felicia Miyakawa of Round Rock told us she left the committee her written testimony against SB 3 before leaving to pick up her son that afternoon. Miyakawa said before that, the first witnesses were mostly proponents and that when she asked a committee aide if there was a way for her name to be moved up, she was told that Taylor was setting the order. Gary Bingham of Mesquite, an SB 3 opponent, told us he submitted his request to speak shortly after 8 a.m. yet didn’t get called up before having to leave for a mid-afternoon flight. ""My suspicion is they stacked the deck the way the chairman wants it,"" Bingham said. ""I can’t prove that."" Senator unavailable for interview We reviewed those witness cards. Each card had a space for staff to record the time it was submitted. But no times were inked in. So we were unable to independently confirm what time Stevenson submitted her postcard-sized witness card where she wrote that she wished to testify against SB 3 on behalf of herself plus ""all 5 million TX public school children.""   We asked Taylor, R-Friendswood, to speak to us about how he organized the witnesses, but didn’t win the opportunity. Instead, Matt Welch, an Austin consultant to Taylor, responded partly by pointing out Senate rules demonstrating there isn’t a mandate that any committee hear from witnesses in order. In the Senate’s adopted rules for the 2017 legislative session, Rule 11.18 states that a committee or subcommittee ""chair shall afford reasonable opportunity to interested parties to appear and testify at the hearing."" Another part says: ""By majority vote, a committee may fix the order of appearance and time allotted for each witness at a public hearing."" However, Welch said by email that on Taylor’s watch, the committee hasn’t voted to ""fix"" any order of appearance. Welch noted, too, that the panel’s rules, which he shared, ""do not stipulate an order of witnesses nor is there a requirement that witnesses testify in the order of their witness card submission."" The rules are indeed silent on when witnesses should be called to speak; a rule says only that the chairman may limit testimony and discussion. Out of curiosity, we also inquired into how House committees handle witnesses. By email, Jason Embry, spokesman for House Speaker Joe Straus, said: ""The chairs of House committees have the discretion to decide the order of witnesses. Many House chairmen choose to call upon witnesses in the order in which they sign up."" The SB 3 hearing, Welch told us, was largely overseen by the panel’s vice chair, Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, because Taylor was the author of the proposal under review. Welch said a few invited experts led off the hearing. They were followed, he said, by witnesses called in the order they’d signed up in panels of four consisting of pairs supporting or opposing SB 3. Welch said: ""I don’t think it’s correct to say the whole hearing was randomized,"" in that the experts were not. ""Part of it was randomized, part of it was not."" Watching the hearing Seeking clues, we watched much of the Senate-posted hearing video, which showed up front Taylor announcing that each witness would have two minutes. The lead witnesses, we found, included advocates such as a former Wisconsin gubernatorial aide and delegates from the conservative Heritage Foundation and Charles Koch and Goldwater institutes. Also, all but one of eight initial witnesses backed SB 3; Donna Corbin of Lubbock, president of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, expressed opposition. And how did Corbin land that spotlight? By phone, the association’s Lonnie Hollingsworth said Corbin wasn’t an invited expert. Rather, he said, the association had alerted a committee clerk that Corbin had to catch a flight. Back to the video: In eight-plus hours of testimony after senators returned from a midday recess, people were called to testify mostly in groups of four. And by our count, before Stevenson was called to speak, followed by 25-plus others, the people who testified included 45 individuals speaking in support of Taylor’s measure, 29 opposed and a few speaking ""on"" his proposal. All told, according to the committee’s alphabetized list of individuals who testified, 67 witnesses ended up speaking in favor of SB 3, 40 expressed opposition and 12 testified without registering a position. In contrast, among 154 people listed as registering a position--most of whom didn't seek to testify--38 were in favor, 110 were against and six took no position, the list indicates. A little after 8 p.m., Lucio called Stevenson’s name. ""She won,"" Taylor then said from the committee dais. Lucio: ""You’ve been here all day."" Stevenson: ""I’ve been patient."" Our ruling Stevenson wrote that witnesses who signed up to testify before a Senate panel were called randomly regardless of when each person had submitted a card requesting to speak. She has a point. We confirmed witnesses were not called in the order they signed up and whatever method was used wasn’t made clear. From the standpoint of someone spending all day expecting to testify, ""random"" is a fair description. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CORRECTION, 1:58 p.m., April 14, 2017: This story was corrected to identify Ginger Russell as opposing the legislation.

Is Congress really less popular than hemorrhoids and herpes as Arnold Schwarzenegger claims?
"," Do voters really have a higher opinion of hemorrhoids -- hemorrhoids! -- than Congress? Do they really prefer root canals, traffic jams and colonoscopies over this branch of government? Really? That’s Arnold Schwarzenegger’s colorful claim from a February 2017 video that went viral. He repeated the allegations in an April 12, 2017 post on Facebook. In the video, he points out the deep disdain for Congress but also notes that nearly all members are re-elected due to what Schwarzenegger calls a rigged political redistricting system, or gerrymandering. Here’s his claim in its raw form: ""Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, cockroaches, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn’t beat herpes in the polls.""  The former California governor and movie star has vowed to raise awareness about gerrymandering now that’s he’s finished as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice and squashed rumors he might run for U.S. Senate. While we know approval ratings for Congress are low, we wondered if they’re really as pathetic as Schwarzenegger wants us to believe. We set out on a fact check. Our research This isn’t the first time we’ve checked Schwarzenegger’s claims on Congress and gerrymandering. In February, we rated as True his assertion that, ""The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%."" He was referring to the average percentage point victory for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election. We asked Schwarzenegger’s spokesman for evidence backing up his claim about Congress’ pitiful popularity. He pointed to results from surveys conducted by Public Policy Polling in January 2013 and October 2013. The polling company is known for conducting some tongue-in-cheek surveys and works with liberal clients. In the polls on Congress’ popularity, it asked hundreds of registered voters if they have a higher opinion of either Congress or a series of unpleasant or disliked things. Before we tackle those results, let’s look at Congress’ overall approval ratings in these recent PPP polls: -- January 2013: Congress’s overall favorability rating among voters was just 9 percent favorable and 85 percent unfavorable. -- October 2013: Congress’ overall favorability rating dipped slightly to 8  percent favorable with the same 85 percent unfavorable. -- March 2017: Congress’ overall favorability rating nudged up to 11 percent with only 68 percent of voters disapproving of it. Now, let’s tackle those head-to-head results: Hemorrhoids -- 53 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of hemorrhoids than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent in this matchup, according to the October 2013 survey Nickelback -- 39 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of the rock band Nickelback than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent Traffic jams -- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of traffic jams, than Congress, which was favored by only 34 percent Root canals -- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this dental procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent Colonoscopies -- 58 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this invasive procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent Herpes The PPP surveys didn’t ask about herpes. It did ask, however, about gonorrhea. And Congress was still less popular than that venereal disease. A spokesman for the company that produced Schwarzenegger’s video pointed to a 2011 CNN op-ed where comedian and radio show host Dean Obeidallah claimed Congress was less popular than herpes, without citing evidence. Our ruling Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed: ""Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn’t beat herpes in the polls."" Surveys by the Public Policy Polling mostly back-up Schwarzenegger’s dramatic claim. It should be noted, however, that the polls were conducted about four years ago and don’t include a comparison of Congress to herpes. Congress’ overall approval rating has remained in the dumps since that time, rising only slightly from 8 percent to 11 percent. It’s disapproval rating has, however, shrunk somewhat from 85 percent to 68 percent. We rate Schwarzenegger’s claim Mostly True.

Fake theory that Barack Obama hid millions of taxpayer dollars offshore started on parody site
","Former President Barack Obama somehow fleeced American taxpayers for millions of dollars and hid the money in offshore bank accounts using an alias, a fake news story claimed. ""Obama tax audit exposes MILLIONS in offshore accounts stolen from taxpayers,"" read the headline on an April 4, 2017, post on FederalistTribune.com. Facebook users flagged the story for possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. Out of the gate, we’ll note the story is fake. It said that the United States Treasury paid $411 million for ""Royalty Payments for Obamacare"" to a limited liability corporation owned by someone named Barry Soetero. The money was for the author of Obamacare for ""expenses and royalties associated with naming the bill."" The story said Obama was the bill’s author and therefore, he is the one collecting this $411 million. The conspiratorial implication is that Obama actually is Soetoro. (Soetoro is the name of Obama's stepfather, Lolo Soetoro.) FederalistTribune.com said the money was split among accounts in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Caledonia. That last one is actually the name the Roman Empire gave to the region that is now Scotland. Among other claims in the disjointed post is a citation for an April 4 missive on FreedomsFinalStand.com, which said Obama had denied using the Soetoro alias many times. FreedomsFinalStand.com said that these contrived royalty payments were stopped after Obamacare was renamed the Affordable Care Act. That’s a patently absurd assertion about the law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and was later dubbed Obamacare by skeptical Republicans to taunt Obama. But let’s go back even farther: It appears this post first breached the Internet as a March 11 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site we know was designed to troll conservatives with faux news made up to stoke ire on political issues. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. The site’s articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, usually without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, either. But its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" It’s difficult to say whether the other sites are in on the joke or not. FederalistTribune.com’s Contact Us link doesn’t seem to perform any action, and FreedomsFinalStand.com doesn’t appear to have contact information at all. Both sites are privately registered, with no personal contact information.

How many people die every day from drug overdoses in North Carolina?
","The fight to limit the availability of prescription painkillers in North Carolina is being led in part by the only medical doctor in the N.C. General Assembly. Rep. Greg Murphy, a Republican from Greenville who is also a urology surgeon, is the primary sponsor of what’s being called the STOP Act. That stands for ""Strengthen Opioid Misuse Prevention."" In the past several weeks, he has promoted his bill with a sobering statistic. ""Every day, four North Carolinians die from a medication or drug overdose,"" Murphy said in early March, when he first introduced the bill. ""I prescribe these medications daily and I see the problem first hand."" Murphy has often been quoted or paraphrased in the news repeating some version of that claim about the deadliness of drug overdoses, most recently on Monday when the bill passed the House of Representatives unanimously. It’s a popular argument for a popular bill, which has support from lawmakers of both parties as well as a vocal ally in Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein. In addition to other provisions, the bill would reduce the amount of pain pills a doctor could prescribe to most patients on their initial visits. The idea is that fewer pills will lead to fewer opportunities for abuse or addiction. The STOP Act passed the N.C. House 114-0 and is now in the Senate. But we wondered whether the morbid statistic that’s driving much of the conversation is actually correct. How deadly are prescription pills? In 2015, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, 1,370 people died of unintentional poisonings. Of those deaths, 93 percent (1,274) were drug overdoses – everything from painkillers to cocaine to heroin. That’s an average of 3.5 deaths daily, which is in line with Murphy’s claim of four a day. Nearly the same number of people died in 2015 from unintentional drug overdoses as died from gunshots. If you also include intentional overdoses, then drugs were deadlier than both guns and car crashes. A 2016 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study found the counties with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths are all in western or southeastern North Carolina. But even though Murphy phrased his claim broadly about all drug overdoses, his bill doesn’t target street drugs like cocaine and heroin. The STOP Act is only aimed at limiting the supply of prescription painkillers. Prescription pills were involved in 738 unintentional overdose deaths in 2015. That’s two a day – certainly troubling, but only about half of Murphy’s claim. However, experts agree there’s a strong link between painkillers and heroin, since they give the same type of high, and heroin tends to be cheaper and more widely available to addicts. ""When we talk to people who are injecting heroin, they all got there through prescription opioids,"" said Steve Marshall, an epidemiologist and director of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Injury Prevention Research Center. ""It's not some of them. It's all of them."" Marshall said it would be fair for Murphy to count heroin overdose deaths when promoting the STOP Act, if not cocaine overdose deaths. Cocaine, unlike heroin and painkillers, is not an opioid. Just under 1,000 North Carolinians died from an unintentional opioid overdose in 2015 (see here for county-level data). That’s an average of 2.7 per day – again, not exactly what Murphy said, but not far off. Last year California medical company Castlight Health ranked four North Carolina cities among the top 25 nationwide for painkiller abuse. Wilmington, the company’s study said, had the country’s highest rate of opioid abuse. The report found more than half of the prescriptions issued for painkillers in Wilmington are being abused. Kay Sanford, another UNC-Chapel Hill epidemiologist, is credited with discovering the rising trend of prescription pill addiction and overdoses in North Carolina in the early 2000s. She said many people have been replacing painkillers with heroin in the last few years. ""The number of people dying from prescription opioids, in North Carolina and nationwide, has gone down while the number of people dying from heroin has gone up,"" Sanford said. ""So when you combine those two, it's basically the same number."" Yet in Murphy’s favor, at least one piece of brand-new research has made the argument that cocaine should be included in these counts, too. In February researchers with several federal government agencies published a paper that argued cocaine overdoses can be linked back to the increased use of opioids like painkillers. ""Opioids, primarily heroin and synthetic opioids, have been driving the recent increase in cocaine-related overdose deaths,"" the study concluded. Our ruling Rep. Greg Murphy has been promoting his STOP Act, which would limit access to prescription painkillers, by saying that drug overdoses kill four people a day in North Carolina. That’s basically accurate (it’s 3.5 per day) but prescription pills alone are only responsible for 2 deaths a day – half of what Murphy said. However, there’s wide agreement in the scientific community that for such counts it makes sense to lump heroin and painkillers together (which cause 2.7 deaths a day) and some research has argued for including cocaine deaths, too. Even if his statistics are slightly inflated, Murphy’s general point – that opioid addiction is leading to multiple deaths per day in North Carolina – is correct. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809749FB80>],/factchecks/2017/apr/13/greg-murphy/how-many-people-die-every-day-drug-overdoses-north/

As possible re-election run looms, Scott Walker says Wisconsin economy is best it's been since 2000
","A boast Gov. Scott Walker made in his weekly radio address on March 23, 2017 sounded like one he’ll repeat -- if he runs for re-election in 2018, which is widely expected. After his standard, ""Hi, Scott Walker here"" greeting, the second-term Republican declared: ""Wisconsin’s economy is in the best shape it’s been since 2000."" It’s a bold, broad claim. Is it right? The measures On the radio, Walker backed his claim with one of his favorite statistics -- the state’s unemployment rate. It had just dropped to 3.7 percent in February 2017, the lowest since November 2000. Though important, the unemployment rate is but a single measure of the economy. When we asked for any other information to support the claim, his staff primarily cited declines in overall tax burden, income taxes and property taxes, saying ""a competitive tax environment sets the stage for economic growth and simply allows households to keep more of their own money."" But taxes are more a measure of the health and size of government, not how well the economy is doing. Indeed, when we asked six Wisconsin economics professors for advice on how to evaluate Walker’s claim, none cited any tax-related measure. With guidance from the experts and other sources, we settled on these six measures: Unemployment rate Labor participation rate Average weekly wages Average income for top earners vs rest of the population Gross domestic product per capita Poverty rate We’ll address them two at a time. Unemployment and employment Unemployment rate: Percentage of people in the labor force -- the civilian population ages 16 and older -- who are unemployed. Unemployment in Wisconsin was low in 2000 and it’s low again. The rate generally rose from 2000 to 2003, then dipped from 2003 to 2008, before peaking at around 9 percent in the second half of 2009 and early 2010. Since, then has steadily declined. Walker was correct in saying that the 3.7 percent rate in February 2017 was the lowest monthly rate since November 2000. (It was as low as 3.2 percent in January and February of 2000). Labor participation rate: Percentage of the population that is either working or actively seeking work -- excluding people such as college students and retirees. The labor participation rate is important because it takes into account people who are unemployed plus so-called discouraged workers -- those who are unemployed and not looking for work. The figures show labor participation in Wisconsin is declining. During 2000 and into 2001, the rate generally rose a bit, hitting 73.3 percent in March 2001. But since then, it’s been on a downward slope, hitting 68.3 percent in February 2017. That means fewer people are in the workforce. The takeaway: Unemployment backs Walker’s claim; labor participation does not. Wages and income Real average weekly wage: What a person (in the private sector) is paid for working, adjusted for inflation, including not only regular wages but pay such as bonuses. Wages in Wisconsin have generally been on an upward trend. The figures are reported quarterly, but since they tend to vary by season (summer vs winter, for example), we looked at annual numbers. On that basis, the average weekly wage rose from 2000 to 2004, and then rose and fell until 2011. Since then it’s been on the rise, hitting $896 in 2015, the last year for which annual data are available. That’s higher than any year going back to 2000. Income distribution: How much more income is earned by people near the top of the scale versus the rest of the population. Income includes not only wages, but also money from sources such as investments and welfare benefits. In Wisconsin, the gap between people near the top of the income scale and the rest of the population is growing. We compared the average income of a person in the top 10 percent versus a person in the bottom 90 percent -- in other words, people near the top versus the rest of the population, taking inflation into account. In 2013, the latest data available for this comparison, the annual income for the average person in the top 10 percent was $234,916. That’s 6.7 times more than the average income in the bottom 90 percent, which was $35,102. That ratio has generally increased since 2000, when it was 6.0. The takeaway: Average wages back Walker’s claim, since they’re up; but income distribution doesn’t, given that the gap is growing between the relatively few people on the top end of the scale and everyone else. Productivity and poverty Real GDP per capita: Total value of goods and services produced, divided by the population and adjusted for inflation. Gross domestic product per person in Wisconsin, taking into account inflation, rose from 2000 to 2006, dropped from then until 2009, and has been on the rise since. The latest figure, for 2015, showed real GDP at $46,893 per person -- higher than any previous year going back to 2000, when it was $41,911. Poverty rate: Percentage of people below the official poverty threshold. Poverty is calculated based on a person’s income from sources such as wages, Social Security and child support, as well as from ""cash"" government benefits such as public assistance and unemployment insurance. The poverty threshold for 2015, the most recent year available for this comparison, was $12,082 for a single person and $24,257 for a family of four. In Wisconsin, the poverty rate has trended upward. The 2015 rate was 11.4 percent. That’s higher than every year going back 2000 except for two (12.4 percent in 2004 and 13.1 percent in 2011). The takeaway: GDP helps Walker’s claim; poverty does not. Summing up As we’ve noted in previous fact checks, governors have some impact on a state’s economy, but many other factors, including national trends, are at work. In this instance, Walker didn’t explicitly take credit for what he says is a better economy, though he implies it. The economists we consulted see some improvements and some declines in how Wisconsin’s economy is now compared to 2000. ""The economic portrait of Wisconsin since 2000 is mixed at best,"" said Lawrence University’s Merton Finkler. ""Clearly, the Wisconsin economy is not as dynamic as some others, such as Minnesota's. Part of the reason is that it has done a relatively poor job of encouraging startup enterprises, which tend to grow employment faster than larger and older firms."" Said Andrew Reschovsky at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: ""A growing economy is characterized by rising real per capita GDP and rising real wages. This growth is to be expected, and reflects increased labor productivity over time. Although Wisconsin’s economy is larger now than it was in 2000, the fact that the poverty rate is higher and that there is growing income inequality indicates that the benefits of our growing economy have gone mainly to those with the highest incomes."" Our rating Walker said: ""Wisconsin’s economy is in the best shape it’s been since 2000."" The latest figures for the unemployment rate, wages and gross domestic product support Walker’s claim. But the figures for labor participation rate, income and poverty do not. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

Fake news that Pelosi had a breakdown credited to a familiar troll
","A bogus story that said House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D.-Calif, suffered ""a psychotic break from reality"" appeared to have come from a website run by a well-known fake news operator and liberal troll. The headline on a June 14, 2017, post on FreedomCrossroads.us declared, ""Nancy Pelosi suffers breakdown, taken from Capitol Hill on a stretcher."" Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The brief post said that Pelosi ""was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda"" and quoted the unmistakably fake Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, the alleged head of psychiatry, as saying Pelosi may not recover. There is absolutely no proof this incident happened, of course, and a Pelosi spokesman had no comment. The image used at the top of the story is taken from NBC footage recorded after a shooting at the Capitol on March 28, 2016. But FreedomCrossroads.us had a familiar feel to it — it shared a design template with TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site responsible for literally hundreds of fake news stories popping up across the Internet. That site was run by a man named Christopher Blair, who has told us he was a self-described liberal troll living in Maine.

The Pants on Fire claim that Ossoff supporters celebrated violence against GOP
","An attack ad released on the eve of Georgia’s special House election claims Democrat Jon Ossoff has the support of ""unhinged leftists"" who celebrated the shooting of Republican lawmakers. The video, from a group calling itself Principled PAC, opens with the sound of gunfire over footage of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., being wheeled on a stretcher. Scalise was critically wounded in the June 14 attack on a GOP congressional baseball practice that left five others with gunshot wounds and the shooter dead. ""The unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans,"" states the ad, which was viewed more than 86,000 times on YouTube since June 18. ""When will it stop? It won’t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday, because the same unhinged leftists cheering last week's shooting are all backing Jon Ossoff.""  Republican Karen Handel, Ossoff’s opponent in the June 20 race, condemned the ad. Handel campaign aide Kate Constantini said the group behind the video ""should be ashamed,"" and denounced efforts to use the recent shooting for political gain. The premise of the ad is alarming and incorrect. We searched for evidence of applause for the shooting and came up empty. There is a further lack of evidence that those cheerleaders are then supporting Ossoff. Principled PAC did not respond to requests for explanation. Recent events, partly connected to the Alexandria, Va., ballpark shooting, have set the historically Republican district in northern Atlanta on edge. On the same day James Hodgkinson attacked GOP congressmen, reports surfaced showing Hodgkinson had previously posted a rant against Karen Handel on Facebook. Hodgkinson had slammed Handel for her opposition to increasing the minimum wage in a profanity-laced tirade he posted a week before the mass shooting. Handel called for calm and unity in response to those reports. ""We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way,"" she said in a statement.  The following day, Handel and her neighbors received suspicious packages at their homes containing threatening letters and an unidentified white powder substance. A letter Handel’s neighbor shared with the media told the recipient to ""resist the fascist takeover,"" and appeared to borrow Marxist language, condemning the ""bourgeoisie."" It’s not clear who sent the package, but a neighbor told Fox 5 Atlanta it had a Greenville, S.C., shipping address. There is no evidence it was mailed by someone who supports Ossoff, or has any connection to the Democratic nominee. If the ad writers had this news in mind, they jumped to a connection that was not based in proof. The same day Handel received the suspicious package, Ossoff revealed in a statement that he too had received threats against him, and had hired bodyguards for protection. Meantime, some residents of the district said they’re too scared to put out a yard sign for fear of retribution. Adding to the toxicity of the election, the most expensive House race in history, the chairman of the Republican Party in the neighboring 11th Congressional District predicted the shooting of GOP lawmakers would hand Republicans a win. A spokesman for Principled PAC described the shooting as a ""political assassination attempt"" fueled by rabid talk by the ""left"" in an email to the Washington Examiner. ""Wednesday's shooting, in stark contrast to a random act of violence, was a political assassination attempt driven by the left's rabid, unhinged rhetoric, so Americans should take a hard look at the ramifications of politically motivated violence,"" Noel Fritsch told the Examiner. Principled PAC said, ""The same unhinged leftists cheering last week's shooting are all backing Jon Ossoff."" For any statement we fact-check, the speaker carries the burden of proof. Principled PAC did not respond to multiple requests seeking information to support its incendiary claim linking Ossoff to a celebration of violence against Republicans. We were unable to find a single example of someone cheering the recent shooting of Republican lawmakers and voicing support for Ossoff. We rate Principled PAC’s statement Pants on Fire!

Claim that Trump welcomes Jamaica as a U.S. territory is fake news
","An undated post on CNewsGo.com claimed that President Donald Trump had finally confirmed the rumor of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory, but the story continues to be nothing more than a hoax. The unnamed author claimed Jamaica has become a permanently inhabited territory of the United States with its own organized government as determined by an Organic Act passed by Congress. There is no date provided for the decision, and we could not find any legislation relating to such news. This is because Jamaica is its own country, declaring its independence from the United Kingdom and creating its own constitution in 1962. The United States then established diplomatic relations with the country and has maintained them to this day. Trump met with Jamaican Ambassador to the United States Audrey Marks in early April, when they discussed bilateral trade, but they made no mention of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory. This story seems to prey on common geographical ignorance; we couldn’t help noticing during our research that a frequently googled question is whether Jamaica is located in the United States. The fourth-largest island in the Caribbean is in fact located about 90 miles south of Cuba. The country does not require visas for visits under six months, but it does require passports from U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The rumor dates back to February of this year, when Mediamaxzone.com reported falsely that the Jamaican prime minister had hinted Jamaica would become a U.S. territory. While it has been circulating for a while, it’s time we shed light on this hoax.

Anti-Ossoff ad in Georgia House race distorts lines from Obama's book
","In the most expensive congressional race ever, outside groups are making a final push to move the needle in what’s expected to be a very close contest between Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff in a suburban district north of Atlanta. Great America Alliance, a pro-Trump organization, lofted a radio ad aimed at cutting African-American turnout for Ossoff. In the ad, black conservative Autry Pruitt warned African-Americans against being taken for granted by Democrats, using the words of the first black president to make his point. Here’s the text: ""Hi, my name is Autry Pruitt, a fellow black American working hard every day, just like you. It may seem out of season, but all of a sudden, Democratic politicians have started coming around again. We normally only see them every other November, swarming around and making promises to get our vote. But nothing ever changes for us, does it? Here's what President Barack Obama had to say about it:"" Obama: ""A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey."" ""Let's not sell out for another Christmas turkey. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The Democrats keep taking our votes for granted."" Did Obama really complain that Democratic politicians only pay attention to African-Americans when they need their votes? No. The voice is Obama’s, but the words were not his. They came from Obama reading from his book Dreams From My Father about his first days in Chicago. He’s quoting a barber named Smitty talking about Chicago’s first black mayor, Harold Washington. A sentence before the book excerpt that appeared in the radio ad gives those words a different meaning. Smitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington. Here’s how the scene plays in the book: ""Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city,"" Smitty said. ""Before Harold, seemed like we’d always be second-class citizens."" ""Plantation politics,"" the man with the newspaper said. ""That’s just what it was, too,"" Smitty said. ""A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. White folks spitting in our faces, and we’d reward ‘em with the vote."" In the book, Obama went on to describe the power of African-Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified. ""They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old. And their faith had been rewarded,"" Obama wrote. In Smitty’s words, ""When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life."" In contrast to the suggested meaning in the ad, the passage is about the good things that come from voting. Through a Great America Alliance spokesman, Pruitt rejected the idea that he had cited Obama out of context. ""The clip of President Obama was absolutely in context on this issue and helps make our point in the ad, which is why we used it,"" Pruitt said. Great America Alliance said that Obama complained that Democrats continue to ignore blacks except at election time. Obama did say the words used in the ad, but they weren’t his. He was quoting a Chicago barber talking about the days before African-Americans in Chicago helped elect the city’s first black mayor. The full text from Obama’s book shows that he was arguing that voting can make a difference. Nothing in the section suggests that he thinks Democrats today only pay attention to blacks at election time.

Donald Trump tweet on 50% approval cherry-picks polling data
","President Donald Trump opened his first Father’s Day as president with a bright-and-early boast about his poll numbers. ""The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating. That's higher than O's #'s!"" The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s! Rasmussen Reports retweeted the president’s message (and so did more than 21,000 other accounts) despite some questionable logic. Among pollsters, Rasmussen has consistently published higher approval ratings for Trump than its peers that track presidential job approval among Americans. Its June 13-15 poll of 1,500 likely voters did show 50 percent job approval for Trump, with a sampling margin of error of 3 percent. His numbers hadn’t hit the 50 percent-mark since late April, according to Rasmussen’s approval index history. Rasmussen’s numbers are atypical of the polls that have surveyed Trump’s approval ratings. The next-closest results were still pretty far from 50 percent. An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 registered voters from June 11-13 showed 42 percent approval. A June 9-15 Survey Monkey poll of adults showed 43 percent. Gallup, which polls all adults on a three-day rolling basis, most recently showed 39 percent approval. When you look at polling more broadly, Rasmussen really sticks out. The RealClearPolitics.com average of polls from May 30-June 17 shows 40 percent job approval -- a full 10 percentage points lower than the rate Trump touted in his tweet. FiveThirtyEight performs a similar comprehensive reflection of polling data, and it came in even lower -- 38.7 percent approval (and 55.4 percent disapproval) by Trump’s 150th day in office. What about Trump’s assertion that Obama fared more poorly? It’s not the case if you use the most apples-to-apples comparison: Rasmussen’s own polling at this stage of his presidency. Rasmussen’s results for Obama during the same period in June 2009 do not show an approval rating below Trump’s 50 percent. Obama’s approval ratings were between 54 and 58 percent through June 9-16, 2009, and they did not dip below 50 percent until late July of that year. Gallup’s tracking of Obama’s job performance showed a higher mark of 60 percent approval at that time. Of course, Obama’s approval rating did dip below the high 50s later in his presidency. Obama’s ratings in the Rasmussen poll did consistently fall below 50 percent from the fall of 2009 to the summer of 2012, and again from the summer of 2013 to the spring of 2016. However, experts caution that it’s most appropriate to compare presidents’ approval ratings at the same point in their presidency. Historically, most presidents have tended to have higher approval ratings early in the ""honeymoon"" period of their tenure before they sink, as some voters begin to tire of their policies. In addition, Obama periodically did reach 50 percent or more in Rasmussen polls even during his weaker periods, and when he didn’t, he was often within a point or two of that mark. This means it’s possible to do some reverse cherry-picking that makes Obama look better than Trump. Trump’s overall polling right now is far below what all past presidents have polled at an equivalent point in their first term. (Here’s a comparison of Gallup approval ratings for Trump’s predecessors, going back to Harry Truman.) One reason why Rasmussen has shown higher ratings for Trump stems from its methodology. For one, it polls likely voters. Registered voters tend to offer higher job approval than surveys of adults more generally. And surveys of likely voters -- Rasmussen’s approach -- offer higher job approval ratings still. ""As we move from all Americans, to registered voters, to likely voters, and to actual voters, the sample becomes more educated, more wealthy, and more Republican,"" said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""Statistical weighting can reduce the bias. Rasmussen weights, but we know little about Rasmussen’s weighting procedures. The details matter."" Meanwhile, polls that use live callers have been showing lower approval ratings than polls conducted by online or automated survey. Rasmussen uses automated surveys. ""Automated polls only call landlines, which means they miss the roughly half (!!) of the American population that uses mobile phones only,"" FiveThirtyEight editor in chief Nate Silver wrote in February. ""This matters because cell-only individuals tend to be younger, lower income, and more urban, all of which bias landline-only surveys in a conservative direction,"" Smith said. Each of these factors help explain the higher results for Rasmussen in Trump’s favor. We reached out to Rasmussen but did not hear back by deadline. Finally, what to make of Trump’s implication that Rasmussen should be more trusted because it was more accurate than other pollsters about the 2016 election? The strongest evidence comes from looking at the final pre-election national polls. According to the rundown in RealClearPolitics, Rasmussen was the only pollster to get the popular vote result -- a two-point Hillary Clinton win -- correct in its final pre-election poll. Two pollsters (Monmouth University and NBC News/Survey Monkey) had Clinton winning by six points; four (ABC News/Washington Post, CBS News, Fox News, and Economist/YouGov) had Clinton winning by four, two (Bloomberg and Reuters/Ipsos) had Clinton winning by three, one (IBD/TIPP) had Trump winning by two, and one had Trump winning by five (Los Angeles Times/USC). However, it’s worth taking this with a grain of salt. First, the polls that had Clinton winning by two or three points were all very close to the mark once margins of error are taken into account. And second, Rasmussen was lucky to have its two-point margin come during the final pre-election poll. During the last week before the election, its daily results were scattered -- Clinton by three, tie, tie, Trump by three, tie, and Clinton by two. Overall, FiveThirtyEight’s comprehensive pollster ratings gives Rasmussen the mediocre grade of C-plus, and it found a two-point Republican bias in its polls. (This rating did not encompass the entire 2016 campaign, but it did go back earlier; it factored in 657 polls by Rasmussen.) Of course, Trump would not be the first president to tout an outlying poll result. ""It is hardly new that presidents choose to talk about polls that support their view of the world and themselves,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. Trump said, ""The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s!"" There’s a grain of truth here: Rasmussen did put out that result two days before Trump’s tweet, and Rasmussen was closest to the mark among pollsters in its final pre-election survey. However, Trump has engaged in some serious cherry-picking. Other polling in this time frame shows approval ratings for Trump that are seven to 11 percentage points below Rasmussen’s finding. And contrary to Trump’s assertion, Obama’s numbers in the same poll at the same point in his presidency were higher than Trump’s current results. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097383580>],/factchecks/2017/jun/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-tweet-50-approval-cherry-picks-pollin/

Did Saudis spend money on Trump hotels? Yes
","Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said foreign governments are trying to curry favor with the president of the United States, and they’re using Trump International Hotel to do it. ""Just one example: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose government has important business and policy before the president of the United States, has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel,"" Racine said. Racine and Attorney General Brian Frosh of Maryland on June 12 announced that they had filed a lawsuit in federal court against Donald Trump for violating the Constitution’s anti-corruption provisions known as the emoluments clause. The emoluments clause bars the president from receiving gifts or payments from foreign government without the permission of Congress. It’s a question for the courts whether the Saudi government using a Trump hotel violates that rule. We wanted to dig into the details of how the lawsuit determined that the Saudi government had indeed spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel. Racine’s office directed us to disclosures made by an agent representing the embassy of Saudi Arabia in the Foreign Agent Registration Act report filed with the U.S. Justice Department. The act requires that people acting as agents of foreign countries disclose their relationship, as well as their activities and spending. They also directed us to the lawsuit, which mentions various other instances of foreign government officials either shifting pre-planned events to Trump International Hotel or making use of its services. The Foreign Agent Registration Act report filed by MSL Group Americas, Inc, a global public relations firm is for the period from October 2016 to March 2017. It lists Saudi Arabia, China, and Equatorial Guinea as its clients, and Bahrain as former clients. The filings say that Qorvis MSL Group, a lobbying firm, paid approximately $270,000 at the Trump International Hotel. Of this, $190,272.87 was for lodging, $78,204.02 for catering and $1,568 for parking on behalf of the Saudi government.  The group was hired by the Saudi government to lobby against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) and managing a grassroots campaign against it, including coordinating visits by veterans to Capitol Hill to oppose the bill. There are several media reports about the Saudis spending $270,000 at the Trump International Hotel with one mentioning how veterans were offered free stays at the hotel, where a standard room costs $500.   The trip for veterans to Washington was part of a plan funded by the Saudi government to recruit veterans to oppose the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) and speak with lawmakers. Under JASTA, Americans can sue foreign governments for acts of terrorism on American soil. Congress overrode a veto from then-President Barack Obama to enact the law in September 2016. Later that year, Republican lawmakers John McCain and Lindsey Graham introduced an amendment to the act so that foreign governments would face lawsuits only if they knowingly supported terrorism, but the amendment was unsuccessful. Although it is difficult to determine from the filings the exact dates the payments were made to the Trump hotel, a Wall Street Journal story quoted a MSL group executive as saying that most were made before Trump became president while some were made after he was elected. Racine said the Saudi government has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the Trump International Hotel. The Foreign Agent Registration Act report mentions at least one filing which clearly shows that the Saudi government spent $270,000 at the Trump International Hotel for lodging and boarding expenses between October 2016 and March 2017.

Ivanka Trump right about role of 'skills gap' in unfilled jobs
","During an interview with Fox & Friends, Ivanka Trump discussed one of the challenges of the current economy -- that job vacancies exist, but many people who aren’t working aren’t qualified to fill them. Her comments came during a week that the White House had devoted to messages about the American workforce. ""There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap,"" she said. When we took a closer look, we found that Trump was generally on target, but that the impact of the ""skills gap"" -- the fact that many potential workers don’t have the right qualifications to take jobs that are currently open -- is worth some explanation. On the numerical side, Trump was spot-on. Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data from a survey called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. One of the key statistics in the survey is job openings nationally. In the most recent month for which data is available -- April 2017 -- the survey found 6,044,000 job openings across the country. That represents the first time this statistic has ever crossed the 6 million line, going back to the earliest data reported in 2000.  Since a measure of the raw number of job openings is affected by overall population growth over time, we’ll also note that the rate of job openings -- which is adjusted for the size of the U.S. population -- also tied a record in April, reaching a level equaled only in two previous months going back to 2000. So Trump has accurately portrayed the scale of how many jobs are available today in the United States. Trump used cautious wording; Economists agree that a mismatch of skills is clearly a ""part"" of the problem, as she put it. That said, they cautioned against making the oversimplified argument that the skills gap underlies all 6 million job openings. On the one hand, ""some of the current job vacancies are unquestionably due to the skills gap,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""If job-seeking jobless workers and promotion-seeking but under-employed workers had exactly the right skills, many of the current job vacancies could be filled faster."" At the same time, for many job openings, the barrier isn’t necessarily the lack of a college degree or specialized training, he said. In many cases, the ""barrier"" can be overcome with on-the-job training and experience. ""There are many job openings with more modest skill requirements,"" Burtless said. ""They require the new hire to learn some extra skills to become more proficient and productive in their new jobs. A large percentage of job seekers have the capacity to learn those skills on the job pretty quickly."" He added that ""employers who think every job opening can be filled immediately and with a perfectly trained worker are either living in a dream world or living through a Great Depression in which millions of highly trained workers are desperately seeking a job."" The reality, he said, is that ""for most current job vacancies, the skill set of today’s job seekers is sufficient to fill the great majority of the vacancies."" Another economist, Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute, has testified that for many manufacturing jobs, a drag on hiring comes not only from a skills gap but also an ""image gap."" Millennials in particular, she said, may have a ""tainted"" image of what high-tech manufacturing jobs look like today, assuming instead that they are like such jobs decades ago -- ""dirty, grimy, repetitive or dangerous."" Survey data shows that ""many workers are no longer interested in manufacturing jobs and there appears to be a stigma attached to manufacturing work,"" she wrote. ""Few parents want their children to work in this industry, and manufacturing is the last career choice for people between the ages of 19 and 33."" In an interview, Mathur said it’s difficult to tease out how much of a factor the skills gap is in today’s job openings. She suggested that it may be the biggest factor -- but she also cautioned that the image gap is particularly significant for younger workers and added that other issues exist as well, including an unwillingness among some Americans to relocate to areas with jobs. And of course, even in an efficiently humming economy, any survey taken at a given point in time will find many jobs that are simply open due to transition, or what economists call ""churn."" Many of these job openings will be due to happenstance rather than structural problems with the skills gap. Trump said, ""There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap."" The number she cites is correct, and she’s right to say that the skills gap plays a role. Economists warn against overestimating the role played by the skills gap in all 6 million job openings, both because other factors play a role (such as the image gap) and because the skills barriers posed are often more modest than having to earn an academic degree or to obtain specialized training. We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C99E80>],/factchecks/2017/jun/16/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-mostly-right-role-skills-gap-unfilled/

Loretta Lynch did not call for 'violence and murder,' 'blood and death in streets'
","The shootings of congressional Republican baseball players by a drifter fan of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., triggered outrage among conservative media. Infowars, the conspiracy website of Alex Jones, accused top Democrats of instigating this sort of violence. The June 14 headline basically said it all: ""FLASHBACK: Tim Kaine, Loretta Lynch Called For Blood and Death In Streets."" The article said Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential candidate, and Lynch, Barack Obama's former attorney general, were part of ""a stunning collection of calls to violence and murder from the intolerant, unhinged leftists in the Democrat party, mainstream media, Hollywood, and the spider web of interwoven organizations and cabals like Antifa and Black Lives Matter who have effectively transformed into domestic terrorists in Trump’s America."" Regarding Lynch, Infowars said she used ""incendiary language in a bizarre one-minute video in which she seemed to call upon fellow ‘progressives’ to march, bleed, and die in the streets ... in resistance to the Trump agenda."" This fact-check focuses on the Lynch allegations and whether the video shows what Infowars said it does. On Feb. 28, 2017, the Senate Democrats posted a video on its Facebook page with the introduction, ""If you need to hear some words of inspiration tonight, take a moment for our friend, former Attorney General, Loretta E. Lynch."" It’s not clear when or where Lynch was speaking, but she seems to speaking in the context of President Donald Trump’s recent inauguration. While she never mentioned Trump, the video went up a few hours before Trump would address a joint session of Congress. About a week before the video, the Homeland Security Department implemented tough new policies on deportations. The Trump administration undid civil rights protections for transgender students. Both ran counter to Obama era policies. Here’s the full text from Lynch: ""I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it’s a time of concern for people who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on, and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our founding fathers. And it has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals, who have made the difference. They’ve marched, they’ve bled — yes, some of them have died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before; we can do this again."" On the face of it, Lynch didn’t say what Infowars asserted. She didn’t call for anyone to commit violence. The violence she described was inflicted on those who marched to defend the rights of individuals. She said they bled and they died. She didn’t say they caused others to bleed or others to die. The Infowars web post recycled virtually identical claims that ran in early March from many conservative corners, including Fox News, Bill O’Reilly (then a Fox News host), and WND. A fact-check from the conservative Daily Caller website also declared the Infowars article false. Infowars said Lynch advocated ""violence and murder."" She did not. She said that people who have marched for political change have bled and been killed. That would be the opposite of what Infowars said.

No evidence Sarah Palin’s PAC incited shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords
","After a lone gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers June 14 while they practiced baseball, the New York Times published an editorial that broadly condemned political violence but sparked controversy with a claim about the motive behind a 2011 attack on a Democratic member of Congress. The New York Times has since issued a correction following broad criticism. The original editorial claimed that maps circulated by Sarah Palin's PAC amounted to ""political incitement,"" which the authors said was clearly linked to the subsequent 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz. ""In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear,"" the uncorrected editorial read. ""Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs."" The editorial, penned amid the frenzy of the mass shooting, sought to connect the attack on GOP lawmakers with the 2011 Giffords shooting to make a broader point about politically motivated violence. The piece reasoned that the latest attack, which left the gunman dead and four injured, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R–La., was probably ""evidence of how vicious American politics has become,"" and that the shooter’s derangement ""found its fuel in politics."" The editorial ran into trouble when it turned its focus to the Giffords shooting, so we decided to explore why the connection between Palin’s PAC and Loughner’s motivation is problematic. According to news reports, Loughner became fixated on Giffords several years before his Jan. 8, 2011, shooting rampage that killed six and injured 14, including the Arizona congresswoman. Loughner first met Giffords in 2007 at a community event where he asked her a question and was ""unsatisfied with her answer,"" CNN reported. It was at this point he developed a fixation for the lawmaker. Several years elapsed between the time Loughner first met Giffords and when Palin posted a note to Facebook that linked to her political action committee. The PAC circulated a map of House Democrats' districts (not individual members) the GOP would seek to recapture.  According to the Washington Post, there is no evidence Loughner was aware of Palin's maps. And according to an interview with one of Loughner's high school friends, the gunman did not watch the news. His rampage was akin to ""shooting at the world,"" said Loughner’s friend Zach Osler. Loughner was ultimately sentenced to serve seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years, without the possibility of parole. The uncorrected editorial appeared in today’s print version of the newspaper, and was available online between roughly 9 p.m. June 14 and 10 a.m. June 15, a spokesperson said. At some point before 11 a.m. this morning, staffers removed the language about the clear link between political incitement and Giffords’ shooting, and issued the following correction: ""An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords,"" the correction reads. ""In fact, no such link was established."" The New York Times’ Opinion twitter account also issued a pair of mea culpas. ""We got an important fact wrong, incorrectly linking political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Giffords. No link was ever established,"" read the first tweet from the NYT Opinion account.  We're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake. We've corrected the editorial. https://t.co/t1FZ3iEYQJ pic.twitter.com/k7WW5uJIQO A follow-up tweet read: ""We're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake. We've corrected the editorial."" Around 4 p.m., the New York Times amended its correction to clarify its description of the maps distributed by Sarah Palin’s political action committee. ""The editorial has also been updated to clarify that in a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting, electoral districts, not Democratic lawmakers, were depicted beneath stylized cross hairs,"" it read. The New York Times editorial board said a political map circulated by Palin’s PAC incited Rep. Gabby Giffords’ shooting. We were unable to find evidence Loughner was even aware of the maps, and a friend told an interviewer Loughner did not closely watch the news.   The New York Times corrected its story some 13 hours after publication to say no such link has been established between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Giffords.

Maxine Waters has not skipped 90 percent of congressional meetings

""Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS,"" read the headline on a June 7, 2017, post on TeddyStick.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The website, which doesn’t list contact information and has hidden its registration data, attacked Waters, an African-American woman, for allegedly inciting racial strife and refusing to do her job. The writer, who is credited on the post as Sam Di Gangi, wrote: ""Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that 'Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.' "" The source is simply a Reddit thread from June 7, 2017, which contains no evidence at all. It’s just a series of comments posted on Reddit’s ""the_donald"" forum. We contacted a Waters spokesman, who chose not to comment. Waters is a long-serving legislator, but she hasn’t been in Congress for 35 years. She first started representing a California district in 1991, so she’s been in Washington for 26 years. She became a state legislator in 1977 and served until joining the U.S. House of Representatives, which amounts to 40 years of lawmaking experience. Beyond that, it’s wrong to say Waters missed 90 percent of her ""congressional meetings,"" even though exactly how those those meetings are defined isn’t specified. It’s possible the post referred to her voting record, but that would be way off. As a commenter on the Reddit thread noted, GovTrack.us notes Waters has missed 7.6 percent of her votes since January 1991. That’s higher than the 2.2 percent average among all House members, but nowhere near a 90 percent absentee rate. The statistic also could mean all her committee meetings, but that isn’t right, either. Of course, no member of Congress attends every single hearing, but the Washington Examiner did analyze meeting records for members of Congress in 2014. Waters was not among the 20 highest absentee rates, which was comprised of 12 Republicans and eight Democrats. U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas, D-Mass., came in first, missing 96 percent of hearings in the Examiner’s analysis. We spot-checked Waters’ 2015-16 record as ranking member of the House Committee on Financial Services, which also gives her ex officio status on a half-dozen subcommittees, meaning Waters could attend meetings for those subcommittees if she chose. By our count, Waters missed 37 percent of the hearings listed on the Government Publishing Office’s website.

Donald Trump's claim about Obamacare premiums doubling in Wisconsin leaves out important details
","On his second visit to Wisconsin since entering the Oval Office, President Donald Trump stepped off Air Force One on June 13, 2017, and tore into Obamacare. Joined by two Wisconsin families whom he described as victims of the Affordable Care Act, Trump said in Milwaukee: ""These are sad but familiar stories in Wisconsin, where Obamacare premiums have doubled. Obamacare is one of the greatest catastrophes that our country has signed into law."" By not stating a time frame with his claim, the president left it to his audience to determine how alarmed to be; premiums doubling in one year, of course, is much different than over a span of years. And premium increases can’t be considered in isolation. So, let’s sort this out. Obamacare vs. GOP plan Three days before Trump’s trip, Vice President Mike Pence visited Milwaukee, saying that under the Republican replacement for Obamacare everyone with preexisting medical conditions will ""have access to the coverage and the care that they need -- no exceptions."" We found the pledge misleading. Based on the GOP plan passed by the House of Representatives, people with preexisting conditions could potentially face huge increases in premiums, though changes in the bill could still be made by the Senate. Around the country, there have been huge premium increases for people who buy health insurance on their own through Obamacare. We rated Mostly True a January 2017 claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan that Obamacare premiums had gone up as much as 116 percent (in Arizona) from 2016 to 2017 -- though it’s important to note that before Obamacare, millions had no coverage at all. But there are multiple problems with the president’s claim. Trump’s evidence The vast majority of Americans get health insurance through their employer or through a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare. So, Trump’s claim refers to the relatively few people who buy health insurance coverage on their own. The White House pointed us to a May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that compared premiums in the individual market in 2013 to 2017. The report says 2013 was chosen because that’s when key regulations that are part of Obamacare took effect. The average premium in Wisconsin nearly doubled, based on the analysis: Obamacare individual market 2013 average monthly premium 2017 average monthly premium Increase Wisconsin $266 $514 93% United States $232 $476 105% But Cynthia Cox, a health reform and private insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care, told us the analysis is skewed in a way that inflates the average premium for 2017 because it includes only policies that are sold in the Obamacare marketplace.

The average 2017 premium would have been lower had the analysis also included individual policies that are not sold on the marketplace.

That's because people who buy individual policies off the marketplace tend to buy less expensive plans because they aren't receiving Obamacare subsidies, she said. Other factors There are two other key factors to consider. 1. Obamacare subsidies offset much of the impact of premium hikes. In a news article on premium increases for 2017, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that tens of thousands of Wisconsinites who buy individual health plans, but earn too much income to qualify for Obamacare subsidies, would have to absorb double-digit increases. But the story also said that because of the subsidies, most people buying those policies would see little, if any, change in their monthly costs. Economist Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under Republican President George H.W. Bush, told us the same is true nationally: People buying individual policies on the exchange are mostly protected from premium increases, though the subsidies that rise along with premium increases are a hit to other taxpayers. 2. Coverage: Premiums are up, but benefits are better. Before Obamacare, millions of Americans had no health insurance and policies on the individual market offered ""very limited benefits,"" University of North Carolina social medicine professor Jonathan Oberlander told us. For example, most of those policies didn’t cover maternity, mental health and substance abuse services. But now insurers are required to cover those services. The federal government estimates that 83 percent of Wisconsin marketplace participants receive premium tax credit subsidies and 51 percent receive cost-sharing subsidies. ""For these residents, nongroup insurance today provides more protection for less money than in 2013,"" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser. Our rating Trump says ""Obamacare premiums have doubled"" in Wisconsin. The average premium for individuals who buy their own health insurance in the Obamacare marketplace nearly doubled from 2013 to 2017. But the vast majority of Wisconsin residents buying those plans get Obamacare subsidies that protect them from the premium increases. Moreover, insurance coverage on individual plans is generally more comprehensive than before Obamacare. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A34CF40>],/factchecks/2017/jun/15/donald-trump/donald-trumps-claim-about-obamacare-premiums-doubl/

Gillibrand claim ignores the cost of a paid leave program
","Here’s something worth noting: President Donald Trump agrees with Democrats in the U.S. Senate on at least one issue. Trump and the Democrats want a national paid leave program. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York says such a program would boost the economy. ""If we had a national paid leave plan, it would potentially put into the economy $21 billion annually,"" Gillibrand said at a conference hosted by the Center for American Progress, a progressive public policy and advocacy organization. Gillibrand has sponsored a bill that would provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave annually through a weekly payroll deduction. Trump’s plan provides six weeks of paid leave by expanding unemployment insurance funds. Both plans would allow paid time off work after the birth of a child. Gillibrand’s plan would also allow paid leave for a temporary disability or to care for a relative. Both proposals face an uphill climb in Congress because many Republicans oppose a national paid leave program. Gillibrand hopes her claim of an economic benefit persuades other senators to support her bill. But is she right? Where the number came from Gillibrand cites a 2016 report from the Center for American Progress. The report found people who take unpaid or partially paid leave lose $20.6 billion in wages each year. Researchers used federal data on the number of people who take unpaid or partially paid leave and their median wage to come up with the number. ""I was trying to figure out how much these people are losing … because they have to take unpaid and partially paid leave while they’re out either because of caregiving responsibilities or temporary disability,"" said Sarah Jane Glynn, former director of women's economic policy at the Center for American Progress and a co-author of the report. The cost of a national paid leave program is not included in the report. Glynn said that was intentional. ""Until we come to a consensus on what this program should look like it’s kind of difficult to say what it’s going to cost to taxpayers,"" Glynn said. Gillibrand touts a $21 billion boost to the economy, but that’s not what the report says. ""That paper did not say including paid family leave would increase the economy by $21 billion. It said it would give workers $21 billion more and that’s a key distinction,"" said Ben Gitis, director of labor market policy from American Action Forum, a center-right policy research organization. ""It sounds like they kind of looked at one side of the coin,"" said Vanessa Brown Calder, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research foundation. ""There’s also some consequences and costs to instituting paid parental leave policies."" Any plan would be paid for with tax dollars or a payroll deduction. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a nonpartisan research group focused on women’s issues, released a report earlier this year that said close to $33 billion would need to be raised each year to fund Gillibrand’s plan. ""There was some flippage in the language,"" said Jeff Hayes, program director for job quality and income security at the institute, of Gillibrand’s claim. ""An economist might tell you that just the uncompensated wages don’t actually grow the economy."" Hayes did not dispute the Center for American Progress report’s estimate of lost wages. The number may even be higher, he said. Our ruling Gllibrand said a national paid leave program ""would potentially put into the economy $21 billion dollars annually."" Researchers say workers would receive at least $20.6 billion in paid leave. But Gillibrand’s claim ignores the money that would be taken out of the economy to pay for it. The program would be adding money to the same pot it’s being taken from. Her claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Democrat seeking Lamar Smith's House seat says each of the past three years 'hottest on record'

After a resident told candidate Derrick Crowe she’s worried about climate change, Crowe responded: ""That one actually keeps me up at night."" Crowe went on: ""I have a 3-year-old, Henry, and every year he’s lived has been the hottest on record."" Has each of the past three years proved the hottest on record? Candidate cites federal agency Crowe, described as a climate justice organizer in the June 3, 2017, Austin American-Statesman news story, responded to our request for factual backup for his claim by pointing out by email a Jan. 18, 2017, web post by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration headlined: ""2016 marks three consecutive years of record warmth for the globe."" NOAA’s post said ""the 2016 globally averaged surface temperature ended as the highest since record keeping began in 1880, according to scientists from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)."" The agency further said: ""The average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces in 2016 was 58.69 degrees F or 1.69 degrees F above the 20th century average. This surpassed last year’s record by 0.07 degrees F. Since the start of the 21st century, the annual global temperature record has been broken five times (2005, 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2016)."" That’s three straight years of record average land-ocean-surface temperatures. That day, NASA announced a similar conclusion. In its post, the space agency said: ""Globally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean. This makes 2016 the third year in a row to set a new record for global average surface temperatures."" The space agency elaborated: ""NASA's analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from 6,300 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These raw measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heating effects that could skew the conclusions. The result of these calculations is an estimate of the global average temperature difference from a baseline period of 1951 to 1980. ""NOAA scientists used much of the same raw temperature data,"" NASA said, ""but with a different baseline period, and different methods to analyze Earth's polar regions and global temperatures."" News stories News stories posted that day by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal each indicated scientific consensus that each of the years was the hottest in the history of  the temperature measurements. The Times’ account said 2016 marked ""the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row."" In 2015 and 2016, the newspaper reported, planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Niño, in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere. But the bigger factor in setting the records was the long-term trend of rising temperatures, the story said, which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A British agency aired a similar conclusion, the story said. ""In the British data set,"" the story said, ""2016 set a record by only a small amount; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA’s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures,"" the story said, ""and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016."" Then again, the story said, the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments, did not find that three records had been set in a row; in its analysis, 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014. The Journal’s news story on 2016 proving the hottest year on record noted three other independent assessments of the year’s warming trend. The Japan Meteorological Agency, which uses slightly different methods in its calculations, had just ranked 2016 as the warmest in its modern record, the story said, while separately researchers at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, drawing on satellite data to track global atmospheric temperatures, concluded that by a very small statistical margin, 2016 was the warmest year in 38 years of orbital monitoring. The Journal story said the same week that NOAA and NASA piped up, scientists at the U.K.’s Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit reported that by their analysis, 2016 was fractionally warmer than any other year in its record keeping, barely edging out 2015. State climate experts For our part, we asked experts including the respective state climatologists for Florida and Texas--big states on the Gulf of Mexico--to evaluate Crowe’s claim. David Zierden of the Florida Climate Center and John Nielsen-Gammon of Texas A&M University each cited the conclusion that global average surface temperatures in 2016 set a record high--just as record highs were reached in 2014 and 2015. By email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Center at Texas Tech University, and Clare Nullis, a spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency, each concurred. Zierden filled us in on how the averages cited by NASA and NOAA are reached, saying that each weather station’s overnight low and day-time high ultimately contributes toward year-long planet-spanning averages. ""It’s not necessarily a great measure of our climate system,"" Zierden said, but it’s a simple way of showing long-term trends. Focusing on global averaged temperatures, he added by email, reduces ""an infinitely complicated climate system, which includes the atmosphere (all levels), oceans, land surfaces, and ice surfaces, to ONE number per month or year is quite an oversimplification."" Warmth of U.S., Texas Crowe didn’t limit his hottest-ever statement to the U.S. or Texas. But the Journal story, citing NOAA, said that in the 48 states of the continental U.S., 2016 was the second-hottest year in record keeping, marking 20 years in a row when temperatures were above average. With help from the state climatologists, we clicked to the NOAA’s NCEI website and obtained a ranking, from 1901 through 2016, of the average surface temperature in the 48 states in the continental U.S. Results: The average 2016 surface temperature of 54.91 degrees F was exceeded by the 55.28 degrees F average in 2012 with the continental U.S.’s 2015 average temperature of 54.40 degrees F ranking third since 1901. The continental U.S.’s 2014 surface temperature average, 54.52.54 degrees F, made that year its 37th warmest, according to NOAA. In Texas, according to the site, 2016 tied 2006 for the third-warmest average surface temperatures on record of 67.1 degrees F. Also not record-setting: The state’s averages for 2014 (the state’s 56th warmest year since 1901) and 2015 (the state’s 16th-warmest year since 1901). Our ruling Crowe said each of the past three years was the ""hottest on record."" There’s scientific consensus that this was so, according to averaged global surface temperature readings, though it’s worth pointing out that those temperatures add up to a single indicator of climate conditions.

Bernie Sanders tweet exaggerates lack of input in Senate health care bill
","Amid criticism that Senate Republicans are working in secret to craft legislation that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted a graphic that tried to make that argument in stark statistical terms. The graphic, which Sanders tweeted on June 13, 2017, is titled, ""Health Care Reform: Then and Now."" It limits its comparison to the Senate, and it looks at two periods -- 2009 to 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was under consideration, and 2017, for the legislation the Senate is currently working on. (The House has already passed its version of a bill, the American Health Care Act.) Sanders’ graphic said that when Democrats were crafting the Affordable Care Act, they allowed 160 hours of debate; 100 ""committee hearings, roundtables, or walkthroughs""; and more than 171 amendments from the opposite party. Currently, though, the graphic accuses Republicans now working on the repeal-and-replace bill of allowing none of those things -- hammered home with a string of red zeroes. How does the graphic add up? I say to Republicans: If you can’t defend your efforts to throw millions off health care to give huge tax breaks to the top 2%, give it up. pic.twitter.com/KExeCeAhAh Debating Obamacare in 2009 and 2010 The left column is the more accurate of the two. When the Affordable Care Act was being put together, both the Senate and House passed distinct versions of the bill, but Democrats then lost a pivotal Senate seat in a special election, dropping their numbers below the crucial 60-seat threshold. Congressional leaders decided to have the House accede to the already-passed Senate version and then work out the differences in a subsequent round of legislation known as reconciliation. When we contacted Sanders’ office, spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis provided us with extensive documentation for the numbers relating to the debate over the Affordable Care Act. They sent us to a Senate Finance Committee fact sheet that includes six pages of detail on how the Senate version of the bill moved through the chamber. They also sent us several other documents about the legislative process in 2009 and 2010, as well as a February 2010 Obama administration letter that touted the ""160 hours"" the Senate had spent on the floor considering health insurance reform legislation On the hours of debate, Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the numbers seem broadly accurate. For the initial Senate version of what became the Affordable Care Act, the Senate started debating the bill in earnest on Nov. 21, 2009, and passed the bill on Dec. 24. Between those dates, ""the Senate debated the bill nearly every day it was in session,"" Smith said. Meanwhile, news reports generally support the idea that there were 100 hours of committee meetings and other types of official events. The New York Times reported that ""in June and July 2009, with Democrats in charge, the Senate health committee spent nearly 60 hours over 13 days marking up the bill that became the Affordable Care Act. That September and October, the Senate Finance Committee worked on the legislation for eight days — its longest markup in two decades."" We previously fact-checked a claim related to Republican amendments. Combining the Republican amendments approved in markups at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, the number of approved Republican amendments was close to the 171 cited in the infographic. That said, it’s worth remembering, as we reported, that most of these amendments were technical in nature, and only two of them were passed via the more rigorous roll-call vote process used for more substantive matters. The debate on repeal-and-replace in 2017 But if the left-hand column is pretty on target, the right-hand column -- covering the debate in 2017 -- cherry-picks a time frame that prevents an equitable comparison. That’s because the graphic compares a completed bill with one that hasn’t yet advanced very far in the process. It’s a case of comparing apples and oranges. One of the three ""zeros"" in the chart may be justified -- the one that refers to time spent in committee hearings. Senate Republicans intend to bring the bill now being written directly to the floor once it’s analyzed for cost and impact by the Congressional Budget Office. That would mean bypassing the typical committee process. Sanders’ office pointed to recent public comments by the chairmen of the relevant committees saying that they had no plans to take up the bill before floor consideration. However, the zeros for floor debate and amendments are more questionable. Senate Republicans want to address the bill through a ""reconciliation"" process, which would enable passage with 51 votes rather than 60 votes to first cut off debate. If they take this course, there would be 20 hours of floor debate under rules for reconciliation bills. Twenty hours is significantly less than the 160 hours spent on the Affordable Care Act, but it’s certainly not the zero suggested in the graphic. ""There will be debate on the current proposal after it is introduced,"" said John Cannan, a law librarian at Drexel University who has written about the legislative history of the Affordable Care Act. As for amendments, there will be an opportunity to consider some on the floor according to reconciliation rules, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist. (Without committee consideration, amendments in committee will be impossible, however.) Sanders’ office acknowledged that the graphic captures a moment in time. ""Clearly, 2017 is ongoing, and the bill hasn’t passed the Senate yet, so the numbers in the right column might need to be updated at some point,"" Miller-Lewis said. Still, this amounts to a flawed comparison and a statistically exaggerated picture, punctuated by a string of bold zeros. Our ruling Sanders’ graphic said that Senate deliberations on the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010 included hundreds of hours of debate and more than 100 Republican amendments, compared with zero for the American Health Care Act this year. Sanders has a point that the Democratic process in 2009 and 2010 included more active involvement by Republicans than Republicans are allowing in the current debate over the repeal-and-replace legislation. However, it’s misleading for Sanders to make this point through an apples-to-oranges comparison that produces eye-catching zeros that will soon be rendered out of date. Under Senate rules, there will be debate and amendments.

"['Crime', ""The 2018 California Governor's Race"", 'California', 'Guns', 'Gavin Newsom']","
Are Americans 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries?
"," Gun control is a top priority for California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. So, it’s no surprise Newsom, a Democrat and 2018 candidate for governor, promoted the cause on National Gun Violence Awareness Day. He claimed in a statement on Twitter on June 2, 2017: ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries. We've had enough. #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay.""  This is not the first time we’ve fact-checked a gun claim by Newsom. In November 2016, we rated Mostly True his assertion that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since the 1990s. Earlier that year, we rated Mostly False his statement that ""So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days."" In this case, we wondered whether the facts support his claim about the seemingly huge disparity in gun homicide rates between the United States and other developed countries. We’ll fact-check this claim below. First, here’s some background on Newsom and the 2018 California governor’s race. Governor’s race Newsom is among several prominent Democrats as of now competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; California Treasurer John Chiang and Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction. Announced Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player. As part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor’s race.  Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at [email protected], tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Newsom has supported California’s stringent gun and ammunition laws. In 2016, he proposed and helped pass Proposition 63, a voter initiative that requires instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Our research We interpreted Newsom’s claim of ""shot and killed"" to mean gun homicides. These are intentional killings using a firearm, not including suicides. To back up the statement, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in March 2016 called ""Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010."" The study relied on mortality data from 2010 collected by the World Health Organization. It found the rate of gun homicides was 25.2 times higher in the United States than in 22 other populous and high-income countries for which data was also gathered. A sample of those included South Korea, Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. When considering all types of gun deaths, such as homicides, accidental shootings and suicides, people in the United States were 10 times more likely to die from a gun-related death than those in the other countries, the report said. Authors of study weigh in We contacted the co-authors of this study. Both described Newsom’s claim as ""accurate."" ""Yes, what he said seems accurate,"" David Hemenway, professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author, said by email. ""I think anyone who looks at the data would agree."" Erin Grinshteyn, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of San Francisco and the other co-author, also said the claim was correct. Grinshteyn described the report as ""purely an academic study."" She said her portion of the work was not funded while Hemenway’s participation was funded, in part, by the Joyce Foundation. On its website, the foundation says it supports ""research-based strategies that can prevent gun violence by reducing the easy accessibility of firearms."" Related study In 2014, PolitiFact examined a related claim by lawyer and author Lisa Bloom that said ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" PolitiFact took this to mean gun homicides. It rated her claim Mostly True, citing figures collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. That data showed the United States had a slightly lower gun homicide rate in 2010 than reported in the American Journal of Medicine Study. That, in turn, meant Americans would be closer to 20 times as likely to die in gun homicides compared with several other ""civilized countries."" But as PolitiFact noted, much depends on which countries are included in this comparison and the years for which that data was available. Chile and Turkey, both with relatively high gun homicide rates, were included in the United Nations study but not in the report in the American Journal of Medicine. Grinshteyn told us her study only included high-income, populous countries  as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. ""If they included Chile and Turkey, which were not included in our comparison group, those will cause the comparison to be skewed,"" she added. We reached out to the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights advocacy group, to ask whether its members knew of any additional and independent reports on this topic. We did not immediately hear back. Our rating Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries."" Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts. His statement could have used this additional information. In the end, we rated Newsom’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F04E40>],/factchecks/2017/jun/14/gavin-newsom/claim-americans-are-25x-more-likely-be-shot-and-ki/

Donald Trump's Mostly False tweet about Obamacare dropouts
","President Donald Trump often says that the health insurance exchanges for buying individual coverage are collapsing under their own weight. Recent reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provided him with another data point. ""2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare. It is in a death spiral,"" he tweeted June 13. We decided to look at that 2 million figure and see whether it adds weight to the argument that the Affordable Care Act exchanges are collapsing. What we found isn’t nearly as convincing as Trump made it sound. It’s become routine for people to leave the health insurance exchanges in the first months of the year, and is often a signal they found insurance through an employer. The number this year is higher, experts say, primarily because of a change in when the federal government collected the data. The 2 million figure comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' snapshot of people who signed up for insurance on an exchange, by the Jan. 31, 2017, deadline, but have not paid the premium to keep the policy active. The report said that 10.3 million individuals had paid the premiums needed to have coverage in February. Compared to total signups of 12.2 million, that was a drop of 1.9 million people, or about 15 percent. First, that has happened in previous years. In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services examined who had paid through all of March and found that the number of enrollees fell from 11.7 million down to 10.2 million, a drop of 1.5 million or about 13 percent. In 2016, the number fell from 12.7 million down to 11.1 million, a drop of 1.6 million or again about 13 percent. (The 2015 enrollment deadline was different but the one for 2016 was the same as this year.) In 2015 and 2016, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services looked at people who paid their premium through the end of March. And for good reason. In nearly every state, people who buy coverage in the last two weeks of January are buying policies that don’t begin until March. That gives them more time to pay before the policy lapses. In 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services looked at who made payments through the end of February. That is a full month shorter than the year before and out of step with the March 1 start date for many policies. (Some news reports said the figure was as of March 15, but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service looked at payments due only for February policies.) We asked why the federal agency changed its reporting timeline and were told it had to do with the release of a report on 2016 enrollment. We note that all the data for March was available at the time when this report was released. The impact of the change could be significant. The website ACASignups, a project of data activist Charles Gaba, tracks enrollment numbers across the country. Gaba reported that as of mid January, 11.7 million people had signed up. That would leave about 500,000 people who purchased policies that would not kick in until March. The federal government, in its report, assumed every one of them didn’t pay their premium and dropped coverage. But we don’t know that to be the case. The missing month could make another difference. In a time when the unemployment rate has fallen, more people might have found work. There are several reasons why people don’t follow through and pay their premiums. Some don’t have the cash, or they turn 65 and get on Medicare. However, Melinda Buntin, professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University, said employment is a major reason. ""More than half, about 60 percent, of those who did drop coverage (after paying for at least one month) said they did so because they obtained employer-sponsored coverage,"" Buntin said. Based on a separate 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report, those who left due to a job outnumbered those who cited the high cost of premiums by a margin of more than four to one. That study also said that insurance companies leaving the exchanges contributed to people dropping coverage. That has been a growing problem in recent months, partly of Trump’s making. ""Efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have exacerbated what was already a turbulent market,"" said Timothy Callaghan, a professor of health policy at the Texas A&M School of Public Health. ""This has caused some insurers to raise their prices and others to exit the market entirely."" Trump went on to say that people failing to pay their premiums is a sign of a death spiral. As we have written before, there certainly are problems with the health exchanges created as part of the Affordable Care Act. For instance, in Iowa, insurers have threatened to pull out of the exchanges in 94 of the state’s 99 counties. A death spiral is a specific term that described when healthy people leave the insurance market due to the cost. That leads to higher premiums for the people remaining in the insurance pools, who tend to be sicker, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle until the entire system fails. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in March that the individual insurance market, which relies on the exchanges, would ""probably be stable in most areas under either current law,"" or the proposed American Health Care Act. In a tweet, Trump linked 2 million people dropping coverage on the Obamacare exchanges to a ""death spiral."" The figure is plucked out of context. The pattern of people signing up and then dropping coverage has been steady over the past few years. One reason people do so, experts and government data say, is because they find coverage someplace else, most often by getting a job. The current government report behind Trump’s figure suggests the percentage of people letting their policies lapse has gone up, but this year, the government changed when it counted those lapsed policies. According to experts, that change created the appearance of a trend that might not exist. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B8BB80>],/factchecks/2017/jun/14/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-ties-flawed-obamacare-data-death-spi/
