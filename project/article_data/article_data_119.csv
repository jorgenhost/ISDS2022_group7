"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Jim Doyle']","
Gov. Jim Doyle says Wisconsin's projected budget shortfall is $1.5 billion, much lower than previously projected
","
It’s a familiar scenario when it comes to the politics around government budgets.

New to office? Puff up the size of the deficit you inherited, so you look like a hero tackling the problem.

Running for re-election or riding off into retirement? Push those numbers as low as you can, so the citizenry doesn’t hold you responsible for it -- and let the next guy deal with all the fallout.

Eight years ago, it was incoming Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, complaining that outgoing Republican Scott McCallum had made the state budget picture a little too rosy. Now Doyle, who did not to seek a third term, has issued his administration’s official budget statement.

It showed a deficit as low as $1.5 billion.

That’s a far, far cry from the $2.7 billion or so deficit bandied about during the November election, won by Republican Scott Walker. And Doyle is facing a hailstorm of criticism from Republicans for playing the how-low-can-you-go game.

""Even on his way out, Jim Doyle continues to use Madison math to manipulate budget numbers,"" soon-to-be Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald said after the Nov. 19, 2010 announcement.

Of course, Doyle’s top administrators are fighting back. They say Walker and his fellow Republicans are hypocritically inflating the deficit number to more than $3.3 billion.

Let’s dig into the numbers, with a focus on those issued by Doyle’s administration because they are the official ones.

Having a realistic number is important. The deficit -- and what Walker and the new Republican-controlled Legislature do about it -- could affect everything from school spending levels to government jobs, tax rates and the state’s safety net for the poor.

At the center of the issue is the statutorily required biennial report by the state Department of Administration. That report, dated Nov. 19, projected the two-year budget shortfall at $1.5 billion by June 2013, with the caveat it could be $2.2 billion if two key assumptions went awry.

That number was much lower than the $2.7 billion estimate in July by the state’s Legislative Fiscal Bureau. But lay that aside. While useful for an overall feel of fiscal condition, the Fiscal Bureau report measures an entirely different number than the new document.

So let’s look at how Doyle’s accounting squares with reality.

First of all, the deficit projection is just that -- a best guess based mainly on predicted tax collections vs. the amount state agencies say they need to operate.

State law says the deficit report should not include the recommendations by the governor, in this case the incoming Walker. Those recommendations are supposed to come later, during budget time. As such, the report is meant to strictly be a measure of the best estimate today of where things stand for the next two budget years.

But Doyle’s administrators put his stamp squarely on it, ""reducing"" the deficit by $800 million -- even before the $700 million in iffy assumptions are factored in.

Doyle did so by assuming Walker would continue several cost-saving measures Doyle used to balance the last two-year budget. Those measures included furloughs, a roll-back of a 2 percent pay raise and across-the-board spending cuts.

Asked about this approach, Department of Administration spokeswoman Emily Winecke told PolitiFact Wisconsin: ""Because Governor-elect Walker has repeatedly supported these measures, we did not feel they needed to be added as a likely additional cost.""

To be sure, a governor has authority on his own to enact many of the personnel and spending cuts. And Walker, as county executive, used furloughs and similar moves to balance the Milwaukee County budget.

But Doyle will be gone long before the budget is introduced.

An independent researcher who has studied the deficit, University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Andrew Reschovsky, said the DOA report obscured the real size of the problem by incorporating solutions into the mix -- solutions that Walker may or may not pursue.

""You have to go back to the status quo -- before furloughs -- to see what the magnitude of the problem is,"" Reschovsky said.

Reschovsky issued his own estimate in September pegging the deficit at $3.1 billion, though he says it would be under $3 billion if he did it today.

Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said it was unusual for an administration to carry over previous cost savings when calculating a future deficit.

Indeed, if one were to assume enough cost savings, a deficit could become a surplus.

There are other problems built into Doyle’s report: 
What’s the bottom line?

Even Department of Administration Secretary Daniel Schooff, who signed the deficit report, says $2.2 billion -- not $1.5 billion -- is the best starting point because the Medicaid and patient fund monies likely will fall to the state to cover.

Doyle’s side argues the deficit reports always have reflected some decision-making by the incumbent governor, even when he’s leaving office.

State agencies, for instance, often are instructed to come in with zero percent increases in state general funds. Doyle did that this time around. Doyle’s camp argues that his incorporation of various yet-to-be-approved cuts -- not just freezes -- is an extension of that approach.

""The real ‘Madison math’ is the assumption that state agency budgets can only go up and not down,"" Schooff said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin.

In fact, Berry of Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance was faulting Doyle just two years ago for using inflated agency requests to pump up the size of a predicted deficit. Now Doyle is under attack in part because his agency requests are too slim.

But the scenario here is different: It is one thing to assume changes when you wrote the current budget and will be creating the new one. It’s another to presume your successor and others -- in this case, Congress -- will do certain things.

Where does that leave us?

With less than two months left in the term, Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration department released a report showing a $1.5 billion deficit for the next two-year budget cycle. Although that number is official, the agency’s chief -- noting caveats included in the report -- almost immediately began portraying the actual deficit as closer to $2.2 billion.

In constructing the official number, the report makes an $800 million assumption -- it counts as continued savings cuts that are really decisions for the new governor. It also counts on an iffy $500 million in federal cash and skates over $200 million the courts say the state owes to one of its funds.

Atlanta wants green light on red light cameras
","
(Want to discuss this ruling? Check out our Facebook page.)  
It's the one piece of mail that makes every motorist who has ever hit the gas at a yellow light cringe -- the letter saying you ran a red light with a picture to prove it.

Atlanta officials recently announced one red light camera is coming back, at the busy intersection of Freedom Parkway and Boulevard.

They ""promote public safety,"" city officials said in a press release.

Is that true?

Critics argue red light cameras are nothing more than a moneymaking racket for government. Some researchers contend they don't make intersections any safer.

State transportation officials earlier this year denied Atlanta's request to keep the camera at the intersection, saying they found little evidence that the device was reducing the grinding T-bone collisions that typically occur when motorists run a red light.

""The crash data at the intersection, compared before and after the device was installed, did not reflect a reduction in the types of crashes caused by red light-running violators,"" Mark McKinnon, a state Department of Transportation spokesman, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a recent article. That doesn't mean the red light camera was unsafe, he said, just that it wasn't improving safety, which is its purpose.

Red light cameras have been used for years in metro Atlanta in cities like Alpharetta, Duluth and Roswell. Several cities in Gwinnett County shut down the cameras in 2009 after noticing a decline in accidents and injuries, which they believed were associated with adding an extra second for yellow lights.

In May, Atlanta's WXIA-TV investigated crash data at several city intersections with red-light cameras. The station found T-bone collisions increased at five of eight intersections with red light cameras.

The city's Public Works Department asked the state to reconsider its plans to keep the camera at the intersection of Freedom Parkway and Boulevard. The city sent new data it believed showed better results for the camera.

About 48,000 vehicles travel through Freedom Parkway and Boulevard each day, city officials say. The red light camera was initially put at the intersection in December 2007. There were 16 wrecks involving vehicles that ran red lights in the 24 months before the camera was installed, according to a study completed in June for the city by LAI Engineering. There were 15 such wrecks in the 24 months after the camera was installed, researchers found. The number of injury crashes in 2006 and 2007 were exactly the same (34) as there were in 2008 and 2009, the company found. None of the crashes in that four-year period were fatal.

LAI Engineering said the camera needed to be there an additional two years to evaluate its effectiveness.

Atlanta officials said they also would extend yellow light time at the intersection. In September, the state approved Atlanta's plan to reinstall the camera.

""The fact that so many crashes are occurring indicates that some measure is needed for public safety,"" Atlanta Public Works Department spokeswoman Valerie Bell-Smith told AJC reporter Ariel Hart in a recent article.

In 2009, nearly three-quarters of the accidents at that intersection were rear-end collisions. Some experts say that's common at intersections with red light cameras.

The Virginia Transportation Research Council, a partnership between that state's Transportation Department and the University of Virginia, conducted a seven-year study of six cities and counties with and without red light cameras. The study found rear-end collisions increased by 27 percent at intersections with red light cameras. Red light-running crashes decreased by 42 percent, the research found. Overall, the number of crashes decreased in three of the six jurisdictions.

""Common sense dictates that if the desired effect of red light cameras is achieved, there will be an increase in rear-end accidents,"" said a report released by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas). ""This is because motorists fearing a ticket will panic and slam on their brakes to avoid entering an intersection.""

""Red light cameras aren’t fixing a safety problem, they’re creating one,"" the Armey report said.

The Urban Transit Institute looked at crashes at red-light cameras in Greensboro, N.C., and found ""large increases in rear-end collisions,"" but fewer accidents involving a vehicle turning left and a vehicle on the same roadway. Researchers concluded ""there has been no demonstrable benefit from the RLC program in terms of safety. In many ways, the evidence points toward the installation of RLCs as a detriment to safety.""

Los Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel released an audit of that city's red-light camera program. Greuel's office found 12 of the 32 intersections with red-light cameras had more wrecks, four had about the same and 16 had fewer accidents.

Studies in other places show red light cameras do not demonstrably improve safety at intersections. The study done for the city of Atlanta found no major difference in accidents since the red light camera was installed.

Many researchers believe there is no major difference in accidents with red light cameras, but they do increase the fear factor among some motorists to slow down. The city's claim that the camera ""promotes public safety"" has some truth, but it leaves out important details, such as the typical rise in rear-end collisions. So motorists, beware when approaching a yellow light. Meanwhile, we rate Atlanta's claim as Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/29/city-atlanta/atlanta-wants-green-light-red-light-cameras/

Wisconsin State Sen. Glenn Grothman says payday loan operations do not exist in Minnesota
","
Here at PolitiFact Wisconsin, we rarely see terms as provocative and pungent as ""usurious vipers.""

When we do, we want to know more.

In this case, it was Wisconsin state Sen. Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) who referred to snakes charging exorbitant interest rates in recent comments about payday lenders.

Payday loan operations -- such as Check ’n Go, Payday Loan Store and Check-Cash Advance -- make short-term loans. You sign a loan agreement, write a post-dated check and get your money. The lender holds off on cashing your check until your next payday, typically two weeks.

Interest rates can run high.

Wisconsin has 482 payday lenders; West Bend, according to Grothman, has eight of them.  

Grothman, who opposes such operations, made his snakes remark in response to news that payday lenders are planning a push to roll back regulations on their business set to take effect in Wisconsin on Jan. 1, 2011.

""This industry does not exist in a state like Minnesota, and I don't see any downside in keeping these usurious vipers out of our state,"" said Grothman, the Senate’s new assistant majority leader, in a Nov. 13, 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. ""There are so many legitimate businesses in this state that need regulatory help. I sure hope that these guys are not on the list.""

Grothman made a similar comment about the lack of payday lenders in Minnesota in April 2010 during a discussion among Wisconsin lawmakers about the bill that eventually became law.

So, is it true that Minnesota has driven all payday lenders out of the state?

When asked about the source for his comment, Grothman acknowledged he didn’t know for sure if his statement was true, but said he had heard from a couple of people that Minnesota doesn’t have payday lenders.

Not wanting to appear like a snake in the grass, we told Grothman we’d do some, ahem, checking.

It didn’t take long.

It turns out Minnesota does allow payday lenders, some 75 of them, according to the state Department of Commerce.

The state’s attorney general warns consumers about ""hefty"" finance charges that can apply to their loans and spells out some of the restrictions that are in place.

For loans of up to $350, a sliding scale applies that limits the interest rate to 10 percent plus a $5 fee. For loans between $350 and $1,000, the lender cannot charge more than 33 percent interest plus a $25 fee.

Wisconsin also warns its citizens about them.

The state Department of Financial Institutions says interest on payday loans can reach 500 percent per year or more. Borrowing $200 at 500 percent interest for two weeks costs $38.36 and; if the loan remains outstanding for 10 weeks, the cost -- $191.78 -- is nearly as much as the loan itself, according to the state.

The Wisconsin law that takes effect in January makes a number of changes, including limiting payday loans to $1,500. In an effort to keep consumers from accumulating too much debt, the law also limits the loans to being renewed one time.

The Wisconsin Deferred Deposit Association, which represents payday lenders, has said it will push to soften Wisconsin’s new regulations, although it has not been specific about what changes it will seek.

According to the association, the average payday loan in Wisconsin is for $300, with a fee of $45.

There actually are many states, nearly a third of them -- including Ohio and most of the East Coast -- that don’t have payday lenders, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.

But as we’ve pointed out, Minnesota isn’t one of them.

That means it’s time for the Truth-O-Meter.

State Sen. Glenn Grothman said Wisconsin’s neighbor to the west doesn’t have any payday lenders. He apparently thought it was true and was trying to make a point that Wisconsin shouldn’t make it any easier for those businesses to operate.  

We wouldn’t say Grothman was being snaky. But his statement is False.",/factchecks/2010/nov/28/glenn-grothman/wisconsin-state-sen-glenn-grothman-says-payday-loa/

Rep. Joe Barton says 80 percent of oil we're discovering is in deep waters of Gulf of Mexico
","
U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who champions oil and gas producers, railed against President Barack Obama's May decision to impose a moratorium on drilling offshore during an Aug. 19 forum in Dallas.

To buttress his critique, Barton lofted a factoid that stuck with us. According to a news blog posted that day by the Dallas Morning News, Barton called the moratorium ""stupid"" and said that 80 percent ""of the oil we're discovering, we're discovering in the deep Gulf. When you put a six-month moratorium in place that could last indefinitely, you're not exploring for the very resource we need in America.""

Pack my trunk, ma, I'm headin' to sea. Eighty percent?

First, some catching up: The Obama administration in October lifted the moratorium, which had idled 33 rigs in the Gulf, according to an Oct. 12 news article in The Washington Post, accounting for more than 25 percent of U.S. oil production.

We asked Barton's office how he came to his 80 percent figure and then started looking for independent indications of how much of the nation's oil discoveries come from the so-called deep waters.

From an online search, we found an article posted in 2004 by the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior stating that energy companies have focused on oil and gas resources in water depths of 1,000 feet and beyond. ""Their progress in developing these resources has made the Gulf of Mexico the focal point of deep water oil and gas exploration and production in the world,"" the article says. The service estimates that the deep water regions of the Gulf ""may contain 56 billion barrels of oil equivalent, or enough to meet U.S. demand for 7 1/2 years at current rates.""

Since 2001, the article says, energy companies have announced 11 discoveries in water depths greater than 7,000 feet. About 30 percent of the oil and 23 percent of the gas produced in the United States comes from the federal Outer Continental Shelf, with most of that production from the Gulf, the story says. In 1990, about 4 percent of the oil and less than 1 percent of the natural gas produced in the Gulf originated in deep water areas, but by 2003 more than 60 percent of oil and 29 percent of the natural gas was produced from deep water areas, the story says.

Separately, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says online that as of 2008, 19 percent of U.S. proved crude oil reserves were believed to be in the Gulf of Mexico.

We ran that by Barton's office and heard from Lisa Miller, a staff member for Republicans on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee. Miller said by e-mail that judging Barton's statement by the EIA oil-reserve estimate would misconstrue ""both the context and the facts. EIA’s number references the amount of U.S. 'proved reserves' in the deep Gulf while Mr. Barton plainly was discussing production, not reserves.""

Miller pointed us to a chart on a web page created by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (formerly the Minerals Management Service) indicating that in 2009, 80 percent of the oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico was produced from deep-water sources.

We pressed Miller on whether oil production is the same as oil being discovered. She replied by e-mail: ""It's semantics.""

Not really, advised W. John Lee, a veteran professor in the Texas A&M University Department of Petroleum Engineering. Lee, who has expertise in estimating oil and gas reserves, told us that oil production and discovery ""are not the same thing."" Essentially, he said, discovery of oil reserves happens years before production takes place: ""Production means developed and flowing. That comes many years after discovery.""

Eric Potter, associate director of the University of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, agreed with Lee. Saying that 80 percent of discoveries are happening in the deep-water Gulf blurs the distinction between discovery and production, he said, casting the two as the same when they are not. Yet Potter also said that although he couldn't find an authoritative source showing where oil discoveries have lately been concentrated, he has no doubt most new finds are in the deep-water Gulf.

Finally, we spoke with Steve Grape, domestic reserves project manager for the Energy Information Administration. Grape speculated that close to 100 percent of oil discoveries in the Gulf are occurring in deep or ultra-deep (meaning 5,000 feet or deeper) waters. Oil companies are probing those waters, Grape said, ""in search of larger targets. They're located in deep water; no one has gone there before."" He noted the administration has estimated that as of 2008, 81 percent of proved crude oil reserves in the Gulf were in its deep waters.

To recap: Although experts we contacted agree that most oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico takes place in deeper waters, we found no proof -- if such data exists -- of Barton's statement that ""80 percent of the oil we're discovering, we're discovering in the deep Gulf.""

Oil production is a different matter, as the experts told us. If Barton had talked about that instead, and clearly limited his geographical scope to the Gulf, he would have fared better on the Truth-O-Meter. But those are big ifs.

We rate his statement Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/nov/28/joe-barton/rep-joe-barton-says-80-percent-oil-were-discoverin/

Rhode Island was one of first states to build sewers and treatment plants
","
In hindsight, World Toilet Day came not a moment too soon.

With a sputtering economy and high unemployment, Rhode Island has had precious few bright spots to brag about in recent years. But on Nov. 19, the Narragansett Bay Commission, which operates two major sewage-treatment plants, celebrated World Toilet Day by pointing with pride to some of the most dark and foul parts of our state: the sewers.

""Think about it,"" Narragansett Bay Commission public affairs manager Jamie Samons said. ""We were one of the first states in the U.S. to build sewers, to bring the treatment plant on line, and now we’re tackling CSOs (combined sewer overflows). How lucky are we to know that we can flush reliably.""

Truth be told, it’s been awhile since we’ve thought about that topic. But with World Toilet Day as our inspiration, we decided to give it some thought. So we set out to prove or disprove the claim that Rhode Island was ""one of the first states"" to build sewers and a sewage treatment plant.

A 1990 Narragansett Bay Commission document, ""Reclaiming Our Resources: A History of The Providence Sewage Treatment System,"" sets the scene, taking us to the year 1854 when Providence, then the seventh largest U.S. city, faced its second cholera epidemic in five years. The city’s superintendent of health, Dr. Edwin Snow, describes the Moshassuck River as ""filthy as any common sewer,"" saying ""the stench arising from it at times pervades the whole neighborhood"" and ""at any time, dogs, cats and hogs may be seen in the water in every stage of decomposition.""

But there’s good news: ""In the 1870s a sewer system was constructed which conveyed the city’s waste to be discharged through a series of 65 combined sewer overflows into the rivers and harbor,"" the document states. And in 1884, Providence sent City Engineer Samuel M. Gray to Europe to study the latest methods of treating household and industrial waste. He recommended a system to collect sewage at Field’s Point and treat it with a ""chemical precipitation method""  used in England.

In 1901, the Providence Sewage Treatment system began operating, and the commission document says, ""The chemical precipitation plant, the third of its kind in the United States, was described as ‘The largest of its type ever built.’ ""

So did that make us ""one of the first""?

To begin with, America certainly wasn’t the first country to come up with this sewer idea. In the Mesopotamian empire (3500 to 2500 BC), some homes were connected to a stormwater drain system to carry away waste, and the Romans built the Cloaca Maxima (AKA the central sewer system) in about 800 BC, according to P.F. Cooper’s ""Historical Aspects of Wastewater Treatment.""

Also, Rhode Island certainly wasn’t the first place in America with sewers. New York, Chicago and Boston battle it out over which had the first sewer system, says Jon Schladweiler, the Arizona Water Association historian who runs the sewerhistory.org website and a traveling exhibit on sewer history. But Providence wasn’t far behind the front runners, he says.

Brooklyn began construction in 1857 of ""the first effective planned sewerage system in the country designed to remove sanitary wastes and stormwater,"" and Chicago began building ""the premiere sewer system of the time"" in 1859, according to Martin V. Melosi's ""The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present.""

In ""The Impact of Sanitary Reform,"" Jon A. Peterson says New York built about 125 miles of sewer lines between 1849 and 1865, and Boston installed about 100 miles of sewer lines between 1849 and 1873. He also mentions sewer projects under way in the 1850s in Chicago and Jersey City, N.J. And he says, ""In New England, where urbanization had advanced furthest, engineers devised major systems for Providence in 1869.""

Providence also gets some love in a footnote found in ""American Sewerage Practice,"" a seminal 1914 text by Leonard Metcalf and Harrison P. Eddy. ""The sewerage system of Providence was declared in 1881 by Rudolph Hering, after a personal investigation of such work in our cities and in Europe, to be equal to anything abroad and much better than the work elsewhere in this country. The system was designed in 1869 by J. Herbert Shedd, then chief engineer of the water works and later city engineer.""

And ""Mr. Shedd’s report of 1874 on these sewerage works was long a famous engineering document,"" Metcalf and Eddy say. ""It is only right to point out that the Providence sewers formed for some years the model American system.""

You hear that, Connecticut? ""Model American system."" After a shout-out from Metcalf and Eddy, it’s safe to say Rhode Island enjoyed sewer All-Star status.

But did we also have one of the first sewage treatment plants?

Metcalf and Eddy say, ""The first extensive treatment plant utilized chemical precipitation and was built in Worcester, Mass., in 1889-1890."" Sewerhistory.org mentions an East Orange, N.J., treatment plant built in 1888 or 1889. And in ""Municipal Wastewater Treatment,"" Andrew Stoddard says, ""In 1886, the first wastewater treatment plant was constructed to protect beaches at Coney Island.""

But, hot dog, Providence wasn’t far behind with its treatment plant starting to hum in 1901. And by 1909, there were still only 19 cities with more than 30,000 people treating their sewage, Joel A. Tarr notes in ""Goodbye to the Flush Toilet.""

So after reviewing the claim that Rhode Island was ""one of the first states"" with sewers and a sewage treatment plan -- a phrase that leaves plenty of wiggle room -- we rate Samons' statement True.

We should mention that in later years Providence’s sewage treatment became a disgrace. By the 1970s, the deteriorating plant was spewing nearly 65 million gallons of untreated or partially treated sewage each day into Rhode Island’s waters.

But in 1980, voters approved an $87.7-million bond issue for improvements, the Narragansett Bay Commission was formed, and by 1995 the Environmental Protection Agency was naming the treatment plant best of its size in the nation.

So next time World Toilet Day comes around, don't just sit there. Stand up and cheer.",/factchecks/2010/nov/28/jamie-samons/rhode-island-was-one-first-states-build-sewers-and/
"['Oregon', 'Oregon Food Bank']","
Oregon is one of the nation’s most food-insecure states, but it is among the top five?
","
Oregon doesn’t have a stellar track record in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s annual report on hunger, or as the report refers to it, food insecurity. The state is routinely above the national average and, despite much research, experts still aren’t sure exactly how to go about reversing this trend or, for that matter, why it exists at all.

Whatever the case, the trend continues, and as proof we have the most recent study from the USDA. We also have a press release from the Oregon Food Bank alerting us all to the realities detailed within the report.

""Hunger in Oregon continued to hover far above the national average as the Great Recession battered Oregon’s economy, according to the 2009 hunger report released today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.""

It continues: ""Oregon, once again, remains among the top five hungriest states in the nation, as it was last year.""

There’s a pretty big tendency, whether you’re writing a press release or a news article, to take this sort of data and compare one state to the next.

In fact, that tendency is so strong, that while we were looking into the Oregon Food Bank’s assertion that our state is ""among the top five hungriest in the nation"" we came upon at least three articles that went one further and called Oregon the third hungriest state.

There was a column in The Oregonian, an article in The Statesman Journaland a short brief by The Associated Press.

But rarely -- heck, never -- are statistics so simple. We decided to see whether the report really backed up these various assertions.

We started with the Food Bank itself to see which information from the report it was using to back up the ""among the top five"" claim. Jean Kempe-Ware, the spokeswoman, pointed us to the table that shows the ""prevalence of household-level food insecurity and very low food security by state"" for 2007-2009.

The report offers two numbers for each state. The first is the percent of households that are suffering from either low or very low food security. The second category focuses on just those households suffering very low food security. In previous years, that category, she said, had been described as ""hungry.""

Kempe-Ware said she focused on that second category. If you rank the states from highest rate to lowest rate, Oregon winds up in third place at 6.6 percent or, to put it another way, ahead of 47 other states.

Now, this is where the state media seem to have stopped. By this measurement, Oregon is the third highest for those feeling extremely food insecure.

To her credit -- and in an effort to be better safe than sorry -- Kempe-Ware went one further than the journalists and also looked at whether the state’s position would change much if you considered Oregon’s margin of error of plus or minus 1.02 percent. If you apply each state’s margin, in either direction, at the same time, Oregon winds up in fifth place, ahead of 45 other states. (It’s important to note here that the margin of error varies by state depending on how many residents were surveyed and the state’s overall population.)

Based on these numbers and some additional advice, Kempe-Ware said ""among the top five"" felt like a fair estimate to her.

We can see why. But there’s a lot more happening in these numbers that is worth exploring.

For starters, we wanted to take a look at the first category that includes not just very low food security but also low food security. If you look at that number, Oregon’s prevalence of food insecurity jumps to 13.9 percent, but it ranks at 18th highest, or, to put it more accurately, it comes in higher than 32 other states. Not great marks, but certainly better than third or fifth.

That’s just the beginning, however. The rankings that we’ve outlined here are all suspect. Just because Oregon might be near the low side of its margin of error doesn’t mean all other states will be. Of course, there are national factors that would probably weigh on all states, but for statistical purposes, there are a lot of possible variations.

Let’s go back to the Food Bank’s preferred ""very low food security"" level. Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that Oregon’s rate is the lowest statistically possible, meaning 5.58 percent (that’s the initial estimate of 6.6 percent minus the 1.02 percent margin), but all the other states are at the high end of their margin. Well, that would put Oregon higher than just 18 other states. Conversely, if Oregon’s rate were the highest possible and all other states were at their lowest, Oregon would rank the out and out hungriest.

The take-away: Oregon can appear first or lower than 31 other states. If you use the first set of numbers (remember low and very low food security?) you get an equally perplexing range of 3rd to 43rd highest.

For more input we turned to Mark Nord, one of the authors of the USDA report. He helped shed light on a few points. First, he said, it was pretty apparent that Oregon was among the nation’s leaders in very low food security. But, he said, ""we kind of discourage ranking by indicating how large the margins of error are. What we try to emphasize is states that are above the national average and states that are below the national average."" Oregon is above the national average.

Mark Edwards, an associate professor of sociology at Oregon State University who has helped advise the Oregon Food Bank on this report and has also been tracking and looking into the causes of food insecurity in Oregon for the last decade, said much same.

The numbers allow for a lot of leeway in all directions, Edwards agrees, but he still maintains that the report highlighted real problems with hunger in Oregon. As proof he pointed to past reports that have consistently showed Oregon near the top. ""The fact that we repeatedly come out higher than other states convinces me that there's something unique going on in Oregon that's a problem.""

There are, naturally, other broader issues with the survey, according to its detractors. John Charles at the conservative-leaning Cascade Policy Institute said the study’s findings, which depend on the respondents’ subjective interpretations of various questions, offer little hard data. Instead, he said, the jobless rate might offer a better indication of how many individuals are struggling to get by. That number -- 10.5 percent -- and the food stamp rate -- one in five Oregonians -- also indicate a lot of people in Oregon who have trouble buying food.

We can see why Kempe-Ware felt that ""among the five hungriest"" was a safe statement. We can even see why some journalists felt that ""third highest"" was appropriate (we might have been tempted to use the same language ourselves). There are some numbers here that would appear to back them up. And two experts agree that Oregon is on the high end of things -- certainly higher than the national average. Still, those same two experts discourage out-and-out rankings. Then there’s the fact that quite a bit of variation is possible no matter how you look at the numbers. For those reasons, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/27/oregon-food-bank/oregon-one-nations-most-food-insecure-states-it-am/

Speaker Joe Straus says Texas House has ""record number of new members joining our ranks""
","
Bolstered by big Election Day gains, Texas House Republicans are preparing for a legislative session in which they will vastly outnumber Democrats. 
Indeed, House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio notes in a Nov. 12 e-mail sent to Republican colleagues (and to reporters): ""We have a record number of new members joining our ranks, and it is essential that we focus our energies on the business of the people, working together to achieve our common goal of a more educated, prosperous and secure Texas."" Attached is a letter from 18 GOP House committee chairwomen and chairmen expressing their support for Straus, who is facing calls from the right for Republicans to line up behind an alternative candidate for speaker. 
When we asked Straus spokeswoman Tracy Young about the ""record number of new members,"" she said Straus was referring to Republicans only. She provided us with a chart showing the growth in GOP House membership over the past few decades that she said she received from Associated Republicans of Texas, a group created to strengthen the GOP presence in Texas government after 1974, when Republicans suffered at the polls in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. 
According to the chart, which is organized by election year starting with 1974, the largest increase in GOP membership will take place when the Legislature convenes in January and at least 98 Republicans fill seats in the 150-member House. 
But the GOP's chart only goes back to the 1974 election, and there were 60-plus legislatures before then. Also: Despite his spokeswoman's clarification, it's not obvious in Straus' e-mail that his mention of ""new members joining our ranks"" means only Republicans. The speaker oversees the entire House, so ""our ranks"" can (and maybe should) be read as inclusive of that body. It's no secret either that House Democrats were key to Straus winning the speakership, a job filled by vote of the House membership, at the start of the 2009 session. 
In search of a definitive, historical count of GOP ""true freshmen"" in the House, we turned to the Legislative Reference Library. The library, housed in the Texas Capitol, tallied the Democratic and Republican freshman House members for each Legislature since the 15th, which convened in 1876. Catherine Wusterhausen, coordinator of public services, told us that the library's count of freshmen excludes anyone who had served in an earlier session. 
Starting the count in 1876 leaves out the 12th Legislature, a majority-Republican body whose members were elected in 1869 during Reconstruction; however, we could not determine how many GOP freshmen came in with that group. 
Upshot: According to the library, there will be at least 29 truly new Republican House members in 2011, the most of any of the 68 sessions included in the library's list. Depending on the outcome of a special election and a pending recount, that number could go up. The year with the second-highest number of new Republican members was 2003, when 27 freshman Republicans came to Austin. 
But the upcoming influx is not a record increase in new House members in toto — not even close. According to the library, 2011 will see at least 34 freshman House members. However, from 1876 to 1967, when Democrats dominated Texas politics, turnover in the House was usually much higher, with a high of 97 new members in the 1913 session and only one session proceeding with fewer than 34 new members (32 in 1943). Since 1967, seven sessions have had a freshman class of more than 34, with a high of 71 in 1973. 
Summing up: The 2011 Legislature stands to have a record number of new Republican House members. But the House record for new members won't be broken, and Straus's statement was not clear about limiting its scope to Republicans only.

Eric Cantor says expiration of Bush tax cuts will raise small business taxes
","
It’s the worst economy in 80 years and Democrats want to raise taxes on small businesses. That’s the way Rep. Eric Cantor and other Republican leaders describe efforts to let some Bush-era tax cuts expire.

During post-election interviews this month, Cantor vowed the GOP will use its newly won majority status to insist that all of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, including those for the wealthy, be extended past their scheduled expiration at the end of the year.

Cantor, like many Republicans, says raising the highest income bracket will penalize small businesses.

""The question is are we going to raise taxes on small businesses right now, when we’re looking at those very individuals, those small businesses, to create jobs,"" Cantor, the soon-to-be House majority leader, said on CNN. ""I don’t think many people think that’s a good idea.""

In addition, Cantor wrote in a Sept. 20 Op/Ed in the Wall Street Journal ""roughly half of small business income in America will face a higher rate"" if the Bush tax cuts die.

Since Cantor is playing a huge role in the national debate on taxes, Virginia PolitiFact examined his claims.

First, a little background. Cantor’s assertion focuses on the top bracket of income taxpayers: individuals with earnings more than $200,000 a year and families making more than $250,000. President Bush cut the top tax rate to 35 percent. President Obama wants to raise it to its previous 39.6 percent level, saying it would lower the deficit.

How does that tie into small businesses? The GOP for years has pointed to a 2007 Treasury Department report which found that about 75 percent of the wealthiest tax filers are ""flow through-business owners"" who report some type of non-wage income, such as money from a sole proprietorship, a partnership or an S Corporation (which chooses to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credit through to its shareholders for federal tax purposes).

But that doesn’t mean all these wealthy taxpayers are small business owners. In the words of PolitFact National, which also has vetted this issue: ""This kind of income could be reported from anyone who earned money from a source other than a regular job, such as consulting or public speaking. It could also be reported by those who make most of their income from partnerships, such as law firms and  medical practices. And it could include investors who have very little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company.""

It’s impossible to know how many of these taxpayers are small business owners. Federal tax law does not provide a standard definition of ""small business.""

About 155.4 million individuals and families file income taxes in the United States.

The Tax Policy Center, a research group started by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, analyzed IRS figures this summer and found that 2.2 percent of all taxpayers reporting business income -- 540,000 filers -- would be affected if Congress increases the tax rate on top earners.

The debate narrows to how many of these wealthy taxpayers should be considered small business owners -- a determination, as we’ve said, that’s impossible.

Although there’s no concrete definition of a small business owner, it seems reasonable to us that he or she would make half of his or her income from business ventures. The Tax Policy Center found that 272,000 of the wealthiest filers do that.

The average adjusted gross business income -- the money they keep after all deductions -- for these taxpayers is $718,827. ""The spin-miestering version of the argument doesn’t mention this,"" said William Ahern, director of policy and communications for the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group  in Washington. ""The viewer would think we’re talking about the appliance store owner on the corner.""

Cantor’s math wrongly assumes that the non-wage income of all top earners comes from small businesses.

Cantor bases his Wall Street Journal claim that ""roughly half of small business income in America will face a higher rate"" if the Bush tax cuts die on a July 12 congressional report. ""According to the Joint Committee on Taxation,"" deputy press secretary Megan Whittemore told us in an e-mail, ""raising taxes only on those owners of small businesses with incomes above $200,000/$250,000 would still subject approximately 50 percent of small business income to a tax increase.""

But that’s not what the report says. It says 50 percent of all flow-through business income in the top bracket would be subject to a higher levy if the Bush tax cuts expire. And it adds this caveat: ""These figures for net business income do not imply that all of the income is from entities that might be considered `small.’’’

Whittemore, in her e-mail explaining Cantor’s claim, also said ""half of those in the top bracket get at least 25 percent of their income from small business sources."" She referred to another analysis by the Tax Policy Center, done in 2008.

We found Cantor’s office was again misinterpreting the results. The study said slightly more than half top earners made at least 25 percent of their net income from business profits. The statistical table Cantor’s office sent us makes no reference to small business.

Let’s summarize:

Would ending the Bush tax cuts raise levies on small businesses, as Cantor’s says? Sure, some extremely successful small businesses would be affected, but probably not many.

The IRS does not offer a standard definition for a small business. Cantor consistently takes IRS data on the percentage of top earners who report some business income and says it comes from small business. You can’t make that leap, as one of the reports cited by Cantor says.

What we know is that a sizable percentage of the nation’s top earners make some of their money from business profits. Their business income could come from any number of places, including stores or partnerships in law firms, medical practices or Wall Street trading houses.

About 272,000 Americans in the highest income tax bracket report more than half of their earnings come from business profits. Their average business income is $718,827, according to the Tax Policy Center, whose figures Cantor sometimes uses. That hardly sounds like a corner shop owner, whose image Cantor seems to invoke when he says Democrats are trying to raise taxes on small businesses.

We rate the claim Barely True.

"['Federal Budget', 'Texas', 'Kay Bailey Hutchison']","
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison voted against an earmark moratorium before she voted for it
","
Before the Republican gubernatorial primary, Gov. Rick Perry painted U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison as a Washington insider, all but hanging a scarlet ""W"" around her neck and crowning her ""Earmark Queen"" for funneling federal tax dollars to Texas projects. 
The upshot: Perry not only walloped Hutchison, he stepped smartly in line with an escalating Republican-led call to stop earmarks — spending items (or pork) tucked into the budget by individual lawmakers. 
And lately, Hutchison has lent her support to Republicans who want to ban earmarks for two years. 
Does that mean she's flip-flopped on the so-called ""earmark moratorium?"" 
According to a February study by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government-spending watchdog, Hutchison, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, ranked 19th among the 100 U.S. senators in fiscal year 2010 for steering tax dollars to specific projects in their home states. The state's junior senator, John Cornyn, ranked 54th. 
Since 2008, Hutchison has secured $3.6 billion in earmarks for Texas projects, according to the Dallas Morning News, which in March 2009 quoted Hutchison saying: ""I do think that earmarks are a legitimate role of Congress. I don't think that we should be earmarking things that do not have a national interest. Can it be overdone? Yes. Should it be transparent? Yes. But that is the role of Congress, to determine how we spend money."" 
Critics say that earmarks are likelier to serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group than the national good. 
In March, House Republicans adopted a voluntary year-long earmark ban, which is non-binding (U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, was one of a handful GOP lawmakers to defy the House moratorium) but symbolically significant. On Nov. 18, House Republicans voted to extend the ban through the next Congress, which convenes in January. 
Such a ban failed to clear the Senate in March. Then, Hutchison voted with the majority to table an amendment by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., to ban earmarks for two years, prohibiting Congress from considering any proposal including an earmark. In the 68-29 vote, 24 Republicans voted to continue consideration of the ban and 15 voted to put the idea aside. Cornyn, who was a cosponsor of the amendment, voted against tabling the measure. 
Before the vote, DeMint said on the Senate floor: ""The trust in our government is at an all-time low, and the earmarks that we send across the country are mostly with borrowed money. With all of our debt, the corruption, the waste, every American has a right to question what we're doing right now."" 
In a March 16 press release Hutchison issued about her vote to table the DeMint's amendment, she said ""this legislation does not rein in the federal budget. Ironically, it would hand even more power to President Obama and his administration, while not cutting one cent of deficit spending. Texas’ elected representatives have a far greater understanding of Texas priorities than federal bureaucrats in the Obama administration. The same amount of funds would be spent; the only issue was who would make the decision – Congress or the president’s appointees."" 
Our finding: Not everyone agrees with the logic that the federal government would control discretionary spending in the absence of earmarks. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said: ""It's a convenient argument that people like to make"" overlooking the reality that each president's budget can't take effect without congressional approval. 
But what a difference seven months, and perhaps the midterm elections, may have made for Hutchison. 
On Nov. 16, Hutchison came out in favor of another effort to ban earmarks, at least among Republicans, when GOP senators adopted a proposal by DeMint to ban earmarks for two years. Like the House GOP's action last spring, the endorsed ban isn't binding; it's a caucus agreement. But GOP senators are calling on Democrats to do the same. The Hill reported Nov. 22 that the full Senate is expected to vote soon on a proposal banning earmarks for three years, as an amendment to a food-safety bill. 
After pushing back against the renewed push for a ban in the days before the GOP caucus vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also pledged his allegiance to the ban, which Cornyn again cosponsored. 
McConnell and other earmark defenders have said the spending items account for a tiny slice of federal spending and are important for their districts. Earlier this month, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True Indiana Republican Sen. Richard Lugar's statement that ""eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending."" 
In a Nov. 16 statement she issued announcing her support for the ban, Hutchison called it ""a way to the start the process of reform that is essential to address the crushing debt our country has accumulated."" 
But she didn't abandon her position that if Congress doesn't direct some spending it yields decisions on discretionary spending to the White House: ""The president will have 100 percent of the discretion in all federal programs... As we reform the budget process, our goal should be to cut overall spending levels, while preventing inappropriately targeted funding by both the administration and Congress."" 
We wondered if DeMint's proposal has changed since March, in a way explaining Hutchison's support this time around. Her office didn't respond to our query. Separately, we consulted Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that favors balanced budgets and reducing the national debt. Gordon told us DeMint's latest proposal is not substantively different from what he offered in the spring. ""Seems to me the intention is exactly the same,"" he said. Also, Wesley Denton, a DeMint spokesman, told us the language of the senator's proposed moratorium has not changed. 
When we asked Hutchison spokeswoman Courtney Sanders why Hutchison voted in favor of the moratorium this month after voting to table his March proposal, Sanders pointed us to the senator's Nov. 16 statement. 
In an opinion article published in the Nov. 22 Austin American-Statesman, Hutchison writes: ""House and Senate Republicans recently took a historic step and voted to support a moratorium on congressional earmarks. I supported that effort because it will give Congress the opportunity to make our nation's budget process more transparent and accountable and allow us to focus on cutting spending."" 
Hutchison also writes that she has ""fought hard to bring federal resources to projects that are priorities for communities in Texas and where there is a national service,"" but her article concludes that ""overall government spending is out of control and we must focus on cutting spending across the board."" 
So, to the Flip-O-Meter. 
In March, Hutchison voted to table DeMint's amendment to freeze earmarks for two years. This month, she voted in favor of a DeMint-backed ban in a vote limited to GOP senators. True, Hutchison's first vote was to set aside legislation temporarily banning earmarks and the second was in favor of a voluntary earmark ban taken by Senate Republicans. But both were significant — and contradictory — stands on an earmark moratorium.

Rep. Armond Budish touts Democrat efforts on jobs, education as successes
","
Ohio House Speaker Armond Budish will relinquish his title in January as a result of the Nov. 2 election, when Democrats lost a dozen seats and control of the chamber.

But he’s not giving up his optimism or his view that Democrats contributed to Ohio job growth and to strengthening the public education system since taking control of the House in 2008.

Recently picked by his colleagues to lead the minority Democratic caucus in the new year, Budish, of Beachwood, pledged to stay the party’s course.

""We have made steady progress creating jobs and improving our schools and we will stand together to protect those priorities,"" Budish said Nov. 17 in a news release that announced his election as minority leader.

The statement grabbed Politifact Ohio’s attention because Republicans defeated Democrats by arguing that Statehouse Democrats failed to create jobs and improve schools.

So, is Budish revising history or did shouting by Republicans drown out Democratic success? PolitiFact Ohio thought we should take a look.

We started with Budish, who sent us a list of items that he says supports his claim. The list includes:  
  
  
There’s more on Budish’s list. We reviewed these items because they represent the heart of his economic and educational claims.

So, from the top:

Tax credits

The two-year budget passed in summer 2009 indeed bears the imprint of Gov. Ted Strickland and the Democratic House. In it are several tax credits; some new ones and the expansion of existing ones like the job creation tax credit.

Both parties generally agree that the goal of such budget items is to foster job growth in Ohio, but, tracking jobs tied to tax credits is not an exact science and takes time.

The motion picture tax credit is one Budish cites. It makes a total of $30 million in tax breaks available during the current budget to companies that make movies and commercials in the state.

Budish said this tax credit ""already created $25 million economic activity and 3,000 new jobs in Ohio.""

Ohio Department of Development data shows that film companies which have applied for the tax credits have spent $17.9 million here so far under the program. And other projects are in the pipeline.

But claiming this tax credit has created 3,000 jobs is a bit of movie magic.

The state tracks the number of people employed by the production company during shooting – including extras and the crew — but these are not permanent jobs.

""Unstoppable,"" the movie about a runaway train starring Denzel Washington, for instance, hired 1,361 people over 54 days in Ohio in 2009, the bulk of them extras. They earned $135,000 in wages, according to state data.

People employed on all completed projects have earned a total $2.4 million in wages. These figures are only estimates because a formal audit of the projects has not been completed, says Department of Development spokeswoman Katie Sabatino. But she underscores that people have been put to work as a result of the credit.

Budish and Democrats also created the New Markets Investment Tax Credit program, which offers tax credits of up to $10 million a year for insurance and financial companies for purchasing and holding securities issued by low-income community organizations. But its effectiveness can’t be judged - the program’s only been available for a month.

Budish also boasts that House Democrats supported continuation of the state Technology Investment Tax Credit program, which gives a break to taxpayers who invest in Ohio-based technology companies. But Ohioans are unlikely to know for sure how many jobs were created directly through the program because the Department of Development doesn’t tally this figure. It instead tracks investments data.

Shrinking unemployment rate

Ohio’s overall economic picture has improved, albeit painfully slow. The unemployment rate in the Buckeye State dropped six months in a row from a high of 11 percent in March to 10 percent in September, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But it’s unrealistic to credit any single party for the slow economic uptick – or conversely, blame it for the decline — especially a legislative body with one budget in its short tenure.

Led the Third Frontier campaign

Democrats loudly championed the Third Frontier program, launched under the Republican administration of Gov. Bob Taft. But a lot of state leaders and institutions, including big-city newspapers, the state chamber of commerce and unions got behind the program and share credit for the program’s success at the ballot box last May.

Boosted education money and reworked funding formula

Ohio lawmakers actually cut state aid to schools by about $32 million in the last budget. It was federal money – including stimulus funding dollars — that boosted school funding to 5.5 percent in the current two-year state budget that ends in July 2011.

But Budish is careful to share the acclaim with federal government, a point some Democrats failed to make during the midterm election.

Whether Democrats reformed how schools are funded is the subject of great debate. Budish is referring to Gov. Ted Strickland’s evidence-based school-funding model, approved by the legislature last year as part of the state budget.

The formula ties school money to specific things the model sets aside as important to the quality of education, such as the size of classes and the number of counselors and administrators. But there’s no guarantee the state will have the money to fully fund the model, so the old formula will be in place.

College tuition

The last state budget did freeze college tuition costs, a move engineered by the Strickland and the House Democrats.

So let’s check the tally.

To evaluate Budish’s original claim — ""We have made steady progress creating jobs and improving our schools"" – we’ve looked at each of these five supporting items which Budish provided. And with all but the last one, there were additional critical details you needed to know to have a full understanding of the context, especially Budish’s assertion about tax credits.

"['Environment', 'Recreation', 'Texas', 'Todd Staples']","
Todd Staples says in any year, more Texans hunt or fish than attend all the games of four professional sports teams
","
Seeking re-election earlier this year, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples threw a wake-'em-up line at the Austin American-Statesman's editorial board: ""More people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the... games of the Dallas Cowboys, the Dallas Mavericks, the Houston Texans and the Houston Rockets combined.""

We figured Thanksgiving (ahem, New Orleans Saints vs. Dallas Cowboys, mid-afternoon, Arlington) would be fitting for checking Staples' Aug. 31 comparison of hunting's appeal in Texas to the drawing power of several major sports franchises.

Cody McGregor, Staples' campaign manager, told us via e-mail that Staples based his statement on statistics in a December 2007 report from the National Shooting Sports Foundation. He pointed us to a press release accompanying the report, which states: ""More people hunt and fish in Texas than attend Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans and Houston Rockets games combined (2.68 million vs. 2.6 million).""

And where did these figures come from?

Lance Lemmonds, spokesman for the sportsmen's foundation, told us the hunting and fishing totals for Texas were drawn from a 2006 national survey for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Next, we learned from the agency's website that it commissions the survey every five years (the next one will be taken in 2011). According to the 2006 survey results, 2.64 million Texans went fishing or hunting in 2006.

Lemmonds said an outside firm researched attendance totals for the four sports teams. He said he did not have additional information.

That left us to search for attendance totals. And online, we found home-field attendance figures for each of the franchises for the time period on websites kept by ESPN, the sports cable TV network, and DatabaseBasketball.com, which posts many sports statistics. Anyway, the combined attendance for the franchises approached 2.6 million, a total we reached by adding up attendance for the Cowboys in 2006 (506,308), the Mavericks in 2006-07 (814,009), the Texans in 2006 (561,469) and the Rockets in 2006-07 (678,262). The basketball season extends from fall to summer, so attendance numbers for basketball franchises aren't limited to a single calendar year.

This curve ball: The National Shooting Sports Foundation comparison leaves out attendance at professional baseball games. The Houston Astros drew nearly 2.8 million home fans and the Texas Rangers nearly 2.5 home fans in 2005, according to Baseball Almanac web posts. Swap in the Rangers, say, for the lowest attendance figure that we found (Cowboys, 506,308) and the four-franchise total would be about 4.5 million--far more than the Texans fishing or hunting in the state in 2006.

Then again, in his first-blush response to us, McGregor of Staples' campaign counseled against taking franchise attendance figures at face value. ""The game attendance numbers count a ton of season ticket holders as 'people' attending a game each time they go to a game, but really you should only count a person one time if they attend multiple games of the same franchise in order to make it apples to apples with the hunt/fish number,"" his e-mail said.

Regardless, it looks like a few years ago the state's hunting and fishing enthusiasts exceeded the combined home turnout for the four selected sports franchises.

Next, we tried to corral updated numbers to see whether the statement still held true when Staples spoke to the Statesman.

We added up the home attendance figures for the latest completed seasons for each of the franchises, getting 2.78 million. Next, we contacted the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department in search of an estimate of the people who went fishing or hunting in Texas more recently than the federal survey year of 2006. Harvey said there is no post-2006 count that the agency touts. With the agency's help, though, we divined a way toward a ballpark estimate for Texans who went hunting or fishing last year. First, we determined that the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold to Texans increased 11 percent from 2006 to the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2010. We then multiplied that rate increase by the 2006 federal estimate of Texans who fished and hunted in the state (2.6 million) and added the result to the 2006 figure. Our calculation: More than 2.9 million Texans went hunting or fishing in the state last year.

All told, it's risky business to stake a claim, as Staples did, on a nearly five-year-old federal survey. But more recent numbers suggest that the claim still holds true: More people hunted and fished in Texas than attended home games for the four selected Dallas and Houston sports franchises in their latest completed seasons.

Transparency pledge sparks call for cameras in House Rules Committee
","
Once it was sunshine. The current buzzword for openness in government is transparency. In practice, it means conducting business in public view and access.

Democrats and Republicans alike have espoused the idea publicly, but Ohio Republican John Boehner, Speaker-elect of the House of Representatives, made it his issue in January 2010, when he criticized Democrats for what he called a lack of transparency during debate on health care reform.

""Every issue of national import should be debated by the people's elected representatives in full public view,"" he said.

A call for more transparent government was part of the ""Pledge to America"" promoted by congressional Republicans in September. Boehner put particular importance on the installation of cameras in the hearing room of the powerful House Rules Committee, which was included in the House GOP Congressional Transparency Initiative that Boehner introduced.

Now, the GOP Leader Blog on Boehner's website says Republicans have asked House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Strodel to begin installing video cameras in the Rules Committee hearing room.

The House Rules Committee is the only panel, other than the Intelligence and Ethics committees, not able to telecast proceedings in its main hearing room, the posting on Boehner's blog says. He cites language in a formal request by the panel's ranking Republican, David Dreier of California.

PolitiFact Ohio, never willing to miss a chance to do a little House-keeping, made its own call to the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, which is responsible for the operating infrastructure of Congress.

Dan Weiser, communications director for the chief administrative officer, said it’s true: Rules, Intelligence and Ethics are the only three committees lacking cameras in their main hearing rooms, of 25 committees in the House.

Each committee has its own rules for use of the cameras and for coverage, he added.

In looking at transparency, however, it’s worth noting that C-SPAN, the cable industry's public-affairs network, has upped the ante by asking Boehner for permission to install its own cameras in the main House chamber to cover activities on the floor. C-SPAN now uses the video feed provided by House-owned cameras for its cable telecasts and free online streaming.

Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's founder and chief executive, requested the addition of ""a few small robotically operated cameras in the House chamber,"" and reminded Boehner of his support in January for C-SPAN's request to televise health care negotiations.

""Currently,"" Lamb wrote in a letter to Boehner, ""House floor debates are not in full public view because private news media cameras are still not permitted in the House chamber. Rules established when the House installed its TV cameras in 1979 restrict congressional camera operators to head-on shots of members at the podium and committee tables, and they are prohibited from taking reaction shots or shots of the chamber, leaving viewers with a less-than-complete view of your debates.""

C-SPAN, which said it would make its feed available to accredited news organizations, made similar requests to Republican Newt Gingrich in 1994 and Democrat Nancy Pelosi in 2006.
Boehner press secretary Michael Steel responded that the speaker-elect ""is committed to making the House more transparent and accountable.

Mike Fasano says seven people a day die using prescription drugs
","
In 2009, Florida lawmakers agreed to regulate many of the ""pill mills"" that fuel an epidemic of prescription drug abuse.

Those regulations were set to take effect Nov. 28, 2010, for most pain clinics. But they were stalled by a new law intended to crack down on expensive state regulations. The law, approved Nov. 16 when the Legislature met in a one-day session to override eight vetoes by Gov. Charlie Crist, requires legislative approval of rules that have a measurable fiscal impact on commerce.

The state Department of Health now must determine whether the new rules exceed the threshold and require a legislative sign-off -- if they have a $1 million adverse impact over five years on economic growth, competitiveness, employment, investment, job creation or regulatory costs.

For now, the upshot is that the rules are stalled. What will happen in the meantime?

""What's going to happen is nothing,"" said Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey. ""And seven more people will die each and every day until the Legislature ratifies these rules that are being approved by the Board of Medicine and the Department of Health.""

Fasano was a sponsor of the pain clinic legislation that cracked down on facilities freely dispensing medications being used by drug abusers who were doctor-shopping. Fasano also was critical of the Legislature for passing the new rule-making bill, arguing it needed more study.

For this item, we wanted to examine the scope of the problem. Is Fasano correct that seven people die each day from prescription drug abuse?

Fasano was referring to a 2009 study by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that tracked which drugs were identified in deceased people. The study shows Fasano is correct: 2,488 people died in Florida with at least one prescription drug listed as the cause of death. That works out to an average of 6.8 people per day.

The drug that caused the most deaths (1,185) in 2009 was oxycodone, a strong pain killer. That was followed by benzodiazepines, which are used to treat stress, anxiety and seizures (1,099), methadone (720), alcohol (559), cocaine (529) and morphine (302).

Compared to previous years, prescription drug abuse is significantly higher. In 2005 -- the earliest report on the FDLE website -- oxycodone was only responsible for 340 deaths. That's nearly a 250 percent increase in four years. Benzodiazepines, the drugs used for stress, were listed as the cause of death for 574 people.

One drug that showed a significant drop was cocaine. In 2005, it resulted in 732 deaths, or about 200 more than last year.

Prescription drug deaths have exploded so much that FDLE did not list them as a separate category in 2005, though past reports noted the steady increase of oxycodone-related deaths.

It's worth noting that the report lists all deaths related to prescription drugs -- not only people who got their drugs from pill mills. ""There's no way of telling if they specifically got their meds from a pain clinic,"" said Capt. Robert Alfonso, head of the Pinellas County Sheriff's narcotics unit. ""The only thing we can really quantify is that people are dying from prescription medication.""

Besides clinics that freely dispense hundreds of pills each day, Alfonso also listed prescription fraud as a major problem. People who write fake prescriptions for pain pills can entirely bypass a clinic and head straight to pharmacies. ""There are just so many different aspects of this that are causing problems,"" he said.

Of course, the rise in prescription-related deaths coincides with an explosion in pain clinics. Take two examples from South Florida. The Palm Beach Post reported that 30 new pain clinics opened in Palm Beach County from 2007 to 2009. And in Broward County, clinics swelled from four in 2007 to 115 in 2009. So it's logical -- but not precise -- to link the soaring number of deaths with the growth of pill mills.

Fasano, an advocate for cracking down on unscrupulous pain clinics, underscores his argument for more regulation with an attention-grabbing statistic: an average of seven people die each day from prescription drugs. The numbers from Florida's top law enforcement agency bear him out.

However, not all of the prescription-related deaths originated at pill mills. Experts say that figure is hard to quantify. We rate Fasano's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/24/mike-fasano/mike-fasano-says-seven-people-day-die-using-prescr/

Jack Seiler says Arnold Abbott, 90-year-old, wasn't taken into custody for feeding homeless
","The city of Fort Lauderdale’s latest attempt to regulate outdoor homeless feedings made international news when police nabbed ""Chef Arnold"" -- a 90-year-old caught in the act of such a public feeding. ""One of the police officers said, 'Drop that plate right now,' as if I were carrying a weapon,"" Arnold Abbott said, recalling his early November arrest for the Associated Press. Multiple news reports -- and Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report -- recounted the tale of Abbott’s arrest, which reignited a long-running debate about how the city should handle the homeless population downtown and at the beach. On Nov. 5, Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler issued a statement in which he said he wanted to ""set the record straight"" about the city’s services for homeless. He said that the media had misrepresented the facts. ""Contrary to reports,"" Seiler wrote, ""the City of Fort Lauderdale is not banning groups from feeding the homeless."" Seiler said outdoor feeding is legal, but added that a new city law regulates the activity. Then Seiler addressed the situation regarding Abbott: ""At two recent outdoor food distributions, citations were rightly issued for non-compliance with the process enacted to ensure public health and safety. Contrary to what was reported in the media, no one was taken into custody. ..."" As the public-relations crisis escalated, Seiler gave multiple interviews to the media. On CNN Nov. 11, Seiler said Abbott ""was not arrested and taken into custody."" At PolitiFact Florida we agree with Seiler’s goal of setting the record straight. Was Abbott taken into custody? Fort Lauderdale’s laws about the homeless Abbott’s battle with the city has brought notoriety to Seiler, a former state representative who has been mentioned as a future statewide candidate for the Democrats. Seiler faces re-election to a third term in March. So far, no one has filed to run against him. Abbott, who founded an interfaith volunteer organization Love Thy Neighbor to help the homeless, has been battling city leaders for more than a decade. In 1999, the city tried to ban him from holding picnics for the homeless at the beach, offering him an alternative site miles away from downtown. But Abbott prevailed in court when a judge ruled that the city had violated his religious rights and that the city’s new location was too remote. Abbott resumed his feedings and resumed them in visible locations in Stranahan Park in downtown and along the beach. The battle has continued in recent years, with the commission passing a series of laws that attempted to regulate the homeless population, including a ban on soliciting for money at intersections and tougher laws against defecating in public. City officials, including Seiler, have argued that while the homeless should have access to services, including meals, they have heard complaints from some businesses and residents about the homeless population in downtown. Advocates have decried city officials for cracking down on the homeless with a series of laws. At an Oct. 21 meeting, the commission approved the ordinance about outdoor food distribution over the objection of protesters. The ordinance, approved by the Commission 4-1, codified a list of rules for outdoor food distribution, including that sites must be 500 feet away from residential areas, have bathrooms or portable toilets, equipment for hand washing and consent of the owner. The law allows indoor feedings at houses of worship. ""You have to balance the interests of everybody in the community,"" Seiler told PolitiFact Florida. ""What we always try to do is make sure everybody gets to enjoy our parks. Every single thing we have done with the ordinance is a balance."" But while the law itself doesn’t technically ban outdoor feedings, it raises the bar for groups such as Abbott’s in a way that makes it almost impossible to clear. (Abbott argues that the requirement that he get a port-a-potty should be moot since a public restroom is nearby and he says volunteers wash their hands before feedings and use gloves.) At the time of Seiler’s statement, Abbott had three run-ins with law enforcement related to the outdoor feedings: on Oct. 6, Nov. 2 and Nov. 5, police reports show. (The October arrest predated the new ordinance but the city already had a separate law banning social services in the parks.) On the first two occasions, Abbott was given a warning but then continued with the feedings. The third time, Abbott agreed to end the food distribution that day, police reports say. In none of the three instances was he handcuffed or taken to jail. Instead, he was given notices to appear in court. (In one police report, it states that Abbott shook the police officer’s hand before he left.) At least one other person helping with the feedings was also arrested in a similar manner. A city spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that the case stemming from the Nov. 2 arrest has been filed in court. The city has generally avoided referring to Abbott’s case as an ""arrest,"" but his attorney John David said that just because it’s not a ""custodial arrest"" doesn’t mean it’s not an arrest. For minor crimes, police use this type of arrest and give defendants notices to appear as long as the person has a connection to the area and is likely to show up in court. Nonetheless, ""it's an arrest, no doubt about that,"" David said. ""He is charged with a criminal offense."" Fort Lauderdale police Capt. Rick Maglione told PolitiFact Florida that ""It is similar to a misdemeanor arrest, but we do not have to take the person physically into custody and they can just show up in court and let a judge decide the case."" We interviewed a few criminal defense lawyers in South Florida not involved in the case and they agreed that the police did indeed arrest Abbott. ""With all due respect to the mayor, it is an arrest,"" said Brian Tannebaum, a Miami criminal defense lawyer. ""The fact that someone is not taken into custody does not make it something other than an arrest. Misdemeanor cases are handled with promises to appear all the time. The officer has discretion to take someone into custody, but even if they don't it is still considered an arrest."" City spokesman Chaz Adams told PolitiFact that although a notice to appear is technically an arrest, ""the mayor has been consistent in saying that Mr. Abbott was not ""arrested and taken into custody."" Abbott faces up to a $500 fine and 60 days in jail for each offense. However, lawyers say it’s unlikely that a judge will throw him behind bars. ""I can’t imagine anyone putting Arnold in jail,"" said Broward public defender Howard Finkelstein. His office is not handling the case, but he has praised Abbott. Abbott’s lawyer filed a motion in Broward court on Nov. 12 that asked a judge to enforce the injunction from the earlier case that allowed Abbott to continue the feedings. The city offered Abbott two alternative sites -- at the city’s aquatic complex near the beach, and at Church by the Sea, located near the beach -- but he rejected both. ""I plan to continue my feedings at the same site I have used for the past 23 years,"" Abbott told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Seiler says it’s not his call what penalty Abbott faces. ""We have to enforce the laws, we have to be consistent,"" Seiler told PolitiFact Florida. ""What the courts do with Mr. Abbott -- that’s up to the courts."" Seiler has defended his city’s reputation for serving the homeless, which includes working with nonprofits to provide services and allowing the county-run Homeless Assistance center to expand. The city’s police department also has a homeless outreach unit. Fort Lauderdale’s law about feeding the homeless is part of a growing national trend. Since 2007, 71 cities have attempted or enacted some type of rules related to food-sharing activities, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. ""The best solution to the food-sharing issue is to have indoor meal programs available to the homeless three times a day, seven days a week,"" said Michael Stoops, director of community organizing National Coalition for the Homeless. ""If these locations were located conveniently in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, a good number of the homeless would opt to eat inside vs. outside. However, food-sharing with the homeless in public spaces would still be needed."" Our ruling Seiler said that ""no one was taken into custody"" for feeding the homeless. Seiler is correct that Abbott wasn’t taken into custody -- the activist was not handcuffed or taken to jail but was instead given a notice to appear in court. But his carefully worded claim glosses over the fact that Abbott was indeed arrested on more than one occasion for allegedly feeding the homeless in violation of city ordinances, something that leaves Abbott at least theoretically in peril of being sentenced to jail. Seiler’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/nov/17/jack-seiler/jack-seiler-says-arnold-abbott-90-year-old-wasnt-t/

Does the world agree that China has made 'enormous progress' on human rights?
","During a trip to Beijing this week, President Barack Obama announced major agreements with China, one to reduce carbon emissions and another to increase travel between the two countries. But the visit was not without controversy. During a press conference on Wednesday with Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mark Landler, a White House correspondent for the New York Times, questioned China’s record on human rights and noted that some American media outlets, including his own organization, have experienced difficulty getting residency permits in China. ""I’m wondering in the spirit of these reciprocal visa arrangements that you’ve agreed to this week with business people and students, isn’t it time to extend that sort of right to foreign correspondents who seek to cover your country?"" Landler asked. Xi replied with a rare, unscripted response, telling foreign reporters they need to ""obey China's laws and regulations."" He went on to defend the country’s human rights record. ""Ever since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and especially over the last three decades and more of China's reform and opening era, China has made enormous progress in its human rights,"" Xi said, according to a translation provided by the White House. ""That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world."" When we put the Chinese leader’s statement to the Truth-O-Meter, we found that human rights organizations were not as glowing in their assessments of China’s record on this issue. ""It’s very standard Chinese political rhetoric,"" said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch in an interview with PolitiFact. ""It may be very nice that President Xi wishes his statement is true, but to suggest among other things people in China and around the world uniformly agree is ludicrous."" Attempts to reach a spokesperson with the Chinese embassy were unsuccessful. Some improvements There is some good news. Experts and human rights advocates we spoke with say that improving economic conditions have indeed produced better living conditions for many Chinese citizens. As it is, when Chinese leaders claim progress in human rights, they are mostly referring to ""human welfare,"" said Patrick Keenan, an expert in human rights and international law at the University of Illinois. ""They're thinking about China's incredible economic growth and the ways that that economic growth has improved the lives of poor people in China,"" Keenan said. ""China's growth hasn't helped everyone, of course, but it is true that poor people, on average, are better off than they were a generation ago."" The reform era of the 1970s that opened China’s doors to a degree to the rest of the world resulted in a vast economic expansion, especially in the urban centers. Some social freedoms followed, such as the ability to move or take different jobs. However, such gains only accrued to certain sectors of the population. For example, according to Human Rights Watch, millions of farmers and herders who are Tibetan — an ethnic minority in China — have been subjected to a mass rehousing-and-relocation policy that forced them into socialist villages. And more generally, outside China’s rapidly growing cities, the economic gains have been less significant. There are two other notable areas of progress, each with limits. First, China has signed several international conventions and treaties pertaining to human rights. While there are clear examples of these agreements being ignored, the simple fact that China has agreed to them ""is important because it creates an opportunity to make claims against the state,"" said Richardson of Human Rights Watch. All told, China has signed 10 of the 16 United Nations agreements pertaining to human rights. However, in most cases, China has attached a stated ""reservation"" that says they won’t abide by parts of the agreement that interfere with state laws. For example, while China agreed to an anti-torture convention, it added that it would not recognize a clause that allows the United Nations to investigate suspected torture, thus eliminating the enforcement mechanism. Second, Human Rights Watch notes some growth in civil society within China, such as new legal-aid services to victims of domestic violence, disabled children and other at-risk groups. These services often do not enjoy recognition from the state, though, and their leaders face imprisonment. Still, they represent seeds of change. ""That degree of organization, participation and serving as a counter to the state is incredibly important,"" Richardson said. A long way to go Any acknowledgement that China has made gains on some issues comes with the caveat that the country is ""starting off a much lower base than most,"" said Joshua Castellino, a law professor at Middlesex University in London and at the Irish Center for Human Rights. ""Against (progress), there remain major issues on political participation, freedom of religion, and the use of the death penalty,"" Castellino said. On the death penalty, Human Rights Watch says China ""leads the world in executions."" While the exact number isn’t known, it’s estimated at about 4,000 a year. Additionally, Amnesty International estimates 500,000 people are ""currently enduring punitive detention without charge or trial, and millions are unable to access the legal system to seek redress for their grievances."" Many detained people are activists and political dissidents. China retains a one-party system, meaning citizens have no real choice or say in their government, and the Chinese Communist Party has authority over all judicial and legal proceedings in the country. The Internet has created opportunities for activists to engage, communicate and inform. However, China has aggressively moved to rein in these efforts through widespread censorship and blocking outside content from reaching Internet users in China. (This is known as the ""Great Firewall."") Additionally, the Chinese Communist Party has recently moved to make it easier to charge activists and Internet critics as part of a crackdown on free expression. ""Use of torture to extract confessions is prevalent, and miscarriages of justice are frequent due to weak courts and tight limits on the right to defense,"" according to Human Rights Watch. Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo is serving an 11-year sentence for non-violent protest against the state, while his wife remains under house arrest. Liu’s trial lasted 20 minutes, according to Amnesty International. These types of human rights abuses are deemed necessary by the state to preserve ""social stability,"" Human Rights Watch says. Historically, China has used ""re-education through labor"" — forced labor camps — as a means of punishment. Officials have said they plan to abolish these camps, but so far it appears they have been replaced with other types of detention without trial. In addition, the disabled face discrimination in employment and education opportunities, workplace safety is a major concern, migrant workers cannot get residence permits that allow them access to education and other social services, and women can be punished, including being forced to have abortions, for violating government family planning laws. ""In the U.S., Europe, and many other parts of the world, the idea of human ‘rights’ means things like freedom of religion, assembly, voting rights, anti-discrimination provisions to protect minorities and people with disabilities, and the like. On these measures, China is not doing well,"" Keenan said. ""There is endemic local corruption, abuses of political opponents, restrictions on free expression and assembly, abuses of property rights, discrimination against people who are out of favor with the government, no real voting rights as that idea is understood in the West, and so on."" Our ruling Chinese President Xi Jinping said, ""China has made enormous progress in its human rights. That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world."" There is a grain of truth here: China’s rapid economic growth has lifted millions of its residents, though hardly all of them, out of extreme poverty. Still, China remains an authoritarian state without truly free expression and democratic choice, and where political dissidents and those who practice civil disobedience face harsh penalties. Meanwhile, China executes thousands of people a year and imprisons or forces labor on hundreds of thousands of others with scant due process. Finally, many groups — ethnic minorities, the disabled, and migrant workers, to name a few — remain marginalized by the state. It’s tough to claim ""all the people in the world"" recognize China has made ""enormous gains"" in human rights when groups that monitor human rights and other outside observers continue to find problems with China’s record.

Chris Wallace: Harry Reid 'blocked any vote' on Keystone XL pipeline for years
","The Senate is poised to take up legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline in a few days, causing some to speculate what’s behind the sudden urgency. Legislation approving construction of the controversial pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico, has so far stalled under the Democrat-controlled Senate. Many Democrats oppose Keystone, but some red-state Democrats would like to see it happen. On Fox News Sunday Nov. 16, host Chris Wallace painted the upcoming vote as a last-ditch effort to help Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., as she faces a tight runoff vote against a Republican challenger. Otherwise, why would Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rush to a vote, he asked. ""The Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years,"" Wallace said. Soon after, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., appearing on the show, tried to correct the record -- saying Reid has offered up a Keystone vote multiple times. ""Harry Reid twice offered votes on Keystone on the Shaheen bill,"" Whitehouse said, referring to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. ""And the Republicans refused to allow those votes because they didn’t want the Shaheen bill to pass before the election. It would have been good for her in New Hampshire to pass a major piece of bipartisan legislation like that. So the Republicans had a chance to vote on Keystone and turned it down."" With Whitehouse’s comments in mind, we decided to see if Wallace was correct to say Reid has ""blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years."" The Shaheen bill Back in May, the Senate was considering a bipartisan energy efficiency bill sponsored by Shaheen, a Democrat, and Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. Twice, Reid said he would allow a Keystone pipeline vote if the Senate approved the Shaheen bill first. But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Republicans rejected both offers. It’s a little more complicated than a simple trade, of course, because Reid had blocked several Republican amendments to the Shaheen bill. So, in a sort of protest vote against Reid, who routinely quashes Republican measures, Republicans rejected his offer, killed the Shaheen bill and lost an opportunity to vote on Keystone. One of the amendments that Republicans tried to attach to the Shaheen bill would have approved the Keystone pipeline. Landrieu, Shaheen and Reid made the same offer again in the summer, and Republicans again rejected it. Bottom line: To hear a Democrat tell the story, Republicans passed on an opportunity to vote on Keystone. But to a hear a Republican tell it, Reid attached so many strings to the Keystone vote, that there was no way Republicans would have been able to support it. Other measures The Shaheen bill wasn’t the only time the Senate has considered Keystone legislation in the past couple of years. For example, in March 2012, the Senate voted on a Keystone approval amendment, sponsored by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D. The measure failed, even with some Democrats voting alongside Republicans. In March 2013, the Senate passed a similar Hoeven amendment, 62-37, approving the Keystone pipeline. But the amendment was non-binding -- and thus largely symbolic. The amendment was attached to a Senate budget resolution, which Reid does not have the ability to block. There have been five standalone bills in the Senate seeking Keystone approval, one introduced by Landrieu and four introduced by Hoeven. None have come up for a vote. The House, on the other hand, has approved the Keystone pipeline nine times, according to Congressional Quarterly, most recently on Nov. 14. Of course, none of these measures have made it through the Senate, contributing to Republicans’ complaint that House bills die at Reid’s desk. Our ruling Wallace said ""Reid has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years."" In actuality, several amendments approving Keystone have come up for a vote in the Senate. And Reid and other top Democratic senators have offered Keystone votes several times as part of a broader legislative compromise. But Reid has generally blocked a simple up-or-down vote on the pipeline, using it either as a bargaining chip or by ignoring legislation coming from the House. Wallace’s claim is partially accurate but goes too far by saying ""any vote."" We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/nov/16/chris-wallace/chris-wallace-harry-reid-blocked-any-vote-keystone/

TransCanada CEO says 42,000 Keystone XL pipeline jobs are 'ongoing, enduring'
","With the U.S. Senate poised to vote Tuesday on authorizing construction of the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline, the Sunday news shows drilled down on what the divisive project means for Americans. On ABC’s This Week, host Martha Raddatz quizzed the leader of the company that wants to build the pipeline, TransCanada CEO Russ Girling, about the project’s job creation potential. Girling cited TransCanada’s estimates for 9,000 total positions, and Raddatz countered with estimates from the U.S. State Department, which is tasked with a recommendation on the project to President Barack Obama because it crosses international borders. ""There are others who say the jobs will not be so great, going as low as 4,000 jobs, and that the jobs will only be here for a couple of years,"" Raddatz said. ""The State Department, you mentioned the State Department, says that once the proposed project enters service, operations will require approximately 50 total employees in the U.S."" Girling conceded that actual operating jobs top out at 50, but he said ""that doesn’t include all of the other jobs that come with it."" Referring to the same State Department report that Raddatz mentioned, Girling highlighted its finding for the project’s support of 42,000 ""direct and indirect"" jobs. ""For about two years,"" Raddatz cut in. ""No,"" Girling said, ""the 42,000 jobs is in ongoing, enduring jobs."" Girling made it sound like the State Department’s estimate pertained to permanent -- or at least long-term -- jobs with his description of them as ""ongoing, enduring."" But that is an inaccurate way to evaluate these job creation estimates. The State Department’s January 2014 report, which evaluated the project’s environmental and economic impact for the country, concluded, ""A total of 42,100 jobs throughout the United States would be supported by construction of the proposed Project."" These jobs are measured on an ""average annual"" basis, meaning one position filled for one year. This total reflects both jobs created directly as a result of construction and manufacturing for the pipeline, as well as spinoff jobs supported by construction workers who purchase materials for the project or spend their wages in the economy. According to the State Department, construction would require around 10,400 seasonal workers for stretches that would last either four or eight months. This works out to 3,900 ""average annual"" jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs each year if the project takes two years to finish. The State Department estimates that 26,100 indirect and induced jobs ""would be supported by construction of the proposed project"" during the construction phase. The jobs would be in providing the supply chain to Keystone as well as employee spending on lodging, food, entertainment, health care, etc. Importantly, as Raddatz said, these jobs would only be supported during the construction phase, which is expected to take one to two years. After construction, the pipeline would employ about 50 people, primarily for maintenance. A TransCanada spokesman told us that Girling ""crossed himself"" as he described the project’s benefits for the economy, and that the 42,000 jobs are just during the two-year construction period. ""The point here is many seem to denigrate construction jobs as not meaning much since they are simply ‘part time,’ "" said spokesman James Millar, highlighting the thousands of workers TransCanada paid to build the Keystone pipeline’s base in 2010 and southern leg that opened in January 2014. ""This is the way the profession works."" ""This is one of the largest infrastructure projects on the books in the U.S. right now, it is a $8 billion project so to say it will not benefit American workers and the U.S. economy is ridiculous,"" Millar said. Our ruling Girling shrugged off Raddatz’s point that an estimated 42,000 jobs supported by the Keystone XL pipeline would only last for two years, saying ""no, the 42,000 jobs is in ongoing, enduring jobs."" That description does not apply to 99 percent of the direct, indirect and induced jobs supported by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project, which are temporary and would not last for more than two years.

India Point Park group says proximity to large power lines lowers property values up to 30 percent
","For more than a decade, residents and officials from Providence and East Providence have lobbied to have the high-voltage power lines that traverse the waterfront along India Point Park buried. The latest estimate to complete the job is $33.9 million, with a 25 percent contingency fund, meaning costs could be as low as $25 million or as high as $42 million, according to figures made public by National Grid. The Friends of India Point Park, the group that has led the effort to move the power lines underground and take down the poles and towers that support them, argues that the project is worthwhile, primarily because it will remove what its members contend is a visual blight along the shores of East Providence and Providence. Burying the lines would improve the scenic beauty of the park and make the vacant land abutting it near Route 195 more marketable -- and more valuable, the group argues. ""Proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30%,"" the group says on its website, adding that multiple studies bear this out. We were curious if there really is a negative effect on property values and, if there is, whether  it’s that large. We called David Riley, the co-chairman of Friends of India Point Park, for more information. He sent us a lot of documents and references to back up the claim -- burying us in information, so to speak -- but we decided to start with a paper published in 2010 in the Journal of Real Estate Literature that is cited on his group’s website. That paper, written by a Texas A&M University professor and a colleague, reviewed more than a half-century of studies on the effects of electric transmission lines on property values. The studies included a 1992 survey of appraisers, with the majority of respondents saying that high-voltage power lines would lower the market value of a nearby property by 10 percent on average. They also included sales price analyses. Many were inconclusive or failed to quantify an effect. One 1979 model predicted a 6-percent decrease for homes between 50 and 200 feet of power lines. Another 1995 study said the effect was a drop in value of less than 5 percent and another done in 2002 in an area near Montreal put it at 9.6 percent on average. None mentioned a decrease of 30 percent. ""The studies reviewed, while having some inconsistencies in their detailed results, generally pointed to small or no effects on sales price due to the presence of electric transmission lines,"" the authors said. That didn’t sound like it supported the Providence group’s claim. So we looked at what Riley sent us.  His documents included a summary on the previously cited Montreal study that described the negative price effect as ""ranging from 5% to well in excess of 20%."" We got a copy of that 2002 study. Although it said that the average decrease was smaller, it did find a 21-percent decrease in residential sales prices for an area of homes within 50 feet of high-voltage power lines. We found separate studies in Canada carried out in relation to a power line outside Vancouver that found negative price effects of up to 27 percent for homes in close proximity, according to a report on a transmission line proposal in Alberta. Riley also sent us part of a report on property values near a power line outside of Houston. That 1993 report found that assessed values of properties abutting the easement for the power line were up to 31 percent less than those farther away. And he sent an excerpt from a 2012 report on sales in Montana that found a decrease in the values of homes in a subdivision near a transmission  line of 25 percent to 30 percent. Lastly, we found two references (here and here)  to a study in Quebec that found that values of second home lots near a high-voltage power line along recreational land were up to 34 percent lower than expected. (Because the study is in French -- and our last French class was in high school -- we were reliant on secondary sources that summarized it.) We called Providence-based real estate appraiser Tom Andolfo, who has chaired the Rhode Island chapters of the Appraisal Institute and the Real Estate Appraisers Board, to get his view.  In testimony before state regulators in 1994  on removing the power lines that cross from East Providence to Providence, he cited the 31 percent number from the Houston study. He told us, however, that he believes the actual effect is not as large. ""A realistic figure could be from 5 to 15 percent,"" he said. But Riley said he believes that because the power lines running across East Providence and Providence are on the water, the effect on property values would likely be at the upper range of figures cited in the studies. ""It … seems logical to me that power lines obstructing water views will likely depress property values more than wires in front of, say, buildings, because they'll be more conspicuous and obstructing a more pleasant, valued view that owners are paying for,"" he told us. Our ruling  The Friends of India Point Park says that proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30 percent. There are many studies on the effects of power lines on property values. Nearly all of the ones that  we found determined that there was a negative effect on values. But they differ widely in what that effect actually is. Most put it at less than 10 percent. But we found four studies in the United States and Canada that found decreases that ranged from close to 30 percent to more than 30 percent. They appeared to be isolated cases, but they did occur, according to the studies. The Friends of India Point Park does not say that such a price effect is the norm. The group only says that a decrease in value can be as much as 30 percent. Riley says that language was chosen on purpose. (There’s also some question about what the group means by ""proximity) but we won’t get into that here.) Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- the preponderance of studies showing property value decreases of 10 percent or less --  we rate it Half True.

Mike Martinez says Steve Adler admitted his law firm worked with Koch Industries for nearly a decade
","Austin mayoral hopeful Mike Martinez says his opponent in a December 2014 runoff conceded his law firm helped out Koch Industries, the Kansas-based conglomerate owned by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch whose backing of conservative causes probably doesn’t play well among the city’s preponderance of Democratic voters. Martinez told reporters Nov. 12, 2014: ""Last night, Steve Adler admitted his law firm worked with Koch Industries for nearly a decade. But Steve Adler still hasn’t come clean about what work his law firm did for the Koch Brothers, and how much money they made from it."" By email, Martinez campaign spokesman Nick Hudson said Martinez was referring to Adler telling KVUE-TV, Channel 24 in Austin, for a news story aired Nov. 11, 2014: ""My understanding from talking to my law partner is that back in the ‘70s and into the ‘80s, he did some work advising Koch on some cases; I was not involved in any of those."" Martinez told KVUE: ""If his law firm benefited from working with the Koch brothers, then he benefited from working with the Koch brothers."" Web pages There’s no Koch mention on the website for Barron & Adler LLP, where Adler is described as a co-founding partner. The firm, which focuses on eminent domain and condemnation issues, came to be in 1983, which would have been the year after Adler graduated from law school. Martinez pointed out a description of Adler’s firm that listed Koch Industries among the firm’s ""representative clients"" until it was amended shortly before the Nov. 4, 2014, election that launched Adler and Martinez toward their runoff. Martinez said his campaign’s copy of the FindLaw.com entry listing Koch Industries was downloaded in October 2014. We spotted a similar Koch notation in a FindLaw.com web page for Adler’s firm downloaded by the online Wayback Machine in December 2003. Aside from Koch Industries, proclaimed clients at the time included: May Department Stores, Inc.; McDonald's Corp.; Nations Bank; Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Southland Corp.; Trammell Crow, and Weingarten Realty Investors. And separately at our request, researchers at the Texas State Law Library checked legal directories from the 1980s and emailed us a 1989 Martindale-Hubble Law Directory entry listing Koch Industries among a dozen representative clients of the Austin law firm Barron, Graham & Adler. So, Adler’s firm previously wanted it known it did work for Koch Industries. Attorney interviews Seeking detail about the firm’s Koch work, we spoke by phone with Adler; attorney Mike Barron, described like Adler as a founding partner of the firm; and lawyer/mediator Sam Graham, formerly with the firm. Adler reaffirmed he personally never worked with a Koch company, though he said he believes Barron and possibly another lawyer helped a Koch entity in the 1970s and, he thinks, early-to-mid 1980s. Adler said that after he graduated from law school, he worked for another firm for a year and then did work for the firm which he joined in 1984 or 1985. Generally, Adler told us, his understanding is Koch was asking for the firm’s advice on acquiring pipeline easements in Texas off and on over about a decade. Barron and Graham said in separate interviews Koch enlisted the firm for a spell in the mid-1980s because it wanted to build a private pipeline to carry jet fuel from the Gulf coast near Corpus Christi to San Antonio, Austin, Waco and Dallas/Fort Worth. Koch, Barron said, ""hired us to shepherd them through"" buying rights-of-way from landowners along the desired route. Graham said the firm also was committed to filing eminent-domain lawsuits for Koch if needed to access the desired land. But, Graham said, Koch succeeded in negotiating the rights-of-way without having to go to court. Barron said Koch paid the firm a retainer of about $2,500 or $5,000 and the firm billed monthly against the retainer for its services. He said its advisory work started in 1984 and ended in 1985 or started in 1985 and ended in 1986. Graham said the firm probably made less than $10,000 from the work, which he said took place in 1985 or 1987. Adler might not have been employed by the firm when the Koch work started, Barron and Graham each said, and he was not involved in the Koch work. ""Steve never touched the file,"" which no longer exists, Barron said. ""I did it all."" Koch spokesman singles out Barron To our queries, a Washington, D.C.-based Koch spokesman, Rob Tappan, said by email Barron was the only person at the firm that Koch worked with as it acquired the rights-of-way. Tappan said the pipeline, built in the late 1980s, carries gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Corpus Christi to the Dallas/Fort Worth area with terminals in San Antonio, Austin and Waco. Our ruling Martinez said Adler admitted his law firm worked with Koch Industries for nearly a decade. We’re not judging here whether the firm’s work means anything about Adler vis a vis the Koch brothers and their views. But Adler did say his firm did work for Koch for a number of years, though other lawyers and Koch say the advisory work occurred over a few years. Also, like Adler, they say Adler had no role. We rate Martinez's claim -- which relies on Adler perhaps overstating the Koch activities -- Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Peter Barca']","
Peter Barca: GOP tax breaks 12 times larger for top earners
","The state Assembly’s Democratic leader, veteran Rep. Peter Barca of Kenosha, looked drained and sounded down when asked to explain his party’s poor showing in the Nov. 4, 2014 elections. And it’s no wonder: Democrats failed to recapture either legislative chamber and in the Assembly will face the largest Republican majority since Barca was a toddler in the mid-1950s. Here’s how Barca responded when Wisconsin Public Television’s Frederica Freyberg put the question to him Nov. 7, 2014: ""We’ve got to communicate differently with the middle class, because there’s no question the middle class is much stronger with the Democratic Party. Even in our state, 12 times the tax breaks were for people making over 350 grand than the average middle-class person. We’ve got to go back to the drawing board."" That claim about income tax cuts drew our attention. Democratic candidates around the state, including Mary Burke at the top of the ticket, pounded their GOP opponents over income-tax breaks approved by the Republican-led Legislature and Gov. Scott Walker. They argued the breaks were too tilted to the higher income level. Republicans countered that separate tax cuts Walker signed benefitted earners at all levels. Walker’s second budget, for 2013-’15, lowered income tax rates (while reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four). And later, in 2014, Walker signed legislation that dropped the lowest rate again (from 4.4 percent to 4 percent). Asked to back up the claim, Barca spokeswoman Laura Smith pointed us to a June 2013 report by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper. That report broke down the effect across income groups of the first income tax cuts -- the ones approved in 2013 -- in raw dollar terms. Smith said his mention of the ""average middle class person"" referred to the median household income in Wisconsin. That was $52,627 as of the most recent U.S. Census five-year average. The Fiscal Bureau report shows that in the $50,000 to $60,000 income range, the average tax savings for 2014 was estimated at $112. At the level of $300,000 and above, where Barca’s example of ""350 grand"" falls, the savings were estimated at $1,518. By our math, the top earners’ break is 13.5 times the size of the average group. The study did not calculate what percentage of income those breaks represented. Barca’s analysis, though, leaves out the second tax cut approved by the GOP -- the one in 2014 that dropped the rate for the lowest part of peoples’ incomes. We found a Fiscal Bureau memo from July 2014  that looked at the combined effect of the two cuts. There, the difference is somewhat smaller. The savings for top earners was estimated at $1,402, compared to $161 for those in the $50,000 to $60,000 range -- about 9 times higher for the upper group. That 2014 report presented another way to look at the distribution of the cuts -- a way that accounts for the reality that rate reductions from top to bottom mean that higher earners will get the biggest break, because they are paying the most in taxes. The highest earners will get a cut worth 2 percent of their income, while the ""average"" earners Barca mentioned get a break worth 7 percent. We’re pretty sure most people gauge the worth of their tax breaks in real, spendable dollars, not percentages. But this percentage-of -income way of slicing this highlights the fact that the top tax rates were not cut as much as the lowest tax bracket So top earners got less of a break than others as a percentage of income. This second way of looking at the tax cuts is used to analyze the effects of a tax cut from an ability-to-pay standpoint, a principle that is a feature of a progressive tax system such as Wisconsin’s, we were told by researchers Richard C. Auxier and Norton Francis of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Barca cites accurate figures in making the point that Walker and Republicans could have designed tax reforms to even up the raw dollar savings for different groups, but his claim needs more discussion, they said. Our rating Barca said that Republicans approved 12 times larger tax breaks for ""people making over 350 grand"" than for ""the average middle-class person."" That was accurate for the major tax cuts Walker signed in 2013, but the gap narrows to 9 times larger when all of the GOP income-tax changes are considered, according to a trusted budgetary agency. We rate Barca’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/nov/14/peter-barca/peter-barca-gop-tax-breaks-12-times-larger-top-ear/

Austin consultant says 110 people moving to Austin tomorrow and the next day and the next day
","An Austin political consultant worried recently about the city handling more growth. Lynda Rife, campaign manager for a group that unsuccessfully sought voter approval of a rail-and-roads proposition, said afterward she hopes transportation issues can still be fixed. She told the Austin Monitor: ""110 people will move here tomorrow, and the next day and the next day. I’m hoping that someone is thinking about some kind of solutions."" We were curious whether 110 people a day move to Austin. That's a figure we've seen cited elsewhere, including in 2014 news stories in the Austin American-Statesman, which used it in terms of the estimated number of people moving to the Austin area, not the city of Austin alone. (Mostly recently, a Statesman news story posted online Nov. 1, 2014 said: ""U.S. Census data shows an estimated 110 people a day are moving to Central Texas."") Rife told us by email that she came across the figure in a Feb. 14, 2014, Austin Business Journal news story quoting Ryan Robinson, the city of Austin demographer. That article reported that Robinson mentioned the statistic in a speech, saying it reflects ""net arrivals per day,"" factoring in people who leave the city. ""The state of our union is very, very good,"" Robinson was quoted as saying. A day later, KVUE-TV, Channel 24 in Austin, quoted Robinson saying that every day, 150 people move into the five-county Austin area and 40 residents move out, leaving 110 net migrants. And a March 2014 American-Statesman news story said bureau estimates indicated that since April 2010, net migration into Austin’s five-county metro area was 110 people a day, with an additional 30 per day added, the story said, because area births outpaced deaths.Of the 140 people added each day, the story said, 81 settled in Travis County. Along similar lines, Rife later told us she should have said 110 people are moving to the ""area"" rather than just ""Austin."" Origin of '110' uncertain To our queries, city officials didn’t elaborate on exactly how they reached the 110-a-day figure. We also queried Beverly Kerr, lead researcher with the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, who speculated the figure was based at one time on results of the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey. The 2013 bureau survey, Kerr said by email, suggests 139,096 residents moved into the Austin area over the previous year. That breaks out to 381 people a day moving to Travis, Williamson, Hays, Caldwell or Bastrop counties, which make up the government's definition of the metro area. On a longer timeline, Kerr said, another chamber researcher explored the bureau’s survey results for 2008 through 2012 and calculated that over those years, 308 people a day moved into the region while about 206 people a day moved out, leaving 102 net settlers a day. Census Bureau, state demographer We sought additional insight from the U.S. Census Bureau and a state expert. Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman, said by email that according to its estimates, Austin grew by 20,993 residents from July 2012 through June 2013. That breaks out to net growth in the city of nearly 58 residents a day, Bernstein advised. Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, said that per the bureau’s resident population estimates for April 2010 through June 2013, Austin’s population grew by about 63 people a day with migrants into the city accounting for 39 of the daily newbies, he said. By phone, Potter said the estimates -- based on sources including federal tax returns -- also roll in the effect of local births outpacing deaths. According to the bureau’s estimates, Potter said, an average of 141 people a day moved to the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in the same period. Potter said these estimates further suggest the Austin-area counties netted 93 migrants a day -- a figure taking into account some residents leaving. Bernstein, asked if the bureau had more Austin-specific detail, replied that according to other agency estimates, nearly 236 people a day moved into Austin from elsewhere in Texas, other states or abroad in 2013. Notably, Bernstein said, this figure doesn’t include additional Austin residents due to births outpacing deaths. Another bureau official offered a different calculation for the latest survey year, forwarded to us by Bernstein, suggesting 80,619 people moved to Austin from within the U.S. -- an average 221 movers-in a day. Another 10,988 newcomers were estimated to have landed in Austin from other countries -- an average 30 a day. In contrast, 77,103 Austin residents left for another U.S. location, the bureau estimates, an average 211 a day. By movers in and movers out alone, the figures suggest, Austin’s population increased about 40 people a day. Our ruling Rife said 110 people move to Austin a day. We failed to pin the basis for this oft-aired figure, but it is in the ballpark with federal estimates of the number of people recently moving into the city's five-county region. But Austin alone? The latest estimates we found for the city -- the entity most affected by the road-and-rails package Rife was discussing when she declared her 110 -- signal that even more people move into the city each day. Yet that's counterbalanced by nearly as many people moving out -- leaving a balance of perhaps 40 to 60 settled newcomers a day. We rate the 110-a-day-to-Austin statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Isakson off on specifics about income tax fraud ranking
","Many of us wonder whether we’re exposing ourselves to identity theft with credit card and debit card purchases, especially after security breaches at some big-box retailers. Identity theft is generally considered the fastest-growing crime in America, so that’s probably not so far-fetched. But in reality, authorities say, identity thieves for the past several years have focused increasingly on income tax fraud. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it paid $5.2 billion in fraudulent refunds in 2013 and caught an additional $24.2 billion of such refunds, according to a September report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Last month, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators -- including Georgia’s Johnny Isakson -- called on IRS Commissioner John Koskinsen to update Congress on the agency’s efforts to stop tax refund fraud related to identity theft. ""Tax frauds costs hardworking Americans billions of dollars and further undermines taxpayers’ confidence in our taxpayer system,"" said Isakson, a member of the Senate Finance Committee who is set to announce re-election plans next week. In a press release, Isakson said he has continually pressed the IRS on the issue, noting that ""Georgia ranks second-highest in the country in the number of fraudulent tax refund claims."" Could that be right?  We decided to check. Amanda Maddox, Isakson’s spokeswoman, said the statement was based on data from the Federal Trade Commission and backed up with information from the IRS. The FTC report that Maddox supplied us is based on ""unverified complaints reported by consumers"" during 2013. The report shows Florida had the highest number of identity theft complaints per capita at 192.9 per 1,000 residents. Georgia was second with 134.1 per thousand, or 13,402, followed by California, Michigan and Nevada. But that includes all types of identity theft complaints. It also doesn’t include any individual state data on complaints about identity theft related to income tax fraud -- what Isakson’s talking about. Maddox told PolitiFact that information she’d just received from the IRS showed Georgia ranked third in per-capita tax-related identity theft (at 0.7 percent in both 2012 and 2014). Tax fraud from identity theft with Georgia connections has made headlines both inside and outside the state. In April, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced that 56 people had been charge or already pleaded guilty in a stolen ID and tax fraud scheme based out of Statesboro. Just last month, a Georgia man pleaded guilty to his role in a $2 million tax refund conspiracy that used state prison inmates’ identities to create bogus tax returns in 2010 and 2011. Three women – all from Georgia – had already pleaded guilty to wire fraud in the case. In January, the IRS announced that Georgia, Florida and the District of Columbia had been chosen for the pilot program because they see ""the highest per-capita percentage of tax-related identity theft."" Yet Mark Green, an IRS spokesman in Atlanta, said: ""There is no ranking per se."" The IRS does not have any state-level data that would show exactly how Georgia, or any state, fares in the overall problem, he said. Maddox provided a spreadsheet from April 2013, which she said the IRS gave to the Senate Special Committee on Aging. The spreadsheet, which the IRS confirmed was its data, showed that Georgia ranked No. 3 in enforcement action against identity theft, with 156 enforcement actions. But the data do not match up with other IRS data, including the presumptive top three problem spots targeted with the pilot program. The spreadsheet shows the top three, in order, are Florida (443), Puerto Rico (374) and then Georgia. The District of Columbia, part of the pilot program for supposedly having a serious problem, shows just one enforcement action. That ties it with five other jurisdictions for the least enforcement actions taken in fiscal 2013. Karen Barney, a spokeswoman for the Identity Resource Center in San Diego, said Georgia was second behind Florida for the past three years in complaints about identity theft involving government documents or benefits fraud. This category of identity fraud includes income tax fraud, she said. Our conclusion: Isakson’s claim that Georgia ranks second when it comes to fraudulent tax refund claims is based on at least one federal report. But that report examines complaints, not verifiable incidents. To be certain, Georgia has a serious problem. The senator would have been accurate if he had said as much, or said that Georgia shows near the top of states with such problems. But Isakson misreads that data to show a specific rank where none exists. We rate his claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2014/nov/14/johnny-isakson/Isakson-off-about-income-tax-fraud-ranking/

Medical marijuana amendment was more popular than winning governors, group says
","Floridians turned down a state constitutional amendment for medical marijuana, but it’s clear a majority of voters were all for the idea. Amendment 2, which would have changed the state’s Constitution to allow the sale of cannabis for ""certain medical conditions"" such as cancer and Parkinson’s disease, rang up 57.6 percent of the vote. Unfortunately for the measure’s supporters, amendments require at least 60 percent of the vote to pass. That close margin means that medical marijuana will continue to be debated, and not just in Florida. Two dozen states have medical marijuana laws, and Oregon and the District of Columbia voted to decriminalize recreational pot in the same general election. Ben Pollara, the campaign manager for the group behind the amendment, United for Care, tweeted two days after the election that the drug proved more popular than Florida’s governors. The tweet read: ""#YesOn2 got a higher % of the vote than the last 6 #flgov including @JebBush in his 2002 landslide #tallyorbust #2016.""    We know the last couple of elections Gov. Rick Scott hasn’t even had to break 50 percent of the total votes in order to win, but is Pollara right about the last six Florida governors not garnering as much as 57.6 percent?   The voting rolls The Twitter shorthand ""#flgov"" generally refers to the gubernatorial campaign, but has been used interchangeably to denote any tweet about a governor, too. We reached out to Pollara to ask him to clarify whether he meant the last six governors or the last six gubernatorial elections, because there’s a difference. Pollara told us he meant the last six gubernatorial elections, going back to Lawton Chiles’ victory over Jeb Bush in 1994. But because of the tweet’s wording, we looked at the last six governors elected, some of whom served two terms, going back to the 1978 campaign. Keep in mind, we’re looking for governors who won 57.6 percent of the vote or higher.   Election year Governor Winning votes Total votes Percentage 1978 Bob Graham 1,406,580 2,530,468 55.6% 1982 Bob Graham 1,739,553 2,688,566 64.7% 1986 Bob Martinez 1,847,525 3,386,171 54.6% 1990 Lawton Chiles 1,995,206 3,530,871 56.5% 1994 Lawton Chiles 2,135,008 4,206,659 50.8% 1998 Jeb Bush 2,191,105 3,964,441 55.3% 2002 Jeb Bush 2,856,845 5,100,581 56.0% 2006 Charlie Crist 2,519,845 4,829,270 52.2% 2010 Rick Scott 2,619,335 5,359,735 48.9% 2014 Rick Scott 2,865,075 5,950,867 48.2% Source: Florida Department of State, Division of Elections If we were to look only at the last six elections, Pollara could be correct, because the highest margin of victory going back to 1994 was Bush’s 56 percent in 2002 against Bill McBride. As Pollara noted when we contacted him, if you’re counting that way, it could be the last eight elections. But if we’re going by individuals elected governor, there’s one obvious outlier: Graham, who was immensely popular and beat Republican state legislator Skip Bafalis with 64.7 percent of the vote in 1982. For comparison, Amendment 2 garnered 3,370,323 out of 5,849,118 votes cast for the measure to get that 57.6 percent. That’s more individual votes than any winning candidate has ever received. Our ruling Pollara said Amendment 2 won a higher percentage of the vote than the last six Florida governors, including Bush’s 2002 landslide. He’s right about the 2002 contest, and when you look back at the last six elections (eight, really) as Pollara intended, that’s true, too. But there’s a glaring outlier when you look at the last six people elected governor -- Graham’s 1982 win, when he garnered 64.7 percent of the vote.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Nancy Pelosi says she doesn't know who Jonathan Gruber is
","Just days after a Republican sweep in the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats found themselves with an embarrassing development on the Obamacare front. The controversy involved Jonathan Gruber, a leading health care economist whose work is widely cited as underpinning the Affordable Care Act and who advised the Obama administration as the law was being drawn up. (This prior fact-check we did runs down Gruber’s involvement. We’ve also interviewed him from time to time as an expert on the law.) Critics of the law located a video from a 2013 conference at the University of Pennsylvania in which Gruber said some impolitic things about how the law was put together, including a remark about ""the stupidity of the American voter."" Gruber’s remarks addressed the idea of a ""community rating,"" the notion that health insurance is least expensive when everyone -- sick and healthy, old and young -- is required to buy health insurance. Doing it this way keeps rates down by sharing health care costs across a larger population, but it typically requires forcing people to have health insurance through a mechanism like penalties for refusing to purchase insurance, which the law includes. Gruber also addressed how various aspects of the law were massaged in order to make the law more palatable to lawmakers and, ultimately, to voters. Here’s the full version of what he said, beginning at about the 20:30 mark. ""Mark"" refers to Mark Pauly, a fellow health care economist who was on the panel with Gruber. ""Mark made a couple of comments that I do want to take issue with -- one about transparency in financing, and the other is about moving from community rating to risk-rated subsidies. It’s just -- you can’t do it, politically. You just literally cannot do it. Not just transparent financing but also transparent spending.  ""This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure (the Congressional Budget Office) did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay? So it's written to do that. In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in — you made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money — it would not have passed. Okay? Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.  ""And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get the thing to pass. ... Look, I wish Mark was right that we could make it all transparent, but I'd rather have this law than not. … Yeah, there are things I wish I could change but I’d rather have this law than not. And I think that involves some trade-offs that we don’t prefer as economists but which are realistic."" There’s a lot of high wonkiness here, but two aspects outraged critics of the law. First was Gruber’s use of the word ""stupidity"" to describe the American voter. And second was his defense of a ""lack of transparency"" when the law was being debated. On Nov. 11, not long after the controversy broke, Gruber offered MSNBC’s Ronan Farrow an apology. ""The comments in the video were made at an academic conference,"" Gruber said. ""I was speaking off the cuff, and I basically spoke inappropriately and I regret having made those comments."" In the meantime, Democratic officials began to distance themselves from Gruber. Few did so as aggressively as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who had shepherded the law through the House when she was speaker in 2010. In response to a question in a Nov. 13 press conference, Pelosi told the reporter, ""Well, you gave an interesting set of observations, but one that you skipped is Mr. Gruber's comments were a year old, and he has backtracked from most of them. He's not even advocating the position that he was at some conference. So I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill. With all due respect to your question, you have a person who wasn't writing our bill, commenting on what was going on when we were writing our bill, who has withdrawn some of the statements that he made. So let’s put him aside."" We decided to take a look at Pelosi’s claim that, referring to Gruber, ""I don't know who he is."" Given Gruber’s prominence in the field of health care policymaking, it would be odd if Pelosi had never heard of him. Certainly her staff did -- on Dec. 1, 2009, they issued a news release titled ""Health Insurance Reform Mythbuster - ‘Health Reform And Insurance Premiums’ "" that cites Gruber by name seven times. (It’s no longer on Pelosi’s site but is archived here.) Still, the fact that her aides knew about Gruber isn’t a smoking gun that she did. The smoking gun instead comes from video of a news conference she held on Nov. 5, 2009. During that news conference, she addressed differences between the bill she was backing and one offered by Republicans: ""We're not finished getting all of our reports back from CBO, but we'll have a side-by-side to compare. But our bill brings down rates. I don't know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT's analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo, versus what will happen in our bill for those who seek insurance within the exchange. And our bill takes down those costs, even from now, and much less preventing the upward spiral."" When this 2009 comment came to light, the Washington Post reported that Pelosi's office told them that the minority leader ""meant that she didn't know Gruber personally."" Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told the Post that Pelosi ""said she doesn’t 'know who he is,' not that she’s 'never heard of him.’ "" When we asked Hammill if he wished to elaborate, he told PolitiFact, ""We've cited the work of dozens upon dozens of economists over the years. As the leader said today, Mr. Gruber played no role in drafting our bill."" (He also directed us to a document produced by Pelosi’s office rebutting some of the claims surrounding what Gruber said.) It’s not clear whether Gruber played a direct role in drafting the House bill -- though he certainly advised the Obama administration in the process of passing the health care overhaul, and there’s little doubt that the ACA shares much in common with the Massachusetts bill Gruber did help devise. But there’s little doubt that Pelosi’s claim from the Nov. 13 press conference -- that ""I don't know who (Gruber) is"" -- is inaccurate. Our ruling Pelosi said, ""I don't know who (Jonathan Gruber) is."" Video showing Pelosi citing Gruber’s work offers the clearest evidence that she did indeed know who he was, and even her office now acknowledges that she meant to say that she didn't know Gruber personally. Even if the latter is true, that’s not what she said at the press conference, so we rate her claim False.",/factchecks/2014/nov/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-she-doesnt-know-who-jonathan-gru/

Brit Hume: 'Senior citizens, not Hispanics' are fastest-growing demographic in U.S.
","Conventional wisdom is that the changing landscape of the American electorate -- i.e. the influx of Hispanic voters -- is good news for Democrats. But Fox News analyst Brit Hume turned the idea on its head during his post-election analysis. The fastest-growing segment of the country is old people, Hume said. And that’s good news for the Grand Old Party. ""It is senior citizens, not Hispanics, who are the fastest-growing demographic in this country,"" Hume said. ""Hispanics are clearly the fastest-growing ethnic group in the country, but their size as a group is dwarfed by the 65 and older demographic which has been trending Republican,"" Hume continued. ""If the GOP continues to make gains, it may more than offset any advantage Democrats have with the ethnic groups."" The simple question here is: Are senior citizens, and not Hispanics, the fastest-growing demographic in the United States? (Hume did not respond to our requests for more information.) Looking at the past Every two years, the U.S. Census Bureau produces a report that breaks down eligible voters by race, ethnicity and age. Of particular significance for tracking the Hispanic vote, it culls out noncitizens. This table, based on the Census Bureau data, shows that in no decade did the senior group grow at a faster rate than Hispanics. (All numbers are shown in thousands) Group 1980 1990 Growth 1980-90 2000 Growth 1990-00 2010 Growth 2000-10 Hispanic 18+ 5,565 8,566 +53.9% 13,158 +53.6% 21,285 +61.8% 65+ 23,514 29,192 +24.1% 31,815 +9.0% 37,745 +18.6%   It’s the same case for the raw number of eligible voters, except for the 1980-90 period. So in present terms, Hume’s case appears weak. Looking ahead As a general rule, we at PunditFact don’t assess predictions, but we can compare Hume’s sense of the future to what the Census Bureau tells us to expect. Here, Hume finds a bit more support. There is one decade, between 2020 and 2030, when the senior population is estimated to grow by 30 percent while the Hispanic group would increase by 26 percent. (Note: These estimates look only at population, not voter turnout. The Census does not project voter turnout. Again, the numbers shown here are in thousands.) Group 2010 2020 Growth 2010-20 2030 Growth 2020-30 2040 Growth 2030-40 Hispanic 18+ 21,285 43,407 103.9% 54,827 26.3% 67,309 22.8% 65+ 37,745 55,969 48.3% 72,774 30.0% 79,719 9.5%   The same pattern holds true when we look at the absolute change in population. Group 2010 2020 Growth 2010-20 2030 Growth 2020-30 2040 Growth 2030-40 Hispanic 18+ 21,285 43,407 22,122 54,827 11,420 67,309 12,482 65+ 37,745 55,969 18,224 72,774 16,805 79,719 6,945   A few important caveats In Hume’s framework, voters are either seniors or Hispanic, but of course, some will be both. By focusing on seniors, Hume seems to assume that age, rather than ethnicity, does more to shape a person’s vote. That might or might not be true, and it’s actually the diciest part of any comparison. Also, there is no question that seniors actually get to the polls much more reliably than Hispanics. In the 2010 elections, about 61 percent of seniors voted. The Hispanic rate was half that, just 31 percent. Now couple that with the higher number of seniors, 37.7 million in 2010 compared to 21.2 million Hispanic voters, and you can see where Hume has a point completely apart from how fast each group is growing. If Republicans get 57 percent of the seniors who vote, and Democrats get 70 percent of the Hispanics who vote, the Republicans come out ahead 13.1 million seniors to 4.6 million Hispanics. We could get into more complex calculations involving presidential races, the electoral college, and the concentration of Hispanics in certain states, but we’ll leave that for fivethirtyeight.com. Our ruling Hume said seniors, not Hispanics, are the fastest-growing demographic. The Census Bureau numbers tell us that’s not accurate right now. Historically, the Hispanic population has grown faster than the senior population. The Hispanic group will continue to grow faster until about 2020, according to Census Bureau projections. In the decade after that, the senior group is projected to grow at a faster rate, but then after 2030, the growth rate for Hispanics is higher once again. Hume’s electoral analysis (based on seniors showing up to vote) was more on target than the trend he cited as evidence, but we only deal with his factual statement, which aligns with Census numbers in one decade out of five. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/nov/13/brit-hume/hume-senior-vote-growing-faster-hispanic/

Ted Cruz: Net neutrality regulations put government in charge of Internet prices, services
","Net neutrality is the ""biggest regulatory threat to the Internet,"" according to Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz took to social media to denounce a policy from President Barack Obama on Nov. 10 that was seen as a big step in favor of net neutrality. Obama said he wanted ""the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality."" Cruz called the proposal ""Obamacare for the Internet"" on Twitter, and he got more specific in his complaint on Facebook.  We wanted to fact-check if net neutrality would in fact put the government in charge of ""determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered."" We found that Cruz is mostly talking about a slippery slope. With Obama’s proposed rules, the Federal Communications Commission could theoretically impose regulations on Internet prices and products -- but the scope of those regulations would be limited. And Obama specifically called on the FCC not to regulate Internet prices. For us, Cruz’s statement conjured images of FCC officials sitting around a table and drafting household Internet service plans. That’s not what Obama is proposing. What is net neutrality? First, a quick primer on net neutrality, which is a pretty complicated topic. The New York Times’ Upshot framed the issue well, comparing it with the difference between electricity and cable TV. For electricity, people pay a monthly bill, the electricity comes into the house, and they use the electricity however they see fit, using whatever electrical devices they want. These same people pay a monthly bill for cable television, but the cable company gets to pick out the channels for the cable packages. These packages are often constructed based on financial agreements between the cable provider and the TV channels. Supporters of net neutrality think Internet service should operate like electricity. Consumers pay a fee to an Internet service provider (like Comcast and Verizon), and they get equal access to the whole Internet -- every website, big and small -- without any interference from the service providers. But this isn’t possible without some government regulation. The FCC makes the final call on how the government regulates the Internet, and the agency is in the process of designing regulations, after a federal appeals court struck down standing FCC net neutrality protection rules in January. Some Internet service providers, however, don’t want this kind of government regulation. Regulations would stop Internet service providers from entering into financial arrangements that would give particular websites prioritized access to Internet users (kind of like cable companies’ arrangements with cable channels). For example, Netflix has a financial agreement with Comcast so that the video streaming website will have better access to customers. Proponents of net neutrality worry that if this trend continues, websites that are able and willing to pay Internet service providers for prioritized access to consumers would have an unfair advantage over smaller operations or startups. In order to stop this trend and protect net neutrality, Obama said the FCC should ""reclassify"" Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning they would be treated as public utilities, such as phone service. Currently, the Internet is classified as an ""information service,"" which greatly limits how much the FCC can regulate it. Under the common carrier classification, however, Internet service providers would not be allowed to give advantages to particular websites. Cruz and other critics of Obama’s proposal think reclassification would create a lot of red tape for Internet service providers. We asked Cruz’s staff for evidence to back up his claim, and they noted some potential impact of Obama’s net neutrality proposal -- pointing to studies that said more Internet regulation could harm the economy and kill jobs. ""The president’s call for the FCC to designate the Internet a public utility means that the  five unelected bureaucrats at the FCC will become the arbiters of pricing, terms of service, and types of products delivered,"" said Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier. ""This changes a relentlessly innovative and growing part of our economy into one that must wait for permission for any new ideas."" It’s a bit more nuanced, though. Prices In theory, Title II would give the FCC some say over Internet service providers’ prices. However, Obama urged the FCC to also adopt a forbearance against price regulation. A forbearance is a legal way of choosing not to enforce part of the law that is unnecessary or irrelevant. ""I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act — while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services,"" Obama said. But let’s talk about what would happen if the FCC reclassified Internet service providers under Title II without that forbearance, just for kicks. Under Title II, the FCC is authorized to ""determine and prescribe"" charges. However, this does not mean that the agency would decide what prices should be and force companies to abide by them. What would happen is that Internet service providers would set their own prices, and the FCC would intervene if it thinks those prices are ""unjust or unreasonable."" The idea is that if a service provider is the only operator in an area, it should not be able to hike up consumer costs unreasonably, knowing the consumers don’t have access to a cheaper option. Even this limited level of price regulation likely wouldn’t be sustainable, said Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge, an open Internet advocacy group. The FCC doesn’t enforce price regulations for other Title II services, like mobile phones and land lines, and has had trouble defending price caps in court. ""As a practical matter, that’s totally not going to happen,"" Feld said. Brent Skorup, a telecommunications research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center and an opponent of net neutrality regulations, said he thinks Cruz’s statement is fair, because of the authority Title II gives the FCC. But he agreed that any price regulation would likely be ""short lived"" because of Obama’s call for a forbearance and precedent concerning other Title II services. Products and terms of service If Internet service is reclassified under Title II, the FCC would have limited authority over the products that Internet service providers can offer. Like the pricing issue, this isn’t to say that FCC officials would draft up Internet service packages that a service provider would have to offer consumers -- the companies would still do that themselves. But if an Internet service provider offers a product that gives undue advantage to particular websites, the FCC could stop them -- and the FCC would decide what constitutes an undue advantage. In this case, the ""product"" would be an Internet service package that involves giving particular websites paid prioritization. For the most part, experts we spoke with said this would be -- to some degree -- government oversight of a particular product. Supporters of Obama’s proposal, though, said Cruz mischaracterizes the extent of government control. Feld described it this way: The rules are such that the FCC wouldn’t be able to stop an Internet service provider from offering a particular product unless that particular product (in this case paid prioritization) prevents other companies from having a fair shot at reaching that consumer. Evan Engstrom, policy director of tech advocacy group Engine, said the regulations aren’t about dictating what products a company can offer -- they’re about preventing ""egregious market abuses."" Saying net neutrality means government regulation of products and services is ""like saying laws against extortion put the government in charge of determining what sorts of ‘protection services’ the Mafia can offer,"" Engstrom said. Feld noted that even under Title II, it’s possible that an Internet service provider could find a way to offer products with paid prioritization anyway. Like Obama’s proposed forbearance against price regulation, Feld said it would be possible for an Internet service provider to petition the FCC for a forbearance against blocking a particular product. Our ruling Cruz said, Obama’s net neutrality proposal ""puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service and what types of products and services can be delivered."" While theoretically possible, Obama said specifically that he does not want the FCC to regulate Internet prices, and the FCC typically does not regulate prices for similar things, such as telephone services. In terms of product offerings, the proposal would allow the FCC to prevent Internet service providers from giving certain websites priority over others. But Cruz’s statement conjures an image of FCC officials sitting around a table designing Internet service packages and their prices, and this is not what Obama is proposing.

Jose Diaz-Balart: 1,000 deportations every day, vast majority aren't criminals
","As part of his post-election analysis, Telemundo news anchor and MSNBC host Jose Diaz-Balart argued that the Hispanic vote remains up for grabs going forward because politicians of both parties seem uninterested in addressing Hispanics’ concerns. ""Every single day in this country, 1,000 people are deported and the vast majority of those people that are deported aren't criminals,"" Diaz-Balart said on NBC’s Meet the Press Nov. 9, 2014. ""The people that are being deported many times are family, fathers and mothers and those people don't see anyone in Washington standing up and saying, let's deal with this problem."" We’ll stay out of the politics of the issue, but we were curious about Diaz-Balart’s claim that 1,000 people are deported every day and that the vast majority aren’t criminals. Deportation lingo Before we break down the numbers, it’s important to note that officials no longer use the word ""deportation"" to describe immigration enforcement actions. What we commonly think of as deportation can include two categories -- returns and removals. ""The return process is more informal,"" said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of immigration policy studies at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group that counts among its funders the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the World Bank. ""It generally takes place at the border and there’s no judicial order and no real penalty."" Basically with a return, a person gets caught and agrees to go back home. Authorities retain a record of their entry and can use that against them if they show up again. Most returns happen right at the border. A removal is more formal. There’s nothing voluntary about it. It comes with an official order, either from a judge or one of two immigration control agencies. If the person is caught again, he or she may face criminal penalties. Based on the numbers he used, Diaz-Balart focused solely on removals in making his comments. In fact, he has talked about these exact removal stats before (without the additional note that the ""vast majority"" were non-criminal cases). Diaz-Balart’s claim by the numbers Representatives for Diaz-Balart said he relied on data from the Department of Homeland Security. In 2013, according to Homeland Security, more than 438,000 people were subject to removal. That is the highest number ever. Of those, 45 percent faced some kind of criminal charge; 55 percent did not. The following table, based on Homeland Security data, shows the trends during President Barack Obama’s time in office. How do those numbers match Diaz-Balart’s statement? More than 1,000 people per day, on average, have been removed from the country since Obama has been president. In 2013, an average of 1,200 people per day were removed. But non-criminals no longer make up the ""vast majority"" of removals and have not since 2009, as Diaz-Balart claimed. ""It’s not accurate to say that the vast majority are non-criminals,"" Rosenblum said. ""It’s a bare majority."" If you include returns in the calculation (178,000 in 2013) Diaz-Balart would be correct that the vast majority are non-criminals but would have understated the daily average of returns and removals by close to 700 per day. A note about those criminals While the percentage of criminal removals is high (45 percent), there’s enough evidence to tell us this category itself should be viewed with care. Homeland Security reports that violations of immigration law represent nearly a third of the cases. Another 15 percent are criminal traffic offenses. We can’t draw a definitive line between minor and more serious offenses. But the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a big data center at Syracuse University, examined cases handled by courts — a subset of all the removal actions — and found about 90 percent of the convictions there have been for illegal entry or re-entry. (In short, these people’s crime is entering the country illegally in the first place.) Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis School of Law, said his reading of the record tells him immigration officials define criminality quite broadly. ""Throughout the Obama years, the data has shown that removals based on non-criminal or minor criminal offenses, such as driving without a license, have greatly outnumbered the removals of serious criminal offenders,"" Johnson said. Our ruling Diaz-Balart said that 1,000 people are deported each day and the vast majority are not criminals. Diaz-Balart is right that 1,000 people a day on average are formally removed from the country. In fact, in 2013, it was 1,200 per day. But he reached too far by saying the ""vast majority"" are not criminals. Strictly speaking, non-criminal removals only slightly outnumber the people removed under the cloud of a criminal charge. Those crimes in many cases include entering the country illegally or overstaying a visa. But they are still crimes. The statement is partially accurate.

Scott Walker: Obama visit failed to boost Democratic turnout in Milwaukee
","National conservative talkers hailed Gov. Scott Walker as a ""rock star"" and a ""genuine hero"" after the Republican won his third statewide election in a row -- the latest coming two years after Democrat Barack Obama won Wisconsin handily. On Nov. 7, 2014, Walker told one of those fans, syndicated TV and radio host Sean Hannity, that he did it despite Obama’s pre-election visit to Milwaukee’s central city. ""The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn't even (increase) the vote there,"" Walker said of Democrats. Before the details of Walker’s win begins to fade away, let’s check his claim that Obama couldn’t boost the Democratic turnout in the Nov. 4, 2014 election, in which Walker topped Democrat Mary Burke. On Oct. 28, 2014, Obama joined Burke, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee at North Division High School in the heart of the city’s predominantly African-American north side. The rally for Burke drew an overflow crowd estimated at 3,500, and Obama lightheartedly pleaded with attendees to back Burke. ""Grab your friends, and grab your coworkers, and grab the lazy cousin who’s sitting at home, never votes during the midterm elections,"" the president said. ""He’s watching reruns of old Packer games. Just grab him up. Take all of them to cast their ballot, and cast their ballot for Mary Burke."" The high school is a voting site (Ward 143) on Election Day, and Walker was right that in the 2012 presidential race Obama won 99 percent in that ward amid turnout that -- following historical patterns -- was larger than in non-presidential years. The crowd at North Division was the biggest of the campaign season for either side and appeared to energize Democrats, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. But on Election Day, did Obama’s urging work? Digging into the claim Walker didn’t specify what election he was comparing to the turnout in the Nov. 4, 2014 contest. It could have been the 2012 presidential race. Turnout then was much higher compared to the 2014 governor’s race. But the most logical starting point is the most recent governor’s race. That would be the June 2012 special election, prompted by the recall drive that followed Walker’s surprise move to sharply curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. Walker seemed to be focused specifically on that one ward. And, indeed, turnout in Ward 143 was down 9 percent from June 2012. If you look at city turnout overall, it’s the same story. In June 2012, turnout topped 73% of pre-registered Milwaukee voters, reflecting the intensity of a race that riveted the state for months. More than 223,000 Milwaukeeans voted in that race, with three-fourths backing Barrett. The tally of those in Milwaukee who voted Democratic in the recall race was 171,150. In the 2014 Walker-Burke race, that number fell to 156,167. What if you go back to the 2010 governor’s race, which also pitted Barrett and Walker? That was the last regularly scheduled governor’s race, so the dynamics are more comparable. The results are mixed. Ward 143 (then known as Ward 109, before maps were redrawn after 2010) produced a higher Democratic vote for governor in 2010 than in 2014. So, by that measure Walker is on the money. But the citywide Democratic turnout in 2014 the turnout was higher than that in 2010. Burke drew 13 percent more Milwaukee votes in 2014 than Barrett did in 2010. Our rating Walker said: ""The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn't even (increase) the vote there."" The numbers back him up: turnout in that ward -- and citywide was down, and so were the votes for Democrats in 2014 when compared to the most recent governor’s race, the 2012 recall. Turnout also was down in that ward compared to the 2010 turnout in Walker’s first race, though citywide it was higher in 2014 than four years earlier.

Congress has 11% approval ratings but 96% incumbent reelection rate, meme says
","It would be an understatement to say that voters in the recently completed midterm elections didn’t exactly feel warm and fuzzy about incumbents on the ballot this year -- even about the ones they voted for. According to the 2014 exit poll of voters, 59 percent of those who voted said they weren’t happy with Republican leadership in Congress, even as they were handing control of the Senate to the GOP. A meme making its way around social media, sent to PolitiFact by a reader, captured the frustration many Americans felt. The meme said, ""11% approval ratings. 96.4% re-elected"" -- in other words, Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014. The text was superimposed over a photograph of the House chamber in the Capitol. We wondered whether that was true, so we took a look. Does Congress have 11 percent approval ratings? While the meme features a picture of the House chamber, the most common polling question refers to Congress generally, rather than the House specifically, so we looked at Congress’ approval ratings overall. We found congressional approval scores from October 2014 from five different pollsters on the poll-archive website PollingReport.com: • Fox News: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the job Congress is doing?"" 13 percent said ""approve."" • CBS News: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?"" 14 percent said ""approve."" • CNN/ORC: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?"" 13 percent said ""approve."" • ABC News/Washington Post: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way the U.S. Congress is doing its job?"" 20 percent said ""approve."" • NBC News/Wall Street Journal: ""In general, do you approve or disapprove of the job that Congress is doing?"" 12 percent said ""approve."" That averages out to 14 percent -- slightly higher than 11 percent, but in the same, miserable ballpark. Were 96.4 percent of congressional incumbents re-elected? To be consistent with the polling, which covers Congress broadly, we’ll lump together the incumbent winning percentages in both the House and Senate. There are a few contests still to be decided, but there are enough settled that we can make a pretty close count. In the House, we counted 390 incumbents who ran on Election Day. Of those, four haven’t had their races called as of Nov. 10, so we’ll set them aside. Of the remaining 386 incumbents, 373 won, for a winning percentage of 96.6 percent. If you add in three incumbents who ran but lost in primaries, the incumbent winning percentage drops to 95.9 percent. Meanwhile, in the Senate, 23 out of 26 incumbents won, with one more (Alaska’s Mark Begich, a Democrat) trailing in a race that has not yet been called, and another (Louisiana’s Mary Landrieu, also a Democrat) heading into a runoff. If you don’t include Begich and Landrieu, the combined House-Senate incumbent winning percentage is 95.4 percent. If you do include them, it falls slightly to 95 percent. All of these percentages are exceedingly close to the meme’s stated 96.4 percent, and they’re a moving target due to late-called races. So we won’t quibble. Our ruling The meme said that Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected. We found small differences in the actual percentages -- Congress had roughly a 14 percent approval rate, and the incumbent re-election rate may be as low as 95 percent -- but the point of the meme is solid. Voters hold Congress in low regard, yet they re-elect almost everyone. So we rate the claim True.  ",/factchecks/2014/nov/11/facebook-posts/congress-has-11-approval-ratings-96-incumbent-re-e/

Fox News host: Keystone pipeline would create 'tens of thousands of jobs'
","Republicans already have some things they’d like to do when they assume full control of Congress in January. Plans include reforming the tax code, renewing the fight against Obamacare and approving the Keystone XL pipeline, according to a Wall Street Journal editorial by House Speaker John Boehner and current Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Fox and Friends fill-in host and reporter Anna Kooiman honed in on the latter initiative during a post-Election Day discussion about the GOP leaders’ plans. ""And if you would just approve the Keystone XL pipeline, there would be tens of thousands of jobs created,"" Kooiman said Nov. 6, addressing President Barack Obama. The job-creation argument behind the controversial pipeline is one fact-checkers have reviewed many times. The bottom line: Keystone isn’t the massive jobs generator that some make it out to be. TransCanada’s project shuffling a heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., has long been on hold pending a review by Obama and the State Department, which must determine if it ""serves the national interest"" because it crosses an international border. The pipeline would connect with an existing southern leg that opened in early 2014, delivering more than 800,000 barrels of oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast. As far as new jobs go, the State Department estimates the operation of the pipeline will only create 35 permanent, full-time jobs and 15 temporary contractors. The full-time workers would be ""required for annual operations, including routine inspections, maintenance and repair."" Some would work in a Nebraska field office. The lack of many full-time positions makes sense, given that the project is to build a pipeline so that tar sands can travel without the need of rail cars or ships. There are, however, temporary jobs that would be supported by building the $8 billion pipeline over one or two years. Over the course of up to two years of construction, the State Department estimates a total of 42,100 jobs ""would be supported by construction of the proposed project."" Some jobs are directly tied to the pipeline and construction. Other jobs are simply a nature of how spending $8 billion ripples out into the economy. And more than 99 percent are temporary. The State Department figures construction would require around 10,400 seasonal workers for stretches that would last either four or eight months. This works out to 3,900 ""average annual"" jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs each year if the project takes two years to finish. Construction work would be spread over four states, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, though most workers would be specialized and need to be brought in from outside those states, the report notes. TransCanada counts direct job creation a little differently, estimating about 9,000 overall positions for construction and manufacturing. These are not measured on an average annual basis, but on an overall basis. TransCanada argues this makes more sense because the nature of construction work is for contractors to move from one job to the next, even if it does not last for a year at a time. ""We’ve always talked about the positions because that’s what we cut the paychecks for,"" said TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard. By either estimate, the number of direct pipeline jobs created is not in the tens of thousands. To get there, you need  to also include indirect and induced ""spin-off"" jobs. Indirect jobs are a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews. Induced jobs are jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy. The State Department estimates that 26,100 indirect and induced jobs ""would be supported by construction of the proposed project"" during the construction phase. The jobs would be in providing the supply chain to Keystone as well as employee spending on lodging, food, entertainment, health care, etc. The State Department calls these jobs ""supported"" and not created because it includes jobs that already exist. Put it all together and you get very few permanent jobs, about 10,000 or so temporary jobs in construction and another 26,000 more temporary spin-off jobs that could be created or supported. Two additional notes: According to The Globe and Mail newspaper of Canada, the pipeline extension’s cost has risen from $5.4 billion to $8 billion. But it’s unclear if higher costs can be associated with more jobs, said Ian Goodman, president of the Goodman Group Ltd. energy and economic consulting firm. Goodman co-authored a 2011 report questioning the project’s employment potential. The increased cost factors in inflation and financing costs. ""The higher costs now being estimated by TransCanada may just be paying more dollars for a similar amount of actual work and materials to build the project."" There’s still no word on when the State Department may announce its recommendation on the project. ""We gave up guessing on that a while ago,"" Howard said, ""but the facts on the project haven’t changed."" Our ruling Kooiman said the Keystone XL pipeline would create ""tens of thousands of jobs."" A State Department review found the project could support -- not create -- 42,100 jobs. But that number needs considerable explanation and does not amount to tens of thousands of full-time jobs in the most common sense of employment. The figure represents the project’s estimated direct, indirect and induced jobs over two years of construction, and all but 50 are temporary. The State Department and TransCanada have different ways of accounting for jobs needed for the building phase, but neither estimate is in the tens of thousands. And some of the remaining indirect and induced jobs supported by subcontractors and employee spending may already exist, so that’s not exactly jobs creation as much as jobs enhancement. Kooiman’s claim is based on a seed of truth but lacks critical information. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/nov/11/anna-kooiman/fox-news-host-keystone-pipeline-would-create-tens-/
