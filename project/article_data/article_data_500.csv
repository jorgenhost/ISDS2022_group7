Obama: 'We're spending millions for each individual' held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
","On his second day in office in 2009, President Barack Obama ordered that the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, be closed within a year. But it remains open nearly six years later, largely because of a difficulties figuring out what to do with the detainees who remain there. On CNN’s State of the Union Dec. 21, 2014, host Candy Crowley asked Obama if the detention facility will be closed by the end of 2015. ""I’m going to be doing everything I can to close it,"" Obama said. ""It is something that continues to inspire jihadists and extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being held. It is contrary to our values, and it is wildly expensive. We’re spending millions for each individual there."" We wondered: Are American taxpayers spending millions of dollars per year for every detainee held in Cuba? In 2002, the United States established a detention camp on the 45-acre naval base on Cuba’s south east coast to hold suspects in the war on terror. More than 750 people have been detained in total over the past 13 years, with 132 current detainees. About 2,100 people work there. So how much does it cost? For fiscal year 2014, the total cost of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is $397 million, according to a Department of Defense report drafted for the Senate Intelligence Committee. This includes money spent on maintenance, personnel, contracted work, military commissions and Department of Defense-funded studies. Spread out among the 155 people detained over the course of 2014, that’s about $2.6 million per detainee. In 2013, with a similar-size budget but more detainees, the cost worked out to about $2.7 million per detainee. For comparison, inmates at high-security federal prisons cost about $34,000 per year on average, as of 2012. Part of the reason holding detainees at Guantanamo is so much more expensive than other prisons might be transportation costs, said Madeline Morris, a law professor and director of Duke University’s Guantanamo Defense Clinic. Most people, food and supplies have to be brought in by air, which is an enormous cost. The number of detainees is going down, but the facility may face extra costs in the future. In August 2014, the New York Times reported that an estimated $200 million in maintenance will be necessary in coming years to keep the detention facility functioning. The infrastructure was originally built to be temporary. One aspect of Guantanamo that doesn’t cost very much is the land. In 1903, then-President Theodore Roosevelt secured the area from Cuba for $2,000 a year, paid in gold -- worth about $4,085 today. The American government continues to pay the rent each year, but the Cuban government reportedly refuses to cash the checks. Our ruling Obama said, ""We’re spending millions for each individual"" detained at Guantanamo. The Pentagon has reported that Guantanamo’s cost comes down to about $3 million per detainee per year -- just under 100 times the average annual cost of a federal prisoner. We rate Obama’s claim True. Editor's note: After this item was published, the Pentagon provided additional information showing Guantanamo's actual costs for 2014, whereas the article previously cited projections. The article has been updated to reflect the new information, which does not affect the ruling.",/factchecks/2014/dec/21/barack-obama/obama-were-spending-millions-each-individual-held-/

Obama: Iran has not advanced nuclear ambitions since U.S. negotiations started
","When you close out the year by ditching America’s 50-year isolation of Cuba, you can expect a few broader questions about your style on the international stage. President Barack Obama said in a year-end interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley that he has been ""consistent in saying that where we can solve problems diplomatically, we should do so."" Crowley pressed Obama to respond to the charge that he is too willing to cut deals that produce little in return for the United States. ""The gist of it is that you're naive and they're rolling you,"" Crowley said, speaking of other world leaders. Obama shot back that on a couple of major fronts, his track record is looking pretty good. Russia now has a crisis on its hands as its economy stalls and the value of the ruble tumbles. On Iran, the president said there have been real gains. ""Over the last year and a half, since we began negotiations with them, that's probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade,"" Obama said. The fear that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, a charge that Iran denies, has bedeviled the international community for over 15 years. We decided to take a closer look at whether Iran’s program has advanced or not. We found general agreement that in terms of curtailing the means to produce enriched uranium and plutonium, the essential fuels needed for an atomic bomb, negotiations between the United States, Iran and other United Nations countries contributed to real progress. However, some analysts define Iran’s nuclear program more broadly to include suspected efforts to design nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The negotiations don’t address those elements, however, and what Iran is doing or has done in that area is subject to much debate. By way of refresher, in November 2013, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, and Iran signed an agreement that temporarily stopped or rolled back Iran’s production of potentially weapons grade nuclear material. In November 2014, that agreement was extended by four months, with some additional restrictions on Iran. In exchange, Iran has been able to sell more of its oil and gain access to millions of dollars that had been frozen in overseas bank accounts. The key elements in the agreements Negotiators focused on nuclear fuel. This had three main aspects. Stopping the production and accumulation of uranium enriched to the 20 percent level of the isotope U-235 and converting a large fraction of what it had to a form harder to use in a weapon. Stop the installation of additional centrifuge machines at Iran’s two enrichment facilities. Centrifuges are essential to the enrichment process. Put the brakes on construction of Iran’s heavy water reactor in Arak. If it were operational, this reactor could produce enough plutonium in its spent fuel for one to two nuclear warheads. Importantly, Iran agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. That agency has found that Iran complied with the terms of the original November 2013 agreement. In its November 2014 report, the agency said, ""All of the enrichment related activities at Iran’s declared facilities are under Agency safeguards, and all of the nuclear material, installed cascades, and feed and withdrawal stations at those facilities are subject to Agency containment and surveillance."" To be clear, Iran continues to enrich uranium, but only to the level of 5 percent of U-235, a form that falls well short of the needs of weapon makers. Regarding heavy water facilities, the IAEA said that Iran had not stopped all work across all of its heavy water projects, but it had not installed any major components. What the experts say As far as nuclear material is concerned, the experts we reached said the agreements successfully, though perhaps only temporarily, curtailed production. ""When President Obama says that for the first time in the past decade Iran has not advanced its nuclear program he is correct,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a research group that advocates for arms control policies. ""Leading up to the interim deal, Iran had nearly amassed enough 20 percent enriched uranium gas, which when further enriched to weapons grade is enough for one bomb."" That material is no longer available, Kimball said. Matthew Bunn, a principal investigator with the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, also said Obama basically has it right on Iran. ""They don’t have any more equipment in place for producing bomb material than they had a year and a half ago,"" Bunn said. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, offered a more qualified view. Albright called progress on enrichment, centrifuges and the heavy water facilities in Arak, a ""great accomplishment."" But Albright noted that, ""Iran continues to run almost 10,000 centrifuges, enriching and stockpiling 3.5 percent low enriched uranium."" And Iran’s research on advanced centrifuges, with limits, is ongoing. Albright is also concerned that Iran has so far not allowed the international inspectors the access they need to learn more about any nuclear weapons research Iran had in the past. Matthew Kroenig, a professor of international relations at Georgetown University, also focused on the weapons side of the equation. Kroenig noted that the agreements that limited and rolled back the production of nuclear-grade material were silent on this front. ""Iran's missile production continues, and we are uncertain about the nuclear weapons design work, although many experts believe that continues as well,"" Kroenig said. But Kroenig also described curtailing the production of nuclear fuel as the ""most important"" piece of the nonproliferation effort with Iran. Two notes on the time elements mentioned in Obama’s comments. He said this is the first time in a decade that Iran’s nuclear program did not advance. Iran restarted its uranium enrichment program in 2005. That would mean it has been a bit over nine years. Also, the president’s year and a half is a bit of a stretch. The first agreement with Iran was signed barely over a year ago, although the terms were announced earlier. Our ruling Obama said that we have seen ""probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade."" The agreement signed in November 2013 has made it harder for Iran to produce weapons-grade nuclear material. International observers report that Iran complied with the terms of the temporary agreement. The amount of enriched uranium is less, and the country’s facilities to produce weapons-grade material has been curtailed. But that does not mean the country has completely stopped all activities that could produce nuclear weapons material in the future. There is also concern about broader aspects of a nuclear weapons program, such as weapons design and missile development. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/dec/21/barack-obama/obama-iran-has-not-advanced-nuclear-ambitions-us-n/

Doctor says teens much likelier to know classmate selling pot than one selling alcohol
","A retired doctor recently included an eye-catching statistic in a commentary in The Providence Journal urging the legalization of marijuana in Rhode Island. ""Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol,"" wrote James P. Crowley, a past president of the Rhode Island Medical Society and professor emeritus of medicine at Brown University, in a piece published Dec. 6, 2014. Crowley cited the statistic to demonstrate that cannabis is the most commonly sold drug in schools. He warned that its prohibition introduces teens to an underground culture of increasingly more dangerous substances. Crowley supports legislation that would regulate, rather than prohibit cannabis. (In 2013, Rhode Island became the 15th state to decriminalize non-medical marijuana possession; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge.) While we were doubtful about an underground culture of selling alcohol in schools, we wondered whether Crowley was right. We sent him an email asking him for his source. We also reached out to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to see what comparable statistics these federal agencies had. All responded they did not have data to verify the statement. When Crowley got back to us, he attributed the information to Jared Moffat, director of Regulate Rhode Island, a group that supports legalizing marijuana. Moffat, in turn, referred us to a survey of students, ages 12 to 17, published in 2012 by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. The ""National Survey of American Attitudes on Substance Abuse XVII: Teens,"" found that 44 percent of the 1,003 students surveyed reported they knew a student who sold drugs at their school. Among that 44 percent, 91 percent reported that they knew a student who sold marijuana on school grounds while about 1 percent, said they knew a student who sold alcohol. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University did not pose the same question to students in previous surveys, and did not publish a 2013 survey. We reached out to Rhode Island KidsCount and to the state Department of Education to see what information they might have for Rhode Island students. KidsCount did not track that particular information. Elliot Krieger, spokesman for the state Department of Education, referred us to the ""SurveyWorks"" student survey of 2013-2014. Among the roughly 32,000 Rhode Island students who offered a response, 10.2 percent said someone had sold or given them an illegal drug on school property in the past year. Similarly, 9.5 percent reported that they had been under the influence of alcohol at school in the same timeframe.   We also asked Robert Houghtaling, director of the East Greenwich Drug Program, for his take on Crowley’s claim that high school pot dealers far outnumbered students selling alcohol. ""Kids usually don’t have to sell alcohol. It’s so easily accessible,"" Houghtaling said.""They steal it from their parents, secure a fake ID, or arrange for someone to buy it for them. ""In terms of using, alcohol is still the predominantly most-used drug,"" he said. ""Alcohol is so prevalent people view it as a rite of passage."" Our ruling James P. Crowley wrote that ""Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol."" But he could only cite one survey, and we couldn’t find any others that asked the same question. One data point does not a trend make. In addition, his statement suggests that the findings of this survey reflect the results from all students polled. It doesn’t. It only looked at the subset of students who said they knew of someone who sold drugs in school.   Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

Marco Rubio says Castros, not embargo, reason Cubans don't have Internet
","There’s a good chance most Cubans won’t be able to read this article. And the reason why — lack of Internet access — is a point of a contention between President Barack Obama and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Obama on Wednesday, Dec. 17 announced sweeping changes to the United States’ decades-old isolation policy against Cuba, promising renewed diplomatic relations and an easing of regulations on commerce. Obama said the drastic shift in approach to the Communist-controlled island would help bolster the Cuban people, who he said have suffered from America’s cold shoulder. ""I believe in the free flow of information,"" Obama said. ""Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have denied Cubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe."" Rubio, a Florida Republican and a Cuban American, chastised Obama’s comments in an animated rebuttal. ""The president said that the people of Cuba do not have access to advanced, 21st century modern technology for communications and telecommunications because of the U.S. embargo. That is false,"" Rubio said. ""The reason why they don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba."" Obama’s statement wasn’t as full-throated as Rubio made it sound. And some of what Obama suggested is true, experts told us. That said, Rubio has the better part of the argument that Cuba’s restrictive policies loom large over the debate. Cuba’s restrictions Cuba has less access to the Internet than most countries in the world. It is the only country in the Western Hemisphere with an Internet access rating of ""not free"" by Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group. Citing the National Statistics Office in Cuba, Freedom House said about 23 percent of Cubans have access to the Internet. But those numbers, while very low, are likely inflated: Many of those people have access only to a tightly controlled Cuban intranet that includes email and government-approved sites. Outside experts, Freedom House said, estimate only about 5 percent of people have access to the full World Wide Web. The government of Cuba maintains almost complete control over telecommunications industries in the country, and it uses a mix of repressive policies and price gouging to keep Cubans offline. Regulations essentially prohibit private Internet use in homes and it is illegal to access the Internet outside government-controlled methods. On top of that, the cost of even a basic computer is more than twice the average Cuban’s annual salary. Cubans who log on to the Internet do so via public, government-run access points. There, patrons deal with some of the slowest speeds in the world. And rates set by the government make it difficult for the average worker on a $20 weekly salary to consistently log on. Checking email costs $1.50 an hour. Access to the national intranet is $0.60 per hour, and international websites are $4.50 per hour, Freedom House said. Bloggers and dissenters are quickly shut down and, in many cases, imprisoned. Alan Gross, the imprisoned American contractor released by Cuba this week, was arrested for building telecommunications infrastructure on the island. As for smartphones, most mobile phones can send messages, even internationally, but cannot access the Internet. GPS and satellite capabilities are prohibited. An iPhone, if procured, would be a pretty dumb phone in Cuba. Cuban officials have recently indicated a potential shift in policy that could open the Internet to personal and mobile usage, but it’s also possible it will be limited to Cuba’s intranet and email. Such promises have been made before. Cuba installed a 1,600 kilometer fiber-optic cable between the island and Venezuela in 2011 with financial help from China (a project completed despite the U.S. embargo, it should be noted). It was supposed to increase speeds and access for Cubans. Actual advances have been modest. And it’s not as though the United States is the only country capable of supplying Cuba with telecommunications technology in today’s global economy. The regime has prioritized preventing political dissent over technological advancement. There’s no guarantee that will change if U.S. policy does. This is why Rubio is right in saying that the U.S. embargo is far from the only factor affecting access. Sure, Cuba is poor and has bad infrastructure, but there are poorer countries with better Internet access, said Larry Press, an information systems professor at California State University Dominguez Hills who writes a blog on Internet access in Cuba. When infrastructure improved in Cuba, access largely did not. ""I think Rubio is closer to the truth than Obama,"" Press said. ""Both have a degree of truth, but the Cuban government's fear of the Internet was a bigger hindrance than the embargo."" The embargo effect Rubio was not quite right, however, when he said that Obama’s comment was unequivocally false. Obama said that U.S. sanctions on Cuba ""have denied Cubans access to technology."" This is true to a certain extent. Part of Cubans’ access problem has to do with the exorbitant cost of technology, relative to how poor the country is, and lifting those restrictions could help that problem. In 2009, Obama cracked the door open marginally for American telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba by allowing them to establish connectivity between Cuba and the United States, and letting satellite radio and television companies serve Cuban customers. Additionally, people could donate (but not sell) telecommunication devices like computers and phones to Cubans. The changes announced Dec. 17 further opened up the ability for U.S. companies to build telecommunications infrastructure in Cuba and it allows for the commercial sale of communication devices and software. Matt Borman, deputy assistant secretary of export administration, told PolitiFact that if American companies were able to compete with other foreign telecommunications suppliers in Cuba, there is an expectation that it would pressure the government to create more viable infrastructure. That could spur more Internet freedom. In a report published in 2010, the Brookings Institution made a similar argument. A of couple experts told us that Obama’s side carries weight because Castro has made an effort in recent years to ease some restrictions, such as lifting the ban on personal computers. (It may be hard to believe, but internet access in Cuba used to be even worse.) So the United States’ sanctions prevent Cubans from acquiring technology that is now legal, said Julia Sweig, an expert on Cuba and Latin America at the Council on Foreign Relations. Our ruling Rubio said that rather than the U.S. embargo, the reason why Cubans ""don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba."" ""Illegal"" is probably the wrong word. There are some ways to legally access the Internet in Cuba, but not in one's home, or on mobile devices, and not by connecting to the full World Wide Web. Internet use is primarily restricted to government-run access points that are heavily monitored. The usage rates, set by the regime, are so expensive that it is cost prohibitive for most Cubans to log on. Political dissenters are barred from publishing online and are punished if they do. The end result is similar to full prohibition: Cuba has one of the lowest rates of Internet access in the world. The U.S. sanctions have played a role in limited availability of technology. However, Rubio is right that the Cuban government has nearly complete control over the Internet. That isn’t a result of sanctions on telecommunication business activity in Cuba. Even if the United States fully repeals its embargo, government control over Internet access could continue. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/dec/19/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-castros-not-embargo-reason-cubans/

Most federal spending is 'permanently appropriated,' Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson says
","Contemplating January 2015 -- when his fellow Republicans will control the U.S. Senate as well as the House -- U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin drew attention to one of his favorite topics: the size of the federal budget. Johnson was interviewed Dec. 11, 2014 by conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on WIBA-AM in Madison. ""Here's another reality -- and most people, unfortunately, don't understand this,"" he began. ""All these budget fights are really only over a third of the budget. Two-thirds of the budget is permanent law."" Johnson added: ""It's permanently appropriated. Obamacare, Medicare, Social Security -- that's how government has grown and how it's always ratcheted up. Totally dysfunctional."" We often hear about ""discretionary spending"" on the one hand and ""mandatory spending"" or ""entitlements,"" on the other. But Johnson’s word choice gave us pause. Is two-thirds of the roughly $3.5 trillion federal budget ""permanent law"" and ""permanently appropriated""? Budget breakdown Federal spending is divided into three broad categories: discretionary spending, mandatory spending and net interest paid on the federal debt. Since paying the interest on our debt is essentially mandatory, it is often included with mandatory spending, leaving us two major categories: 1. Discretionary spending is about one-third of the budget. It refers to government spending that Congress sets every year through the appropriations process. This portion includes spending for most federal agencies, such as transportation and health, as well as foreign aid and defense spending. 2. Mandatory spending is about two-thirds of the budget. It refers to spending that is controlled by legislation that sets eligibility criteria or spending formulas. This portion includes entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, in which you are legally entitled to benefits as long as you meet certain criteria. It also typically includes programs for which individuals automatically qualify, such as farm subsidies or veterans benefits. Unlike discretionary spending, which gets annual appropriations from Congress, mandatory spending is typically provided in permanent or multi-year appropriations. Therefore, the funding essentially becomes available automatically each year, without further legislative action by Congress. So, as Johnson indicated, two-thirds of the federal budget does not have to be appropriated annually by Congress. Rather, the spending is mandated by law, with the amount determined by how many people qualify. Johnson goes too far, however, when he says the two-thirds portion of the budget is ""permanently"" appropriated. When conservative columnist George Will said in 2011 that virtually all federal spending is ""discretionary,"" PolitiFact National rated his claim True. Will had said: ""It's all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid."" Indeed, it may not happen often, but mandatory spending can be changed at any time by passing new legislation that changes the particular program. In 1983, Republican President Ronald Reagan reached a deal with congressional Democrats to make changes in Social Security. The deal raised tax rates and gradually increased the eligibility age to 67 by the year 2027. The Affordable Care Act, adopted in 2010, reduced the increases in Medicare payments to hospitals and insurance companies. Johnson’s spokeswoman told us that in saying permanent, the senator didn’t mean that mandatory spending could never be changed. Rather, he was distinguishing it from spending that is allocated annually. Our rating Johnson said two-thirds of the federal budget is ""permanent law ... it's permanently appropriated."" It’s true that only one-third of the federal spending is done through annual appropriations bills approved by Congress, and that the other two-thirds is mandatory spending on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. But mandatory spending appropriations aren’t permanent. It isn’t easy, but Congress can make changes in the law that change spending within mandatory programs. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/dec/19/ron-johnson/most-federal-spending-permanently-appropriated-wis/

A deeper look at claim Georgia leads the nation in school shootings since Sandy Hook
","Georgia has had the nation’s highest unemployment rate for three straight months. Now a new report puts Georgia at the top of another undesirable ranking: leading the nation with 12 school shootings since the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the Everytown for Gun Safety findings when they were first released last week. But a follow-up story noted concerns that PolitiFact found in previous Everytown school shooting report, centered on the group’s overly broad definition of a school shooting. PolitiFact Georgia decided to review the latest report, and our previous work, to see if the new ranking holds up. At issue is what counts as a ""school shooting."" Everytown is very transparent about its methodology and criteria which go beyond the common understanding that a school shooting is an intruder or student shooting at innocent classmates and staff. The group counts those incidents, such as the Sandy Hook massacre that left 28 dead. But it expands to other incidents, according to the report’s footnotes: ""Incidents were classified as school shootings when a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds, as documented by the press or confirmed through further inquiries with law enforcement. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included. "" In other words, Everytown is counting incidents where no one is killed and even accidental discharges as school shootings. That’s how, for instance, the 12 incidents in Georgia include a 17-year-old student who accidentally shot herself with an illegally concealed firearm in a February 2013 incident at Grady High School. Also added to the tally: what turned out to be a suicide attempt in May in the parking deck of Georgia Gwinnett College. Only one incident counted in the more commonly understood definition: the August 2013 morning when Michael Brandon Hill stormed McNair Discovery Learning Academy in DeKalb County armed with an AK-47 style semi-automatic rifle and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition. A school bookkeeper, Antoinette Tuff, talked down the man who had shot his way into the 800-student school. She, and a heavy police response, convinced Hill to surrender without injuring anyone – an outcome that drew international headlines. Experts warned about the confusion of putting those kinds of attacks – and two other shootings during school hours or school events following confrontations – in with other incidents. ""The question is whether the entire school or campus is endangered by the episode. The answer is most of these cases is no,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston and author of the book, ""Violence and Security on Campus: From preschool through college."" But without knowing that, the report could drive anxiety and fear amid parents and students when schools are actually among the safest places for children to be, Fox said. There were consistently about 45 school-associated violent deaths (not just by guns) in K-12 schools annually between 1992 and 2010. The number plunged to 31 in 2011, after spiking at 63 in the 2007 school year, according to a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report. The Southeast, not just Georgia, often sees more of the incidents because of easier access to guns, Fox said. But a two-year snapshot does not offer any meaningful analysis, he added. Shootings on college campuses, meanwhile, are yet another different type of incident. Alcohol is often a factor in those incidents, which the Everytown report and experts conclude are often the result of an escalating conflict. Those shootings are no less tragic for stemming from confrontations, but experts said that also shows the different circumstances than the image of a lone shooter gunning down victims indiscriminately. ""That kind of personal altercation happens in a variety of locations. People are in a bar, get in a fight and go get a gun from their car,"" said Mark Safarik, president of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. ""You’ve really broadened it to the point where it loses the sense that you are trying to get,"" he added. Everytown defends its definition, noting it includes on the first page of the report its criteria for the report. ""Our definition of what qualifies as a school shooting could not possibly be any more straightforward. When a gun is shot on school grounds, that's a school shooting,"" said Everytown communications director Erika Soto Lamb. ""Plain and simple -- any challenge to this very obvious definition deserves to be called what it is: a case of 'pants on fire.’"" The experts disagree. But, the group can take heart in one key element of its findings and how it may play out in Georgia. The report concludes that more than a third of all shootings nationally occurred after an argument or confrontation. Two-thirds of the Georgia incidents involved a shooter and victim who knew each other, an argument or fight beforehand or a drug deal. That helps make the case for keeping guns off of college campuses, a fight expected to be revived when the Legislature convenes next month. ""In a lot of these incidents, a fight occurs and it’s settled with a gun,"" Safarik said. ""You add in college campuses, with alcohol consumption, it could be a recipe for more events. That should be a more important conclusion than a dubious conclusion Georgia has the most school shootings."" And with that, it appears the new Everytown report on school shootings mirrors concerns raised before about how to tally school shootings. It is accurate, by its broad definition, that Georgia led the nation with its version of ""school shootings."" The report is also useful in explaining what often leads to violent incidents at school and college campuses. In the end, there is value in the findings but significant context missing from its overall conclusion.We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/dec/19/everytown-gun-safety/deeper-look-claim-georgia-leads-nation-school-shoo/

CNN's Ana Navarro: Cuba's economy survives largely on Venezuelan aid
","President Barack Obama’s historic decision to open full diplomatic relations with Cuba has appalled many opponents of the Castro regime. Among their biggest complaints is that Cuba got huge concessions from the United States without being required to make fundamental changes to its political system. CNN contributor and Republican strategist Ana Navarro also argued that Obama could have outwaited the Castro brothers, Fidel and Raul. The Cuban economy is in shambles, Navarro told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. ""A lot of what their survival depends on is Venezuelan oil money, which is drying up,"" Navarro said. ""Now that we are so close to the end of those two dictators -- who have oppressed these people for over half a century -- now we're going to change and do it unilaterally without them lifting the oppression?"" The Cuba-Venezuela connection has been on the lips of many commentators since the news broke. We thought it would be good to put a number to Venezuela’s generosity toward Cuba and to what extent that aid is a matter of life or death for the Cuban economy. Cuba and Venezuela have been joined at the hip in their shared antipathy toward the United States. The superpower to the north sees both governments as fundamentally opposed to political freedom and free markets. In return, leaders in Cuba and Venezuela regularly speak out against the United States. Out of this tension emerged a deal between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuba sent tens of thousands of medical staff and other skilled professionals to treat Venezuela’s poor and otherwise aid the government. In exchange, Venezuela sent Cuba oil and provided money to modernize that country’s infrastructure. The plunging price of oil has put the basic tenets of that swap in jeopardy, experts say. Cuba’s supply line We found estimates that Venezuela sends about 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Luis R. Luis is the former chief economist with the Organization of American States, an international body with representatives of governments that span from Canada to Argentina. Luis told PunditFact the swap means a lot to Cuba. ""Venezuelan oil and transfers play a key role in allowing the country to import essential foodstuffs, medicines and industrial inputs,"" Luis said. ""The value of oil plus investments and grants from Venezuela to Cuba varies greatly from year to year largely because of oil price fluctuations. In 2008 it was over 10 percent of GDP. Last year some 6 percent of GDP. This year less."" Former International Monetary Fund economist Ernesto Hernandez-Cata offered a slightly higher estimate of ""just over $7 billion, or 11 percent of Cuba’s GDP,"" in 2011. Whatever the exact percentage, and even though the aid has been falling, Venezuela pulls a lot of weight in the Cuban economy. University of Maryland economist Roger Betancourt said that impact only grows when you factor in trade between the two nations. Betancourt, who co-founded the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy, said Venezuela accounts for about 40 percent of Cuba’s trade in goods. We found another estimate that put Venezuelan purchases at 20 percent of Cuba’s GDP. Why would Venezuela stop helping Cuba? Venezuela has seen the price it receives for sending oil overseas fall 40 percent this year because of the drop of oil prices worldwide. And oil revenues account for about 95 percent of the country's export earnings, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. As such, Venezuela faces an economic collapse that include defaulting on its debts. ""You only need to look at the economic disaster that is Venezuela, and clearly it’s a bad bet to have all your chips in one basket,"" Christopher Sabatini, policy director at Council of the Americas, told Bloomberg. ""That 100,000 barrels per day gift of oil is going to end very soon."" While the Venezuelan connection is hefty, its importance can be overblown. Hernandez-Cata ran the numbers and found that if the aid stopped, Cuba's real GDP would contract ""somewhere between 7 percent and 10 percent"" without Venezuelan oil. Which would be no garden party for Cuba, but as Hernandez-Cata noted, the country emerged from a fall of 38 percent in GDP when the USSR cut off its economic support in the early 1990s. And today, Cuba has been moving to diversify. ""Current efforts to obtain financing at non-market terms from other countries, like Algeria, Angola and Brazil, would, if successful, diminish the magnitude of the shock,"" Hernandez-Cata wrote. A longtime critic of the Castro regime, Pedro A. Freyre, a partner in the law firm of Akerman LLP, is skeptical of the doom and gloom predictions of Cuba’s precarious economy. ""Cuba has turned surviving misery into an art,"" Freyre said. ""Cuba has been diminishing expectations for decades. Everything collapsed in 1992.  It was a disaster and they survived."" For the record, Freyre, who lost a brother-in-law in the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs assault on Cuba in 1961, now favors normal diplomatic relations. Our ruling Navarro said a lot of Cuba’s survival depends on Venezuelan oil money, and that it's drying up. The data we found and the experts we reached back that up, to a point. Venezuelan aid added at least 6 percent to Cuba’s GDP last year. Venezuela is also a major trading partner, buying as much as 40 percent of Cuba’s trade in goods. The loss of direct support from Venezuela could cause a 7 to 10 percent drop in Cuba’s GDP, experts told us. While that hasn't happened yet, it's certainly a strong possibility. Though Cuba has been moving to reduce its dependency on Venezuela, and has a track record of making it through tough times, that would still be a significant hit.

Marco Rubio says talks with Cuba produced no commitment to democratic reforms
","Sen. Marco Rubio -- a Republican born to Cuban emigres whose Florida constituency includes the nation’s largest concentration of Cuban-Americans -- has taken the lead opposing President Barack Obama’s overhaul of U.S.-Cuba relations. His main complaint: The United States isn’t getting enough out of the deal, especially when it comes to democratic reforms. On Dec. 17, 2014, Obama said the United States would be re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time in more than five decades, as well as easing longstanding travel and export restrictions. The move coincided with Cuba’s release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross. Rubio called the warming of relations ""profoundly disappointing. It is a victory for the oppressive Cuban government, but a serious setback for the repressed Cuban people."" To Rubio, the agreements between the two governments -- which had been worked out in secret over 18 months -- were one-sided, with the United States drawing the short end of the stick. Here’s more of what Rubio had to say at a press conference: ""The White House has conceded everything and gained little. They gained no commitment on the part of the Cuban regime to freedom of press or freedom of speech or elections. No binding commitment was made to truly open up the Internet. No commitment was made to allowing the establishment of political parties or to even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy. ""And in exchange for all of these concessions, the only thing the Cuban government agreed to do is free 53 political prisoners who could wind up in jail tomorrow morning if they once again take up the cause of freedom and to allow the United Nations and the Red Cross to monitor conditions on the island, the same United Nations that did nothing when Cuba last year was caught helping North Korea evade United Nations sanctions."" We wondered whether Rubio is right that, under the agreement, Cuba doesn’t have to ""even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy."" What's in the agreement? After looking over the publicly available information, it seems like Rubio has a point. If talks between the United States and Cuba resulted in any final document, it hasn’t been released yet. Instead, we’ll rely on what the White House has made public in its comments. (Rubio’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) On the subject of ""human rights and civil society,"" a White House summary focuses mostly on what the United States promises to do in fostering those goals in Cuba, not on what the Castro regime had promised to do. The administration ""will continue to implement U.S. programs aimed at promoting positive change in Cuba, and we will encourage reforms in our high level engagement with Cuban officials,"" the White House summary said. ""Ultimately, it will be the Cuban people who drive economic and political reforms."" In his remarks announcing the change in policy, Obama seemed to acknowledge that the two countries disagree on human rights and democracy. ""Where we disagree, we will raise those differences directly -– as we will continue to do on issues related to democracy and human rights in Cuba,"" Obama said. ""But I believe that we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement. After all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked. It’s time for a new approach."" This theme was reiterated during a conference call with reporters featuring unnamed ""senior administration officials."" They said that the United States’ emphasis on human rights won’t be decreasing, only pursued within a context of direct relations with the Cuban government. The officials said the United States would seek to leverage other nations’ efforts to promote democracy in Cuba, including at the Summit of the Americas in Panama next year. They said the difference now will be that the United States would conduct its democracy-building efforts -- which they said the Cuban government forcefully opposes -- within the context of normalized relations. Meanwhile, Raul Castro, in a televised speech from Havana, promised only ""dialogue,"" not concrete steps, on democracy and human rights. He said Cuba recognizes ""that we have profound differences fundamentally in the subject of national sovereignty, democracy, human rights and domestic policy. I reaffirm our willingness to dialogue on all these topics."" Are there concrete steps? So far, we see nothing about what the Castro regime needs to do to promote democracy. Is there anything specific in what’s been announced? The answer is: A bit. During the conference call, officials said that the the Cuban government has made ""sovereign decisions"" to release 53 political prisoners whose cases were brought to Cuba’s attention by the U.S. government."" In addition, the White House says the Cuban government said it would be taking steps to increase Internet connectivity for its citizens. The White House argues that, in conjunction with additional authorization for U.S. telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba, ordinary Cubans will be empowered by better Internet access. Finally, officials announced that Cuba would increase its engagement with the United Nations and with the International Committee of the Red Cross about monitoring conditions within Cuba.   Indeed, Rubio mentioned these three steps in his press conference -- but even if these changes prove permanent (and there’s no guarantee they will) they were outweighed, in his view, by the lost opportunity to leverage bigger pro-democracy reforms, such as the creation of political parties and a loosening of the Castro family’s grip on the island’s politics. When we asked experts whether Rubio’s description is on target, they said it was. ""It’s accurate,"" said Eric Farnsworth, who worked in the Clinton White House’s office of the special envoy for the Americas and now serves as vice president of the Council of the Americas. ""Rubio is about right,"" agreed Brock Tessman, associate director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of Georgia. ""While these initial changes, particularly the introduction of open media technology, may eventually lead to more profound political changes, nothing in yesterday's agreement commits Raul Castro to concrete steps toward democratization."" Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Omaha, concurred. He predicted that any concrete concessions on democracy and human rights would have to wait until -- or if -- Congress decides it’s ready to lift the decades-old trade embargo. ""This is what Congress will argue must be dealt with for the embargo to be lifted,"" Benjamin-Alvarado said. He added, ""I take Raul Castro’s response to mean that he too understands the nature of how normalization must unfold and what conditions will have to be addressed."" Our ruling Rubio said that in the U.S.-Cuba negotiations, ""no commitment was made to allowing the establishment of political parties or to even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy."" He’s largely correct. Cuba did promise to release 53 political prisoners, take steps to open up the Internet and allow greater scrutiny by international organizations. But the secret talks led to no breakthroughs in structural reform to a political system dominated for more than half a century by the Castro brothers. Rather than producing pro-democratic results now, the agreement seeks to create the conditions for results later. Rubio's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/dec/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-talks-cuba-produced-no-commitment/

Doonesbury says 3,000 died from gunfire during time of Ebola scare
","A day before PolitiFact unveiled that exaggerations about Ebola took top honors as the 2014 Lie of the Year, the comic strip Doonesbury took aim at the very same target. The strip’s author Garry Trudeau imagined an interview between his characters NPR host Mark Slackmeyer, and Fox News correspondent Roland Hedley. Hedley: We’re very proud of our Ebola unit. We covered Obama’s bungling of the epidemic from the Dallas debacle to the election. Slackmeyer: Have any idea how many Americans died from Ebola during that time? Hedley: Um ... No. I’d have to run the numbers on that. Slackmeyer: None. Not a single one. Want to know how many died of gunfire during that same period? Hedley: I don’t see how that’s relevant. Slackmeyer: Statistically, about 3,000. For the record, Trudeau is correct about the number of Americans who died from Ebola. The two people who succumbed on American soil were not American citizens. But we wanted to take a closer look at Trudeau’s statement that ""statistically, about 3,000"" people died of gunfire between the events in Dallas and the November election. That word ""statistically"" struck us as a particularly careful choice. To refresh your memory, Thomas Eric Duncan was admitted to a Dallas hospital on Sept. 28. Duncan ultimately died and then two nurses who treated him contracted the disease. They both survived. The election took place on Nov. 4. Trudeau explained to us that he based his number on annual deaths due to guns that he found on a website run by the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney in Australia.  The yearly totals only went through 2011 so Trudeau looked back five years and took the lowest number.  He divided to find the weekly average and used that for the five weeks between Duncan becoming ill and the election. ""It's obviously only a statistically typical five-week period,"" Trudeau said. ""For all I know there could have been a major lull in gun violence in October. But for purposes of argumentative contrast, I felt it accurately reflected the magnitude of harm our epidemic of gun violence inflicts."" Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s aptly named Wonder database, we found monthly numbers that ran through 2012. For simplicity, we summed deaths for October and the first four days of November. This approach was slightly more precise than Trudeau’s and as this table shows, it more than confirmed Trudeau’s claim. (Adding a few days in September would only make the case stronger.) Year October Nov. (4 days) Total 2012 2,733 364 3,097 2011 2,748 344 3,092 2010 2,725 336 3,061 2009 2,655 333 2,988 2008 2,626 339 2,965 Average 3,041 We don’t know exactly how many people died over that time period in 2014, and we won’t know for about a year. But Trudeau’s figure is very much in line with past trends, and as Trudeau noted to us, the numbers have been stable for many years. Suicide looms large The most important caveat to Trudeau’s statement is that it includes suicides. In 2012, the CDC classified 20,666 deaths as due to ""intentional self-harm"" by any sort of firearm. The number of deaths by assault, or what we might call homicide? 11,622. Gun violence is an umbrella term that covers all manner of deaths when a weapon is fired. It includes suicide, criminal homicide, police shootings, cases when the intent is unknown, and a strange category called ""exposure to inanimate mechanical force - firearm."" When you hear about gun violence, it might suggest solely people killing each other. That would be inaccurate. Roughly two-thirds of the deaths are people killing themselves. Also, the CDC data records the death of residents, but it doesn’t track their citizenship status. Trudeau contrasted gun deaths with the deaths of Americans due to Ebola. We found no information that made the distinction. A note about Fox News While Fox News devoted many minutes if not hours to Ebola coverage, and not always with pinpoint accuracy, on Oct. 15 host Shepard Smith delivered a 4-minute monologue saying that fear of Ebola is ""not based in fact or reason."" Smith decried the tendency of politicians and news organizations to hype the hysteria. Our ruling Garry Trudeau, speaking through his characters in Doonesbury, said that in the time between the Ebola scare in Dallas and the election, ""statistically"" about 3,000 Americans died from gunfire. The latest data from the CDC bears that out. Using a five-year average, we found 3,041 deaths in the relevant time period. Given that the debate over gun deaths in this country often centers on homicides or accidental shootings, it is important to note that about two-thirds of the total would likely be suicides. Plus, the CDC data counts the deaths of residents, which might include some noncitizens. Still, the number of deaths is in line with what Trudeau said, even if the precise figures will vary. The claim is accurate but it requires some clarification. Accordingly, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/dec/18/doonesbury/doonesbury-says-3000-died-guns-during-time-ebola-s/

Pete Gallego says this Congress least productive, popular in U.S. history
","Calling for less partisanship, a Texan leaving the U.S. House lamented the bickering and pettiness around him. But one-term Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego of Alpine also made a grander claim, saying in his Dec. 10, 2014, floor speech: ""This Congress made history as the least productive, most unpopular Congress in the history of this proud nation."" We failed to reach Gallego, who lost his 2014 re-election bid to Republican Will Hurd. But Anthony Gutierrez, who helped Gallego’s campaign, sent an email pointing out a May 2014 Vox web post showing the latest Congress was stacking up poorly in productivity and popularity compared to any Congress since the 1970s. Productivity We’ve gotten into congressional productivity before, rating True a May 2014 claim by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, that with only 67 bills or so passed into law, ""2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping record."" The office of the U.S. House clerk offers one-page detailed numerical recaps of each year’s congressional proceedings dating back to 1947. And according to the latest tally available when we looked, 114 ""public bills"" were passed into law by the House and Senate from early January 2014 through Nov. 30, 2014. That was an improvement in that 73 measures made it into law from early January 2013 into early January 2014, according to another office tally. In our previous look at productivity, we found previous low-end years including 1995 (88 bills passed into law); 2011 (90); 1981 (145); 1969 (190) and 2012 (193). Per these counts, Congress fared better in 2014. But we take it that Gallego was referring to the full Congress, meaning his claim to history covered its two years in session. And the 113th Congress, which passed 187 measures into law through November 2014, trailed the productivity of previous ones by a wide margin, according to the clerk’s tallies. The previous least-productive Congress was in session in 1995-96, ultimately advancing 280 measures into law, according to the clerk’s count. Next-worst was the Congress that gathered in 2011-12, which had 283 laws to its account. Popularity Was the latest Congress, which adjourned days after Gallego spoke, the least popular in history? From early 2013 through October 2014, according to results compiled at pollingreport.com, some 73 percent to 85 percent of respondents to more than 20 Fox News polls disapproved of Congress. Per the latest results when we looked, 80 percent disapproved ""of the job Congress is doing,"" 13 percent approved, 7 percent were unsure. That poll of registered voters, conducted Oct. 25-27 by Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Company Research, had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. In 2011-12, disapproval ratings in the Fox poll ranged from 60 percent of poll respondents to 83 percent, polllingreport.com says. In 2009-10, congressional disapproval ranged from 46 percent to 80 percent and in 2007-08, the disapproval range was from 44 percent to 77 percent, according to the website. In 2013-14, CBS News, asking poll respondents to approve or disapprove of ""the way Congress is handling its job,"" found 75 percent to 85 percent disapproval. That range compared to CBS poll disapproval percentages of 62 to 84 percent in 2011-12; 55 to 82 percent in 2009-10; and 49 to 75 percent disapproval in 2007-08, pollingreport.com said. The latest result: 76 percent of 1,269 adults polled Oct. 23-27, 2014, disapproved, 14 percent approved, 10 percent were unsure; that poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. Those are pretty dismal figures (unless, say, you don’t have a stake in Congress being well liked and respected and so on). But they don’t prove the 113th Congress was the least popular ever. Polls through history We asked Brian W. Smith, a political scientist at St. Edward’s University, for perspective. By email, Smith cautioned there has only been careful regular polling on attitudes about Congress since the mid-1900s, meaning it’s impossible to say for certain the latest Congress is the least-popular ever. The Gallup polling organization has inquired into attitudes toward Congress since 1974 and only started asking monthly in 2001. Smith noted the results show Congress never proving very popular, except after the 9/11 attacks, when there was a spike to 84 percent of respondents approving of the job Congress was doing.  Source: Research by Brian W. Smith, associate professor of political science, St. Edward’s University (received by email, Dec. 11, 2014) Since 2001, Smith said, the Gallup poll indicates the latest Congress to be the least popular.  Source: Research by Brian W. Smith, associate professor of political science, St. Edward’s University (received by email, Dec. 11, 2014) ""It is fair to say that… this Congress will have the lowest approval since we began collecting data. This is true as an average, and the 113th Congress has the lowest single approval at 9 percent, which was in November 2013."" Smith reminded, though, there is often a caveat. Though Americans tend to hate Congress in general, he wrote, voters tend to like their local representative, which ""means that"" even in ""times of congressional disdain, incumbents do very well at the polls,"" Smith said. By email, congressional scholar Norman Ornstein agreed polling on the popularity of Congress only goes back a few decades. That said, Ornstein replied, it seems clear ""the last two congresses are at the very low end of the spectrum since we've been recording these things systematically."" Our ruling Gallego said: ""This Congress made history as the least productive, most unpopular Congress in the history of this proud nation."" This claim lacked caveats: There wasn’t polling on the popularity of Congress for most of its existence and productivity has only be yard-sticked since 1947. That said, it looks like the 113th Congress was the least productive Congress in nearly 70 years and the least popular one since relevant polls launched in the 1970s.

Scott Walker says he's got himself to thank for his tax bill going down
","Christmas cards no longer stuff up mailboxes this time of year, but you can count on receiving one piece of old-fashioned mail: the annual property tax bill. After getting his residential tax bill in December, Gov. Scott Walker took to Twitter to proclaim it was lighter than last year. And to take credit for the reduction. ""My property taxes went down largely because my technical college portion went down 35.5% because of the money we put in at state,"" the governor tweeted Dec. 12, 2014  from his personal account. Walker made tax relief a cornerstone of his first term, signing legislation easing both income taxes and property taxes, among others. In January 2014, we rated Mostly True the governor’s claim that ""With the tax controls we already put in place, property taxes on a typical home in December of 2014 will actually be lower than they were in December of 2010."" Walker was correct that the ""typical"" property owner -- a hypothetical individual owning a median-valued home taxed at the average statewide property tax rate -- would have a smaller tax bill than four years earlier. But that doesn’t mean everybody is in the same boat. So let’s take a look at the bill of one flesh-and-blood person -- Walker -- and see if his claim is on target when it comes to the year-to-year change. The governor owns and lives in a $360,000 home on a busy street in suburban Wauwatosa in Milwaukee County. An online database shows his total bill fell $118 or 1.4 percent this year. His total bill: $8,364. Two of the six taxing authorities represented on the bill collected less from the Walkers this year than in 2013: the Wauwatosa School District and the Milwaukee Area Technical College. As Walker tweeted, MATC billed him 35.5% less than last year, a drop of $255 Almost all of that drop is directly attributable to state legislation pushed by Walker and other Republicans who sought to return surplus state funds to taxpayers. Walker signed Wisconsin Act 145 in March 2014, injecting additional state aid into the state’s technical college system. At MATC alone, that unexpected state aid replaced $60 million in funds that would normally have been raised through local property taxes. Consequently, the overall MATC property tax levy for 2015 dropped by 40 percent, according to MATC budget documents. In terms of the school district portion of the tax bill, the governor saw a drop in school taxes of $90, or 3 percent. So the biggest contributor to his lighter tax load, as he claimed, was the technical college portion. And it was, as he claimed, due to actions taken at the state level. A couple notes before we leave you to check your escrow accounts. Walker had less to brag about last year at this time, when his property tax bill jumped more than $1,100. It coincided with the 2013 citywide property revaluation in Wauwatosa. Walker’s property assessment rose 11 percent that year. In fact, Walker is not one of those ""typical"" taxpayers whose bill is lower now than four years ago. His is up $1,300. Finally, the governor wasn’t alone on his block this year in seeing a dip in his property taxes.  Across Wauwatosa, more than 95 percent of property owners saw a decrease. We checked three of his neighbors’ bills. They each fell by $50 to $100. And, in contrast to their famous neighbor, they have seen a decrease in their overall bill from 2010 to 2014. Our rating In a tweet, Walker said: ""My property taxes went down largely because my technical college portion went down 35.5% because of the money we put in at state."" He’s right.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov says 80% of U.S. lawmakers have never traveled abroad
","Are American lawmakers rubes who never travel outside the United States? Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, seems to think so. It isn’t often that comments made by Russia’s foreign minister during an interview with French TV generate enough interest to catch PolitiFact’s eye. But a recent claim by Lavrov -- originally made to the France 24 channel, then repeated in a New York Times dispatch about Russia’s floundering currency -- caught the eye of several PolitiFact readers. In turn, they asked us to fact-check it. The claim came at about the 15-minute mark in the English-language interview Lavrov gave to France 24’s Marc Perelman on Dec. 16, 2014. Perelman asked Lavrov for his reaction to unanimous votes by the U.S. House and Senate to pass the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014. That measure authorizes (but stops short of requiring) military assistance for Ukraine as well as significant new sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, according to Bloomberg. Lavrov dismissed the measure and proceeded to tweak the legislative institutions that passed it. ""Congress is a very special group of people,"" Lavrov said. ""More than 80 percent of them never left the United States. They live in their own walls. So I’m not amazed about this Russophobia which is being displayed by the Congress at the moment."" Lavrov didn’t look like he was joking in the interview, so we’re taking the claim at face value. Here’s what we found. (An inquiry to the Russian Embassy in Washington was not returned.) Because calling up all 535 members of the House and Senate and asking them about their lifetime travel histories would be prohibitively time-consuming, we figured the fastest way to test Lavrov’s claim would be to look at lawmakers’ records of official travel. We asked Jock Friedly, founder of the legislative data service LegiStorm, to run some numbers for us. Utilizing his database, Friedly found that no fewer than 412 voting House members and senators in the 113th Congress -- the one that just wrapped up its business this week -- have taken privately financed overseas travel during their congressional career, at least going back to 2000. (See LegiStorm’s whole list here.) That means that at least 77 percent of Congress’ 535 members (House and Senate combined) have gone overseas solely by counting one type of congressional travel -- namely, trips financed by outside organizations. The LegiStorm figure doesn’t include official congressional delegations (commonly known as CODELs) that take trips paid for using funds from the federal treasury. We took a quick look through some of the recent CODEL disclosures by the Clerk of the House and found that just in the final six months of 2013, at least 115 House members went on a CODEL. That’s 26 percent of the chamber going overseas just during one quarter of a two-year congressional term. (See the whole list here.) We cross-checked the two lists and found 20 House members who took a CODEL during that six-month period but had never taken a privately financed overseas trip. So that raised the number of confirmed members of Congress who had gone overseas at least once to 432 out of 535 members, or 81 percent. In other words, Lavrov got the percentage who had gone overseas almost exactly backwards. In reality, it’s probably low-balling it to say that 81 percent of lawmakers have made overseas travel. We are confident that the percentage would rise even higher if we had included a longer-term sample of CODELs, if we had counted travel paid by a foreign government (trips that are regulated under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act), and if we had counted trips sponsored by lawmakers’ campaigns or political action committees. ""I think it’s likely to be close to 100 percent who have done official travel of some kind overseas,"" Friedly told PolitiFact. And of course, none of these numbers touch any foreign travel taken in the lawmakers’ personal lives, either as children or adults. Our ruling Lavrov said, ""Congress is a very special group of people. More than 80 percent of them never left the United States."" Actually, the data shows that at least 81 percent of members in the recently concluded Congress have taken overseas trips on official business, and the actual percentage is almost certainly higher once all sorts of travel are included, including personal travel completed before being elected to Congress.

Appointee Wallace Hall says Joe Straus said he didn't care if Hall was strung from a tree
","According to a University of Texas System regent who’s under criminal investigation, the Republican speaker of the Texas House indicated he didn’t care if the regent got strung up. Dallas businessman Wallace L. Hall Jr. made his biggest splash in a Dec. 6, 2014, speech accepting the Torch of Freedom award from Texans for Fiscal Responsibility by saying the House speaker, Joe Straus, separately told Gov. Rick Perry, who appointed Hall to the board, that he would drop the House’s pressure on Hall if Hall just quit the board -- an offer that Straus spokesman Jason Embry subsequently said did not happen. Our attention was drawn by another part of Hall’s speech. After saying his own questions about ""unusual admissions"" practices at UT led to a special House committee’s impeachment proceedings, Hall added: ""And this quote from the speaker of the House before a large audience: ‘I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree.’ This from the same speaker who claims his job is not to protect the citizens, but his (House) members. ""Of course, he did not attempt to confront me personally,"" Hall said. ""Does that seem odd to you? Instead he set up an experimental investigative committee to force me to quit and, failing that, destroy my reputation."" Hall said he also was threatened with investigations by the Department of Public Safety and FBI and is waiting, like his wife and children, to see if he’s indicted in Travis County. That tree-swinging mention struck us as provocative enough to verify. Hall offered no comment in response to our emailed inquiries nor did Straus engage. Straus interviewed in 2013 From an online search, though, we learned that Straus talked about Hall and a tree in a public interview during the 2013 Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. In the Sept. 28, 2013, interview, Straus described his expectations of a special House panel formed to consider leveling impeachment charges against Hall. In August 2014, that panel censured and admonished Hall, listing his relentless demands for records from UT-Austin, his handling of confidential student records and his efforts to oust the university’s president, Bill Powers, who later announced his plans to step down. Hall’s defenders, including Perry, say he has simply exercised his oversight duties as a regent. As of mid-December 2014, Hall remained under investigation by the Travis County district attorney’s Public Integrity Unit, in part for his handling of confidential student information. Straus said in the 2013 interview: ""I want a fair, thorough, complete investigation. ...Wherever the trail leads, that’s where we’ll go."" Our transcript picks up with Tribune reporter Jay Root: ROOT: ""What have you heard about the allegations against Wallace Hall that either just don’t disturb you, that think that it’s even appropriate to even be talking about?..."" STRAUS: ""I don’t know. I don’t want to prejudge what the committee and the investigation is going to turn up. And I don’t, I don’t want to say I don’t care. But I have, I have no bias here. I don’t, I don’t care whether they, whether they give the guy a medal of honor or hang him from a tree. I don’t know, I don’t know, I have no idea. ROOT: ""Hang him from a tree, really?"" (crowd laughter) STRAUS: ""Well, you know, not literally. But my point is whether the report is harshly critical and leads to some impeachable offense and makes that recommendation or whether it says Wallace Hall is the greatest... regent that’s ever been in the history of Texas, hands off, give him some kind of resolution in his honor. I don’t know. And I’m not gonna know until the investigation is complete."" Our ruling According to Hall, Straus said, ""I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree."" Straus said close to that, but he said in the same breath he’d likewise be open to a special panel deciding Hall deserved to be honored. Overall, the speaker made it clear he wasn’t judging Hall in advance of the committee’s review -- which is hardly how Hall characterized Straus' attitude. With all this detail available in the online video of the Straus interview, Hall’s statement shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Are long gas lines forming in North Korea, as Donald Trump says?
","As North Korea continues to try the West’s patience with a series of nuclear and missile tests, President Donald Trump is touting the success of tightening sanctions against the rogue nation. Referring to a conversation he had with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, Trump tweeted on Sept. 17, ""I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!"" Is it true that there are ""long gas lines forming in North Korea""? We checked with several experts and reviewed the fragmentary news reporting out of Pyongyang. Gasoline supplies do seem to be short in North Korea these days, and the White House provided one article that cited long lines in April. But the unusual nature of the country’s top-down system of control and its minimal levels of car ownership suggest the idea of ""long gas lines"" is exaggerated. I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!   The White House told us that the remark referred to the sanctions package against North Korea approved by the United Nations on Sept. 11 that, in part, ""reduces about 30 percent of oil provided to North Korea by cutting off over 55 percent of refined petroleum products."" It’s unclear whether these particular sanctions could have acted quickly enough to show up on North Korean streets within a week. But they did provide one article citing long gas lines in North Korea, well before the most recent round of sanctions. It was an Associated Press dispatch from April that said in the wake of the initial gas shortage, ""lines at other stations were much longer than usual and prices appeared to be rising significantly."" There is strong evidence that North Korea has been facing gasoline shortages this year. NKNews, an independent news outlet with operations in Seoul, London and Washington, reported that petroleum and diesel prices are ""far higher than usual"" in North Korea this year. The April price spike began amid ""rumors"" that China had been considering a halt of all crude oil sales, NKNews reported. The publication also reported that the government in September imposed ""new restrictions against customers filling up jerry cans to buy extra supplies, while a number of gas stations were reported as being closed in the city."" All told, gas prices have more than doubled this year, data from NKNews shows. That said, more recent coverage suggests that lines at gas stations aren’t widespread. The NKNews article cautioned in its headline, "" ‘Long gas lines’ not forming in North Korean capital, sources say."" The Washington Post concurred, writing that Trump’s long gas lines claim ""has residents puzzled."" So how can gasoline be in short supply in North Korea without many signs of lines forming at the pump? To explain, let’s take a look at the hermit kingdom’s unusual relationship with the automobile. A ""traffic lady"" in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 2008. (Wikimedia commons) Personal automobiles in North Korea are rare. They are primarily for government or military use, or by the very richest members of the elite. Private citizens typically can’t own cars unless they have government ties. ""You are more likely to know somebody with a private jet than a North Korean is to know somebody with a car,"" Car and Driver magazine wrote in 2010 There is some anecdotal evidence that the number of cars in North Korea has risen in recent years, possibly due to a spike in the registration of privately purchased vehicles under the name of state enterprises, according to the publication DailyNK. But car ownership rates remain low in comparison to most countries. The combination of legal obstacles and high costs put cars out of the reach of ordinary North Koreans, who live in one of the world’s poorest nations. So, despite the increase in automobile use, the Associated Press reported from the capital of Pyongyang in December 2015 that ""it’s unusual to have more than a dozen or so cars waiting behind a red light at any time of day, in any part of the city. At night, the roads remain virtually empty."" The size of the vehicle fleet in Pyongyang is so modest that it’s easy to spot examples from a 1974 purchase of Volvo 144 sedans that are still puttering around the city. (North Korea never ended up paying for them, and Sweden is reportedly still tabulating interest on the purchase in the vain hope that the debt will be settled one day.) A billboard for Pyonghwa Motors in a Pyongyang park in 2007. The ad shows a Pyeonghwa Hwiparam, the North Korean version of the Fiat Siena. (Wikimedia commons) Not that North Korean drivers would have many places to go if they did have access to cars. By land area, North Korea is about 20 percent bigger than South Korea, yet it has less than 1 percent of South Korea’s paved-road mileage. Even adding in unpaved roads, the North has only 26 percent of the road mileage that the South has. ""Public transport in the major cities is done by electrically driven buses, and many trucks in the countryside are converted to wood burning,"" said Erik van Ingen Schenau of the China Motor Vehicle Documentation Center in France. ""Outside Pyongyang, people have no cars, and the cars in Pyongyang are (driven by) the upper class, except for some taxis and government vehicles."" Because of this, gas lines in North Korea mean something different than ones in the United States. ""They indicate not enough supply for non-regime elite ‘luxury’ use,"" said Joseph DeThomas, a former ambassador who now teaches at Penn State’s School of International Affairs. ""It is not meaningless, but it may be less meaningful than would shortages of diesel for ground transport, kerosene for heat and air transport, and heavy fuel oil for power generation, industry and other similar needs."" Trump referred to ""long gas lines forming in North Korea."" North Korea does appear to be facing a gasoline crunch, with prices rising in recent months. But experts we contacted, along with media reports that appeared in response to Trump’s tweet, uncovered little evidence of lines at the pump, likely because the North Korean government exerts such control over gasoline and automobiles that the impact of such shortages are far narrower than they would be in the United States.

Joy Behar claims that PolitiFact said Donald Trump lies 95 percent of the time
","The View co-host Joy Behar gave a selective — and frankly, incorrect — reading of PolitiFact’s rulings on President Donald Trump’s statements during an on-air debate with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Behar brought up Trump’s Truth-O-Meter record during the Sept. 6, 2017, episode of the ABC talk show, asking Sanders how she thought the press should report on his statements. A reader emailed us asking if Behar was accurately describing our rulings, so we took a closer look at the exchange. ""Is the media supposed to not report on the fact that 95 percent of what he says is a lie?"" Behar asked. ""The problem with that, Joy, is that is, you are doing exactly what we are talking about and pushing a false narrative,"" Sanders replied. ""Ninety-five percent of what the president says is not a lie."" ""No, it’s not,"" Behar said. ""It’s from PolitiFact."" It appeared that Behar was referring to Trump’s PolitiFact file, which tracks every statement we’ve rated on the Truth-O-Meter. We compile the results of a person's most interesting or provocative statements in their file to provide a broad overview of the kinds of statements they tend to make. A spokeswoman for The View didn’t clarify Behar’s claim by our deadline. As of Sept. 6, 21 of the 446 statements we examined earned a True rating. That is only 5 percent. Does that mean he lied 95 percent of the time? In a word, no. While we appreciate being a part of a discussion about the facts, Behar wasn’t using our file on Trump properly. Let’s take some time to re-examine what the Truth-O-Meter does and doesn’t do. There’s no question Trump has a shaky relationship with the truth. His campaign misstatements earned our 2015 Lie of the Year award, and his Truth-O-Meter record was much worse than Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign. His tendency to play loose with facts has continued into his presidency. We’ve given him Pants On Fire ratings for gross distortions saying Charlottesville, Va., counter-protesters didn’t have a permit; that CNN’s ratings have suffered mightily; and that allegations his campaign colluded with Russia ""is a made-up story."" He’s also received False ratings for saying President Barack Obama’s immigration policies led to an upswing in MS 13 gang activity; that his own administration did more in the first 90 days than any other presidency; and that he’s saved ""millions of jobs"" since becoming president.   Overall, he’s earned 147 False ratings (33 percent of all the Trump rulings we’ve made) and 69 Pants on Fire ratings (15 percent). Those statements are provably wrong. But to call the rest lies, as Behar did, doesn’t reflect the Truth-O-Meter’s design. We define our ratings in our description of our fact-checking process, which helps us determine the veracity of a statement we’ve chosen to check: TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. So when we rate a statement something less than True but more than False, the speaker can be accurate to some degree, but incorrect because it’s omitting an important angle, being used in the wrong context or drawing a bad conclusion. For example: When Trump tweeted in February, ""The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion,"" he was using a real statistic from the U.S. Treasury Department. He was clearly attempting to make it appear he was responsible for the decrease. But experts we interviewed said not only did the national debt fluctuate on a regular basis as it continued an inexorable upward climb, there was no way Trump enacted policies leading to the minor (and temporary) drop. We rated Trump’s tweet Mostly False. Trump has received 52 Mostly True ratings, 64 Half True ratings, and 93 Mostly False ratings. Also keep in mind that a person’s PolitiFact file isn’t a comprehensive look at every single statement they make, nor is it a random sample of what they say. It would be logistically impossible for PolitiFact to make informed rulings on every single comment an official makes. We choose to fact-check statements that are interesting to us or to readers, or that are relevant to policy discussions or the news of the day. The content of the statements can sometimes repeat, as well, landing another rating in the file. We’ve rated Trump’s assertion that America is the highest-taxed nation in the world four times over two years, each earning a False rating. This is not to beat a dead horse, but rather to address Trump’s repetition of the falsehood during the campaign. Behar said PolitiFact reported that ""95 percent of what (Trump) says is a lie."" That’s a misreading of Trump’s file, which notes that of the 446 statements we’ve examined, only 5 percent earned a True rating. We’ve rated Trump’s statements False or Pants On Fire a total of 48 percent of the time. The definitions of our Truth-O-Meter ratings make it difficult to call the bulk of Trump’s statements outright lies. The files we keep for people's statements act as a scorecard of the veracity of their most interesting claims. Keep in mind that the statements we rate are neither a random nor comprehensive look at things Trump has said. Behar oversimplified when invoking our Truth-O-Meter rulings.

President Donald Trump's Half True claim that support for DACA is as high as '92 percent'
","President Donald Trump has questioned why undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children should be deported, a sharp departure from the campaign when he advocated for the removal of all who were violating immigration laws. Trump’s administration is phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. At the same time, Trump wants Congress to pass a permanent solution for the so-called ""Dreamers,"" saying the idea has very high support among Americans. (DACA recipients are commonly called ""Dreamers."") ""Look, 92 percent of the people agree on DACA, but what we want is we want very, very powerful border security,"" Trump said Sept. 14 before traveling from Washington to meet with Floridians affected by Hurricane Irma. He said Republican congressional leaders were also on board. Later in Florida, he said they were not looking at amnesty or citizenship, but ""looking at allowing people to stay here."" If and when funding for Trump’s border wall will come or what will be part of a DACA deal is still unclear. For now, we were curious about Trump’s claim that 92 percent of people agree on a solution for DACA recipients. We did not find a poll showing support that high, but several polls do show that the majority of Americans want a favorable outcome for Dreamers. The White House declined to comment for this fact-check. We found several polls that asked about DACA and showed majority support for not deporting Dreamers. But we did not find nearly universal support that Trump described. • A Morning Consult and Politico poll conducted between Sept. 7-11, after the Trump administration announced it was eliminating DACA, found that of 1,976 registered voters polled, 45 percent said it was the wrong thing to do; 35 percent said it was the right thing to do; 20 percent did not know or had no opinion. Asked about the issue in a different way — ""When it comes to legislation regarding Dreamers, which of the following would you most like Congress to pass?"" — 54 percent of respondents said they would want legislation that allowed Dreamers to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements; 19 percent favored legislation that would allow them to stay legally but not become citizens, if they met certain requirements; 12 percent wanted legislation that removes or deports them; and 15 percent did not know or had no opinion. So, for this second question, 73 percent favored legislation that would protect Dreamers from deportation. A previous Morning Consult and Politico poll, conducted from April 20-24 asked about 2,000 registered voters what they thought was the best way to handle Dreamers. Fifty-six percent said they should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements, and 22 percent favored allowing them to stay and become legal residents, but not citizens, if they met certain requirements. Overall, 78 percent definitely did not want Dreamers to be deported. • An NBC News and SurveyMonkey poll, conducted online from August 24-29 among a national sample of 10,129 adults, found 64 percent support for DACA. • A Sept. 3-5 poll from The Economist and YouGov of 1,500 U.S. adults also found that 55 percent of responders somewhat or strongly supported DACA, though support for the program was lower among Trump voters and Republicans. Several polling and public opinion experts we reached out to say they were not aware of any recent poll showing a 92 percent support for DACA, but that a solid majority does seem to favor the program. Trump said ""92 percent of the people agree on DACA."" We found several polls in which a majority of people said they supported DACA or favored legislation that would allow Dreamers to stay in the United States.

Did U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin want a $25,000-an-hour government jet for his honeymoon?
","U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan frequently criticizes the administration of Republican President Donald Trump. On Sept. 13, 2017, the Madison-area Democrat got a little more personal, tweeting this about Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin: Mnuchin wants to use a gov't jet that costs $25k/hour for his honeymoon. And he's in charge of tax reform for the middle class? #OutOfTouch What’s this all about? Revelations in the news Mnuchin is a former longtime banker, Goldman Sachs executive and a Hollywood producer (""The Lego Batman Movie"" and others). When tapped for Trump’s Cabinet in late 2016, he was worth $300 million, according to Forbes. As treasury secretary, Mnuchin advises Trump on economic and financial issues. In June 2017, with Vice President Mike Pence officiating, he married Scottish actress Louise Linton. Their honeymoon was in August 2017, according to news reports. Pocan’s tweet was sent the same day ABC News broke a story that was picked up by the Washington Post, USA Today and many other national media. The story said: Mnuchin requested, in writing, a U.S. Air Force jet to take him and his actress-model wife Louise Linton on their honeymoon to Scotland, France and Italy. The jet could cost $25,000 per hour to operate, according to an Air Force spokesman. A Treasury Department spokesman said Mnuchin made the request out of concern for maintaining a secure method of communication, but the secretary's office decided (before ABC’s story) that the use of military aircraft was unnecessary after it became apparent that other methods for secure communication were available. So, based on the news report, Mnuchin’s request isn’t current, as Pocan’s tweet suggests, and the cost isn’t necessarily $25,000 per hour. But the thrust of the claim is correct: Mnuchin requested a military jet for his honeymoon. Mnuchin’s response When we asked the Treasury Department about Pocan’s claim, we were referred to a video clip of an interview Mnuchin did with Politico the day after the ABC News story aired. Asked about the matter, he said: ""I probably spend over 50 percent of my time on national security issues ….This had nothing to do with convenience, this was purely about national security."" ""The government has never paid for any of my personal travel."" ""My staff wanted to make sure that I constantly had access to secure communication"" and the use of a jet for his honeymoon ""was one of the things we explored. So, they put in a request to consider the use of an aircraft ... and ultimately we withdrew the request. We found a way of dealing with other secure communication."" Asked whether the jet was a staff request, not his personal request, Mnuchin said: ""Again, I discussed with the staff a bunch of alternatives … one of the things they suggested, I agreed that they would look into it, OK? We looked into other things, as well. When we found alternative uses, we withdrew the request."" So, Mnuchin doesn’t deny requesting the jet, though he suggests it was out of concern for national security. A final note: As of Sept. 14, 2017, the day after the ABC story, the Treasury Department’s inspector general’s office was looking at all requests for, and use of, government aircraft by Mnuchin, that office told reporters. The inquiry was launched after Mnuchin and his wife took a trip to Kentucky just ahead of the August 2017 solar eclipse. Mnuchin held an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and visited Fort Knox, where he and Linton viewed the eclipse near the path of totality, the Los Angeles Times reported. Treasury officials defended that visit as official government travel and said Mnuchin would reimburse the government for bringing his wife along. Our rating Pocan says Mnuchin ""wants to use a government jet that costs $25,000 per hour for his honeymoon."" Pocan’s use of wants wrongly suggests it is a pending request, and the news report he cites said the jet could cost $25,000 an hour. But essentially Pocan is on target: Mnuchin put in a request for a government plane to take him and his wife to their honeymoon destinations, though he did not use one.

NAACP president is partially accurate on stops and searches statistic
","The first travel advisory in the history of the NAACP was issued Aug. 2 for the state of Missouri over concerns about the safety of African Americans, and once again tensions between law enforcement officers, state officials and minorities were thrust into the spotlight. The advisory, originally set to expire Aug. 28, was renewed, according to The New York Times. Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel said it will remain in effect until at least late September. When NAACP Interim President and CEO Derrick Johnson announced the organization’s travel advisory, he cited statistics that depict racial disparities in Missouri. ""The numerous racist incidents, and the statistics cited by the Missouri Attorney General in the advisory, namely the fact that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than Caucasians, are unconscionable, and are simply unacceptable in a progressive society,"" Johnson said in the statement. The advisory was issued largely in response to SB 43, which requires employees who claim workplace discrimination prove bias is an explicit reason for being fired, rather than just a contributing factor. It was also in response to a ""series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently."" We wanted to look into Johnson’s statement about racial disparities in Missouri. Are law enforcement officers a full 75 percent more likely to pull over and search an African American? Stops versus searches When we reached out to the NAACP, communications director Malik Russell said Johnson may have gotten some of his numbers mixed up, since he didn’t have the data in front of him. But he emphasized the larger point, saying the difference between the numbers that he might have mixed up is small. Russell didn’t give any additional evidence, but the statement announcing the advisory cited data from the attorney general’s office. In 2000, concerns from both Missouri residents and the legislature prompted the passage of a law that requires law enforcement officers collect specific information, including race, for every traffic stop. Each agency must provide this data to the attorney general, who in turn sends it to the governor. A team of researchers has been compiling this information for the attorney general since 2001. The 2016 Vehicle Stops Report Executive Summary from the attorney general’s office breaks down the data related to vehicle stops last year. There were 21 agencies that did not submit the data by the required date and 58 agencies that reported no stops out of 682 law enforcement agencies in the state. Blacks represent 10.9 percent of the driving population and 18 percent of all traffic stops, while whites represent 82.8 percent of the population and 78 percent of stops. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has been on the research team since 2001. Rosenfeld said the researchers divided stops made by the number of people 16 years and older in the state to come up with a ""stop rate."" A value of one means there is no disparity, values greater than one mean there is overrepresentation, and values below one mean there is underrepresentation. The disparity index, which is the proportion of stops divided by the proportion of the population, was 1.65 for blacks last year, overrepresenting the black population by 65 percent. Whites, on the other hand, were stopped at a .94 rate, underrepresenting the white population by 6 percent. Researchers divided 1.65 by .94 to get 1.75, or a 75 percent higher stop rate for blacks than whites. This is the number Johnson used in his statement. But stops and searches are different things. Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. (Formula: 8.77 percent search rate for blacks divided by 5.57 search rate for whites = 1.57.) Our ruling Johnson stated that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than caucasians. Blacks in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by law enforcement officers than whites, which is reflected in the attorney general data. That’s not true about searches. Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. The discrepancy in searches is huge, but it’s not 75 percent.

President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have both come out for Moore’s chief opponent, Luther Strange. In the latest salvo, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by McConnell’s former chief of staff, aired an ad that essentially tells viewers that Moore opposes Trump’s wall along the Mexican border. Here’s the full text: Male voice: ""Who will fight with President Trump to change Washington? Not career politician Roy Moore. He’s on the wrong side of Trump’s border wall."" Video clip of Moore: ""I’ll tell you a little secret. Does it take a wall?"" Video clip of Moore: ""I don’t think it would take a wall."" Repeats the same clip of Moore: ""I don’t think it would take a wall."" Male voice: ""Roy Moore. Dead wrong on President Trump’s wall to protect our borders."" Audio clip of Moore: ""You can’t build a wall around our country."" This is a case where the individual elements of the ad hold up, but the package deal paints an incomplete picture. The ad uses video selectively. A good example comes from the rest of Moore’s words at the forum where he said, ""I don’t think it would take a wall."" Here’s a more complete excerpt of his remarks: ""I think we need something to stop illegal aliens flowing across our borders, because they are a danger to our republic, a danger to our homes, our families, and we can do something,"" Moore said at the Wetumpka T.E.A. Party candidate forum on July 31. ""I support using federal troops (and the) National Guard to stop this."" A moment later, he continued, ""If it takes a wall, we should build it. I don't think it would take a wall. I think we should use the United States military."" In an Aug. 15 radio interview, Moore expressed impatience with the pace of fortifying the border. ""Here we are, waiting since November and nothing’s been done in stopping illegal aliens,"" Moore said. ""It can be stopped within days by the U.S. military ... We need to stop illegal aliens coming in and then, if a wall is necessary and we’ve got the money, we can build it."" Moore’s campaign website says, ""We must allow willing states (like Arizona) to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens, and use our own military to protect our border. If a wall is our only option, then we should build it immediately."" Chris Pack, a spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, said Moore’s stance is at variance with Trump’s position. ""Roy Moore has repeatedly said he doesn’t think we need a wall and that it should be ‘the last recourse,’ or as ‘the last thing we need to do,’ ""Pack said. ""President Trump, by contrast, has called the wall ‘absolutely necessary,’ ‘so vital,’ and ‘very, very important.’ "" Pack went on to say, ""Our ad is simply pointing out that Roy Moore is not with Trump in pushing for the wall."" Advocates of the wall argue that, unlike a military deployment, it would be a barrier that would outlast any change in leadership or policy in Washington. The Senate Leadership Fund ad describes Moore as being on the ""wrong side of Trump’s border wall."" Based on that and the clips in the ad, most viewers might reasonably think that means Moore is against a wall. In fact, Moore doesn’t want to wait and would rather deploy the American military immediately to secure the border with Mexico. If after that a wall is needed, he said the country should build it. What we have is more of a difference on tactics, not overall strategy or outcomes. The ad makes it sound like the gap is more than that.

Rohrabacher repeats bogus claim Democrats orchestrated Charlottesville violence
","California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Orange County, repeated a debunked conspiracy theory this week that top Democrats ""setup"" and ""manipulated"" the political violence at last month’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. In August, PolitiFact national took a deep look at this inflammatory claim, which started with controversial commentator Alex Jones of Infowars.com. Jones said emails show Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and billionaire investor George Soros instigated and orchestrated racial protests in Charlottesville by trying to ""control"" and keep people ""desperate."" After an exhaustive examination of relevant leaked emails, it found no evidence of Jones’ theory and rated it Pants On Fire, the most severe false rating. See the full fact check here. The violence in Charlottesville culminated with the death of Heather D. Heyer, 32. She was killed and at least 19 others were injured after the driver of a Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of people protesting the rally. Authorities charged a 20-year-old man from Ohio, James A. Fields Jr., with second-degree murder. Fields had marched in the white nationalist rally. Rohrabacher, a 15-term congressman and former speechwriter for President Reagan, has garnered controversy in recent months for his pro-Russia stance amid intelligence findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election. Democrats have targeted his congressional seat in 2018. Rohrabacher’s claim Below are Rohrabacher’s conspiracy theory comments made in a San Francisco Chronicle article on Sept. 14, 2017. The article says Rohrabacher is ""deep"" into the theory that ""Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va."" Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former ""Hillary and Bernie supporter"" got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there. ""It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,"" Rohrabacher said. ""It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation"" and to ""put our president on the spot."" PolitiFact California asked Rohrabacher’s spokesman Ken Grubbs for any evidence supporting the claim. Grubbs told us the congressman saw a FoxNews.com article in which Jason Kessler, the organizer of the ""Unite the Right"" white nationalist rally says ""he voted for Obama and was involved in Occupy Wall Street."" The article says Kessler voted for Obama in 2008 and ""once attended an Occupy Wall Street rally in Charlottesville."" It offers no evidence -- nor does it even discuss the idea -- that Democrats ""setup"" a group of ""Civil War re-enactors"" and manipulated a confrontation, as Rohrabacher claims. PolitiFact’s conclusion PolitiFact national found Jones’ comments were part of a broader accusation that the events in Charlottesville were staged by liberals and coordinated by top Democrats. It found no evidence that Jones’ broad attack, or his specific claim about comments made by Soros, Clinton or Democrats in emails, checks out. PolitiFact rated his claim Pants on Fire. PolitiFact California, after examining the same facts, found California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Orange County, doubled-down on the same bogus claim. We rate his claim Pants On Fire, as well.

Website passes along dubious claims about fraudulent New Hampshire votes
","Apparently, the Internet is never going to leave the 2016 presidential race behind. A Sept. 8 post on the website Young Conservatives was headlined, ""Mass Voter Fraud Just Discovered, to the Amount That Could Void Hillary’s Victory In New Hampshire."" We learned about the post through a partnership between PolitiFact and Facebook to fact-check articles of questionable accuracy. The article said, ""Hillary Clinton blew an election she should’ve won with ease. In fact, the former secretary of state lost a rigged election in her favor to a man with zero experience holding political office. That’s how awful a candidate she was. Now, new reports of voter fraud are popping up. The numbers are so egregious, in fact, that Hillary’s New Hampshire victory might not even count anymore."" As evidence, the post cited a Washington Times article that said that in New Hampshire, ""more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver’s licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later."" That’s larger than the number of votes that separated Clinton and her opponent, Donald Trump. Clinton won the state over Trump by 2,732 votes. The claim in the Young Conservatives post is effectively the same as a separate assertion we checked, by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Kobach, the vice chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, said, ""Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes in the presidential election."" We rated that False. David Rufful of Young Conservatives told PolitiFact that his site ""provides conservative commentary on news reports originating from outside news sources. In this case, we are sourcing an article from The Washington Times and The Gateway Pundit. … A PolitiFact assessment of an article at Youngcons.com would seem to be misplaced as we aren't the original source."" However, the post was widely read -- when we looked, it had been shared nearly 55,000 times. So we’ll recap our evidence here. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, a fellow member of the commission co-chaired by Kobach and launched by President Donald Trump, said that the facts laid out by Kobach don’t create proof for the accusation of voter fraud. He said Kobach had fudged the line between domicile and residency, which is crucial in understanding New Hampshire voting law. A state Supreme Court decision has determined that a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. In other words, it’s not necessary for the 5,313 voters in question to have become residents in order for their votes to be valid. That’s because eligible voters can be domiciled in the state without having to be residents — something Gardner acknowledged has caused confusion, even among polling officials. Domicile is defined as the place where a person sleeps, more than any other place, most nights of the year, or where they intend to return after a temporary time away. ""The basic difference between a ‘resident’ and a person who merely has a New Hampshire ‘domicile,’ is that a ‘resident’ has manifested an intent to remain in New Hampshire for the indefinite future, while a person who merely has a New Hampshire ‘domicile’ has not manifested the same intent,"" Gardner wrote. Kobach said that residents must obtain a New Hampshire’s driver’s license or register a vehicle in the state 60 days after moving, but that’s limited to drivers of motor vehicles. As multiple articles pointed out, college students are typical examples of people who would drive in another state without establishing residency in New Hampshire. New Hampshire Public Radio’s analysis of out-of-state IDs used to vote in November found that ""the towns that see the highest rates of out-of-state IDs used at the polls are all home to college campuses."" Kobach was unconvinced. ""Being enrolled in a college does not free you from the legal obligation to become domiciled,"" Kobach said in his testimony. But that’s misleading, as becoming domiciled isn’t as complicated as he makes it sound. A voter can prove domicile using a New Hampshire driver’s license, a vehicle registration in the state, or a non-driver ID or other government issued photo identification that lists a New Hampshire address. But in some towns, providing a form issued by a New Hampshire college or university is sufficient to prove domicile. In Manchester, a voter can prove domicile by presenting a monthly bill, a medical bill, pay stubs showing a current address, or postmarked mail within the last 30 days. Other towns accept similar documentation. Otherwise, voters can simply sign an affidavit attesting they live there. In the case of affidavits, the state mails a letter to the listed address and if undeliverable or ignored, the case gets forwarded to the attorney general’s office for review. The other aspect of New Hampshire law that lends to the confusion is that alongside 15 other states, it has a same-day voter registration policy. ""The result is that yes, it is possible and legal for someone to drive into a polling place in a car with out-of-state tags, register to vote, and vote,"" Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, told PolitiFact in February. ""Of course they have to sign affidavits and they would be risking significant legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. The odds of being caught are pretty high."" According to the New Hampshire Department of State and Department Safety, 196 people are being investigated as possibly having voted in New Hampshire and one other state — but even that isn’t proof that they did. In the meantime, even if the votes had been were fraudulent -- and again, they were not -- the article’s use of the word ""mass"" is also questionable, since these votes accounted for well under 1 percent of the votes cast for president in the state. The article also misleads when it says that these findings ""could void"" Clinton’s victory. There is no mechanism for changing election results once they have been certified by the state and electoral votes have been cast. ""Once the electoral college votes are certified it's done,"" said Andrew Smith, a University of New Hampshire political scientist. The Young Conservatives post was headlined, ""Mass Voter Fraud Just Discovered, to the Amount That Could Void Hillary’s Victory In New Hampshire."" The article cited 5,313 votes cast with out-of-state IDs. However, under New Hampshire law, there is nothing fraudulent about them, as a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. And even if those votes were somehow declared fraudulent, there would be no way to ""void"" Clinton’s four electoral votes in New Hampshire. We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2017/sep/15/young-conservatives/website-passes-along-dubious-claims-about-fraudule/

Is there evidence of voter fraud in New Hampshire, as Kris Kobach said? Not really
","Kris Kobach, the Kansas Secretary of State and Vice Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, has alleged voter fraud in the New Hampshire 2016 election. But his evidence is circumstantial at best. Kobach penned a Breitbart column on Sept. 7, 2017, claiming that 5,313 fraudulent votes likely altered the results of the Senate race between Democrat Maggie Hassan and Republican Kelly Ayotte and the presidential general election. Hassan won her race by 1,017 votes, and Clinton won the state over President Donald Trump by 2,732 votes. ""Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on Nov. 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes in the presidential election,"" Kobach wrote. Kobach repeated his point in Manchester, N.H., on Sept. 12, 2017, during the second meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity,  which Trump formed to analyze vulnerabilities in the voting system after his widely debunked claim that millions of illegal voters participated in the election. Kobach didn’t respond to our request for comment but Kobach’s spokeswoman, Samantha Poetter, said he stood by his column after the meeting. ""About 5,300 (voters) as of 10 months (after voting) still had not obtained a New Hampshire’s driver’s license, which is required of residents 60 days after moving to the state, nor had they registered a vehicle in the state of New Hampshire,"" Kobach said. ""So this obviously is a subject of concern because there have often been anecdotal reports of people driving into New Hampshire because it’s a same day registration state and voting because it’s a battleground state."" Kobach also said that unlike his state of Kansas, New Hampshire has people ""flooding across the border to possibly cast a vote."" Trump and his Cabinet have repeated baseless claims that thousands of Massachusetts residents ""brought in on buses"" voted illegally in New Hampshire, which we originally rated Pants on Fire. Do we have reason to doubt New Hampshire’s general election results? Again, not really. ""The problem that has occurred because of what you wrote is that the question of whether our election as we have recorded is real, and valid,"" said New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, who is a fellow member of the panel co-chaired by Kobach. ""And it is real and valid."" Gardner said that the facts laid out by Kobach don’t create proof for the accusation of voter fraud. He pointed out that in the column, as well as in his speech, Kobach had fudged the line between domicile and residency, which is crucial in understanding New Hampshire voting law. A state Supreme Court decision determined that a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. In other words, it’s not necessary for the 5,313 voters in question to have become residents in order for their votes to be valid.

""Until further research is done and until you make the next cut to find out how many are non-domiciled and then the final cut to actually determine how they voted, we will never know the answer regarding the legitimacy of that election,"" Kobach said in the panel. But Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, another member of the committee who affirmed New Hampshire’s voting integrity, said Kobach’s need to find out how voters cast their ballot was unnecessary in determining fraud, as fraudulent votes don’t necessarily equal votes against the Republican candidates. ""We shouldn’t know how they voted,"" Dunlap said. ""There’s a secret ballot, and it protects the voter."" Dunlap also said Kobach was conflating fraud with the oft-contested New Hampshire voting statute that allows non-residents to vote. Kobach expressed his support for New Hampshire's Republican-backed SB 3, a recent law that calls on those registering to vote within 30 days of an election to provide documents that show they live where they are voting. A judge blocked the law's penalties. Kobach said, ""Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four Electoral College votes in the presidential election."" He cited 5,313 votes cast with out-of-state IDs, but New Hampshire law says there’s nothing inherently fraudulent about them, as a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state.

Can noncitizens vote in San Francisco, Takoma Park elections?
","Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam asked his Twitter followers if voting practices in San Francisco and Takoma Park, Md., are fair to American citizens since they allow noncitizens to participate. ""San Fran & Takoma Park have been overrun by liberals. They’re allowing illegals to vote. Is this fair to Americans?"" Putnam, a Republican who is running for governor, tweeted Aug. 30. San Fran & Takoma Park have been overrun by liberals. They’re allowing illegals to vote. Is this fair to Americans? https://t.co/Q1YkvZ1sXJ Putnam’s tweet caught our attention given the broader false claims from President Donald Trump and others that millions of immigrants in the country illegally fraudulently voted in the 2016 presidential election. Was Putnam correct about San Francisco and Takoma Park ""allowing illegals to vote""? Starting in the 2018 November elections, noncitizens in San Francisco will be allowed to vote for board of education members. Takoma Park in 1992 adopted a measure permitting noncitizens to vote in city elections. But noncitizens in those cities cannot vote in other elections, a notable distinction not clear in Putnam’s tweet. In the November 2016 election, San Francisco voted in favor of Proposition N, which asked if the city should allow noncitizen residents of San Francisco who are of legal voting age, not in prison or on parole for a felony conviction, and the parent, legal guardian or legally recognized caregiver of a child living in the San Francisco Unified School District to vote for Board of Education members. The approved measure is set to apply to the elections in 2018, 2020 and 2022. It’s slated to expire after the 2022 election unless it’s extended by ordinance, according to the San Francisco Department of Elections. The San Francisco elections department did not provide comment in reaction to Putnam’s tweet, but Takoma Park told us his message was a ""mischaracterization"" of its voting policy. ""It's clear that Mr. Putnam's social media posts were sent to cause a knee-jerk reaction and fails to accurately describe what our City Charter does,"" said Jeremy Dickey, Takoma Park city spokesman. ""He chose not to attack the fact that Takoma Park also allows 16-year-olds to vote, because that would not have fit his narrative."" A charter amendment resolution adopted in 1992 removed the citizenship requirement for voting in Takoma Park for the election of the city’s mayor and six council members, Dickey said. ""Takoma Park strives to be a welcoming community for all, and that means allowing people who live in our City to have their voices heard, regardless of citizenship status,"" Dickey added. But the right doesn’t extend to federal office. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 states it’s unlawful for noncitizens to vote for candidates seeking federal offices, such as the presidency or a seat in Congress. But it’s not illegal for noncitizens to vote for local offices if it’s allowed by a state constitution, statute or local ordinance. We asked voting and elections experts for feedback on Putnam’s claim. They said his message left the impression that noncitizens are allowed to vote in all types of elections. Voting rights granted to noncitizens in Takoma Park and San Francisco ""are limited to local office, not a blanket right to vote for all governmental offices,"" said Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud. ""These cities are allowing noncitizens to vote in elections, but the lack of clarity about which elections is misleading and in context with Trump's unsubstantiated claims of millions of illegal votes in the presidential election, Putnam's overly broad claim creates confusion and detracts from the ability for the public to assess whether noncitizens should be given limited voting access,"" said Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. The replies to Putnam’s post show the confusion among some people who saw it. ""Per Constitution only citizens can vote,"" one person responded. ""Illegal Voting?  If allowed, we lose all form of control in this country. Let's let taxpayers vote.  Become Legal & Vote,"" wrote another. Even though some localities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, noncitizen voting in the United States is rare, said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. And the actual number of noncitizens who vote in local elections is relatively small, said Joshua A. Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law and voting rights. Douglas wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post noting that noncitizen voting has a storied history in America and used to be more commonplace than it is now. ""The intent of these new laws is not to allow illegal aliens to vote but to give legal noncitizens, also called legal permanent residents, a say in local affairs,"" Douglas said. ""In fact, even if the text of the law technically allows illegal aliens to vote, it seems highly unlikely that they would register with the city (thereby giving government officials precise info on their citizenship status) so as to vote."" It's worth noting that a noncitizen isn't just someone who is in the country illegally. That classification also extends to individuals who are in the country on visas or who are lawful permanent residents. Putnam’s tweet was expanded on in an op-ed published by multiple Florida publications, his website also posted the op-ed and a link to it was posted on Facebook and Twitter before the tweet about San Francisco and Takoma Park, his office said. The tweet about San Francisco and Takoma Park did not include a link to the editorial, but to a form and poll on Putnam’s website that required individuals to submit their email address along with a ""No"" or ""Yes"" answer to the question ""Should Illegal Immigrants Be Allowed To Vote?"" Politicians use polls like these to collect personal information about voters to target with advertising, or to raise funds. Putnam’s op-ed said voting is an American right that must be protected and ""not minimize the value of it by allowing noncitizens the same right."" It criticizes so-called sanctuary cities and adds that some cities ""have taken it a step further."" ""Not only are they allowing violent illegal aliens to remain within their boundaries without the threat of getting caught, but some cities are going so far as to grant illegal aliens the right to vote in America,"" said the Aug. 29 op-ed. Cities like San Francisco and College Park, Md., ""have lost their American values, and have been overrun by liberals. They have forgotten the principles our nation was founded on – the right for American citizens to choose our leaders – in granting foreigners who violated our laws to come to our country the right to shape our country’s future through voting,"" Putnam wrote. College Park was still considering the issue when Putnam's editorial published. (College Park officials initially said the measure passed, but they later clarified that it actually failed. They said it did not receive the necessary number of affirmative votes as required by state law.) National media outlets have reported on a ""growing trend of liberal cities, including Takoma Park and San Francisco, allowing illegal immigrants to vote,"" said Amanda Bevis, spokeswoman for Putnam. ""Adam Putnam will not let that happen in Florida. Illegal immigrants violated our laws to come to America, and these cities are granting those very people the right to vote,"" Bevis added. ""The actions by these cities completely undermine the value of voting in America that so many others work so hard to earn."" Putnam said, San Francisco and Takoma Park are ""allowing illegals to vote."" In the November 2016 elections, San Francisco voted to allow noncitizens to vote for board of education members starting in the 2018 election. Takoma Park adopted a measure in 1992 to allow noncitizens to vote for mayor and city council members. Neither of the measures allow noncitizens to vote for candidates seeking other offices. Federal law allows noncitizens to vote in local elections if their municipalities allow it. Putnam's tweet leaves the impression that the cities give noncitizens broader voting power and that’s not the case.

Chappelle-Nadal’s statement isn’t necessarily a federal crime
","Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, faced calls that she should resign after writing on Facebook ""I hope Trump is assassinated!"" in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Criticism of Chappelle-Nadal’s statement came from Republicans and Democrats, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis. ""Calling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime. … (She is) an embarrassment to our state. She should resign immediately,"" Clay told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in an article published Aug. 18. On Wednesday, the Missouri Senate censured Chappelle-Nadal. The resolution reads, ""Members of the Missouri Senate urge Senator Chappelle-Nadal to resign or, upon failure to do so, she may be subject to potential expulsion at a future session of the Missouri Senate."" That’s a political decision. We wanted to know whether calling for the assassination of a president really is a federal crime. We reached out to Clay’s spokesman, Steven Engelhardt, who pointed us to a Wikipedia article on U.S. Code Title 18, Section 871, which states that ""knowingly and willfully"" threatening the president is a felony. While that is the law, after consulting with experts, we found it’s not quite as straightforward as Clay made it out to be. The context, wording and intent of the statement are all important factors to consider to determine whether the speaker committed a federal crime. Early versions of the law date back as far as 1351, with the British Treason Act. The act made it a crime to plan or imagine the death of the king of England. The United States is no stranger to presidential assassinations and attempts, which justifies the existence of the current law, said Ronald Feinman, author of the book, ""Assassinations, Threats, and the American Presidency: From Andrew Jackson to Barack Obama."" ""One out of every 10 presidents has been killed, and one out of every seven has been wounded and about half of them have faced threats we know of,"" Feinman said. ""So it is a endemic problem in America."" Lyrissa Lidsky, dean of the MU  School of Law, said threats have a ""tremendously disruptive effect"" and are considered outside the boundary of normal conflict in the political arena. ""Threat laws are designed to, one, prevent the person who's making the threat from carrying out the threat,"" Lidsky said. ""But another purpose is to prevent intimidation of the person who's threatened. So if a speaker says, 'I'm going to kill you,' chances are, your life will be seriously affected if you think someone has made a serious threat to kill you."" The law has evolved, MU School of Law professor Frank Bowman said. ""In 15th century England, this statement would surely be taken as a threat,"" Bowman said of Chappelle-Nadal’s comment. ""Now the Secret Service has to do some triage to discover if a threat was made."" While it is a crime to threaten to assassinate the president, Clay’s statement fails to consider the nuance needed to determine whether a statement is a true threat that would be deemed a crime. ""It's an overstatement,"" Lidsky said of Clay’s claim. ""You really have to look at the statement and discern what the speaker intended. Whether it was a joke, a jest, hyperbole or whether it was a serious intent to threaten the president."" Other experts emphasized the importance of the statement’s language, context and tone when analyzing it. ""The key word really is threat. Threat doesn’t just mean, 'I wish this would happen,'"" Bowman said. The United States Supreme Court explicitly dealt with the issue in 1969 in Watts v. United States, when an 18-year-old man who disagreed with being drafted said, ""If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J."" The Supreme Court ruled that the man’s statement was ""crude political hyperbole"" that ""did not constitute a knowing and willful threat against the President."" Experts have stressed that social media complicates the problem. ""A statement made on social media doesn't automatically have the same contextual clues as to the speaker's meaning as a statement made in person,"" Lidsky said. When it comes to free speech and what you can say or post on social media, there are limits, Feinman said. ""You can condemn (the president), you can denounce him, but you don't have a right to call for his death, because that could incite others to commit violence,"" Feinman said. It’s unclear if Chappelle-Nadal’s statement was ""calling for the assassination of the president,"" as Clay claimed. ""Saying, 'I hope' is not the same thing as saying, 'Please someone go out and assassinate the president,’ "" Lidksy said. ""The very language of it itself means it's unlikely to be a threat, because she's not saying she's going to assassinate him, and she's not even calling for somebody to go out and assassinate him. It's a hope. And so therefore, that's unlikely to be a federal crime standing on its face."" Experts said they thought it would be unlikely that Chappelle-Nadal would be prosecuted. At most, she could be investigated. Clay said, ""Calling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime."" While calling for the assassination of a president can be a crime, context matters. Decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis to determine if someone’s statement is a true threat with intent that could lead to prosecution. In Chappelle-Nadal’s case, experts agreed that her statement was more wishful thinking than incitement to assassinate the president. Therefore, Clay’s statement was missing important details and was an overgeneralization of the law.

Roy Blunt points out a serious lack of Internet infrastructure in Missouri
","The internet has become a part of everyday American life, and people are more connected now than ever before. However, some Americans do not have access to high quality broadband services. At the Missouri State Fair, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt addressed an audience about the importance of broadband access for rural residents, saying that two-thirds of rural Missouri residents are lacking broadband access. Nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. That needs to change,"" Blunt posted on Twitter Aug.8, 2017. The tweet included a video clip from the address. Blunt went on to talk about why he believes broadband is necessary. He also went on to discuss how he is an advocate for broadband issues on the Senate floor. Blunt’s remarks got us thinking: Are two-thirds of rural Missourians really lacking access to the service? A spokesperson for Sen. Blunt pointed us to a Wall Street Journal piece, as well as some past research by the PolitiFact team as the sources backing the statement. Before we delve deeper into the issue, let’s establish what ""broadband"" means. The FCC describes it in a 2016 report as the speed benchmark of 25 Mbps download speed and 3 Mbps upload speed for fixed (not mobile) services. The FCC is required by a portion of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to report on whether Americans are able to access advanced telecommunications capabilities. They define this as, ""‘high-quality’ capability that allow users to ‘originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video’ services."" Basically, high-speed internet. In the same report, the FCC said 10 percent of Americans lack access to broadband — 39 percent of rural Americans and 4 percent of Americans living in an urban area. Currently, many rural Missourians use alternatives to broadband like DSL, or digital subscriber line, which uses the same two-wire copper telephone line used for landlines. Some people just use their phones for internet, but for Northeast and Northwest Missourians, it’s tough to get service. Surprisingly, 8 percent of rural Missourians still use dial-up internet. While 39 percent of rural Americans live without access to broadband internet, that figure jumps to 61 in Missouri, according to the FCC. Missouri is lagging compared to surrounding states. Forty-nine percent of rural residents in Kansas are without broadband access, 56 percent in Illinois, 37 percent in Iowa and 48 percent in Arkansas. The lack of access affects everything from telemedicine to searching for jobs. It even touches agriculture: Janie Dunning, Missouri Farm Bureau’s consultant for broadband, said farmers utilize technology in order to do ""precision farming."" By combining computers and farm equipment, production can increase, and business can be easier to manage. Further, when looking at a map provided by the FCC, we can see that in Missouri, even when rural areas have broadband access, most of those residents only have one provider option. It gets worse. ""One caution on using broadband maps and data — you need to understand how ‘access’ is being counted,"" said University of Missouri Extension state specialist for community development Sharon Gulick. ""In many cases as long as one person or business in the zip code has access, that zip code is considered covered. Also, having it available and it being affordable are also two very different issues."" In most rankings, Missouri is around No. 40 to 47 when it comes to broadband access, Dunning said. Missouri has over 6 million people living it, 70 percent of whom are in urban areas and 30 percent in rural areas, Dunning said. So with almost a third of the population residing in rural areas, how are there so many without broadband? When looking at people per square mile, the state average is 87.1 people per square mile. In urban areas, that number skyrockets to 5,000 people per square mile; conversely, some rural areas have as few as one or two people per square mile. ""Even non-profit providers need a return on investment,"" Dunning said. ""Providers prioritize the urban areas since there’s more people who will use their services. It’s just more financially feasible."" Blunt said that nearly two-thirds of rural Missourians don’t have access to broadband. FCC numbers back up his statement. Experts agree that Missouri has a broadband access issue, and all cite the same FCC report. The 2016 Broadband Progress Report from the FCC states that 61 percent of rural Missourians lack access to broadband. The report is the most recent and uses a benchmark of of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps for high-speed internet. While 61 percent isn’t 2/3, it’s nearly so, especially in the context of the statement.

Ken Paxton makes unfounded claim that Barack Obama used DACA to 'unilaterally confer' citizenship
","The lead lawyer for Texas state government hailed President Donald Trump’s rescission of predecessor Barack Obama’s move affording young unauthorized immigrants, sometimes called ""Dreamers,"" renewable shields from deportation. Moreover, Attorney General Ken Paxton charged in a Sept. 5, 2017, press release, Obama ""used that lawful-presence dispensation to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship."" A reader asked us to check on that. In his release, Paxton said the program that Trump gave Congress six months to restore granted lawful presence and work permits to nearly a million ""unlawfully present aliens."" That's close to solid. The Pew Research Center recently estimated that fewer immigrants, nearly 790,000 people with roots mostly in Mexico, have received work permits and deportation relief through the Obama-launched Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Yet citizenship wasn’t a declared offering via DACA. The June 2012 Homeland Security memo announcing the program said: ""This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights."" Iowa senator touts figures So, what citizenship provision was Paxton talking about? By email, Kayleigh Lovvorn, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, replied that DACA wasn’t intended to be a path to citizenship. But, Lovvorn wrote, figures released by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services indicate that 39,514 DACA recipients have been approved for Lawful Permanent Resident status,"" green cards, her email implying that such individuals could later seek citizenship. A web search led us to a Sept. 1, 2017, press release from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, publicizing the USCIS figures. Grassley’s release said preliminary data ""indicate that the Obama administration allowed thousands of DACA recipients to exploit an immigration law loophole to obtain green cards. The data also show that more than a thousand DACA recipients have already obtained citizenship."" As of Aug. 21, 2017, Grassley’s release said, 45,447 DACA recipients had been approved for ""advance parole"" with 3,993 applicants getting applications denied. ""This approval,"" the release says, ""allows a DACA recipient to travel out of the country and legally return, making them eligible to adjust their immigration status and receive a green card."" We’ll delve into ""advance parole."" But first, more numbers from Grassley’s release: 59,778 DACA recipients have applied for green cards with 39,514 approved. Also, the release said, 2,181 of the green-card recipients have applied for U.S. citizenship--with 1,056 becoming citizens, which would break out to 0.1 percent of DACA recipients becoming citizens, by our calculation. We spotted no elaboration in the release--and didn’t draw any from Grassley aides or Homeland Security--demonstrating that any of the tallied individuals obtained citizenship by virtue of being a DACA recipient. On the other hand, legal experts supportive of DACA told us the advance parole aspect of the program may have helped individuals attain legal residency and citizenship. In each instance, the experts stressed, a person getting citizenship would first need to have been sponsored by an immediate family member--most commonly a spouse--who was already a legal permanent resident or citizen, which would have been required regardless of an applicant’s DACA participation. Natalia Drelichman, an attorney for Austin-based American Gateways, which serves refugees and other immigrants, said by phone: ""The fact that individuals are eligible to apply for green cards if they have a qualifying relative, somebody who can apply for them, is old news."" Drelichman and others stressed that attaining citizenship, for any immigrant, is a multistep process. ""Only some DACA recipients will be eligible for green cards,"" Drelichman said. ""And the path from green card to citizenship is long and requires meeting certain obligations, including payment of federal income taxes, at least three years of continual legal permanent residency, and passing the"" required ""civics and history exam,"" Drelichman said. ""There is no direct route to citizenship uniquely available to DACA holders."" Employing advance parole We dug into advanced parole after hearing back from Arwen FitzGerald, a USCIS spokeswoman, who reaffirmed by email that an estimated 40,000 DACA recipients have received Legal Permanent Resident status and another 1,000 have become citizens. FitzGerald also said: ""The majority of these cases received their status through a grant of advance parole."" Separately, the Fact Checker at The Washington Post said in a Sept. 7, 2017, analysis that Grassley’s release failed to account for DACA recipients who wouldn’t have needed advance parole to seek legal residency because the beneficiaries had previously entered the U.S. with visas and not left in the meantime. All told, that story estimated that about 3,000 DACA recipients may have used the advance parole strategy to pursue legal residency. Advance parole, experts told us, reflects an element of immigration law that permits certain people living in the U.S. without legal authorization--including some members of the military and some juveniles-- to travel to a home country for a specified purpose and then have the opportunity, with federal approval, to return--and no longer be considered someone who’d entered the U.S. without permission. That clean-slate distinction can provide a lift because under U.S. law, it’s more difficult for someone living in the country after entering without legal permission to seek legal status. ‘An important strategy’ In a June 2016 memo on advance parole options for DACA recipients, the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which says it focuses on advancing immigrant rights, said DACA recipients approved for advance parole will, on return, ""be paroled into the U.S., which is considered a lawful entry. This reentry with parole allows some of those immigrants more opportunities to seek permanent residence,"" according to the memo, which otherwise called such a request ""an important strategy to consider."" DACA recipients (unlike other immigrants seeking advance parole) must present a specific humanitarian, educational or employment reason for traveling to another country, the memo noted. Still, the center advised, someone who obtained advance parole wasn’t guaranteed re-entry. ""When an advance parole recipient presents herself at a U.S. port-of-entry upon her return,"" the center said, ""she will be subject to inspection by an immigration official who will make a discretionary decision as to whether she will be paroled into the United States."" As Trump rescinded the DACA program, Homeland Security said new applications from DACA recipients for advance parole would no longer be accepted. Lawyers comment Drelichman, among expert attorneys we reached, called Paxton's statement ""very misleading."" If ""you have DACA"" status, she said, ""it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be a U.S. citizen."" David Leopold, a Cleveland immigration lawyer and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, also was critical, deeming Paxton’s claim ""a gross mischaracterization"" of DACA, which did not confer citizenship, Leopold said. A San Diego immigration attorney, Cesar Luna, noted by phone that whether a person landed advance parole or not, she or he still would have needed a sponsoring immediate family member to pursue citizenship. ""You have to have another latch,"" Luna said. Our ruling Paxton said President Obama used the order creating DACA ""to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship."" It’s flat-out incorrect to say that Obama via DACA conferred citizenship on anyone. That’s not how the system works, and the attorney general should know better. This unsupported characterization traces to a few DACA recipients--about a tenth of 1 percent—who gained citizenship in part by returning from abroad with a clean slate in accord with existing laws not amended by DACA. We find the claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Rep. Dave Brat claims DACA leads to chain migration of up to 4 million. That's False
","Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va. said that a program that protects young immigrants from deportation needs to be looked at in a broader context and that a bipartisan deal to protect the program is misguided. NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Brat if he was open to granting legal status to DACA beneficiaries if Democrats supported funding Trump’s promised border wall. ""I don't like these little pieces, as I was just saying,"" Brat said Sept. 7. ""That's not the problem. If you want to know if people are going in good faith on immigration reform, first you've got to do e-Verify and then you've got to take a look at chain migration, right? So the number on DACA is 800,000, but every one person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status. So it's 3 or 4 million, right?"" Brat went on to say that ""8 billion people would love to come here"" but that such migration ""ain't going to work."" Todd interjected that the number at issue was not 8 billion, ""we're talking about 800,000."" The 800,000 is the approximate number of young people who are part of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA program. DACA spares from deportation immigrants in the country illegally who came to the United States as children. President Donald Trump gave Congress six months to pass a bill that would deal with the hundreds of thousands of people protected by the program. Brat said the 800,000 number was deceptive. ""The DACA problem is the immigration problem. And once you put up a green light, it's a green light. Once you legalize and say, hey, once you make it in here, the American people are generous, always have been. We're a country of immigrants. But once you put up that green light, kwoom, right? Surges come every time."" Brat left us wondering if in fact DACA recipients could bring in extended family members ""once they reach a certain status"" and if that could add up to 4 million additional immigrants. His office said this could happen once they got green cards. But green card recipients can only petition for spouses and unmarried children. On average, DACA recipients came to the United States before they were 7 years old. DACA gave individuals temporary deportation relief, but did not grant them legal status. Having DACA does not allow them to petition a family member to come to the United States. What ""certain status"" was Brat referring to? ""Currently a loophole exists for DACA recipients to become eligible for green cards,"" said Juliana Heerschap, Brat’s communications director. ""Individuals with a green card status can petition to bring their immediate and extended family into the United States."" Heerschap pointed us to a Sept. 1 press release from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that said ""the Obama administration allowed thousands of DACA recipients to exploit an immigration law loophole to obtain green cards,"" and that some of them had become U.S. citizens. Grassley said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services preliminary data showed that as of Aug. 1, 2017: • 45,447 DACA recipients were approved for advance parole (3,993 applications denied); • 59,778 DACA recipients had applied for green cards and 39,514 were approved; • of those who received green cards, 2,181 had applied for U.S. citizenship, and 1,056 had become U.S. citizens. Advance parole is issued at the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security, and DACA recipients can request it for humanitarian, education or employment purposes. It allows them to travel outside the United States and re-enter lawfully. (Individuals with other immigration statuses or protections can also request advance parole.) Simply re-entering lawfully thanks to an advance parole does not lead to legal permanent residence. A DACA recipient would still need to be eligible for a green card under established categories. However, coming in with advance parole can make the green card process easier and faster for immigrants who initially entered the country illegally. Brat’s office told us people who have green cards could petition for their immediate and extended family. But per U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, green card holders can only petition for spouses and unmarried children. Only U.S. citizens can petition for extended family members, such as parents and siblings, and in those cases the petitioner must be at least 21 years old. While the majority of DACA recipients are now adults, it’s worth noting that to be approved they had to be in the United States before they were 16 years old. Also, DACA recipients on average were 6.5 years old when they came to the United States, according to an August survey of 3,063 program beneficiaries, fielded by Tom K. Wong, an associate professor of political science at the University of California-San Diego. The median age of arrival was 6, according to the survey. How did Brat determine that DACA beneficiaries could bring in 3 or 4 million people? ""Rep. Brat calculated the 3 or 4 million number based on a rough estimate of total immediate and extended family members potentially eligible for chain migration if DACA recipients receive green card status. This is a very back of the envelope estimate and conservative at best,"" said Heerschap said, his communications director. Heerschap referred us to a paper on chain migration published by Negative Population Growth, which studies overpopulation and advocates for gradual population reduction and reversal, including through an 80 percent decrease in legal immigration. Contemporary studies found that in recent years each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 additional immigrants, the paper said. Federal data up to March 31, 2017, show that 787,580 people had been approved for DACA. If each of the 787,580 people approved brought in 3.45 family members, that would be 2.71 million more immigrants. But green card holders cannot petition for extended family members and it’d be unlikely that the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients have spouses and unmarried children back in their home country, because many came to the United States after they were 6 years old. DACA beneficiaries also must have continuously lived in the United States since June 15, 2007. Brat’s office also linked us to data from Migration Policy Institute that estimated the number of people who may benefit under House and Senate bills introduced in 2017 to help so-called ""Dreamers."" Under the Senate bill, about 1.5 million immigrants would be eligible for a green card, compared to an estimated 938,000 under the House proposal, MPI reported. Brat said, ""So the number on DACA is 800,000, but every one person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status. So it's 3 or 4 million, right?"" Brat’s office said the status he meant was lawful permanent residence. However, even if DACA recipients were to become lawful permanent residents, as green card holders they cannot petition for extended family members to enter the United States, only spouses and unmarried children. DACA recipients were on average 6.5 years old when they arrived, making it less likely that they all have children and spouses back in their home country.

"['Corporations', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan: 35% corporate tax rate keeps $3 trillion in 'trapped cash' overseas from coming to U.S.
","When U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff on Sept. 1, 2017, an editor mentioned major tax cuts adopted under Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981. At first, Ryan joked around. ""The music was bad in those days, and the tax laws were as well,"" he replied, chuckling. ""So, I think -- I’m not a big ‘80s music guy; I’m more of a ‘70s guy."" But the 47-year-old Janesville Republican quickly got serious. Arguing that U.S. taxes are stopping U.S.-based multinational corporations from bringing giant sums of money to America, he stated: We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws. Ryan has made essentially the same claim a number of times, including on Milwaukee television, on CNBC, on Twitter and to the New York Times.   So, do U.S. tax laws essentially prevent $3 trillion being held overseas from being brought to this country? Keep the word repatriate in mind. Taxing foreign earnings The object of Ryan’s criticism is the U.S. corporate tax rate. At 35 percent, as we reported in a Donald Trump fact check during the 2016 presidential campaign, it is among the highest in the world -- though it’s worth noting that, after deductions, companies typically pay an ""effective"" rate that can be much lower. (Trump, by the way, pledged during the presidential campaign to reduce the rate to 15 percent. That promise has been rated as In the Works on PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter.) As for the focus of Ryan’s claim, he’s talking about U.S.-based multinational corporations. More specifically, the foreign-earned profits of those companies. Here’s an example of how the taxation works: If the company earns income in a country with a 20 percent corporate tax rate, it would pay that 20 percent tax immediately to that country. If that money is then repatriated -- that is, brought back to the company’s U.S. headquarters -- the company would pay an additional 15 percent to the U.S. government. (In other words, the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent minus the 20 percent already paid to the foreign country.) So, as long as the profits stay parked overseas, there is no U.S. tax on it. Now to the specifics of Ryan’s claim. The $3 trillion figure To back up Ryan’s statement, his office cited an April 2017 CNBC news article that said American companies are holding about $2.6 trillion in overseas earnings, and the figure has been growing. That’s the latest estimate by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, for 2015, although an estimate done in July 2017 for PolitiFact National put the figure at $2.8 trillion. So, Ryan’s claim of about $3 trillion is reasonable. It’s worth noting that the figure has been rising. In fact, considering only the Russell 1000 index of large companies, the amount of parked cash overseas has more than doubled since 2008, as shown in a July 2017 report by the Massachusetts research firm Audit Analytics: Year Amount of foreign-earned profits by U.S.-based companies kept overseas 2008 $1.09 trillion 2009 $1.19 trillion 2010 $1.36 trillion 2011 $1.63 trillion 2012 $1.89 trillion 2013 $2.12 trillion 2014 $2.3 trillion 2015 $2.43 trillion 2016 $2.62 trillion ‘Trapped’ and ‘basically can’t come back’ Ryan asserts that the money is ""trapped overseas"" and ""basically can’t come back"" because of U.S. tax laws To be sure, a substantial amount of foreign profits are repatriated each year. But Ryan didn’t invent the term ""trapped cash."" In fact, academics for years have referred to it as a commonly used term to describe the growing amount of cash held by U.S. multinationals overseas to avoid, or at least defer, paying the 35 percent U.S. tax rate. Ryan’s claim is also backed by September 2017 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Massachusetts. The paper found a dramatic increase in U.S. corporations holding onto cash; that the cash is concentrated in foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations; and that it is explained by low foreign tax rates. News articles also have reported on the phenomenon. In August 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook said of his company’s profits parked offshore: ""We’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate. There’s no debate about it."" Apple is second to Microsoft in the amount of cash parked overseas, according to Audit Analytics. And as the San Jose Mercury News reported in May 2017, the tax is such a deterrent that even though Apple was sitting on $240 billion in overseas cash, it has continued to borrow money. The reason: The borrowing cost Apple 4 percent or less, far below the 35 percent tax that would be paid for repatriating the overseas cash. One more point before we close: The companies would like to repatriate the money because bringing it back to the parent company enables them to do things such as paying dividends, doing stock buybacks and investing in U.S. operations. Several academic experts told us that some of the overseas money, while not repatriated directly back to the companies’ U.S. headquarters, is invested in U.S. securities. That doesn’t trigger the 35 percent tax. Our rating Ryan says: ""We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws."" To avoid a 35 percent U.S. tax, U.S.-based multinational companies have opted not to ""repatriate"" roughly $3 trillion of their foreign profits, a figure that is growing. That is, they don’t bring the money back to their U.S. headquarters, where it can be used for things such as dividend payments or investments in their domestic operations. But the overseas profits aren’t literally trapped and indeed some foreign-earned profits are repatriated, though they are subject to the 35 percent tax. Ryan’s statement is accurate but needs additional information, our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/sep/15/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-35-corporate-tax-rate-keeps-3-trillion-t/

Beto O'Rourke says latest polls show he's running even with Ted Cruz
","A West Texas Democrat seeking to represent the state in the U.S. Senate asserts that he’s already running even with incumbent Ted Cruz, who won the seat with 57 percent of the vote in 2012 before later running for president. In an August 2017 Facebook post, El Paso U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s campaign said: ""Beto O’Rourke out-raised Senator Ted Cruz in the second financial quarter without taking a DIME from PACs, and the latest polls show us tied neck-and-neck."" O’Rourke indeed raised more money than Cruz from April through June 2017 though Cruz, a Republican, ended the quarter with a balance of $5.7 million in campaign cash compared to O’Rourke’s $1.9 million. Also, we’ve previously noted that O’Rourke no longer takes PAC contributions. Let’s focus the Truth-O-Meter this time on whether the latest polls show O’Rourke ""tied neck-and-neck"" with Cruz. To our inquiry, Jody Casey of O’Rourke’s campaign emailed us a web link to an April 2017 USA Today Network news story headlined ""O’Rourke, Castro running even with Cruz, poll shows,"" Castro being U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio, who later said he wouldn’t be challenging Cruz. According to the USA Today Network story, a statewide poll of 1,000 adults commissioned by the Texas Lyceum, a leadership group, found 30 percent of respondents favoring Cruz, 30 percent backing O’Rourke. That’s neck and neck--albeit with 40 percent of the respondents not accounted for. Texas Lyceum poll For the full skinny, we turned to the Lyceum’s post about the poll, which specifies that the poll was conducted statewide April 3-9, 2017, and that 890 respondents who self-identified as registered voters answered this question: ""If the 2018 election for Senate were held today, would you vote for the Republican Ted Cruz, the Democrat Beto O’Rourke, or haven’t you thought enough about it?"" Each time, the order of the names was randomized, according to the results.        SOURCE: Documents showing topline results and crosstabs, 2017 Texas Lyceum Poll, April 18, 2017 (accessed Sept. 11, 2017) Beyond the 30 percent-30 percent split between O’Rourke and Cruz, the results indicate, 37 percent of respondents said they hadn’t thought enough about it with 3 percent refusing to reply or saying they didn’t know. By phone, Josh Blank the Texas Lyceum’s research director, told us that an observer could read the results as indicative of a neck-and-neck race; he said he thinks it’s too soon to reach that conclusion. ""The electorate isn’t knowledgeable enough yet,"" Blank said. The April poll ""is mainly a reflection of name identification and voter attitudes about"" Cruz, he said. By email, Blank noted that among the 37 percent of respondents who did not choose between Cruz and O’Rourke, 36 percent identified as moderates, 33 percent identified as conservatives, and 19 percent identified as liberals. That is, Blank said, ""a larger share of voters who admitted to not yet having a preference identify as conservative as opposed to liberal. When they choose to tune into the race, they are going to be predisposed towards supporting Cruz over O'Rourke."" Republicans underrepresented? We asked Mike Baselice of Austin, a pollster for Republican clients who’s not working for Cruz, to assess the April poll results. By email, Baselice suggested that the poll showed Cruz and O’Rourke with identical levels of support because it surveyed too few Republicans considering the actual Texas electorate. In the poll, 27 percent of adults identified as Republican, 32 percent as Democratic and 40 percent as Independent. Thirty-seven percent self-identified as conservative, 34 percent as moderate, 21 percent as liberal. Baselice wrote: ""Our surveys have shown an 8-10"" percentage ""point Republican advantage over Democrats in terms of partisan vote behavior. ""You can look at the down-ballot races where the vast majority of the candidates are unknown to the voters, and yet we see that Republicans defeated Democrats statewide by an average of 15 points in 2016,"" Baselice said. That margin, by our calculation, averaged 14.8 percentage points across seven races, one for the Texas Railroad Commission and six for judicial posts. Blank, asked about Baselice’s comment, said by email that the April poll intentionally gathered the opinions of more people than likely voters. Blank said future polls, closer to the November 2018 election, will be filtered to ""make the measurement of the electorate more conservative, and more in-line with the ultimate outcome "" Texas Tribune survey Blank noted that more recently, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune survey of 1,200 Texas adults taken from June 2-11, 2017, found few people familiar with O’Rourke, who’s making his first bid for statewide office. That poll didn’t ask people to pick between Cruz and O’Rourke. Rather, 18 percent of respondents held a favorable view of O’Rourke, 15 percent neither favorable or unfavorable and 13 percent felt unfavorable--with 55 percent not knowing or having no opinion. In contrast, the poll found 37 percent of respondents with a favorable view of Cruz, 12 percent neither favorable or unfavorable and 45 percent unfavorable--with 6 percent not knowing or having no opinion. We otherwise heard back from Jim Williams of North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling, which serves Democratic clients. By phone, Williams said the firm last polled Texans about the 2018 U.S. Senate race in August 2016. That poll suggested Cruz would lead Democrat Wendy Davis or Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and Housing and Urban Development secretary; it didn’t test Cruz versus O’Rourke. Our ruling O’Rourke said ""the latest polls show us tied neck-and-neck"" with Cruz. An April 2017 poll showed a 30 percent-30 percent race though a plurality of registered voters indicated they didn’t know enough to commit either way and the poll folded in too many Democrats. O’Rourke didn’t identify any other poll of the match-up nor did we find one. We rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"['Military', 'Florida', 'Tom Bossert']","
Has the military taken unprecedented action in response to Hurricane Irma?
","President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said that the military has taken unprecedented steps in response to Hurricane Irma. By the time of this briefing Sept. 11, Hurricane Irma had weakened to a tropical storm as it made its way up the Florida peninsula. ""The mobilization of our military in response to the storms in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is the largest ever mobilization of our military in a naval and marine operation, and we now have an Air Force carrier deployed in this effort; this was the first-ever as well,"" Bossert said. Was the military’s response to Irma the largest naval operation ever and the first time an aircraft carrier has been deployed after a natural disaster? For one, the Navy actually operates aircraft carriers, not the Air Force. More to the point, it is too soon to say that the U.S. response to Irma was the largest response to a hurricane, and it definitely was not the first time an aircraft carrier was deployed for that reason. Hurricane Irma struck the U.S. Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm and skirted along Puerto Rico’s coast with 185 mph winds. The storm continued on a track towards Florida, where it hit the Keys as a Category 4 hurricane in the Florida Keys and then again on Marco Island as a Category 3. The storm caused major, widespread damage from Miami to Naples to Tampa and Jacksonville. In response to Irma, the Defense Department said on Tuesday that it had dispatched 10,000 service members to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and 20,700 in the eastern United States. The National Guard reported Sept. 12 that it had deployed more than 15,500 guardsmen in response to Irma. In addition to service members, the Pentagon has deployed nine ships and the USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier controlled by the Navy. These numbers could change as the department assesses what is needed.   Still, by numbers alone, the response to Irma at the time of this claim doesn’t quite stack up against the Pentagon’s response to Hurricane Katrina. By Sept. 7, 2005, nine days after Katrina made landfall, operations included 17,417 active-duty troops, 42,990 National Guardsmen, 20 U.S. ships, 360 helicopters and 93 military planes, according to a Congressional Research Service report. ""Whether the Irma efforts become the largest deployment of U.S. military forces after a natural disaster remains to be seen, but it’s worth noting that more than 12,000 Department of Defense personnel assisted with Unified Assistance, and thousands were deployed after Hurricane Katrina,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. More broadly, if you consider all naval and Marine operations (not just hurricane relief), then Bossert’s claim is even more inaccurate. ""Clearly this was nowhere near the biggest naval/Marine operation ever—it was dwarfed by big wartime operations from World War II and the Korean war and even Operation Desert Storm,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The Navy Office of Information confirmed that this was not the first time an aircraft carrier has been deployed to help hurricane recovery efforts. After Hurricane Katrina, the USS Harry S. Truman deployed for rescue and recovery operations. In addition, the USS Saipan was deployed after Hurricane Hazel in 1954. And it’s not only hurricanes. In 1959, the USS Kearsarge deployed to Japan to help with relief efforts related to Typhoon Vera. The USS Abraham Lincoln was also sent to Sumatra to provide support for Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami. #70YearsOfService 1959: USS Kearsarge responds to #Typhoon Vera in #Japan w/ airlifts & #SearchAndRescue ops.

He also added that for the first time ever an ""Air Force carrier"" had been deployed in the effort. Bossert misspoke when he said ""Air Force"" carrier, but it’s still not the first time an aircraft carrier has been used after a natural disaster. Most importantly, it is too soon to say that the military response to Hurricane Irma was the largest ever. At this point, the response to Irma doesn’t quite stack up against the Pentagon’s response to Hurricane Katrina.
