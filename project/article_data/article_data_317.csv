Wisconsin Rep. Joel Kleefisch says he didn’t break Assembly rules when he voted for 2 other members
","
The unidentified person with the camera phone recording the state Assembly proceedings Feb. 21, 2012, thought he scored a coup  -- a chance to show the public images of lawmakers breaking chamber rules and engaging in outright hypocrisy.

The shooter saw a vote being taken and state Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, stand up, reach over and press a button on his neighbor’s desk to vote on his behalf. Kleefisch then moved to the next desk and hit that missing member’s button as well.

Counting his own vote, Kleefisch voted three times.

When the video hit the Internet, it promptly drew squeals of hypocrisy. 
After all, Kleefisch -- who is married to Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch -- joined Republicans to pass a new photo ID law for voting while arguing the change was needed to prevent election fraud.

The day after the video was made, WTMJ-TV aired an ""I-Team"" report that included the cell phone multiple-vote footage. Asked if he had broken chamber rules, Kleefisch defended his actions.

""It depends on how you interpret the rule,"" he said. ""The rule says you have to be present in the chamber. The bathroom counts as the chamber. And the parlor counts as the chamber if you are grabbing something to eat.""

Ultimately cable TV talk show host Keith Olbermann branded Kleefisch his ""Worst Person in the World"" for Feb. 23, 2012.

That has to sting.

But is Kleefisch actually right?

Are Assembly members really considered in the chambers when they are, um, on the chamber pot? And can members vote for colleagues who are in the chamber and not at their desk?

We emailed and left voicemail for Kleefisch to ask him to elaborate on his claim. He did not respond before this item was completed. So we went to the rule book, and consulted with a couple of experts, including those in charge of running the Assembly.

Turns out, the chamber is more than the room itself.

The written rules  define the chamber as: ""The entire area west of the easternmost doors of the Assembly, including the visitor's galleries, lobbies, offices of the speaker, majority leader, and minority leader, and hallways.""

The rules also say: ""Only the members present in the Assembly chamber may vote.""

So what about the practice of voting for your neighbor?

Turns out, it’s done all of the time.

That’s not in the formal  rules, as Kleefisch indicated. But, like many legislative bodies, there are informal yet powerful rules of courtesy and tradition.

And that’s where the claim by Kleefisch needs some additional explanation.

""Traditionally, we’ve done it as a courtesy,"" said state Rep. Bill Kramer, R-Waukesha, the Assembly Speaker pro tem, whose job it is to maintain order, handling votes cast by 99 people and generally keeping business moving along during floor sessions.  ""Otherwise, we’d be breaking down every time we had a vote.""

Indeed, he said it’s very rare that everybody present is in their seats to vote.

""It’s less than 10 to 20 percent of the time that everybody votes for themselves,"" said Kramer.

Only in rare instances is there a vote where each member’s name is called. More commonly,  a vote is ""open"" for a short window, during which times members press their buttons. and their votes are tallied on a large scoreboard.

On a day when the Assembly has a lot of business to conduct, votes can begin and end in a minute or less. Strict enforcement of the ""present in chambers"" rule could dramatically slow down the voting process or result in many members not voting.

Sometimes the proxy voting can backfire.

That happened to state Rep. Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, on the same day Kleefisch was caught voting three times. State Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, voted on behalf of Barca against a measure regarding penalties for aiding a felon. But Barca wanted to be a ""yes"" vote, so when he returned to the floor he asked for -- and was granted permission -- to have his vote recorded as a ""yes.""

Where was Barca when Pasch stepped in?

""He was in here,"" in his office, said aide Rich Judge. And ""here"" means in the chambers, because Barca is the minority leader and his office is among those included in the formal definition.

A total of seven requests for corrected votes were made by Assembly members on the day in question, Feb. 21, 2012. Business began about 11 a.m., and then there was a recess from 12:30 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. Dozens of matters were then taken up in a session that lasted until 10:58 p.m., and there were more than three dozen votes taken.

From the video, it appears that Kleefisch voted for his neighbors, Rep. Paul Farrow, R-Pewaukee, and Rep. Dean Knudson, R-Hudson, who, according to the Assembly seating chart, are assigned to the desks next to Kleefisch. Neither Farrow nor Knudson returned a telephone message to discuss their whereabouts during the vote.

There’s no indication of what matter was being voted upon.

So voting on behalf of another member is a routine practice by members of both parties.
In fact, members sometimes press the button for a colleague not even in the building.

This is done as the chamber is called to order and attendance taken -- which is, strictly speaking, not a vote but attendance.

""It was not uncommon to see one or two people punch 30 buttons,"" said Stephen Freese, a Republican who served 12 years as speaker pro tem until 2006.

Why?

The Assembly’s business day often begins with routine, procedural matters and special recognitions. Then there is  a recess so the two parties can caucus and get their issues and votes lined up for the day. It may be hours before the body reconvenes for the real action.

In some cases, Freese said, an Assembly member might be coming from a great distance. So rather than leaving in the middle of the night to make the opening gavel, the member skips the procedural stuff but is there for the caucus and voting. Colleagues cover for him by registering him present.

Such votes usually are cast by another member of the tardy member’s party. But not always.

Said Freese: ""I’ve seen that, in the case of close friendships that have developed, a Republican will vote for a Democrat and a Democrat vote as a Republican,""

Our conclusion

Caught on video voting for his neighbors, Kleefisch claimed he didn’t break Assembly rules. The chambers, he said, extend beyond the floor, and include hallways, a parlor and the bathroom.

He’s correct, but that’s only part of the story. As Kleefisch said, ""It depends on how you interpret the rule."" The rules are clear on what is the chamber, but don’t specifically allow the vote-for-your neighbor approach. However, that is the longstanding, informal tradition of the body.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Stephen Sweeney']","
Stephen Sweeney claims his tax cut proposal would lower property taxes
","
In radio and TV interviews last week, Senate President Stephen Sweeney said what should come as a relief to most New Jerseyans: he has a plan to cut property taxes.

But a closer look at his proposal shows that the potential tax savings are more complicated than the senator made it sound.

While Gov. Chris Christie is pushing an across-the-board income tax cut, Sweeney unveiled a plan to provide a 10 percent tax credit for certain households based on their property tax bills. The plan would mean a credit of up to $1,000 for households earning less than $250,000 a year.

In a March 8 interview with former New York Gov. David Paterson on WOR-AM, Sweeney (D-Gloucester) claimed: ""I put a plan together that cuts property taxes 'cause that is the issue that's most pressing in this state.""

That same day, Sweeney appeared on NJToday and compared his proposal to Christie’s: ""My plan is a property tax cut. His is an income tax cut.""

However, Sweeney’s proposal would actually lower income taxes, not property taxes, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

It’s accurate to say the proposed tax credit would be based on the amount of property taxes paid. For instance, someone earning less than $250,000 a year and paying $8,000 in property taxes, would receive a credit of $800.

But here’s why Sweeney’s statement is flawed: that credit would be applied to one’s income taxes.

That point is backed up by the description of Sweeney’s plan on a website set up by the Senate Democrats -- www.realreliefnj.net. Under the headline ""How Our Plan Works,"" here’s part of the explanation:

""It gives every household with income under $250,000 a new 10 percent property tax credit that can be taken every spring when income taxes are filed,"" according to the website. ""A family that pays $7,500 in property taxes would receive a $750 credit against their income taxes.""

So, those households would receive a ""credit against their income taxes."" The property tax bill may be the basis for the credit, but that’s not the bill that will be cut.

But David Brunori, a research professor of public policy at The George Washington University in Washington, DC, told us ""property tax cut"" is a reasonable description.

""NJ is proposing to deliver property tax relief through the income tax. Most public finance folks would call this a property tax cut since you have to be paying property taxes to get it,"" Brunori, who writes a column on state taxation, said in an e-mail. ""It is certainly aimed at relieving the property tax burden. So its mostly semantics after that.""

In response to our findings, Sweeney spokesman Chris Donnelly provided this statement:

""What Democrats have proposed is direct relief for middle class New Jersey residents based solely on their property tax burden. What the governor has proposed is an income tax scheme which gives money to millionaires. The numbers and facts we have provided are clear enough: folks making less than $250,000 a year would get up to $1000 off their property tax burden. It is that simple.""

Our ruling

In radio and TV interviews, Sweeney claimed his proposal ""cuts property taxes"" or represents a ""property tax cut.""

The senator’s proposal would provide a tax credit of up to $1,000 for households earning less than $250,000 a year. The credit would be based on the amount of property taxes paid, but the credit would be ""against their income taxes,"" as the Senate Democrats’ website states.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'John Kasich']","
John Kasich says the state's payroll is smaller and retirements have reduced employee numbers
","
Gov. John Kasich and other Republicans often talk about shrinking the size of government and spending less taxpayer money.

Personnel costs are one measure of government spending that is both easy to understand and significant. Ohio’s payroll last year was more than $3 billion.

Kasich recently was asked about the state’s payroll during a question-and-answer session with reporters after a public appearance in Columbus on March 2. The question was posed to Kasich shortly after the state released its payroll data in response to a public records request.

A reporter suggested to Kasich the payroll had decreased and the governor rattled off some more statistics on the state’s workforce. The Ohio Capital Blog recorded video of the exchange and archived it online.

""The total (state) payroll has gone down. The total amount of the number of workers in the state has gone down. I like the fact that the bulk of that is just by retirements.""

The new payroll figures show that the state is becoming more efficient, the governor went on to say. Kasich, who took office in January 2011, said the declines in payroll and workforce show Ohio can do more with less.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s claim, given the general interest in government spending and Kasich’s boastful interpretation of the new payroll data.

We checked with the Ohio Department of Administrative Services, which keeps payroll figures. The department also provided figures for the number of state workers and the number of retirements, so we were able to check all three aspects of the governor’s claim.

It turns out that Kasich was wrong to say the state’s payroll went down. He was correct, however, to say the state has fewer workers and that retirement is the main reason for the reduction in workforce.

The state’s payroll in 2010, the year before Kasich took office, was $3.083 billion, according to the department of administrative services. The payroll figure includes payments for overtime, sick leave, vacation leave and other forms of compensation.

In 2011, the state’s payroll was $3.084 billion – an increase of about $1.4 million, or 0.045 percent. One factor for the payroll bump was the end of a policy halfway through the year that forced state workers to take unpaid days off. The policy saved the state $104 million in 2010 and about $48 million last year.

When explaining Kasich’s erroneous claim that payroll decreased, Rob Nichols, a spokesman for the governor, cited a media report published the day Kasich met with reporters that said payroll decreased. But Nichols did not dispute the figures provided to us by the Department of Administrative Services that showed a slight increase.

Although Kasich was off when talking about the state payroll, he was right about the decrease in state workers and the reason most of them aren’t working for the state anymore.

The department of administrative services said Ohio employed 54,906 workers at the very start of this year and 58,304 a year earlier – a difference of 3,398 workers.

The department also said 2,909 workers retired in 2011. So Kasich was correct to say the ""bulk"" of workers no longer with the state left due to retirement.

Where does that leave us?

The governor was partially accurate. Of the three parts in Kasich’s claim, he was accurate on two: the number of workers on the state payroll has decreased and the biggest reason is jobs emptied by retirements.

He missed, though, on the main part of his statement, that the state had decreased its payroll. Actually, it has grown, but very slightly at less than five one-hundredths of a percent. That’s an important detail to known, given that he went on to boast about the state’s efficiency under his administration.

Rhode Island state Rep. Robert B. Jacquard says many U.S. casinos have gone bankrupt
","
It appears likely that come November Rhode Islanders will decide whether to expand the state’s two slot parlors into full-fledged casinos. State legislators have already approved holding a referendum on a proposal to allow table games at Twin River, in Lincoln, and are considering doing the same for Newport Grand.

On March 6, before the House passed legislation to put the Newport Grand question on the ballot, Rep. Robert Jacquard raised concerns about allowing casinos in Rhode Island.

""Let's face it: there are a lot of casinos across the country that have gone bankrupt,"" the Cranston Democrat said. ""Just because you give them a casino license is not a guarantee that you are going to save all this money for the state and guarantee all this revenue. It is just not true at all. Management is the most important factor.""

But doesn’t the house always win? Have a lot of casinos around the country really gone bankrupt?

We called Jacquard, who explained that he’s not necessarily opposed to casinos in Rhode Island, but he does want to make sure that if the state opts to go down that route, responsible operators with a lot of experience in the industry are brought in.

He told us that he’s read about a number of casinos failing around the country, and although he hasn’t kept a list, he recalls bankruptcies occurring particularly in the South.

""I know what I read in the paper,"" Jacquard said.

We couldn’t find a central repository of information on casino bankruptcies, but we did come across numerous news reports about casinos and their financial struggles.

Donald Trump has filed four corporate bankruptcies -- in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009 -- in connection to his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J. Tropicana Entertainment, which operates casinos in Nevada, New Jersey, Louisiana, Mississippi and Indiana, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008 and 2009. Station Casinos, which owns or operates 18 casinos in and around Las Vegas, made a similar filing in 2009.

And on a side note, Rhode Islanders will be familiar with the struggles of Twin River, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009 and emerged under new ownership the following year. It’s not technically a casino, but it is a local reminder of the potential pitfalls of the gambling industry.

I. Nelson Rose, distinguished senior professor of law at Whittier Law School, in Costa Mesa, Calif., who writes about gambling and legal issues, has kept a partial list of gambling companies that have closed or filed for bankruptcy protection in the last three years as the recession has dragged on. He has counted 18 companies so far.

Rose said that other casino operators, including MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Foxwoods, may not be facing bankruptcy but have struggled because of mounting debts and falling revenues.

David Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said gambling revenues in all major U.S. markets have declined since 2007 as discretionary spending has dried up.

He also pointed to heightened competition in the gambling industry as another factor that’s squeezing casinos. For example, Atlantic City has lost business to newer casinos in Pennsylvania, whose residents can now gamble closer to home instead of making the trip to New Jersey.

It’s in that sort of competitive market when management can be particularly important. Rose referred to Colorado’s experience in the early 1990s when 68 casinos opened in two or three years. A third of them eventually went bankrupt, and, said Rose, it turned out that the operators of those failed casinos had no previous experience in the industry.

Our ruling

Gambling is a boom or bust industry. Even when times are good, casinos fail. And when times are bad, even more fail.

As Schwartz told us, casinos ""definitely are not a sure thing."" Good management matters  -- a point Jacquard made as well.

We rate Jacquard’s statement True.

"['National', 'Gas Prices', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich said energy secretary advocated raising gas prices
","Newt Gingrich, who has promised gasoline at $2.50 a gallon if he’s elected president, frequently blames the Obama administration for rising prices at the pump.

He recently called President Barack Obama’s energy plan ""outrageously anti-American."" And in an interview on Fox News Sunday on March 11, 2012, Gingrich said Obama is leading the nation toward ""greater dependency and much more expensive gasoline, maybe ultimately as high as $9 or $10 a gallon, which is what his secretary of energy, Dr. Chu, says he wants it to be.

""He has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels, and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon.""

That sounds like it could ruin a lot of road trips. We decided to check that claim about Steven Chu, and while we’re at it -- are Europeans really paying that much to fuel their Fiats?

What Chu said

Chu is a a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who served as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a federal energy research center. His quote about European gas prices has become somewhat notorious since he uttered it almost four years ago.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in late 2008 -- before Obama was elected and at a point when Chu had no ties to Obama -- Chu told the newspaper that he favored raising gasoline taxes gradually over 15 years to coax consumers into buying fuel-efficient cars and discouraging sprawl.

""Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,"" Chu said in an interview with the Journal in September 2008. The quote did not appear in print until December, when the Journal ran a story after news emerged that Chu was being tapped as energy secretary.

It has been a target of criticism numerous times since then.

""The popularity of Chu’s now-infamous quotation tends to track the rise and fall of gas prices: It enjoyed a huge surge of attention last spring and summer (2011) before largely vanishing from view in the fall, leading up to this month’s renaissance,"" reporter Bob King wrote in a story in POLITICO.

As it happens, after Gingrich's comment, Chu backed away from what he said. At a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on March 13, 2012, Chu said, ""Since I walked in the door as secretary of Energy I’ve been doing everything in my powers to do what we can to … reduce those prices.""

Chu added, according to POLITICO, that the ""most important tool in DOE’s tool chest is moving off oil.""

""So are you saying you no longer share the view that we need to figure out how to boost gasoline prices in America?"" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked him.

""I no longer share that view,"" Chu said.

""When I became secretary of Energy, I represented the U.S. government,"" Chu added. ""Of course we don’t want the price of gasoline to go up, we want it to go down.""

Getting back to Gingrich’s portrayal of Chu’s 2008 remark -- that he ""has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels"" -- Chu’s statement was indeed public. He said it to a newspaper. And he did express a desire to raise domestic gas prices closer to those in Europe.

About that $10 gas

Gingrich pegged the cost of a gallon of gasoline in Europe at between $9 and $10. We contacted the European Union, which provided this chart showing gasoline prices in various countries as of March 5, 2012. The chart (on page 2 of the document) shows prices in Euros per liter. We converted that into dollars per gallon and came up with these figures: France: $7.07 per gallon Portugal: $7.24 per gallon Italy came in highest at $8.48 per gallon. We also received information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to the chart on page 3 of this document, which shows prices in January 2012, a gallon of gasoline cost $7.54 per gallon in France, $8.07 in Germany and $6.68 in the United Kingdom.

The travel website mytravelcost.com reports even higher prices. The site, which says it updates prices monthly, puts a liter of unleaded in France at 1.64 euros. Converted to dollars per gallon, that’s $8.10 per gallon. In Spain, it’s $7.06 per gallon, and in the Netherlands it’s $8.90, according to the website.

Our ruling

Gingrich said that Chu, the energy secretary, ""has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels [for gasoline] and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon.""

Chu’s statement, made to the the Wall Street Journal in 2008, was ""somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe."" Gingrich’s paraphrase was accurate. As for the price, he aimed a little high. We found examples of gasoline near $9 a gallon in Europe, but none approaching $10. Gasoline prices fluctuate, however, and so does the exchange rate between dollars and euros. But, because of the discrepancy, we rate his statement Mostly True. This story originally provided an incorrect date for the Fox News Sunday program on which Gingrich appeared. It has been corrected to say March 11, 2012. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cab7a2a-1eab-49c8-8bf0-54f9628d4bf2",[<zip object at 0x0000028097076380>],/factchecks/2012/mar/14/newt-gingrich/gingrich-said-energy-secretary-advocated-raising-g/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Kathleen Falk']","
Kathleen Falk says Gov. Scott Walker cut school aid despite saying he’d aim for two-thirds funding for education
","
Kathleen Falk has a theory about what drove the recall campaign against Gov. Scott Walker -- and it’s not all about his move to sharply curtail collective bargaining by public employees.

The Dane County Democrat, a candidate in the all-but-certain recall race, says the recall was rooted in people’s anger at what she considers Walker’s dishonesty in how he balanced the state budget.

She offered this example on Feb. 29, 2011 in an appearance at Marquette University for the ""On the Issues"" series with Mike Gousha.

""He said he was going to try to fully fund the two-thirds state commitment to education. That’s what he said he would try to do. But then what did he do? He made the largest cut in public education in our state’s history, a billion dollars.""

We previously rated True a claim from Falk that Walker’s education cuts -- including higher ed -- were the largest in state history.

In that item, we noted Walker’s limits on unions also paved the way for many school districts to cut costs on pension, health insurance and other expenses. In at least some cases, the money the districts generated from employees paying more for pensions and health care totally offset their aid cut.

But Falk’s claim about the two-thirds funding is new. It relates to an earlier period and a separate issue: Walker’s positions during the 2010 campaign.

During that election, it was clear the next governor would face a huge budget shortfall, one tallying billions of dollars. And Walker was promising a series of tax cuts.

But did Walker also talk about trying to ""fully fund the two-thirds state commitment to education""?

First, a quick word on what’s so magical about ""two-thirds"" funding.

In the mid-1990s, the state pledged to provide two-thirds of school revenue, a move aimed at holding down local property taxes. The change, enacted when Republican Tommy Thompson was governor, marked a major shift in how education was funded.

But in 2003, lawmakers repealed the commitment. And by 2010, the state’s overall share had slipped to about 63 percent. That may seem small on a percentage basis, but was very significant for many districts.

In his first bid for governor, in 2006, Walker explicitly promised to ""maintain"" two thirds funding.

What about in the 2010 campaign?

In that race, Walker did not go that far -- nor does Falk’s claim go that far. She claims Walker said he would ""try"" to fully fund schools at the two-thirds level.

(In her recall bid, Falk has said she supports a goal of two-thirds funding, but hasn’t committed to a specific funding level.)

When asked for evidence to support her claim, Falk’s staff pointed us to an October 2010 story in the Appleton Post-Crescent that quoted Walker saying he would ""aim"" to return to two-thirds state funding.

The quote originated in a Tomah Journal story on Sept. 8, 2010, before Walker won the GOP primary.

The Tomah Journal reported that on education, Walker said ""it would be an aim"" to restore two-thirds funding of local school costs. Walker noted Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle had ""chipped away at that.""

We looked for other clues on Walker’s position.

On July 24, 2010, Walker was quoted in a Wisconsin State Journal article that described him as saying he supported two-thirds funding ""in principle.""

Meanwhile, when asked on Sept. 2, 2010 by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel if he supported two-thirds state funding for schools, Walker did not directly answer the question. Instead, he emphasized restoring limits on school employee compensation and helping school districts control insurance costs.

A Walker administration spokesman told us Walker did back the goal, but did not explicitly promise to do it. Once in office, other priorities and fiscal challenges overtook his aim, said spokesman Cullen Werwie.

In the end, Walker moved dramatically in the opposite direction. His budget proposed dropping the state commitment to 61 percent  for the two years, down from 62 percent to 63 percent the previous two years.

Walker still has two-thirds as a goal.

Said Werwie: ""We still have one budget to go and because of the tough decisions that were made in the first budget we will be in a much better position to try and make progress towards this aim.""

In any case, Falk framed her claim around actions by Walker in his first budget. So let’s take a closer look at what he told voters about the prospect the goal could be reached that quickly.

In the State Journal piece, Walker doused the idea that he would accomplish a restoration to two thirds in the 2011-’13 budget. He emphasized that ""the multibillion dollar hole left by (Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle)"" makes it difficult to maintain in the 2011-’13 budget.

And in the Tomah Journal story -- in which Walker said he would ""aim"" to restore two-thirds -- he put his main emphasis on limiting schools’ compensation costs.

So Walker sent clear signals his first budget might not be able to meet the goal.

Our conclusion

Falk claimed Walker proposed a big cut in state school aid, even though in the campaign, he said ""said he was going to try to fully fund the two-thirds state commitment to education.""

Walker did support it in principle and says it remains a goal for the next budget. But Falk’s critique of Walker fails to note that before election day he signalled it may not be possible to be able to move back to two-thirds funding in the first year.

We rate Falk’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097015680>],/factchecks/2012/mar/14/kathleen-falk/kathleen-falk-says-gov-scott-walker-cut-school-aid/
"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Johnny Isakson']","
Isakson: Democrats failed to submit budget in past 1,000 days
","
A favorite GOP talking point accusing Democrats of punting on the nation’s budget problems for the past 1,000 days has made its way to Georgia.

The GOP devoted an entire video ad to it. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican from Wisconsin who has won kudos from some deficit hawks, is churning out essays and press releases on it.

And Georgia’s U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, is putting his own spin on the subject.  

""I find it very troubling that the president is asking to increase the nation’s debt limit when his Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days,"" Isakson said in a Jan. 26 press release.

That’s about three years.

We grabbed our calculator and got to work with the help of our sister sites PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, who have analyzed other claims on the same subject.

But before we proceed with our fact check, it helps to explain how Congress comes up with its federal budget.

This is how it works: Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years.

If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.

If a budget resolution doesn’t pass, the federal government won’t go dark.

Budget resolutions are distinct from appropriations bills, which actually allocate how the federal government spends its money.  If a resolution tanks, the majority party can use congressional procedures to move forward to consider appropriations bills.

As a previous PolitiFact National story said, ""the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.""

Now, on to our fact check. Thanks to PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, we have a good sense of whether Isakson’s claim is accurate.

Last year, George LeMieux, a Republican contender for U.S. Senate in Florida, posted on Twitter that it had been 750 days since his opponent and Senate Democrats ""passed"" a budget.

LeMieux was referring to the last time the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, passed a budget resolution.

Indeed, the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution was in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service.

PolitiFact Florida rated this statement Half True. The candidate got the number of days right, but placing the blame on Senate Democrats wasn’t fair. Partisans on both sides share responsibility.

Let’s move on to Jan. 23, about 250 days after LeMieux made his statement. Ryan, the Republican House member from Wisconsin, said Senate Democrats ""have gone without any budget at all"" for more than 1,000 days.

Ryan’s language could have been more precise, PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled. It had been that long since a budget resolution passed, but not since the last Senate budget resolution expired. He earned a Mostly True.

Isakson uses somewhat different wording from Ryan and LeMieux. He said that the Democratic majority in the Senate has failed to ""submit"" -- not pass -- a budget in the past 1,000 days.

Democrats did submit a budget resolution since the last resolution passed, though it never went before the full Senate for a vote.  

We took a look at the Congressional Record, the official record of Congress’ proceedings.

On April 26, 2010, under the heading ""Submitted Resolutions,"" is S. Con. Res. 60, introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. He’s a Democrat and head of the Senate Budget Committee.

The resolution would have set forth the budget for 2011, but the Senate took no action after its date of submission.  

A resolution is ""submitted"" when its author formally presents it to the house of which he or she is a member, according to Congressional Quarterly’s American Congressional Dictionary, a widely used authority on language used in Congress.   

Instead of passing a typical budget resolution for 2011, Democrats passed one that would last for a single year. They said that they were waiting for a fiscal commission created by President Barack Obama to make its recommendations for debt reduction, according to news accounts at the time.

In an email, Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson described Conrad’s submission of the budget resolution as a ""gimmick.""

""It was never reported out of committee. It was never brought to the floor. It was not debated for even one hour,"" the email said.

Federal law limits debate on a budget resolution to 50 hours.

The Democrat-controlled Senate didn’t put a budget resolution up for a vote last year. And according to news accounts, they don’t intend to put one up this year, either.

Isakson’s claim that the ""Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days"" needs some revision.

No budget has been passed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. None has been put up for a vote in that time, either. But one was submitted April 26, 2010, or 640 days before Isakson issued his press release.

That said, this flaw in Isakson’s statement doesn’t undermine his larger point. The budget resolution for 2011 languished. It never went up for a vote, and Democrats haven’t submitted one since. In the past few years, Senate Democrats have taken limited action on budget resolutions.

The statement contains a kernel of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It meets our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A40D880>],/factchecks/2012/mar/14/johnny-isakson/isakson-democrats-failed-submit-budget-1000-days/

Ohio Democratic Party touts 850,000 Buckeye State jobs tied to the auto industry
","
How do you know if a Democratic candidate is talking about the auto industry bailout in Ohio?

His lips are moving.

But, seriously, few issues excite party operatives more these days than the resurgence of Chrysler and General Motors, both rescued by the federal government. Democrats see it as a huge positive for President Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who just so happen to be up for re-election this year, and a huge negative for their Republican challengers.

And while this might make for smart politics, particularly in states such as Michigan and Ohio, sometimes the crisp talking points come at the expense of facts. With this in mind, PolitiFact Ohio chose to look at a number that the Ohio Democratic Party has seized on with gusto.

The party trotted the number out in a March 13, 2012, news release targeting Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, Brown’s Republican opponent in the Senate contest. The news release trumpeted criticism from Toledo-area auto workers toward Mandel, saying he would have opposed auto industry bailouts.

There are ""850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry,"" the release said.

That number has become key to ODP’s core argument. The party used it in two other recent releases. One on March 6, the day of the Super Tuesday primary, took aim at front-running Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, an outspoken opponent of bailouts. The other on March 12 targeted Mandel.

We’re not addressing Mandel’s position on the auto bailouts or how Romney’s anti-bailout view will serve him if he faces off against Obama in November. That’s a political calculation for another forum.

ODP Chairman Chris Redfern and others have repeatedly claimed that the industry would have died had Romney and Mandel been calling the shots on the bailouts. That, too, is a hypothetical pretty much impossible to prove one way or the other.

But what about the number?

We asked Andrew Zucker, the ODP’s press secretary, for the source, and he pointed us to the Center for Automotive Research, or CAR. In 2010, the independent group from Ann Arbor, Mich., published a 55-page report examining the U.S. auto industry’s economic worth nationwide.

Side note: We started looking into the number’s accuracy after it was used in those two previous releases. By the time we had downloaded the report, Zucker had fired off the latest ODP missive, using the same statistic -- but this time with a full citation.  We’re using that statement for this item.

An appendix on page 48 of the report provides a state by state breakdown that attributes 848,304 Ohio jobs to the U.S. auto industry. That’s roughly 12 percent of the state’s workforce, according to CAR.

PolitiFact Ohio then took a closer look at how CAR arrived at its figures.

For starters, it is important to understand what types of jobs factor into the group’s analysis. CAR looks at three levels of employment: direct, intermediate and a category they call spin-off.

Direct employees include those who work for automakers, parts manufacturers or car dealers. Intermediate employees work for companies that sell goods or services used by the direct employers. And spin-off jobs are the jobs created by the spending activity of employees in the direct and intermediate categories. Such employees could be a cashier at the supermarket or mall, a waiter or a bartender.

In Ohio, about 149,000 jobs are attributed to direct employment, 285,000 to intermediate and 415,000 to spin-off. Half of the jobs are tied to automakers rather than suppliers or dealers.

It is clear, though, that intermediate and spin-off jobs account for a majority of the estimated jobs. Those numbers, according to CAR’s report, come from a ""dynamic, inter-industry model"" -- in other words, a simulation that includes multipliers. The methodology is not uncommon.

We touched base with Kim Hill, one of the report’s authors, who confirmed what PolitiFact Ohio suspected. These estimates include not only U.S. automakers with Ohio operations, but also foreign automakers such as Honda, which has an Ohio presence.

That is a key point because the ODP has typically used the 850,000 number in a context that suggests that’s how many jobs were at stake in the bailout. ODP, in the March 12 news release that also targeted Mandel, went as far as saying ""850,000 Ohio jobs … would have been in jeopardy"" had a hypothetical Sen. Mandel and his colleagues voted against the bailout.

This would be more accurate if those 850,000 jobs were tied solely to Chrysler and GM, the beneficiaries of the bailout. But had these two companies failed, Ohio still would have Honda, as well as suppliers and dealers that also do business with other foreign companies and Ford.

Honda employs more than 13,500 Ohioans, according to recent media statements. The company has announced more than $500 million in Ohio investment since late 2010.

Hill gave the ODP a pass here and noted that industrywide fallout from the collapse of two giants would have been significant for suppliers and other service providers and thus would have impacted spin-off employment, as well.

Hill also noted that those jobs are supported by the auto industry not just in Ohio but in other states, too. A generic example would be a Cleveland metals manufacturer or another Ohio company that provides some professional service (an intermediate employer) to a Detroit automaker (a direct employer). In this case, it is auto industry in Michigan that is supporting the jobs in Ohio.

The ODP’s claim was that ""850,000 Ohio jobs (are) tied to the auto industry."" That is an accurate statement. While the jobs figure includes intermediate and spinoff jobs, as well as direct employment, that manner of counting is not uncommon for evaluating employment impact.

Can Chris Telfer claim credit for the budget re-balance that cleared the Oregon Legislature?
","
Like other savvy politicians, state Sen. Chris Telfer, R-Bend, issued a press release via the caucus office crediting herself for her accomplishments in the 2012 legislative session:
  
Senator Chris Telfer (R-Bend) wrestled several important successes from Oregon’s first annual session, which ended Monday evening. Among her accomplishments are two substantial job-creating bills and a fiscally responsible budget agreement that controls state spending. 

Innocuous enough, right? Except that the press release prompted this tweet from a colleague of PolitiFact Oregon: OR Sen. Telfer, R-Bend, takes credit for ""fiscally responsible budget"" -- which she voted against.

Whoa. That got our attention. What’s the story? We found there were votes on five budget related bills Monday, the last day of the 2012 legislative session. Telfer voted in favor of bonding and capital construction, but voted against operating money to run state government.

The key bill was Senate Bill 5701, the ""omnibus budget reconciliation bill"" that reflects the bulk of the agreement struck by House and Senate budget negotiators. Nine Republicans in the Senate voted no, including Telfer. Senate Bill 5702 allocates the other part of state general fund: state lottery money. Two Republicans voted no, including Telfer.

Telfer is a certified public accountant who is not on the Ways and Means Committee. She said on the floor that the budget bills were important bills, but she didn’t receive them in time to vet them properly. She also said that there is extra money on the books that state agencies are hiding from lawmakers.

""Just letting everybody know that I will be no on all the budget bills,"" she said on the floor.

We reached Telfer by telephone. She said she did not write the press release, but did review it and she stands by the statement.

She said the budget agreement struck by the three budget writers reflects her stance on trimming state personnel and opposing new taxes. She said she was in frequent contact with the office of Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, the Republican in the meetings. Her no votes were an opportunity to send a message to fellow lawmakers, Telfer said.

""It’s a budget I can live with,"" she said, ""but I certainly think there were lots of faults with the budget.""

To be fair, the press release went on to talk about her advocacy for ""budget transparency and accountability"" and that she fought ""to end runaway state spending and successfully lobbied against new taxes and fees increases."" In other words, the release was candid about the general nature of her role.

But the statement specifically cites ""among her accomplishments are … a fiscally responsible budget agreement that controls state spending."" Telfer didn’t negotiate, or help negotiate, that agreement. Not only that, she voted against the bills that authorize operating money for state government.

Her statement is not accurate and it makes a ridiculous claim. We rule the statement Pants on Fire.

Paul Sadler says four super PACs are in U.S. Senate race on GOP side
","
At a candidate forum in Austin, Paul Sadler was asked if he’d support a constitutional amendment overturning the 2010 Supreme Court decision that touched off a flood of super PACs, a type of political action committee that cannot coordinate with a candidate’s campaign, but can independently spend unlimited donations to influence a race.

""Hell yes, I will,"" Sadler said at the March 1, 2012, Travis County Democratic Party event. Calling the super PACs’ impact ""scandalous,"" the lawyer and former Texas House member said: ""In our race on the Republican side, already, there are four super PACs -- four super PACs -- and it is a distortion of our democracy.""

Such PACs are weighing in heavily this election season, raising eyebrows in some cases because they can accept money from certain tax-exempt groups that don’t have to disclose their donors’ names. According to the nonpartisan research group Center for Reponsive Politics’ opensecrets.org, super PACs have spent $65 million in the 2012 cycle so far supporting presidential candidates -- including President Barack Obama, who as PolitiFact noted February 7, 2012, executed a Full Flop in his stance on fundraising for super PACs.

But four in our little ol’ U.S. Senate race?

Jeff Rotkoff, spokesman for Sadler’s campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told us the backup for his candidate’s statement was included in Sadler’s February 8, 2012, fundraising email, which cited in turn a Texas Tribune news story from the day before. That story listed four super PACs and linked them to candidates: Texas Conservatives Fund and Conservative Renewal Political Action Committee, supporting Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Real Street Conservatives, supporting Craig James; and Club for Growth Action PAC, supporting Ted Cruz.

Like traditional PACs, super PACs register with the Federal Election Commission, which describes supers as ""independent expenditure-only committees.""

Typically when a super PAC is created, the organizers attach a memo to the FEC stating their intent to make independent expenditures. The FEC website displays those memos for three of the PACs that Sadler referred to.

For the fourth, we asked Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller to confirm its super PAC status. Keller told us by email that the club’s Action PAC is its super PAC, distinct from its traditional Club for Growth PAC, which Keller said has endorsed Ted Cruz.

So, yep: All four are supers. We set out to learn what we could about their activities.

From websites and what the four PACs had reported to the FEC through March 6, 2012, we gleaned these thumbnails, keeping in mind that only the Club for Growth super PAC has existed long enough to have filed reports of contributions and expenditures: 

The Club for Growth is a national conservative group that advocates economic growth. According to opensecrets.org, the group spent $5 million on Congressional races in the 2010 election cycle, using its cash for items such as television ads. In the 2012 election cycle, opensecrets.org shows the group has only spent $574,097 so far, but 82 percent, or $468,758, of that has been used against Dewhurst, the website records.

So, yep: four supers, all linked to Republican candidates in the Texas U.S. Senate race.

Sadler told us via email that he did not know of any such PACs supporting him. How would he respond if such a group formed? ""Nothing I or anyone else can do -- I think that is the point, isn't it?,"" he wrote.

We rate Sadler’s claim True.

"['National', 'Energy', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum says 'many parts of the country ... experience rolling blackouts'
","
On March 10, 2012, Rick Santorum published an op-ed on his website titled, ""Why Energy Policy Matters to Americans."" In it, he took a series of shots at President Barack Obama’s energy policies.

""This president’s agenda doesn’t just stop with oil and gas,"" Santorum wrote. ""President Obama has also discouraged new electricity generation -- forcing many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts. That means that millions of Americans will live with a power grid that is second-rate, like a Third World country.""

We hadn't noticed the lights cycling off, so we wondered: Are many parts of the country really experiencing ""rolling blackouts""?

Before we go any further, let's define our terms. A ""rolling blackout"" occurs when a utility intentionally ""shuts off the power to an area, turns it back on, and then shuts the power off in a different area,"" with outages in any given area typically lasting 60 to 90 minutes, according to the California Energy Commission. A utility would do this as a last resort, in order to avoid an even worse situation -- a total power blackout.

A rolling blackout is distinct from two other electrical problems. Brownouts are temporary reductions in current, intentional or unintentional, which may or may not be noticeable to a customer. An uncontrolled outage occurs when power is disrupted without warning, often by weather or accidents.

Rolling blackouts typically occur during 3 to 7 p.m., hours of peak use, when demand for electricity begins to exceed the local utility's available supply, the commission explained. ""These controlled or planned blackouts help prevent ‘uncontrolled’ electrical power outages during the peak periods, which assures your electricity supply remains continuous and with minimal interruptions.""

Typically, utilities will try to forestall rolling blackouts by first issuing calls for customers to limit their power use and then by activating a system under which certain customers have agreed to limit their power uptake on high-demand days.

So how often do rolling blackouts occur today? The Santorum campaign didn’t get back to us, but from what we can tell, it’s not all that often.

We found data from Eaton Corp., a private power management company that publishes an annual ""Blackout Tracker."" (It can be downloaded here, free with registration.)

Overall, in 2011 Eaton counted 3,071 power outages affecting 41.8 million Americans. That’s a modest decrease in outages from the previous year, but a big increase in the number of Americans affected; in 2010, 17.5 million Americans were affected. The difference is partly due to Hurricane Irene, which cut power to 6 million people, following two relatively quiet years for hurricanes.

Weather is the principal cause of power outages in the U.S., according to Eaton. Here's the company's breakdown of what caused blackouts in 2011, where causes could be determined:

Weather: 1,229
Faulty equipment or human error: 767
Vehicle accident: 245
Animal: 208
Planned: 138
Theft or vandalism: 28

Rolling blackouts would be ""planned"" outages, so at most, just 5 percent of these power outages might have been rolling blackouts. For comparison, that’s about as many power outages as were caused by squirrels in 2011.

Really. Eaton tracked that in another chart.

A range of experts we spoke to said they knew of no epidemic of rolling blackouts in the United States in recent years.

""The Electric Power Research Institute is not aware of any rolling blackouts cascading throughout the country,"" said Clay Perry, the senior media relations manager for EPRI, a research group on the generation, delivery and use of electricity. ""Do share if you can find any.""

As for Santorum's suggestion that Obama is to blame for the non-existent widespread rolling blackouts, it’s worth noting the limits of Obama’s power on the electric power supply. While Obama has pushed for improvements to the electrical grid, ""political decisions about power generation and distribution are largely a state regulatory matter,"" with additional roles played by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is an independent federal agency, and various regional grid reliability councils, said Stephen Brown, a fellow with Resources for the Future and adjunct professor in energy management at the University of Colorado.

There was at least one high-profile case of rolling blackouts in 2011 -- in early February in Texas, when the state, shivering in an unusual cold snap, imposed rolling blackouts for just the second time in more than two decades. The blackouts ""left nearly 1 million homes dark and without heat for up to an hour, caused some schools and businesses to shut and spurred traffic snarls as some traffic lights stopped working,"" Reuters reported.

According to the Houston Chronicle, Trip Doggett, the CEO of the state's main grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the rolling blackouts were not caused by a failure to predict demand accurately or to keep enough plants online but by a widespread mechanical failure of more than 50 power generating units across the state. There was no single reason for the failures and no particular location, plant operator or type of power plant behind the problem, Doggett said.

Critics of Obama seized on the Texas rolling blackouts as evidence that the president’s policies were endangering the nation’s energy future. The impact of Obama’s policies on energy supplies is a topic of heated disagreement, but that’s not what we're checking here. Rather, we’re checking whether such policies are already ""forcing many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts"" -- and the data and expert opinions don't back that up.

Our ruling

Santorum’s said that Obama’s policies have forced ""many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts"" -- evoking images of Third World countries. But neither Santorum nor experts offered any evidence that widespread rolling blackouts have occured. Arguably, squirrels are as much a threat to the power supply today. We rate the claim Pants On Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097557380>],/factchecks/2012/mar/13/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-many-parts-country-experience-r/
"['Georgia', 'Campaign Finance', 'Hank Johnson']","
Congressman: Roughly half of super PAC money coming from ""super rich""
","
This year’s primary elections are getting so nasty that Lithonia Congressman Hank Johnson has taken to calling them ""slimary"" elections.

In an op-ed on liberal website ""The Huffington Post,"" Johnson, a Democrat, blamed the viciousness on super PACs, political fundraising organizations that can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations and unions alike.  

""In the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations,"" Johnson wrote in the Feb. 24 article.

Those are some big bucks, wealthy people, and generous businesses. We wondered if Johnson got his numbers right.

Super PACs became legal after a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision. They are an object of ire for those who think they can be used to buy elections and help donors obscure their identities.  

A Johnson spokesman said the congressman got his data from articles in Politico and Roll Call. The stories, which ran Feb. 8, lay out the findings of ""Auctioning Democracy: The Rise of Super PACs & the 2012 Election.""

The report was authored by left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos and U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. It argued that super PACs skew American politics by giving outsize influence to wealthy donors who hold views that do not represent those held by the broader public.

Johnson’s account matched both news accounts’ descriptions of the ""Auctioning Democracy"" report. One of these descriptions could have been more precise, but they were not unreasonable.

From the advent of super PACs to the end of 2011, donors have contributed a total of $181 million in what are called ""itemized individual contributions"" to super PACs, the report states. These are contributions from donors who give more than $200. Super PACs must report donor names once their contributions pass this threshold.

The report did not tally contributions by small donors, said Adam Lioz, a Demos official and an author of the report.

Demos and U.S. PIRG found that 196 people donated $100,000 or more to super PACs, which is just shy of 200 individuals. Calling them ""super-rich"" is polarizing, but it’s reasonable to assume that people who can afford to make a $100,000 donation have unusually high incomes.

We used the report’s findings to calculate that donations of the ""super-rich"" amounted to about 43 percent of total contributions. This is some 7 percentage points lower than the ""roughly half"" figure that Johnson used.

For-profit businesses contributed 17 percent of itemized donations, the report states. This is just shy of the 20 percent Johnson cited.

We checked with the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for more transparency in government. It is the source of much of the data used in the report, so we wanted to get the organization’s take on the numbers. A spokesman said they found no problems with the conclusions of ""Auctioning Democracy.""

But for the sake of due diligence, we compared the report’s numbers to data published by the Center for Responsive Politics, which keeps a rolling tally of super PAC contributions on its website OpenSecrets.org.

The data from the CRP and the ""Auctioning Democracy"" report are not easy to compare. They track contributions over different time periods, and the CRP tallies a broader pool of contributions.

However, we felt an analysis of the CRP data would give us a rough sense of whether Demos and U.S. PIRG overstated their results to make their case.

First, we looked at the CRP’s count of total super PAC donations.

From 2010 to late February, about $215 million had been donated to super PACs, according to the CRP data. This is about $35 million -- or 20 percent -- more than the data published in ""Auctioning Democracy,"" but this difference did not signal major flaws.

The CRP’s number should be significantly higher than the figures in ""Auctioning Democracy."" The report excludes donations of $200 or less as well as contributions for the 2012 calendar year. The CRP includes them.

Next, we looked at whether ""roughly half"" of super PAC donations came from 200 ""super-rich"" people. The CRP publishes a list of the top 100 super PAC donors for the 2012 election cycle on its website. We found they donated about $74 million so far, or 57 percent of the cycle’s $130 million total.

The count in ""Auctioning Democracy"" was lower, which suggests that Demos and U.S. PIRG did not overstate the significance of donations from the ""super-rich.""

We had difficulty using the CRP’s data to check corporate or business donations. The CRP’s Web page lists too few organizations, and does not distinguish between for-profit businesses and groups such as labor unions or advocacy organizations.

Our ruling

Johnson wrote that ""[i]n the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations.""

On balance, Johnson’s claim reflects the findings of a report by two advocacy groups that are critical of super PACs. The statistics Johnson uses also make sense in light of data published by a separate group.

We give Johnson a True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F7AC00>],/factchecks/2012/mar/13/hank-johnson/congressman-roughly-half-super-pac-money-coming-su/
"['Ohio', 'Elections', 'Kathleen Clyde']","
Kathleen Clyde says Ohio not in compliance with federal voter law
","
The non-partisan Pew Center on the States issued a report last month that the nation's voter registration rolls are plagued with problems. About one record in eight is inaccurate or invalid, the report said, and about 1.8 million registered voters are dead.

No evidence of voter fraud was found -- just record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray.

State Rep. Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat from Kent, raised a similar issue at a news conference focused on provisional voting. She pointed to flaws in maintaining Ohio's voter database as a prime reason for the state's high number of provisional ballots, one of the highest rates in the country.

Provisional ballots -- many of which go uncounted -- are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at a polling station, which happens most often because of a change of address.

The problem is partly the result of another one, she said:

""Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV.""

Clyde wasn’t raising the issue as a policy matter. Rather, she said Ohio is not meeting a legal obligation. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look and asked Clyde to back up her statement.

She cited the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which is also known as the Motor Voter Act and NVRA.

Congress enacted it ""to enhance voting opportunities for every American,"" according to the Justice Department. ""The act has made it easier for all Americans to register to vote and to maintain their registration.""

Among its provisions, the act requires states to keep voter registration lists accurate and current -- by, for example, identifying persons who have become ineligible due to having died or moved outside the jurisdiction.

It says that any change of address submitted for driver's license purposes must also serve as notification of an address change for voter registration purposes, unless the license-holder indicates specifically that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes.

The U.S. Election Assistance Commission last year produced a report on the effects of the voting act on voter registration.

""It strongly suggests that Ohio is not meeting the requirements of federal law,"" Clyde said. ""Ohio's rate of registrations and registration updates from BMV transactions is far lower than the national average -- 16.4 percent compared with 37.1 percent.""

We confirmed those numbers in the EAC report. 
But, Clyde added, ""My statement was not completely based on this report, because this report merely suggests that Ohio is not in compliance.""

Instead, she said, the statement was based on the proof that voter registration updating is not offered during online BMV transactions.

Our examination of the BMV's website, and specifically the ""change of address"" pages in online services, turned up no reference to voter records. So while an individual can use the website to submit a change in a driver’s address data, there is no mechanism for using that data as the NVRA-required notice of a change in the voter registration address.

And, the site offered no opt-out option, as the NVRA also requires.

We looked at the study of voter records from the Pew Center on the States. It notes that Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted last summer requested better compliance with the voting act from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.

""From 2007-2008,"" Husted said in his request, ""only 9.6 percent of all driver license transactions resulted in a voter registration transaction. ... While driver license transactions increased, voter registration transactions fell to only 6.5 percent of all driver license transactions from 2009-2010.""

We asked BMV for a response.

A spokeswoman said: ""When customers change their address by calling in, email or via written forms, they have the option of choosing to have that information sent on to update their voter registration or choosing not to update their voter registration. Currently we don't have our online vehicle registration database, OPLATES, set up that way and are working to add the ‘opt in’ and ‘opt out’ options to that by July 1, 2012.""

Our conclusions:
  
Ohio, clearly in some cases, is using address updates to its driver license database to update voter registration addresses.

But considering that the state’s rate is less than half the national avearge, and that the option isn’t even available for online transactions, the BMV is falling short of compliance with the nearly 20-year-old Motor Voter Act.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Clyde’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809746A400>],/factchecks/2012/mar/13/kathleen-clyde/kathleen-clyde-says-ohio-not-compliance-federal-vo/

Sen. Jim DeMint says Sen Sherrod Brown is responsible for ""over $14 trillion in debt""
","
Josh Mandel, who was elected Ohio treasurer last November, insists he’s not officially running for the U.S. Senate.

But the young Republican, whose two tours in Iraq as a Marine intelligence specialist and his fund-raising prowess has made him a top GOP political recruit, is raising money and collecting endorsements like an official candidate.

He won two endorsements recently that come with fund-raising help, one from the conservative Club for Growth and one from the Senate Conservatives Fund.

The Senate Conservatives Fund, headed by U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, said in a statement that the group was ""launching an all out SCF surge to raise $100,000"" for Mandel by June 30.

Explaining his support of Mandel, DeMint heaped praise on Mandel while blasting Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, whose seat Mandel wants.

""The race will pit a young conservative leader with the principles and determination to restore America’s greatness against a liberal career politician who is responsible for near double-digit unemployment and over $14 trillion in debt,"" DeMint said in a statement.

DeMint’s statement was widely distributed by the group and others, including the Cuyahoga County Republican Party, and quoted by news organizations, including The Columbus Dispatch.

Politifact Ohio tripped over DeMint’s line that Brown is responsible for the country’s $14 trillion debt and decided to ask DeMint to explain Brown’s culpability.

DeMint’s spokesman, Wesley Denton, referred our questions to the Senate Conservatives Fund.

The funds’ spokesman, Matt Hoskins, said in an email that Brown has voted for bills that drove up spending and the debt, citing his support for the financial and auto bailouts, federal stimulus bill and the health care reform bill. He also said that Brown has voted for other Democratic spending bills and earmarks and has voted to raise the debt ceiling at least three times.

Before we can get into DeMint’s defense, let’s review a few things about the debt.

The debt is the total amount of money the government has borrowed over the years to cover its cash deficits. The government has often carried debt, which spiked after recessions and wars. In the past, however, the government has done a better job of paying down those debts.

When Republican George W. Bush left the presidency in January 2009, the nation’s debt was $10.6 trillion, which includes the amount of publicly held debt plus debt held by the U.S. government. The government borrows from itself by tapping the money set aside to pay for Social Security and other entitlement programs.

Under President Obama, the debt has climbed to more than $14 trillion.

Since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the legal limit of borrowing, known as the debt ceiling, 10 times, seven under Bush and three times under Obama, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Congress faces a vote on raising the debt ceiling in August. If Congress doesn’t raise it, the government will default on its loans, which is fueling the debate over cutting and spending issues.

Brown, a former representative nearing the end of his first term in the U.S. Senate, has been in Washington nearly 19 years. And he’s voted to raise the debt ceiling in the past, but he’s also voted against raising the debt ceiling three times.

So, does Brown bear the responsibility for the debt, as DeMint claims?

Hoskins acknowledged that Brown is not solely responsible for the debt but said Brown’s still a major cause.

""DeMint says many Republicans are responsible, too,"" Hoskins said. ""But Sherrod Brown has clearly contributed greatly to the problem. Has there ever been a spending bill that he didn’t support?""

In other words, DeMint is saying any vote Brown cast that resulted in federal expenditures has contributed to the national debt.

But there’s numerous problems with this argument.

For one, it paves the way for the reverse argument that any vote Brown cast against spending or reducing revenue should be tallied and subtracted from the national debt.

Brown, for instance, voted against the Bush-era tax cuts, which the non-partisan Congressional Research Service said came with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion. (But Brown supported a 2010 bill that extended them for two years and renewed jobless benefits.) Brown also voted against the War in Iraq, which the CRS says cost $800 billion in direct costs to date.

Brown – despite claims to the contrary by the Senate Conservatives Fund -- also voted against the 2003 Medicare prescription drug program passed by the Republican-controlled Congress. At the time, President Bush said the program would cost $400 billion but the figure was later revised to more than $1 trillion.

In a recent PolitiFact item, Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argued that kind of tallying was faulty analysis.
   
Riedl referred us to his own blog, in which he wrote, ""Imagine a basketball team that loses 100-98. It would make no sense to cherry pick one single basket by their opponent and blame it for 100 percent of the loss – letting all other baskets scored off the hook.""
   
Riedl’s broader point is that ""one could cherry pick"" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire problem.

Trying to assign a value to every individual vote leads to an accounting exercise that would give a CPA nightmares.

The biggest problem with DeMint’s argument is that it oversimplifies how Washington works by ignoring that spending agendas are set by party leadership and succeed only when leaders win collective support. The argument also ignores the impact of recessions and wars, and all the other spending and borrowing that produces debt.

So where does this leave DeMint’s original claim?
  
  
Brown has certainly voted for spending programs and to raise the debt ceiling, but DeMint left himself little wiggle room in a statement designed to score political points.

On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A396500>],/factchecks/2011/jul/11/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-sen-sherrod-brown-responsible-/

 Rick Perry says Texas debate of pat-down legislation initiated federal policy change
","
Gov. Rick Perry saw a silver lining in state lawmakers not sending him legislation penalizing airport security officers if they get too physical while searching passengers. As a June special legislative session ended, Perry said in a June 29 press release that ""although the airport pat-down bill did not pass, it did initiate a public discussion and some changes in airport security procedures."" 
Did debate at the Texas Capitol drive a national shift? 
Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us toward an earlier Perry statement that referred to a Transportation Security Administration reassessment of pat-down searches of children 12 and younger. The June 23 statement by the governor’s office said the agency’s change of policy ""follows Gov. Perry's recent addition of legislation to the (agenda) of the special session of the Texas Legislature to address this issue."" Perry added: ""TSA's policy change is a step in the right direction to regain the trust of American families."" 
According to an ABC News report, the federal agency had issued a statement the day before, June 22, saying that its chief administrator, John Pistole, ""has made a policy decision to give security officers more options for resolving screening anomalies with young children, and we are working to operationalize his decision in airports. This decision will ultimately reduce — though not eliminate — pat downs of children."" 
The news report notes that Perry had recently added the airport security issue to the special session’s agenda; that action occurred June 20. During the regular session that ended in May, legislation making it a criminal offense for airport security officials to touch ""the anus, sexual organ, buttocks or breast of another person,"" even through clothing, had cleared the Texas House before stalling in the Senate. 
And a June 27 Associated Press news report quotes state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, defending a watered-down version of the pat-down measure under consideration in the special session. Referring to the already-announced federal policy change, Patrick said, ""The goal is to get the TSA to change their policy. TSA is going (to) change their policy because Texas is taking the lead."" 
But we couldn’t find independent indications that the Texas debate touched off the federal change. Instead, we found that public outrage began flaring late last fall over the new enhanced pat-down procedures and that TSA officials have been talking about changing the procedures ever since. 
TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said that Pistole ""began evaluating risk-based changes to the checkpoint security process, including the process for screening children, shortly after he was sworn into office in July"" 2010. 
Kimball pointed us to a Nov. 21, 2010, statement from Pistole saying, in part, ""We are constantly evaluating and adapting our security measures, and as we have said from the beginning, we are seeking to strike the right balance between privacy and security."" 
Kimball also noted a March speech by Pistole to an American Bar Association group. Pistole said then: ""We want to focus our limited resources on higher-risk passengers, while speeding and enhancing the passenger experience at the airport. I believe what we're working on will provide better security by more effectively deploying our resources, while also improving passengers' travel experiences by potentially streamlining the screening experience for many people."" 
Kimball also pointed out news reports such as an April 12 CNN report topped by mention of the recent pat-down of a 6-year-old girl at the New Orleans airport. The report quotes the agency as saying that Pistole ""has tasked the agency with exploring additional ways to focus its resources and move beyond a one-size-fits-all system while maintaining a high level of security. As part of this effort, TSA has been actively reviewing its screening policies and procedures to streamline and improve the screening experience for low-risk populations, such as younger passengers."" 
We pressed Kimball about connections between the pat-down debate in Texas and the agency’s June change of policy. He replied by email that the Legislature's debate ""did not have an impact."" 
Perry’s office isn’t convinced. Frazier said by email that the ""fact remains that TSA took action a mere two days after the governor's addition (of the anti-groping topic) to the agenda of the special session."" 
She continued: ""We've never claimed the addition to the (agenda) was the sole catalyst of TSA’s changes. But as we’ve said before, we do believe that making it a legislative issue in the midst of Americans’ escalating frustration toward TSA’s invasive pat-down searches played a role in the agency’s decision to finally take action, and make changes to its policy that are a step in the right direction."" 
It’s reasonable to say the debate in Austin brought even more attention to pat-downs. But the TSA was already catching flack for the procedures two months before the Legislature convened. And we found no evidence the Texas debate initiated, as Perry puts it, the administration’s policy change. We rate Perry’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3AAB40>],/factchecks/2011/jul/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-debate-pat-down-legislation-/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Jim Whelan']","
State Sen. Jim Whelan says Gov. Chris Christie ""slashed school aid in this budget""
","
Gov. Chris Christie recently wielded his veto pen to wipe out more than $900 million in spending passed in the state Legislature’s budget. A flood of press releases from Democrats condemning the governor’s cuts followed.

And state Sen. Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) was among those expressing disapproval.

""In our proposal, we would have expanded school aid across the board and finally realized the promise of the 2008 school funding reform act by fully funding all schools – urban, rural and suburban. Governor Christie slashed school aid in this budget, preferring instead to extend a tax break for millionaires over funding in the classroom,"" Whelan said in a July 5 news release.

But Christie claimed otherwise.

""This budget is not only constitutionally balanced, but represents my commitment to education,"" the governor said in a June 30 news release. ""This year’s budget managed to increase funding by $850 million and does so in a fiscally prudent budget.""

So, who’s right? They both are.

Whelan's statement was included in a news release about the governor's line item vetoes of the Democrats' budget proposal and Whelan confirmed to PolitiFact New Jersey that his statement was about the governor’s reductions from the Democrats’ budget.

In that case, Whelan is correct: the governor did cut state aid for schools from the budget approved by the Legislature. But year over year, Christie increased overall funding for schools.

Let’s break it down.

The governor always fires the first shot in the state’s budget war. In Christie’s February proposal, state aid to school districts was increased by about $250 million over last year’s budget.

Then, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered another $500 million in state aid go to 31 urban school systems, the so-called Abbott districts.

When Democrats unveiled their budget for Fiscal Year 2012 late last month, an additional $1.1 billion in state aid for schools had been added over the governor’s proposed budget. They also put another $412 million in state aid for non-Abbott districts in a separate bill that would have been enacted only if an income tax rate increase was approved for individuals earning more than $1 million. Christie vetoed both measures.

The increases in the Democrats’ spending plan also did not withstand Christie’s veto pen.

The governor cut nearly $500 million in state education aid from the Legislature’s budget. However, he left in more than $446 million in funding that will go to Abbott districts per the court order and another $167 million for other districts.

That aid, as well as the $250 million in the governor’s original budget proposal that went untouched, equals about $863 million. So,  year over year, funding for schools increased.

Whelan recognized this when PolitiFact New Jersey spoke with him. ""There’s more school aid than last year,"" he said, but argued that the aid still didn’t fully fund all districts.

As a spokesman for the Senate Democrats put it: the year over year increase ""only tells a partial story, as the only districts being made whole are the Abbotts."" 
State Treasury Department spokesman Andrew Pratt said, ""Everyone would like to see more aid for schools, however there’s a limit to what we can spend.""

Let’s briefly touch on the second part of Whelan’s statement, which said Christie made the cuts in state aid for schools, ""preferring instead to extend a tax break for millionaires over funding in the classroom.""

Christie vetoed a bill that would have raised the income tax on individuals with incomes over $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent for two years.

But is vetoing a tax increase a tax break?

PolitiFact New Jersey tackled this issue before and rated it half true.

Let’s recap.

Whelan said, ""Governor Christie slashed school aid in this budget"" and Christie did cut funds from the Legislature's proposal. 
And although Christie slashed school aid in his first year as governor, he in fact increased school aid year over year from Fiscal Year 2011 to Fiscal Year 2012.

For these reasons, we rate Whelan’s statement Half True.

"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says public-employee unions falsely told members that they would have to pay up to 13 percent of incomes for health insurance
","
Gov. Scott Walker loves playing political pundit, so he was ready with talking points when a CNBC interviewer asked him if he could resurrect popularity polls numbers that ""are in the toilet.""

Walker predicted his numbers would turn around as protests over his battle with public employee unions die down and people realize his 2011-’13 budget wasn’t the end of the world.

And he blamed unions for a disinformation campaign for tainting the public’s view of the plan, which forces public employees to pay more for pensions and health care costs.

""In many cases, many of the national unions told their members things that just don't add up,"" Walker told ""Squawk Box"" co-anchor Joe Kernen on June 21, 2011. ""They told them, for example, that the health insurance premium (contributions) we were asking for were a percentage of their incomes, not of their premiums.""

""Well that’s a big difference,"" Walker continued. ""If you’re asked to pay 12 to 13 percent of your actual salary, that’s a huge amount...""

That certainly is a big difference.

Walker’s claim is a variation on a theme advanced by Republicans, that national union leaders were pulling the strings here in order to boost the size and duration of the Capitol protests. But it puts an awfully specific spin on it.

When we asked for backup, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said they had no documentation of unions making that claim to members. He said Walker as heard this privately from teachers around the state, though he did not identify any individual teachers.

That leaves it to us to see what evidence there may be.

A bit of background before we begin:

In December, after the election, Walker spoke publicly about his plan to seek greater health and pension contributions. He repeated that during his state of the state speech Feb. 1. And less than two weeks later, he unveiled the plan as part of his budget-repair bill.

After unprecedented protests -- and the departure of 14 Democratic senators to Illinois -- the plan won final approval on March 9, 2011. It then survived a legal challenge at the Supreme Court over the manner in which it was approved -- and there may be more battles to come.

A central part of the plan: Requiring most state and local public employees to pay at least 12 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums.

It is a big deal for workers. As the issue was debated, we found in an earlier item, the average state employee was paying about 4 percent to 6 percent of the premium. Local government workers’ costs varied by municipality or school district.

Walker’s plan also called for workers to pay more toward their pensions -- a contribution of about 5.8 percent of their salary.

Note the difference: the pension contribution was a percentage of salary, and the health change was percentage of total premium.

The governor’s office -- and reporters --  soon began reporting the combined impact on workers’ paychecks, because in the end that’s where the money would come from. In effect, it is a reduction in pay.

In our review, we found a range. Depending on their incomes and health insurance choices, workers would see a 6.8 percent to 12.9 percent hit from the combined changes.

With all these numbers floating around, the opportunity for confusion was there. In fact, scattered media reports got the health-insurance change wrong, reporting it as a percentage of income.

And we previously found one falsehood on health insurance that circulated briefly in an email, but it involved Walker’s separate two-year budget, not the repair bill. Some state corrections employees, including a dentist who leads unionized state professionals, thought the budget forced workers to pay 100 percent of health costs, but that email rumor was quickly debunked by the state’s largest public-sector union, and separately by PolitiFact Wisconsin.

The issue here is how the big unions described Walker’s health change to their members. Those unions were the subject of Walker’s misinformation claim.

We reviewed dozens of public communications -- web postings, email alerts and press releases -- between the various unions and their members, as well as to the general public. We also looked for private communications, some of which surfaced publicly.

The ones we found all accurately described the impact of the plan.

A few examples: The Wisconsin State Employees Union, part of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), got it right. Same for the state’s largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the National Education Association, AFT-Wisconsin and Madison Teachers Inc.

Marty Beil, head of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, said his 22,000 members understood Walker’s plan very clearly.

""For him to say that is just misleading as hell,"" Beil said. ""There was no misunderstanding.""

Let’s finish up.

Walker blamed union disinformation for what he said was confusion about his health insurance plan in his budget repair bill. He squarely blamed big unions, and described the problem as widespread. But Walker offered no tangible evidence for his claim. And our check of the communications by the big unions found no instances of unions falsely portraying his plan as a percentage of income.

If any additional information surfaces, we may revisit this ruling. But based on the information available, and the lack of documentation from Walker, we rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4F4B40>],/factchecks/2011/jul/10/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-public-employee-unions-false/

Democrats say Mitt Romney is first Massachusetts politician who failed to win New Hampshire in a generation
","
Mitt Romney, now competing in his second New Hampshire primary, considers himself more than a neighbor from the south. The former Massachusetts governor, who owns a home on New Hampshire’s Lake Winnipesaukee, likes to think of himself as one of the Granite State’s own. But state Democratic leaders were quick to point out last week that state voters haven’t always returned Romney’s affection.

Speaking with reporters on a June 27, 2011, conference call, Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley said Romney, who placed second in the 2008 primary, was the first Bay State politician in decades who failed to win the New Hampshire primary.

""It's important to note that Mitt Romney is the first Massachusetts politician to run for president and not win the New Hampshire primary in a generation,"" Buckley said. ""The people of New Hampshire know him very well.""

PolitiFact decided to check the record books.

Prior to Romney’s last run in 2008, the last three Massachusetts politicians to run for the Oval Office all got off to good starts by winning the New Hampshire primary, according to state voting records.

In 2004, John Kerry, the U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, won the Democratic primary, defeating former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, among other candidates. Twelve years earlier, in 1992, U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas defeated Bill Clinton to win the primary; and four years prior to that, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the primary on his way to the 1988 Democratic nomination.

Political analysts say all three Massachusetts residents took advantage of the physical -- and philosophical -- proximity of the two states.

Voters from both states tend to hold common cultural values, political attitudes and histories, according to Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. And, because much of southern New Hampshire, the state’s most populous area, falls within the Boston media market, Granite State voters are often familiar with Massachusetts candidates even before election season begins, added David King, a lecturer at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.

But the home court advantage doesn’t help all Massachusetts candidates. Indeed, you need only go back to 1980, when U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy lost his bold bid to unseat President Jimmy Carter.

So it was 28 years between that loss and Romney's. Does that count as ""a generation""?

To find out, we asked the experts.

Genealogists across the country don’t have a set definition for the length of a generation, the time between the birth of a parent and that parent’s child. We found a range of answers from  20 to 30 years.

Ancestry.com, a national genealogical website, considers a generation as 25 years; the New England Genealogical Society accepts a generation as 25 to 30 years, and the U.S. Genealogical Society extends it between 20 and 30 years.

""Anywhere between twenty and thirty years seems to be the standard, but there is no hard and fast rule,"" said Laura Prescott, a Brookline, New Hampshire resident and president of the Association of Professional Genealogists. ""It’s something that changes over time, and it’s an inexact science.""

Our ruling

Buckley said Romney was the first candidate to lose ""in a generation."" Buckley is right if you rely on the shorter time period of 20 or 25 years, but he is off if you rely on the 30-year standard. Even so, he wouldn't be that far off, and his underlying point is correct that Romney's 2008 loss was unusual by historical standards. So we find his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3C7540>],/factchecks/2011/jul/10/new-hampshire-democratic-party/democrats-say-mitt-romney-first-massachusetts-resi/

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama will add more debt than 43 prior presidents
","
At a roundtable of small business leaders in Salem, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was asked what he would do about the corporate tax rate, whether he would cut government spending or raise taxes and whether it was possible to do both.

Romney said he had a plan to lower the corporate tax rate but noted the nation's huge debt.

""What I would like to do is bring the tax rate down and eliminate some of the special breaks that go to the big businesses that have found ways to take advantage of loopholes,"" Romney said. ""So, I’d take that corporate tax rate down at least from 35 down to 25 percent. Then we can talk about where we can go from there. I’d like to get it a lot lower, but what I don’t want to do is add to the deficit. I don’t want to come back with a tax rate so low that we end up seeing our deficit go shooting up, because what we don’t want to have happen is the circumstance where we have larger and larger deficits.

""I mean, this president is on track to have added so much debt to this country, that by the end of his first term, he will have added as much debt as all the prior presidents of this country combined. Think of that. I don’t want to do what he’s done, but I do believe we need to bring the corporate tax rate down, close special deals and loopholes to help finance that and encourage investment and growth by virtue of doing so.""

Really? More debt than all 43 presidents before President Obama?

First we had to determine which ""debt"" Romney was referring to in his statement.

There are actually two main ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities.

The other is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future.

Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said the candidate was referring to debt held by the public.

We then needed to determine the start and end points for calculating how much of the debt can be categorized as falling within Obama’s first term.

Obama took office on January 20, 2009, but who ""owns"" the debt recorded for fiscal year 2009 is unclear. Obama signed off on the budget that year, but it was assembled during Bush’s term, and it does not really bear Obama’s imprint. Similarly, it’s possible to say that either the fiscal year 2012 budget or the fiscal year 2013 budget is Obama’s last from his first term.

So we decided to analyze Romney’s claim by using three possible date ranges for our calculations.

-- October 1, 2008 (the start of fiscal 2009) to Oct. 1, 2012 (the end of fiscal 2012)
-- January 20, 2009 (the day of Obama’s inauguration) to Oct. 1, 2013 (the end of fiscal 2013)
-- October 1, 2009 (the start of fiscal 2010, Obama's first full budget year) to Oct. 1, 2013 (the end of fiscal 2013)

We’re offering several options because each of these measurements have shortcomings for the purpose of measuring the debt accumulated under Obama.

We’re able to calculate the debt figures for the earlier dates using the U.S. Department of Treasury’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator. The future debt amounts come from Office of Management and Budget projections. Because they are projections, they’re subject to change as economic circumstances change, but they are are widely cited among experts. (OMB doesn’t project future debt to specific dates, only to the end of future fiscal years, so that’s why our ending dates are only at the end of fiscal years.) 
Here are the debt totals accumulated during the three periods we listed above:

* End of fiscal year 2008, when the accrued debt under the 43 presidents was $5.851 trillion, to the end of fiscal 2012, when the debt is projected to reach $11.881 trillion. Yes, more than the previous 43 presidents. 
* Obama inauguration, when the accrued debt was $6.307 trillion, to the end of fiscal year 2013, when the debt is projected to reach $12.784 trillion. Yes, more than the previous 43 presidents.  
* End of fiscal year 2009, when the accrued debt was $7.506 trillion, to end of fiscal year 2013, when the debt is projected to reach $12.784 trillion. No, not as much as the previous 43 presidents. 
Over the first two scenarios above, the debt more than doubled from the starting point (which reflects the debt under the prior 43 presidents) to the ending point. So in these two scenarios, Romney is right -- Obama accumulated more debt than the previous 43 presidents combined. But for the third scenario, the debt didn't double, so Romney would be wrong. This exercise is a testament to the fact that small changes in assumptions can produce big differences in outcomes.

Of course, there’s no guarantee that Obama’s administration will actually preside over as much publicly held debt as predicted, since new budgets and projections will change debt outcomes every year. And the current negotiations over raising the debt ceiling could significantly change the forecasts. Still, this is what we can conclude given the data when Romney made his statement.

Now let’s throw in a further complication. In an interview, Romney’s staff backed up the candidate’s statement in part by citing a prior ruling by PolitiFact.

Williams, Romney’s spokesman, cited PolitiFact ""True"" ruling on a claim by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va.

In a letter to the editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch in October 2010, Cantor wrote that ""the budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined.""

PolitiFact rated the statement True, and that was good enough for Romney’s campaign. ""We actually pulled it right off the (Politifact) website,"" Williams said in an interview. ""We’re making the same contention that (Cantor) made.""

But when the topic came up in Romney's claim, we re-checked our work and realized that in the Cantor fact-check we had only used the first option (the end of fiscal 2008 to the end of fiscal 2012) rather than the other two. Based on all three measurements, Romney is right by two but off by the other one. So we find his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BCD540>],/factchecks/2011/jul/10/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-will-add-more-debt-4/

Senate President Stephen Sweeney claims average workers in New Jersey won’t see payments rise until third year of new health benefits reform
","
After thousands of protesters had descended on Trenton in recent days, New Jersey Assembly members gathered on the evening of June 23 for what would be the final passage of the divisive pension and health benefits reform legislation.

That night, Senate President Stephen Sweeney -- one of the principal architects behind the bill -- explained how the health benefit changes would impact the average worker during an ""Ask the Senate President"" interview on New Jersey 101.5 FM.

""Right now, everyone pays 1.5 percent for healthcare,"" Sweeney, a Democrat who represents the southwestern part of the state, told host Eric Scott. ""For the average worker, government worker, for the first two years, on that grid that we created, they're not even impacted. They won't even feel it until the third year where they'll see any kind of an increase.""

Two years without any increases in health care expenses?

Based on the senator’s own numbers, PolitiFact New Jersey learned that Sweeney is right about the first year, but in the second year, the average worker’s costs would rise for every type of coverage -- including a nearly 80 percent jump for a family plan.

First, let’s talk about the health benefits reform piece of the legislation.

Signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie on June 28, the legislation requires all public employees to contribute toward their health care based on a percentage of one’s premium.

The contributions, which vary according to salaries and levels of coverage, will be phased in over four years for existing employees. The new regulations apply to all employees whose contract has expired and take effect after existing contracts expire. They also apply immediately to employees not covered by a union contract.

But contributions won’t go below 1.5 percent of one’s salary, the minimum amount currently paid by most public employees. Once the premium-sharing percentages exceed that minimum amount, employees would contribute according to the percentages.

Now, let’s turn to that ""grid"" Sweeney referred to in the radio interview.

The grid breaks down the premium percentages according to salaries. Because Sweeney referred to the ""average worker,"" we focused on someone earning $60,000, because federal data puts the average annual pay for a New Jersey state employee in that range.

Based on the grid, that average worker would continue paying 1.5 percent of his salary in the first year, but starting in the second year, the percentage of premiums would increase his health care costs in each level of coverage.

An average worker with family coverage would continue paying $900 in the first year, and then $1,615 in the second year, according to the senator’s grid.

Sweeney spokesman Chris Donnelly, who said the senator was aware of our correspondence, acknowledged in an email that the average worker would be impacted in the second year.

""The Senate President's goal with these reforms was to create a phase in system that was as fair as possible to lower and middle income workers.  He succeeded in doing that,"" Donnelly wrote in an email. ""While he firmly believes the cost of the new plans will lower premiums, if his comment that night mislead(s) anyone, he apologizes.  It certainly was not done maliciously, so he hopes to avoid seeing his pants being on fire.""

But there’s one more problem with the senator’s calculation: we don’t know what the premiums will be yet.

Sweeney used projected premiums in his grid, but the new legislation calls for two new committees to design new plans with an anticipated start date of Jan. 1, 2012. The senator argues the new plans could reduce premium costs.

Alan Monheit, a professor of Health Economics at the Newark-based University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said the average premium may be lower than it would have been under the old system, because the new cost-sharing could drive employees to opt for cheaper plans.

Still, premiums depend on a group’s level of health care spending, and the recent reform is mainly focused on shifting costs, Monheit said.

Let’s review:

Sweeney said in a radio interview that the average worker won’t pay higher health care costs until the third year of the new health benefits reform. But the senator’s own figures prove him wrong, showing increases starting in the second year.

Also, the premiums at the heart of this debate have yet to be determined by the new committees. Have no fear, senator, this statement isn’t getting a Pants on Fire. We rate the statement Barely True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Stimulus', 'Ocean State Policy Research Institute']","
Watchdog group says R.I. used stimulus funds for $250,000 project to “provide digital television to the state’s inmate population.”
","
Flip through ""The 2011 Rhode Island Piglet Book"" and you’ll find hundreds of examples of what the Ocean State Policy Research Institute (OSPRI)  considers wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars

OSPRI, which says it is devoted to ""the principles of free enterprise, limited government, and traditional American values,"" published the 39-page booklet in June with the support of Citizens Against Government Waste, a national conservative nonprofit group. The report focuses on municipal, state and federal spending in Rhode Island.

The authors say the booklet  ""exposes over 300 pork projects, bungled boondoggles, bad ideas and examples of abuse of power that have resulted in the waste, fraud and abuse of more than $600 million of the taxpayers’ hard-earned money.""

We can’t check on every example. But we were intrigued by one, related to federal stimulus spending, that OSPRI executive director Mike Stenhouse cited when publicizing the report on an appearance on WHJJ-920 AM’s ""The Helen Glover Show.""

The report says: ""The stimulus’ $2 billion price tag alone doesn’t tell the whole story of how tax dollars were spent – and wasted – in Rhode Island. In order to see the pork projects and frivolous spending hidden in the state’s stimulus spending, it is necessary to take a closer look.""

Included on a list of ""some of the more dubious taxpayer-funded stimulus projects"" is ""$250,000 to provide digital television to the state’s inmate population.""

Our antennae perked up: Did the state channel stimulus funds to digital TV for prisoners?

The item in the report is footnoted and includes the first in a series of links that  bring you to an OSPRI Web page with what appears to be a list of Department of Corrections projects. It includes $250,000  ""to convert digital television signal.""

We inquired about the project at the state Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment, which administers spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)  -- the formal name of the stimulus program. Deputy director Laurie Petrone reviewed records and got back to us.

""Under ARRA, they are not receiving any funds for that,"" she said.

So we contacted the corrections department

""There were no ARRA funds used for the digital conversion project,"" said spokeswoman Tracey Zeckhausen.

When we related this to Stenhouse, he sent an e-mail with an attached state document that he said was where ""the specific information was originally drawn from.""

The document heading reads, ""Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment"" and beneath that it says ""submitted requests under review, state agencies and state university."" Beneath that, in larger red type, the phrase ""submitted requests under review"" is repeated.

Petrone said those headings reflect that the document was merely a list of projects that various state agencies and institutions proposed as possible candidates for stimulus funding. The state compiled the list as it prepared to apply for stimulus money, she said. Ultimately, many did not receive ARRA funds, including the requested $250,000 for digital TV conversion at the Adult Correctional Institutions, she said.

The corrections department did undertake the project, however, using $143,000 in capital funds and $31,000 from its general fund to pay for work that ended up costing $174,000, Zeckhausen said. The sources of those revenues were state taxpayer dollars, she said.

The project, completed in early 2009, prepared the Adult Correctional Institutions for the federally mandated deadline for full-power TV stations to switch from analog to digital broadcasts. After that date, June 13, 2009, the prisons’ analog TVs -- the only kind available at that time -- would have been unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts without special converter boxes and antennae.

And, Zeckhausen noted, ""They do not get cable.""

The ACI’s 3,200 inmates watch TV in common areas and in their cells. In minimum security, as many as eight inmates may live in the same dormitory room and share one television. Inmates in old maximum security, who have no cellmates, have the exclusive choice of what to watch.

The 2009 project involved improvements to the ACI’s existing antenna system, including rewiring and installing new components for reception of over-the-air digital broadcasts, Zeckhausen said. TVs are connected to the antenna wiring via a cable plugged into a cell wall.

Today, inmates can purchase converter boxes for their analog TVs for $69 or buy new 13-inch digital flat-screen TVs for $191 (with clear backs to prevent the hiding of contraband). The TVs can receive about two dozen  stations,  including NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS outlets in Providence and Boston.

Why should inmates get to watch TV at all?

""An idle inmate can present a security risk. Keeping prisoners occupied is critical, and the opportunity to watch TV is one way to do that,"" Corrections Director A. T. Wall said in a statement. He also said that TV ""keeps inmates...in tune with current events, another factor in preparing them for life beyond the walls.""

But our mission here isn’t to judge whether such spending is, or is not,  ""dubious."" It’s to check on the accuracy of the report’s claim.

Here’s what we found:

OSPRI got two things right. The project was ""taxpayer-funded"" and it did provide digital television to the state’s inmates.

But it got two big things wrong. First, the project didn’t cost $250,000. The actual price was $174,000.

And more important, it is not a ""stimulus project."" OSPRI should have heeded the cautionary note in big red type on the document it cited. A call to the Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment would have cleared that up.

When we told Stenhouse what we learned, he downplayed the source of the project’s funding. The main purpose of the Piglet book, he said, is "" to list federal, state, and local expenditures of taxpayer dollars in R.I.""

Isn’t the purpose of a 38-page report with 412 footnotes to get the facts right?

Furthermore, the OSPRI report pointedly described federal stimulus spending as a ""litany of pricey and preposterous handouts"" in highlighting 17 local projects it said benefited from the program.

When we asked Petrone about those other items, she said only 2 of the 17 won funding through the state. We can’t delve into those here, but we’re checking into whether any secured stimulus funding through some other means, if they received any public funding at all, and whether the projects were actually undertaken. (Download the report, go to page 32 and let us know the ones you’re interested in.)

The Piglet Book authors got a bit lucky on this one. The fact that the ACI completed the project without stimulus funding saved their bacon from the flames of a Pants on Fire ruling. We rate this one False

"['Jobs', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Eddie Rodriguez']","
Austin Rep. Eddie Rodriguez says budget cuts ""almost 6,000 state jobs""
","
Critiquing the new state budget, state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez told the Central Texas Democratic Forum that Austin will suffer because of cuts imposed by the Republican-controlled Legislature. 
""We’re losing almost 6,000 state jobs,"" the Austin Democrat said June 22. ""If you lose a lot of state employees, it affects Austin"" — the state capital — ""more than almost any other place in Texas."" 
We wondered whether Rodriguez was right about the number of state jobs getting cut in the 2012-13 budget. 
Nate Walker, Rodriguez's chief of staff, pointed us to an analysis of the adopted budget by the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. The report has a section on ""full-time-equivalent positions,"" which include state agency jobs as well as higher-education jobs that are funded with money appropriated by the Legislature. 
According to the report, the new state budget provides for 235,240 FTEs in fiscal year 2012 and 235,135 FTEs in 2013. Compared with the 240,862 FTEs that were budgeted for the current fiscal year, which ends Aug. 31, that's a reduction of 5,727 FTEs by 2013, or 2.4 percent. 
But does that mean 5,727 fewer state jobs by 2013? Sort of. 
According to the state auditor's office, which collects information on the state's work force, one full-time-equivalent position is ""any combination of employees whose hours total 40."" That means that an FTE total is not necessarily equivalent to a head count — one FTE position could be filled by two people working 20 hours a week, for example — and that the number of jobs being cut over the next two years could actually be greater than 5,727. 
It's also important to note that eliminating a position doesn't always mean someone gets laid off. Employers frequently trim their work forces by getting rid of unfilled jobs. And after the 2004-05 budget was written, the last time the state faced a significant revenue shortfall, most of the 10,000 eliminated state jobs were cleared through attrition and a retirement incentive, not layoffs, according to a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman article. 
According to the most recent information from the state auditor’s office, there were about 255,000 full- and part-time state agency and state-paid higher education employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. So, how many of those people are expected to lose their state government jobs because of the budget cuts? 
That's difficult to determine because we don't know how many of the positions destined to be eliminated are currently filled. Also, the state doesn't have a centralized, single source to go to for layoff plans; those decisions are made at the agency level. 
Still, news about layoffs at state agencies has been trickling out. 
The Statesman recently reported that the Texas Education Agency and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department are each expected to lay off more than 100 people. 
And in an interview with the Statesman published July 2, University of Texas President William Powers Jr. said that roughly 600 UT employees would be laid off ""over a couple-year period."" In Dallas, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center announced June 29 that it had cut 105 employees, according to a Fort Worth Star-Telegram article. 
Summing up: Rodriguez’s statement refers to full-time-equivalent positions as jobs. While that's not a perfect fit, it's understandable shorthand for what the new budget requires. We rate this statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970442C0>],/factchecks/2011/jul/09/eddie-rodriguez/austin-rep-eddie-rodriguez-says-budget-cuts-almost/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'John Cornyn']","
John Cornyn says 51 percent of American households pay no income tax
","
In a July 7, 2011, floor speech, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, offered a striking statistic about how few American households pay federal income taxes.

""Let's talk about federal tax reform,"" he said, referring to suggestions that a restructuring of the tax code could emerge from bipartisan negotiations over extending the federal government’s ability to borrow money. ""There has been a lot of discussion about that, where we want to take the tax code with all of its multiple provisions and get it on the table and take a look at it to make sure it is, in my view, flatter, fairer and simpler.

""But right now, the fact (is) that according to the Committee on Joint Taxation, 51 percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada. … Actually, to show how out of whack things have gotten, 30 percent of American households actually made money from the tax system by way of refundable tax credits -- the Earned Income Tax Credit, among others. So 51 percent of American households paid no income tax in 2009, but 30 percent actually made money under the current system.""

In a sign that this is becoming a Republican talking point, Cornyn’s comments echoed those made on the floor the same day by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.

So, is it true that a majority of Americans aren’t paying any federal income tax? The answer is that Cornyn is correct. And the backstory is interesting.

 As Cornyn noted, his statistics come from a document produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a respected bipartisan committee of Congress. The JCT found that for tax year 2009, roughly 22 percent of ""tax units"" (not exactly ""households,"" but we’ll give Cornyn a pass on the terminology) ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, a longstanding policy that encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code. By contrast, JCT found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government.

How did we get to the point where most Americans don’t pay federal income taxes? Our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia explained it a few months ago while checking a similar claim by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. The main reason is that the U.S. employs the tax system not just to collect funds but to distribute them as well.
   
Bob Williams, a tax policy specialist at the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks, which are sometimes called ""tax expenditures.""
   
""There are lots and lots of them,"" he said. ""We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes, and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution.""
   
However, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks they get still don’t lower their taxes to zero. By contrast, popular lower- and middle-income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook.  

Concern about the wisdom of providing so many tax expenditures is one of the reasons why some are calling for fundamentally restructuring the tax code, perhaps as part of the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations. A tax code that included fewer specialized exemptions and deductions would enable basic tax rates to fall for all tax brackets. As an added benefit, the tax code would become simpler.

We should note that Cornyn worded his statement carefully enough to avoid potential pitfalls. Here are a few of them:

Cornyn made clear that he meant 2009. The percentage of households with no tax liability bounces around quite a bit year by year, partly due to changes in the tax code and partly due to changing economic conditions.

Figures from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center show that since 2004, the percentage of no-liability tax units has been as low as 39.9 percent in 2007. In fact, 2009 -- the year Cornyn cited -- may prove to be a high point. The center’s projections suggest that the rate could fall to 49.5 percent for tax year 2010 and 46.4 percent in 2011.

Cornyn took care to refer to households that pay no ""income tax,"" rather than suggesting that they paid no taxes at all. Many Americans who pay no income tax pay other federal taxes, most notably the payroll tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare and is deducted from every working American’s paycheck.

Estimates by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center project that for tax year 2011, 46.4 percent of households won’t have any income tax liability. However, of this number, 28.3 percent will pay payroll taxes, the center projects. Of the remaining 18.1 percent with neither income nor payroll tax liability, 10.3 percent are elderly and 6.9 percent are not elderly but have incomes lower than $20,000. In other words, all but a tiny sliver of Americans without either income tax or payroll tax liability are either elderly or poor.

Some families who pay no federal income tax may be liable for state income taxes (and local property taxes, sales taxes and the like). But Cornyn began his remarks by talking about ""federal tax reform,"" so we won't fault him for not mentioning that.

There are enough different ways to look at the tax burden to allow all sides to pick and choose tax statistics that favor their positions.

Conservatives have a point that richer Americans pay the lion’s share of federal taxes. In 2007, according to the Urban-Brookings Center, the richest 20 percent paid 68.9 percent of federal taxes, and the top 1 percent paid 28.1 percent. (One would expect the rich to pay more, since they earn more, but these percentages are even higher than their share of the nation's total income. According to one frequently cited academic study, the top 20 percent earned 61.4 percent of income in 2006 and the top 1 percent earned 21.3 percent of income that same year.) 
In addition, the richest 10 percent, 5 percent and 1 percent of taxpayers each paid significantly higher effective tax rates than Americans lower on the income spectrum.

On the other hand, PolitiFact rated as Mostly True a recent statement by President Barack Obama that ""if you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s."" And by international standards, the U.S. tax burden remains modest.

In other words, scoring points on tax policy depends on how you frame the issue.

So where does this leave us? A full understanding of U.S. tax policy requires a lot of additional context that Cornyn didn’t supply. Still, at PolitiFact, words matter, and on the specific point Cornyn was making -- that a majority of American households paid no income tax in 2009 -- he not only accurately cited a credible study but also took care to cite a specific year and to explain that he only meant to refer to federal income taxes. So we rate Cornyn’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096ED95C0>],/factchecks/2011/jul/08/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-51-percent-american-households-pa/
"['China', 'Deficit', 'Economy', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
Allen says China owns more U.S. bonds than Americans
","
Republican Senate candidate George Allen said recently that the U.S. is indebted to China, and not in a good way.

""China owns more of our bonds than do Americans,"" Allen said in a July 2 interview with the NBC 29 television station in Charlottesville. ""That’s not a good position to be in.""

Are China’s holdings of U.S. government debt larger than the amount Americans own? We checked to see if that was true.

The national debt stands at $14.3 trillion. Nearly $6 trillion of that is held by the Federal Reserve and U.S. government agencies in various funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund.

The rest of the amount, about $8.3 trillion, is ""privately-held"" debt owed to mutual funds, pension funds, foreign investors and other bond holders.

There’s no doubt China holds a lot of U.S. government debt. In fact, it’s the largest foreign owner of U.S. Treasury securities.

As of March 2011, China owned about $1.2 trillion of U.S. debt - more than a quarter of the total $4.5 trillion in U.S. treasuries held by foreign investors, according to statistics from the U.S. Treasury Department. But the rest of the roughly $3.8 trillion of privately held debt was owned by United States investors such as banks, pension funds and mutual funds.

So there’s no way that China owns more U.S. debt than domestic investors.

But Bill Riggs, an Allen campaign spokesman, told us that when the former governor said China held more bonds than Americans, he was referring to debt held by ordinary American investors.

To support that narrower contention, the Allen campaign sent us a couple of reports from the U.S. Treasury to argue that regular American investors’ U.S. debt holdings were less than China’s.

Allen’s campaign pointed to an April 2011 Treasury report showing the June 2010 amount of foreign holdings of U.S. securities, which includes treasury securities as well as other investments including stocks and debt owed by U.S. agencies.According to the report, China had $1.6 trillion of U.S. securities.

Riggs then sent us a Treasury Department table showing the breakdown of how much U.S. Treasuries are held by various classes of investors.

That chart breaks out holders of U.S. treasuries into about 10 groups such as U.S. banks, savings bonds, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, foreign investors, state and local governments and a miscellaneous ""other investors"" category.

Riggs said the campaign tallied up the total debt held by what Allen termed American investors. Allen’s campaign included debt tied up in U.S.savings bonds, private pension funds, state and local government pensions and mutual funds.

Investors in those funds held a total of $1.5 trillion of debt in June 2010, Riggs said. The Allen campaign did not include in its calculations U.S. Treasury debt held by banks, insurance companies, state and local governments outside their pension funds or tallies from the ""other investors"" category.

That $1.5 trillion tally that Allen attributes to American investors is less than the $1.6 trillion attributed to China in Treasury’s April report.

But there are serious flaws with the Allen campaign’s reasoning.

First of all, Allen’s rationale is an apples-to-oranges comparison.

The smaller $1.5 trillion tally for so-called American investors only includes U.S. Treasury securities. But the larger $1.6 trillion tally linked to China includes not just Treasury debt, but other investments a well -- such as stocks and corporate debt.

Derek Scissors, an economist who specializes in Asian affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the two numbers are not measuring the same thing.

""It’s not a comparable number,"" Scissors said. ""They’re trying to build a skewed case.""

Scissors was also skeptical of how the Allen campaign defined debt held by regular American investors. If the Allen campaign was going to count debt held by mutual funds, Scissors wondered why they didn’t include debts held by U.S. banks.

Scissors also said some portion of the ""other investors"" category, which held $1.2 trillion of U.S. treasury debt in June 2010, would certainly include some debt owned by Americans.

But Allen’s calculations for American-held debt doesn’t count a penny of debt held in that category, which includes debt held by individuals, government-sponsored enterprise and businesses.

For the record, we checked a pair of Treasury Department charts to get the latest official tally of how much U.S. treasury securities were owned by China. As of December 2010 -- the most recent month for which we could find comparable data -- mainland China and Hong Kong (which are reported separately) together held nearly $1.3 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities. In that same month, the investor categories comprising Allen’s definition of regular investors held $1.6 trillion in U.S. securities.

To sum up:

Allen said China owns more U.S. bonds than Americans. That statement is wrong on its face, but the Allen campaign offers a qualifier -- his spokesman said Allen’s statement is a reference to regular American investors.

But the reports Allen cites are not comparable and don’t even prove that narrower assertion.

Official debt tallies, even using Allen’s definition of ordinary American investors, show U.S. citizens held more government debt than China.

As an added defense, Allen’s campaign said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in February testified before Congress that he thinks China owns more than $2 trillion of U.S. government bonds. That still doesn’t prove Allen’s point.

The bottom line is that Allen’s methodology of including some U.S. investors and ignoring others is highly questionable, and his evidence doesn’t add up to his conclusion.

We rate the claim False.

"['Rhode Island', 'Children', 'Families', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Poverty', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Gary Sasse']","
Sasse says Rhode Island spends 52 percent more per capita on human service programs than U.S. average
","
If you're strapped for cash, as Rhode Island certainly is, you're always looking for a way to cut expenses.

One area often targeted by pundits, because it makes up such a large share of the state budget, is spending on human services such as Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income people.

In April, we looked at one aspect of that portion of the budget, giving a Half True to a statement by Rhode Island Tea Party founder Colleen Conley that Rhode Island has the most generous welfare benefits in New England. (We found that every New England state, except Maine, pays more to its welfare recipients.)

During the June 26 broadcast of 10 News Conference, Gary Sasse, former director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration and the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, made a related comparison, saying that the state gives out far more benefits than the national average.

Speaking of what is now the 2012 state budget, Sasse said that ""of the $200-million increase [in overall spending], 90 percent is to support human service programs. We spend 52 percent more per capita on human service programs than the national average.""

When reporter Bill Rappleye asked for specific numbers, Sasse said, ""Well, we spend about $9,300 per capita on Medicaid programs, and that's soup to nuts, that's everything from RIte Care to nursing homes. The average for the country is about $6,100. There's a $3,000 difference.

""So the question on human services is not necessarily cutting back on eligibility, but looking at what optional services we provide. We provide about $60 [million] -- probably more than that, probably about $70 million -- in optional Medicaid services that many other states don't provide.""

We asked Sasse for the source of his assertion that Rhode Island spends $1.52 for every $1 spent nationally.

He gave us two.

The first is a Feb. 10 presentation developed by the House Finance Committee, which reported that in 2008, a total of $294 billion was spent nationally on Medicaid recipients. That averages out to $6,120 per recipient (19.4 percent of the money went to children, 13.5 percent went to adults, 43 percent was for the disabled and 24.1 percent was spent on the aged).

In Rhode Island that year, the state spent $1.7 billion (about 52 percent of it federal funds) or $9,341 per recipient, with children and adults getting less (13.5 percent and 10.1 percent respectively) and the disabled getting a lot more (51.4 percent). House spokesman Larry Berman said the source of those numbers was the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which collects state and federal spending data.

The per-enrollee spending is 52.6 percent higher in Rhode Island than the United States. Sasse said that's where his 52 percent statement came from.

But what about the ""per capita"" spending?

Sasse said in an interview that when he said ""per capita,"" the population he was referring to was enrollees. However, we believe most people who hear the term will think it's based on the population in Rhode Island.

Would the number be different if calculated using the general population?

As a second source, he referred us to RIPEC's 2010 ""How Rhode Island Compares"" report. It's based on U.S. Census data from 2008 and looks at the cost of public welfare -- Medicaid and cash payments to the poor -- on the basis of state population. That report says public welfare costs were $2,036 per Rhode Island resident, which is 51.8 percent more than the $1,341 spent per capita nationally.

If you just look at RIPEC's Medicaid numbers, as the House Finance Committee staff report did, per capita spending in Rhode Island is actually 55.8 percent more than the national average, a bit higher than Sasse said.

Why does Rhode Island spend so much more?

""We have very high residential care costs,"" said Sasse, a factor others have noted.

In addition, Rhode Island covers some services regarded as ""optional"" by the federal government, such as adult daycare, assisted living for the elderly and hospice care for the dying.

Sasse offered no specific suggestions about what to cut. He said that's for the politicians to decide; he's just looking at the basic numbers.

Fred Sneesby, spokesman for the state Department of Human Services, said in April after we published our earlier item that it's important to consider ""other fiscally meaningful differences among states; for example, the percentage of disabled and elderly in Rhode Island is significantly higher than in neighboring states as well as the national average.""

He pointed us to section of the Kaiser website, StateHealthFacts.org, showing that since the 2004 fiscal year, the state's growth in Medicaid spending has been significantly less than the U.S. average. He also said that eligibility for Rhode Island programs is as strict -- if not stricter -- than Massachusetts and Connecticut.

To sum up, Sasse said Rhode Island’s per capita human services spending -- by his definition, Medicaid spending per enrollee --  is 52 percent higher than the national average. By that definition, he’s correct.

He’s also correct in the more common use of ""per capita"" -- spending by population.

So we rate his claim True.

As often happens, our research on this item raised questions that go beyond the statement we evaluated. Chief among them: How concerned should we be that Rhode Island spends more than the national average?

Advocacy groups rarely address the question directly when they offer their reports and statistics.

The 52-percent figure could mean that the state is being overly generous with its benefits.

Or it could mean that the characteristics of Rhode Island's population require us to spend more to give the same level of service that other states provide.

Or it could mean that the national average is depressed by states that are declining to provide some of the ""optional"" services, such as hospice care for the poor, that some Rhode Islanders might regard as anything but optional.

"['Georgia', 'History', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich says campaign problems ""exactly the same"" as Reagan's
","
Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich is comparing his struggles to those of President Ronald Reagan so often it’s turning into a habit.

The former West Georgia College history professor said June 22, during a speech at the Atlanta Press Club, that on the day of the 1980 New Hampshire primary, ""the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan’s staff quit."" We ruled his claim Mostly True.

Gingrich recycled the historical tidbit that same day before a crowd near Baltimore and to Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, both times in slightly different ways that hewed close to the truth.
But the Truth-O-Meter's dial began to spin when it got word of what Gingrich said June 27 on Fox News’ ""Your World With Neil Cavuto.""   

Cavuto asked Gingrich how he will fight the perception his campaign is ""rudderless"" and assure voters that he can get his campaign on track.

""Well, first of all, by not being distracted, but focusing on substance and talking about the solutions we need as a country, and second by reminding people that Ronald Reagan had exactly the same challenges in 1980 -- John McCain had exactly the same challenges in 2007,"" Gingrich said.

Ronald Reagan had ""exactly the same"" challenges in 1980 as Newt Gingrich does?

We rated his earlier statement Mostly True because on balance, Gingrich’s claim squared with history. At about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day of the New Hampshire primary, Reagan met with campaign manager John Sears and two other top staffers in his hotel suite. Reagan and others blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses.

Reagan handed Sears a news release that announced the campaign’s new manager was future Central Intelligence Agency head William Casey. It said Sears had resigned to return to his law practice.  

Sears got the message and left, as did staffers loyal to him.

Gingrich’s memory wasn’t perfect. But yes, many of Reagan’s top aides left the campaign on the day of his blowout victory in New Hampshire.

Staffers left Gingrich’s campaign under very different circumstances.

News accounts said Gingrich’s high command rebelled after disagreements on the direction of the campaign. The Associated Press, which broke the story, described the dissent as a ""rebellion.""

On-the-record accounts indicate Gingrich did not orchestrate these departures as Reagan did in 1980. Staffers left of their own accord because they disagreed with the direction of the campaign.

The departures started May 31, when Will Rogers, Gingrich’s Iowa political director, resigned. Rogers told The Des Moines Register that he thought Gingrich wasn’t campaigning or fundraising hard enough. Gingrich’s departure for a luxury vacation in the Greek isles was the last straw.

Former staffers Rick Tyler, Gingrich’s longtime spokesman, and the campaign’s Iowa director Craig Schoenfield both told The Boston Globe after they left that they and others resigned after a series of meetings involving top-level campaign aides.  

Schoenfeld told Politico that staffers couldn’t convince Gingrich to run a more labor-intensive campaign.

""To be successful in Iowa you need to be here [and] taking a look at the way the schedule was, he’s not scheduled to be here in June at all and he’s got very few appearances in July,"" Scoenfeld said. ""You need to make sure that you give yourself a chance to be successful.""

Tyler told the National Journal that staffers made up their minds to resign June 9, the day the news broke.

There are other glaring differences between the Gingrich and Reagan departures. Reagan switched staff during the primaries, as his campaign gained steam.  

Gingrich’s staffers left at a low point, after embarrassments on Medicare policy, his vacation to the Greek Isles, and news he held massive credit accounts at the jeweler Tiffany’s. The primaries are still eight months away.

Reagan lined up replacements before he pushed out his old staffers. Ten days after Gingrich’s staff left en masse, The Des Moines Register reported that Gingrich had yet to replace his Iowa staff.

At the Atlanta Press club, Gingrich referenced Reagan campaign history to drive home the fairly vanilla point that ""campaigns go up and down.""

On Fox News, his point that he had ""exactly the same"" problems as Reagan in 1980 is outrageous self-flattery.

Reagan was on an upswing when his staffers left. Gingrich’s campaign is in a rut.

Reagan had replacements ready. Gingrich did not.

Reagan pushed out his staffers to run a more competitive campaign. Gingrich’s left him because they thought he wouldn’t do what it takes to win.

Gingrich started off in Atlanta with a statement about Reagan that was close to the truth, but as he repeated it, he embellished the facts so much that only a kernel of truth remained.   

Gingrich might wish he had Reagan’s problems. But on this one he deserves a Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809723DD40>],/factchecks/2011/jul/08/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-campaign-problems-exactly-same-reaga/

Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. claims Gov. Chris Christie has repeatedly cut funding for AIDS patients
","
Wearing pink shirts and holding up signs, people gathered outside the Statehouse in Trenton recently as Democratic legislators led a rally to increase women’s health care funding in the face of opposition from Gov. Chris Christie.

When Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. (D-Burlington/Camden) addressed the crowd on June 20, he claimed Christie also has been cutting health care funding for another group: people with AIDS.

""This governor has cut funding repeatedly for people who have AIDS, who need drugs to save their life,"" said Conaway, a physician specializing in internal medicine. ""People who have AIDS today can live out their life...almost as long as anybody else if they get the drugs they need and this governor, time and time again, has cut that.""

PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that the Christie administration had cut or proposed to cut state funding for AIDS and HIV services, but in two cases, other funding sources would allow the same number of individuals receiving those services to be served.

When we asked Conaway’s chief of staff, Ethan Hasbrouck, to back up the statement, he pointed to two funding cuts in the governor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 as well as a change made last year in eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program.

Although a final budget for fiscal year 2012 was approved at the end of June, this Truth-O-Meter item focuses on the proposed budget at the time of Conaway’s statement. We later called Hasbrouck twice and sent him multiple emails to set up an interview with Conaway about our findings, but we never heard back.

Let’s review those three items one at a time.

Hasbrouck said the fiscal year 2011 budget lowered the income eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. That disqualified about 960 people from the program, saving $7.9 million.

But the state later set up a new drug benefits program to assist those individuals who would no longer be eligible under the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. That new program was funded through additional rebates from pharmaceutical companies and a new federal grant program.

The state increased AIDS Drug Distribution Program funding last year for people who met the new income eligibility, but reduced spending in other categories of HIV services, according to Dawn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services.

Now, let’s turn to the cuts in the originally proposed fiscal year 2012 budget.

Hasbrouck correctly states that the governor’s proposed budget would have cut $4.7 million for special-care nursing facilities, including Broadway House in Newark, the state’s only long-term care facility for people living with HIV and AIDS.

The second proposed cut cited by Hasbrouck was $3.7 million from the AIDS Drug Distribution Program.

Although that state funding was proposed to be cut, the mix of funding sources would enable the same amount of participants to receive access to medications through both the AIDS Drug Distribution Program and the other drug benefits program, according to Thomas.

But remember this: two of the funding cuts cited by Hasbrouck were only proposals at the time of the assemblyman’s statement.

Here’s how the final budget for fiscal year 2012 affects AIDS and HIV funding:

The income eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program was restored to its previous level, but state funding for the program has been further reduced for a total cut of about $10.7 million, Thomas wrote in an email. Other funding sources will allow the same number of participants to be served, she wrote.

The budget reduces overall funding for nursing facilities, but there is no longer a specific cut to special-care nursing facilities like Broadway House, Thomas wrote. The impact on those special-care facilities remains unclear, she wrote.

Let’s review:

Conaway claimed at a Statehouse rally that Christie has repeatedly cut AIDS funding. His chief of staff pointed to three pieces of evidence, one from the budget approved last year and two from the proposed budget for fiscal year 2012.

A spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services confirmed cuts to AIDS and HIV funding in both budgets.

But last year, a new program was created to assist people impacted by the eligibility change. This year, state funding was proposed to be cut, but other funding sources were to maintain services for participants. 
Conaway correctly stated that Christie has cut state funding for AIDS and HIV programs, but at least when it comes to pharmaceutical assistance, people continued to receive medicine for their AIDS and HIV treatment. 
We rate his statement Mostly True.

"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Will Weatherford']","
Rep. Will Weatherford says penalized Florida delegation would still wield clout
","
Florida lawmakers, seeking to boost the state's presidential primary influence, want to jump ahead in line.

Why let just Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada set the agenda as early primary states?

A legislative commission will decide by Oct. 1, 2011, when to hold the 2012 Florida presidential primary. (At the moment, it's legally set for Jan. 31, fifth in line and before a raft of other states that vote on Super Tuesday.) But any date before the first Tuesday in March would draw the ire of the Republican National Committee, which says it will slash Florida's delegation by half.

Still, some Florida Republicans argue it could be worth it for Florida voters once again to throw critical early weight behind a candidate. (It braved party penalties to support John McCain in January 2008, and lived to tell about it: While half of Florida's delegates didn't get official convention votes, they did get to attend. And McCain went on to win the nomination.)

State Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, chatting with the St. Petersburg Times editorial board in a wide-ranging hourlong interview July 5, 2011, said lawmakers were working on a deal for an earlier primary that wouldn't draw penalties. But he wanted to make the point that even if the state got penalized, it would still have influence.

""I think the goal is to be as close as we possibly can, hopefully like the fifth slot or something like that, without penalty,"" he said. ""So we’re negotiating with the RNC as to how we get that done. There may be a penalty anyway, no matter what we do. ... The way they've got it structured is that anybody who goes before Super Tuesday gets penalized. But playing devil’s advocate, as Florida, if we were to go into it and say, 'Okay, we’ll take the penalty, we’re going to go the Thursday before Super Tuesday, and Florida's election is going to really matter and help catapult that person to Super Tuesday.' Let’s say they take away half of our delegates. They’re worth more than Iowa’s, New Hampshire’s and almost South Carolina’s combined. We have a lot of delegates. We're a large state. We're a diverse state. We reflect what I think is the demographics of the country, and we should be a player. And so I think we will be a player. It'll just come down to what the specific date is, but we're talking about that.""

He said, ""Let’s say they take away half of our delegates. They’re worth more than Iowa’s, New Hampshire’s and almost South Carolina’s combined."" We were curious: Does Weatherford's convention math make the grade? 

The Republican National Committee hasn't said how many delegates each state will have at the 2012 convention. So we asked Weatherford how he made his calculation.

He pointed to a CNN count that showed delegates from 2008:

Iowa: 37
New Hampshire: 12
South Carolina: 24
Florida: 57 (half of its original 114)

So, if things are similar next year, Florida's half-delegation would be the same size as Iowa's plus New Hampshire's and a third of South Carolina's, according to 2008 numbers.

He mentioned a second source, the Green Papers, a favorite site among political junkies for its fastidious attention to political details.

And that's where Weatherford's 2008 comparison started to break down.
The site lists how state delegates voted at the Republican National Convention. It notes that Florida lost half its delegates for violating party rules. Interestingly, it also lists four other states that lost half their delegates — including New Hampshire and South Carolina.

That's right — two states in Weatherford's comparison also sported atypically small delegations in 2008. And those states won't be penalized in 2012. New rules allow four states to lead the pack: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Not Florida.

Which means if states are awarded delegates in relatively similar numbers to 2008, as Weatherford assumed (something also predicted by the Green Papers for Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina) — New Hampshire and South Carolina will actually have twice as many as were allowed back then.

Since the RNC hasn't released its official totals, we can only offer thoughtful estimates, but according to two methods, Iowa and New Hampshire alone would have more delegates than a halved Florida delegation. (First method: Assume 2008-sized delegations, but double New Hampshire and South Carolina. Second method: Rely on the Green Papers estimates.)

Wouldn't a normal person think Weatherford meant that Florida's delegates would still outnumber Iowa's, New Hampshire's and at least a chunk of South Carolina's when he said ""They’re worth more than Iowa’s, New Hampshire’s and almost South Carolina’s combined""?

Weatherford would prefer you not parse his words so carefully: ""We were having a free-flowing conversation,"" he said. ""... I was trying to give an illustration that we're still meaningful.""
So we ran his main idea by some experts in Florida politics, who backed him up.

Christopher Mann, a political scientist at the University of Miami with elections expertise, noted that the biggest argument supporting Weatherford's claim is one the future House speaker didn't make: The Florida 2008 primary was ""winner take all."" McCain won, and so was was awarded every at-large delegate, plus three delegates for every congressional district he took.

But in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, delegates were divided among candidates in proportion with the votes they earned.

""Thus, Florida's 2012 primary is a bigger prize to win and a more painful to lose,"" Mann said. ""In theory, someone could get zero delegates in the prior three states and still have the most delegates after winning Florida because the delegates in the first three states are likely to be split among several candidates. More likely, a congested field after three proportional primaries will suddenly have a clear front-runner in the delegate count after Florida.""

Experts from the University of Central Florida and University of South Florida agreed.

""Weatherford does have a valid point that by moving up the Florida primary, Florida will have a greater role in selecting the Republican nominee,"" said Darryl Paulson, professor emeritus of government at University of South Florida. ""The 2008 election found that McCain's victory in the Florida primary essentially ended the contest for the presidential nomination.""

So where does this leave us?

Weatherford was on safer ground when he based his claim on 2008 delegate counts. But the 2012 numbers will be different, first because they've yet to be set, and second because delegations for New Hampshire and South Carolina will return to full strength. Meanwhile, Weatherford's underlying point, that Florida's delegate count will add heft to the winning candidate even if it's penalized, is true — and for more reasons than he gave.

While we would have preferred he had gotten his delegate math right — and mentioned the ""winner take all"" nature of Florida's primary — we still rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097323400>],/factchecks/2011/jul/07/will-weatherford/rep-will-weatherford-says-penalized-florida-delega/

Obama claims job rate soared after Clinton raised taxes
","
While many Republicans have warned that President Barack Obama's plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans would hurt the fragile economy, Obama fired back in a Twitter town hall on July 6, 2011, that he's only proposing to return the top tax rate to the level it was raised to under President Bill Clinton, when job growth subsequently soared.

Said Obama: ""If wealthy individuals are willing to simply go back to the rates that existed back in the 1990s when rich people were doing very well -- it’s not like they were poor -- and by the way, that’s when we saw the highest job growth rates, and that’s when we saw the highest -- the greatest reduction in poverty, and that’s when we saw businesses very profitable -- if the wealthiest among us -- and I include myself in this category -- are willing to give up a little bit more, then we can solve this problem. It does not take a lot.

""And I just have to say, when people say, job-killing tax increases, that’s what Obama is proposing, we’re not going to -- you’re entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts.  And the facts are that a modest increase for wealthy individuals is not shown to have an adverse impact on job growth.
 
""I mean, we can test the two theories. You had what happened during the ‘90s -- right? Taxes for wealthy individuals were somewhat higher, businesses boomed, the economy boomed, great job growth. And then the 2000s, when taxes were cut on wealthy individuals, jobs didn’t grow as fast, businesses didn’t grow as fast. I mean, it’s not like we haven’t tried what these other folks are pitching. It didn’t work. And we should go with what works.""

First, let's look at the history of the top tax rates at issue here. Clinton raised the top marginal rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (previously, President George H.W. Bush had raised the top tax rate from 28 percent to 31 percent in 1990).

At the time, Clinton said, ""The deficit has increased so much beyond my earlier estimates and beyond even the worst official government estimates of last year. We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our country needs, more Americans must contribute today so that all Americans can do better tomorrow.""

Sound familiar?

President George W. Bush later lowered the top marginal rate to 39.1 percent in 2001 and 38.6 percent in 2002 by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. And then he lowered the top rate again, to 35 percent, with the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.

The Bush tax cuts -- extended in a compromise deal in December -- are set to expire at the end of 2011 unless Congress seeks to extend them or make them permanent. Obama proposes to let the Bush tax cuts expire for people making over $250,000 a year. In other words, Obama would like to return the top marginal tax rate to the 39.6 percent it was under Clinton.

As for Obama's claim that in the years after the Clinton tax increase, job rates soared, the numbers back him up. Employment rates grew a healthy clip through the mid 1990s after Clinton's tax hike, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. And it's also true that jobs didn't grow as quickly after the Bush tax cuts were enacted.

So tax hikes equal job growth?

""The 1990s were very good, but not because of higher tax rates,"" said  Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute.

In an April 18, 2010, blog post, Mitchell argued that ""while Bush had a better record (than Clinton) on taxes, he had a much worse record on spending.""

Other economists say the trend at least shows raising taxes on the wealthy isn't going to cause the economy to tank.

""I don't think Obama was claiming that the higher tax rates in the '90s led to the boom, just that they did not prevent it,"" said Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the
Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""Similarly, the tax cuts of the Bush years did not lead to strong growth. Most of the evidence shows that tax increases with a given level of deficits will have a modestly negative impact on the economy.""

Higher tax rates in the top brackets does create some disincentive effect, Baker said, and some people work less, ""but it is not a very big deal in the scheme of things.""

""The idea that going back to something like Clinton era tax rates would be a disaster is nonsense,"" Baker said.

Said Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics with Moody's economy.com: ""I think he (Obama) is making the point that higher tax rates, at least at the levels under President Clinton, are compatible with strong economic growth, and the evidence is clear on that.""

""You can argue that one reason we had strong growth in the 1990s is that Bush I and Clinton reduced the deficit (cut spending and raised taxes), bringing down budget deficits,"" Faucher said. ""This, in turn, lowered long-term borrowing costs and made more capital available to the private sector. The strong growth then helped bring down the deficit further, and eventually we got surpluses. I think the fiscal discipline of Bush I and Clinton was a reason for the strong growth in the 1990s.""

J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, scoffed at the suggestion that higher tax rates might be responsible for higher job growth rates and a booming economy. ""The most you could even hope to say is that the Clinton tax hikes didn't do much damage,"" Foster said.

""The economy was poised for a dramatic boom in 1993, and instead we got muddle and negative real wage growth,"" Foster said, drawing from arguments he made in a March 4, 2008, post on the Heritage website about this very topic. ""The Clinton boom? It started not in 1993, but in 1997, which not coincidentally coincided with Republicans taking firmer control of the budget, welfare reform, and especially the capital gains tax rate reduction. Did these policies cause the boom? I argue they contributed to a propitious moment. But at least the case is plausible, whereas to ignore history and argue that the tax hikes somehow led to a boom that began four years later is simply laughable.""

Foster argued that while the Clinton tax hikes didn't trigger job losses in the 1990s, tax increases could now.

""The real difference between 1993 and 2011 is that the circumstances of 1993 suggested a recovery well underway that was on course for rapid expansion, an expansion that was dulled by the tax hikes,"" Foster said. ""We had just come out of a very mild domestic recession, inflation was low, energy prices were low, peace reigned as democracy bloomed and a confluence of new technologies were about to transform the world economy. 
""2011? We're still struggling out of a finance-centered deep global recession, the recovery is weak and retarded by a series of economic policy gaffes by this administration, global political tensions are high, oil prices are high, Europe is in the grips of a massive sovereign debt crisis of their own making.  Do you really think the consequences of a tax hike today would be the same as in 1993?  Not hardly.""

Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, doesn't dispute Obama's facts. But he questions what it proves.

""It does not prove that tax increases cause growth and tax cuts retard it,"" Toder said. ""Lots of other stuff was happening in both decades, and simple correlations don’t prove causation.  It is even possible that growth in the 1990s would have been stronger without the tax increases and weaker in the 2000s without the tax cuts. It is true, however, that the Clinton tax increases did not prevent an economic boom from occurring, whatever their incremental effect may have been. And the Bush tax cuts did not forestall a decade of relatively weak performance, even if one is willing to argue that things would have been worse without them.""

So where does this leave us? It is true that when Clinton raised the top marginal tax rate to 39.6 percent -- the same level Obama would like to return it to now -- the U.S. saw strong job growth in the ensuing years. But to the extent Obama is suggesting a cause and effect relationship between those two events -- and we think he certainly leaves that impression when he says we ""should go with what works"" -- that is dubious, according to the cross-section of economists we spoke to. There were many other economic factors that played a larger role in job growth, they said. However, most agree that the tax increases did not appear to hinder job growth, and that's significant given the dire warnings some Republicans have issued about Obama's plan to return the top tax rate to Clinton levels. Perhaps, as Foster argues, the situation is different enough now -- more precarious -- that a tax hike would have a more damaging effect. That's a matter for economists to debate. 
When Obama says we saw job growth in the 1990s even as Clinton raised taxes, he's right. But to the extent that he's suggesting raising taxes created job growth -- as he appears to be when he says ""we should go with what works,"" he goes too far. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C192C0>],/factchecks/2011/jul/07/barack-obama/obama-claims-job-rate-soared-after-clinton-raised-/

Barack Obama says post-9/11 veterans have higher unemployment than non-veterans
","
During a July 6, 2011, question-and-answer session on Twitter, President Barack Obama was asked whether he would consider giving companies a tax break if they hired honorably discharged veterans.

Obama said it’s an idea that he’s ""been talking a lot about internally. We’ve got all these young people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan; have made incredible sacrifices; have taken on incredible responsibilities. You see some 23-year-old who's leading a platoon in hugely dangerous circumstances, making decisions, operating complex technologies. These are folks who can perform. But, unfortunately, what we’re seeing is that a lot of these young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn’t serve. And that makes no sense.""

We wondered whether Obama was right about unemployment among recent veterans, so we took a look at federal statistics.

We found a recent table from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that breaks down employment status for veterans and non-veterans.

It reported that in May 2011, veterans from the post-9/11 period had an unemployment rate of 12.1 percent. By comparison, non-veterans that month had an 8.5 percent unemployment rate. So Obama was correct.

It’s worth noting that since post-9/11 veterans account for a tiny fraction of the entire labor force -- a bit over 1 percent -- and because the BLS did not seasonally adjust the numbers, these figures are subject to a lot more volatility than the unemployment rate for all workers.

For instance, in March and April 2011, unemployment for post-9/11 veterans was 10.9 percent, or more than a full point lower than it was in May. Going further back, it bounced around quite a bit -- 12.5 percent in February 2011, 15.2 percent in January 2011, and 11.7 percent in December 2010. Still, even the lowest of these figures were comfortably ahead of the comparable unemployment rates for non-veterans.

The other issue we’ll mention is that post-9/11 veterans are an exception to a more general rule. Typically, veterans of earlier military actions have unemployment levels similar to, or even lower than, non-veterans.

Consider the statistics for May 2011. As post-9/11 veterans saw their unemployment rate hit 12.1 percent, veterans of the first Gulf War were seeing a 7 percent unemployment rate, veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam were seeing 7.4 percent unemployment and veterans from other periods saw a rate of 7.9. Each group’s rate was clearly lower than the 8.5 percent unemployment rate for non-veterans.

Still, none of this undercuts Obama’s claim. If you interpret his remark -- that ""young veterans have a higher unemployment rate than people who didn’t serve"" -- to mean post-9/11 veterans, then the rates have indeed been significantly higher than for non-veterans over at least the last six months.
