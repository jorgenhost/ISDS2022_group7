Obama's tax plan hits $200,000 and up
","
A snarky Web ad from Sen. John McCain calls Sen. Barack Obama ""The One"" and shows his supporters saying things like ""Hot chicks dig Obama.""
 
""We know he doesn't have much experience and isn't ready to lead, but that doesn't mean he isn't dreamy,"" jibes an off-screen narrator.
 
Of most interest to us, though, was the ad's claim of what Obama supporters — his ""fan club"" — will get.
 
""The perks are amazing, like a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year,"" the narrator says, as a 1040 form from the Internal Revenue Service slides across the screen.
 
Text flashes by briefly, then spins around 360 degrees as it fades away, saying, ""Obama voted to raise taxes on everyone making more than $42,000.""
 
McCain has made similar statements before, saying Obama voted to raise taxes on people making more than $42,000 a year. We rated that statement

Barely True

.
 
The McCain campaign's evidence for its charges are Obama's votes on budget resolutions. A kind of blueprint for the federal budget, a budget resolution sets targets for committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The resolution envisions tax cuts rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher.
 
But voting for a budget resolution is quite different from voting for a tax increase. Budget resolutions are nonbinding, don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending. They're different from legislation that raises or lowers tax rates.
 
In the case of the McCain ad, we're more concerned with the voiceover that says, ""The perks are amazing, like a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year."" That seems designed to make the average viewer think that Obama wants to raise taxes on people making that amount, which isn't true. Obama wants to increase taxes by rolling back the Bush tax cuts on people making more than $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly.
 
What the ad implies is a major distortion that seems intent on confusing people about what Obama's policies are. When McCain's ads talked about tax-related votes, we found the statement

Barely True

. In another instance, he made claims about Democrats raising taxes by $500-million through a budget resolution, a claim we found

False

.
 
But the new Web ad pushes the envelope too far when the narrator says ""a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year."" It's a gross distortion of Obama's proposals to say they would raise taxes on ""everyone"" who earns that much, and we rate McCain's claim False.

McCain opposed ""Buy American"" rules
","
In a radio ad airing in the heart of Harley-Davidson country, Sen. Barack Obama accuses Sen. John McCain of turning his back on American-made products.
 
An announcer introduces McCain telling motorcycle enthusiasts in South Dakota that he prefers the roar of Harley-Davidsons to the cheers that Obama received during a recent trip to Germany.
 
""Not long ago, a couple hundred thousand Berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent. I'll take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day,"" McCain said.
 
The announcer then states: ""But when it comes to his record, American-made motorcycles like Harleys don't matter to John McCain. Back in Washington, McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all buy-American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.' Surprised? You shouldn't be. This is the same John McCain who supported billions in tax breaks for companies who ship American jobs overseas. It's time to hear the roar of a strong American economy again, and stop John McCain from shipping our jobs overseas.""
 
Obama's campaign is broadcasting the 60-second ad in York, Pa., in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin, where Harley-Davidson is headquartered. York is home to Harley's largest motorcycle manufacturing plant and played host to McCain the day the ad debuted.
 
In this item, we'll focus on whether McCain called a requirement for the federal government to buy American products ""disgraceful.""
 
Indeed he did.
 
McCain has repeatedly voted and spoken against requiring the government to buy American-made products. He argues that such a requirement hurts trade and doesn't guarantee the lowest prices for taxpayers.
 
In a 1997 article in

Defense Daily,

McCain criticized the requirement as ""the worst, most disgraceful aspect of the legislative process in Washington. I can not be more strong in my views without using four letter words. It's crazy for us, because ball bearings are made in a certain state, to somehow prevent the United States Defense Department from purchasing ball bearings if they meet quality standards from our allies.""
 
In 2005, he specifically mentioned motorcycles during Senate debate on a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security.
 
""Lastly, I am also disappointed that the bill once again this year contains a department-wide 'buy America' requirement, and specific language directing the Secret Service to purchase American-made motorcycles. I firmly object to all 'buy America' restrictions, as they represent gross examples of protectionist trade policy.""
 
He added, ""Furthermore, as a fiscal conservative, I want to ensure our government gets the best deal for taxpayers and with a 'buy American' restriction that cannot be guaranteed.""
 
The McCain campaign did not respond to Obama's charge. But his past words say it all. Obama's claim is True.

Tax breaks for all companies; credit for kids.
","
Barack Obama's campaign unveiled an attack ad that portrays John McCain as a creature of Washington beholden to special interests.
 
""The lobbyists – running his low road campaign,"" the ad says. ""The money – billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies, but almost nothing for families like yours.""
 
We've looked at lobbyists and the McCain campaign previously and found that

many former lobbyists

work for his campaign, though he does not hire active lobbyists for his campaign staff.
 
In this instance, we'll look at whether McCain offers ""billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies, but almost nothing for families like yours.""
 
Under McCain's proposed tax plan, it is true that oil and drug companies will get reduced taxes, but this is because McCain advocates lowering the overall corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 25 percent. He's not doling out special breaks for particular industries as the ad implies.
 
The Obama campaign points to an analysis by the Center for American Progress to show that oil companies and drug makers will receive ""billions"" in tax breaks. The center looked at corporate profits reported in publicly available Security and Exchange Commission filings, and then computed tax reductions under McCain's plan. The center acknowledges that company profits could differ substantially from the reported taxable income because of accounting rules. Corporations' tax returns are not public records. So it's not possible to know if their analysis is technically accurate, though it seems at least somewhat reasonable that a 10 percent reduction in corporate tax rates could result in billions saved for highly profitable industries.
 
Still, we find the singling out of oil and drug companies to be a significant distortion of McCain's plan.
 
The ad also says that McCain offers ""almost nothing for families like yours."" This too isn't entirely accurate. McCain proposes increasing the tax exemption for dependents (usually children) from today's $3,500 to $7,000. So he does offer some tax cuts for families that include children or other dependents.
 
Obama, on the other hand, proposes several different tax cuts aimed at the middle and lower incomes: a $500 tax credit for workers to offset payroll taxes, mortgage interest deductions for people who don't itemize their returns, expansion of the earned income tax credit, and eliminating taxes for seniors who make less than $50,000.
 
The statement that McCain offers ""almost nothing for families like yours,"" though, depends on what

your

family is like and how you define ""almost nothing."" McCain does propose increasing the exemption for dependents. Some families will consider that a significant tax savings while others might rate it ""almost nothing.""
 
His tax cuts for oil and drug companies, though, are part of an across-the-board reduction of corporate taxes that McCain says will make the United States more competitive with countries around the world. When we look at Obama's overall statement -- billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies, but almost nothing for ""families like yours"" -- we find accuracy problems on both halves of the claim. (The tax breaks aren't just for oil and drug companies, and McCain does offer some tax breaks for families.) Putting the statements together like that only makes it worse, leading us to rate his statement Barely True.

Only the wealthy make big profits.
","In a Spanish-language radio ad, John McCain makes the case that Obama will raise taxes on the middle class.
 
Translated into English, the ad asks, ""Are you ready for the higher taxes on income, savings and the sale of your home that Barack Obama promises?""
 
We checked out some of the ad's

other claims in a story we wrote

. Here, we'll look at the claim that Obama wants to raise taxes on home sales.
 
We've seen this claim before in anonymous chain e-mails that attack Obama's tax policies. We ruled those claims false.
 
There's only one scenario in Obama's tax plan that we can find in which taxes on home sales would go up. You would have to be a wealthy person, making more than $200,000 if you're single and $250,000 as a couple, and you would have to make a substantial profit on your home -- more than $250,000 in profit.
 
Here's how it would work. Obama proposes to increase the capital gains tax on upper incomes. There are exemptions to the capital gains tax, however, and one of the best-known exemptions is on home sales. In general, if you own your home and sell it for a profit, you are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit if you are single, or on the first $500,000 of profit if you are a married couple. Neither McCain nor Obama have proposed changing this exemption.
 
Most home sales under Obama's plan would also be taxed at 0 percent, unless, as we explained, profits on the home sale are more than $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for couples.
 
To present this detail of Obama's plan as wholesale tax increase on home sales is deceptive. Obama promises no such thing. We rule this statement Barely True.

Obama inflates this tire claim
","Who would've guessed tire pressure would turn out to be Topic A on the campaign trail?  
The candidates have been talking about it for days. At a town hall event in Berea, Ohio, Sen. Barack Obama brought up the subject again, knocking Sen. John McCain for mocking him for advocating proper tire inflation.  
""The Republicans are going around -- this is the kind of thing they do, I don't understand it -- they're going around, they're sending, like, little tire gauges, making fun of this idea, as if this is Barack Obama's energy plan,"" Obama said in the August 5 appearance. ""Now, two points: One, they know they're lying about what my energy plan is. But the other thing is they're making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent.""  
We've decided to check that last sentence, which the McCain campaign and a conservative blog brought to our attention.
We found that Obama was correct in a prior claim along these lines, when he suggested that inflating tires properly and getting tune-ups could ""save all the oil"" we could get from drilling in protected areas offshore.  
(The McCain campaign and its allies in the conservative blogosphere have attacked that finding from every angle, but we stand by it.)  
But this new claim is different. This time Obama didn't talk about what tire inflation and tune-ups ""could"" do. He said ""every expert"" was in agreement that tire inflation ""would absolutely reduce our oil consumption"" by 3 to 4 percent.  
We imagine very few experts would say that.  
""You can make some back of the envelope calculations to show that number would be impossible to obtain,"" said Thomas Menzies, a senior program officer at the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies who managed and drafted a study on tires and fuel economy.
So let's do that.  
To support the claim, Obama's campaign referred us to this brochure from the U.S. Department of Energy. On page 31 it says: ""Keep tires properly inflated and aligned to improve your gasoline mileage by around 3.3 percent.""  
Similarly, this Department of Energy Web page says: ""You can improve your gas mileage by around 3.3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0.4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires.""  
Under-inflation is a severe problem (affecting 80 out of 81 cars according to one survey), but most tires do not suffer from severe under-inflation.  
This survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that 26 percent of passenger vehicles had at least one tire under-inflated by 25 percent or more, and the average under-inflation of the four tires for those vehicles (not each tire) was 6.8 pounds per square inch.  
So if those drivers corrected their tire pressure, their fuel consumption would be 2.7 percent (6.8 x .4) better. That's just the severe under-inflators -- savings would be smaller for the rest of us. So fuel consumption would fall by something less than 2.7 percent if passenger vehicles corrected their tire pressure.  
Furthermore, those savings alone would not result in a one-to-one reduction in oil consumption, as Obama suggested, since just 70 percent of the oil we consume goes to vehicles. The rest gets used in a vast array of products from petroleum jelly to fertilizer.  
Also, commercial vehicles have less of a problem with under-inflation, because truckers check their tire pressure religiously to minimize fuel consumption. So they would further drag down the average savings from correcting tire pressure.  
Obama's prior claim on this subject was safely couched in generalities and possibilities. But this time he veered into certainties and absolutes -- ""every expert,"" ""would absolutely"" -- put an exact number on fuel savings, and linked it to overall oil consumption in a way that did not stand up to scrutiny. We find his claim to be False.","[('\nWeeklyStandard.com, The Blog,\n\nTire Inflation Could Not Save More Oil Than Offshore Drilling Could Produce\n\nAugust 6, 2008\n', 'http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/08/tire_pressure_1.asp'), ('\nYouTube.com,\n\nObama Insists Inflating Tires Better Than Oil Drilling\n\n, August 5, 2008, accessed August 7, 2008.\n', 'No link'), ('\nU.S. Department of Energy,\n\nEnergy Saver$\n\n, January 2006\n', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akjXqfvLu28'), ('\nU.S. Department of Energy,\n\nKeeping Your Car In Shape\n\n', 'No link'), ('\nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration,\n\nFinal Regulatory Impact Analysis, Tire Pressure Monitoring System\n\n, March, 2005\n', 'https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml'), ('\nInterview with Thomas Menzies, Senior Program Officer for the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, August 7, 2008\n', 'No link'), ('\nYahoo Finance,\n\nThe 15-Minute Tip: Err on the Side of More Air\n\nApril 18, 2008\n', 'http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/TPMS-FMVSS-No138-2005/part3.html#5'), ('\n', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2008/aug/08/barack-obama/obama-inflates-this-tire-claim/

Obama voted for budget resolution, not taxes.
","New political ads from John McCain accuse Barack Obama of raising taxes on the middle class.
 
""Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000,"" an announcer says in a television ad. ""He promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family.""
 
To support this statement, the McCain campaign points to two Obama votes on budget resolutions, one in March 2008 and another in June 2008.
 
Problem is, neither of these votes actually raised taxes, nor were they expected to.
 
Instead, the votes approved budget resolutions, which are blueprints for the federal budget. The resolutions set targets for the committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The tax cuts would have been rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher.
 
The McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted for the measures, which expressed approval for tax increases. But as we have pointed out in other stories, it's inaccurate to suggest votes on non-binding budget resolutions, which don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending, are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The ad gives an overall false impression that Obama as president would favor tax increases for incomes of $42,000. He does not. Obama's tax proposals are crafted so that tax increases hit those couples $250,000 or more a year, or $200,000 for singles. He also proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles).
 
Because the ad cherry-picks a vote that would not have directly changed the tax code, we find the statement Barely True.

McCain opposes taxes but hasn't commented on bill
","Sen. Barack Obama's campaign says Sen. John McCain is a Washington insider with a special place in his heart for oil companies.
 
""McCain has consistently chosen profits for the oil companies over energy relief for American families,"" said a recent press released issued by the campaign. McCain even refused to back a new bipartisan energy compromise in the Senate ""because it would take away tax breaks from oil companies like Exxon Mobil.""
 
Turns out the Obama campaign is off base with its charge that McCain opposes the new measure.
 
A bipartisan group of senators unveiled the proposal on Aug. 1, 2008. Called the New Energy Reform Act of 2008 or New ERA, the measure advocates expanded offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, incentives and research to transition cars to alternative fuels, and a number of conservation and energy efficiency proposals. To pay for the incentives, the act would roll back about $30-billion in tax deductions that oil and gas companies currently receive, among other things.
 
The group of senators supporting the initiative calls itself the ""Gang of 10,"" hearkening back to the ""Gang of 14,"" a group of senators (including McCain) that came together in 2005 to prevent filibusters of federal judicial nominees.
 
As proposed, the Gang of 10's measure includes things that both candidates don't like. Obama has said no to oil drilling, while McCain has opposed additional taxes.
 
The day the proposal was unveiled, Obama said he was willing to consider drilling if the plan included enough other measures for energy independence.
 
""If it is part of an overarching package then I am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem,"" Obama told the

St. Petersburg Times

. (We ruled this change of position a

Half Flip on the Flip-o-Meter

.)
 
Meanwhile, an unnamed spokesman for McCain told the

Wall Street Journal

that while McCain ""applauds the bipartisan effort,"" he wouldn't support the proposal because ""he cannot and will not support legislation that raises taxes.""
 
The next week, Obama's campaign announced it would send supporters to Florida gas stations to promote Obama's energy policies and knock McCain's.
 
""Supporters will also highlight Sen. John McCain's failure to do anything to address the energy crisis during his 26 years in Washington,"" the campaign said in a statement. ""McCain has consistently chosen profits for the oil companies over energy relief for American families, including voting against fuel mileage standards, opposing renewable sources of energy, and refusing to back the bipartisan energy compromise in the Senate because it would take away tax breaks from oil companies like Exxon Mobil.""
 
We wanted to know if McCain was opposing the bill and if it was because of rescinded tax breaks for oil companies. One unattributed statement in the

Wall Street Journal

seemed like not much evidence on which to hang such a charge.
 
For all the prepared statements the McCain campaign has put out on energy policy — we've got dozens — we couldn't find one that specifically addressed the new proposal. So we asked Brian Rogers, a campaign spokesman, about it. Rogers said McCain is opposed to tax increases, and would not support legislation that included tax increases. But he also said that the Gang of 10 has yet to present a draft of the legislation, and that McCain ""would certainly look at any legislation.""
 
""He hasn't taken a position on it, because there's no specific legislation,"" Rogers said. Rogers also pointed us to an Aug. 6 article from the

Shreveport Times

in which spokesman Tucker Bounds made similar statements that McCain was essentially uncommitted on the legislation.
 
The Senate is in recess as we reported this statement. But the Gang of 10 hopes to have a proposal finalized when the Senate returns in September, said a spokesman for Sen. Kent Conrad, D-S.D., a member of the group.
 
The other senators include Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga.; John Thune, R-S.D.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.; Mary Landrieu, D-La.; Johnny Isakson, R-Ga.; Bob Corker, R-Tenn.; Mark Pryor, D-Ark.; and Ben Nelson, D-Neb.
 
It will be interesting to see what happens in September, but for now, the statement from the Obama campaign pushes McCain's position too far. It's true that McCain's campaign said he won't support the legislation if it includes tax increases, but technically speaking, McCain has not taken a position on the new measure and he has not ""refused to support it.""
 
McCain may well end up opposing this legislation if his antitax sentiment wins out over his desire to expand offshore drilling. But at the time the Obama campaign made its statement, it wasn't an accurate summary of McCain's position. We rule the statement False.

Right, but tax cuts were a major factor, too
","Faced with new projections showing a $482-billion federal budget deficit for 2009, Sen. John McCain tried to pin the blame on spending increases.
 
""It wasn't taxes, it was spending. We presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society and we mortgaged our children's futures, to the great disgrace of the Republican Party. We let earmarking and corrupt spending get to the point where we mortgaged our kids' futures,"" he said on CNN's

Larry King Live.

 
McCain is right when he argues that higher government spending caused most of the current gap between what the government collects and what it spends, according to an analysis of Congressional Budget Office data. But it's the federal budget, so it's not quite that simple.
 
In January 2001, CBO, the official scorekeepers of such things, projected government surpluses far into the future: $573-billion in 2007, $635-billion in 2008 and $710-billion in 2009.
 
Things didn't turn out so rosy. Earlier this year, CBO broke out the factors that have contributed to the transformation from surplus to deficit. For fiscal year 2007, almost all of the $735-billion change was due to ""legislative"" factors, and just $12-billion was due to economic and technical factors. In other words, Congress did it.
 
But measuring how much of the legislative changes were due to taxes and how much were due to spending is trickier. When the government spends more than it takes in, it borrows the remainder, and the interest charges are due in subsequent years. CBO doesn't parcel out the interest costs to the tax and spending sides of the budget, but the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities does.
 
Their nitty-gritty calculation requires the quadratic equation, but the bottom line is McCain is right. For fiscal year 2007, 58 percent of the legislatively caused deterioration came from spending and 42 percent came from tax cuts. This year, taxes make up 52 percent of the change, because of those tax-rebate checks. But that's a temporary blip. In 2009, according to the projections, tax cuts' share of the blame will drop to 44 percent while spending's portion will rise to 56 percent.
 
One other note: all spending isn't equal. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis found that most of the spending increase didn't come from the earmarks or domestic programs that McCain complains about. It was defense and homeland security.
 
Until the rebates temporarily changed the equation, spending increases did cause the majority of the deficit. But tax cuts aren't blameless, either. We find McCain's claim to be Mostly True.

Make that at least $2-million
","
Sen. Barack Obama's campaign has a new

television advertisement

called ""Pocket,"" as in Sen. John McCain's in one, and it belongs to Big Oil.
 
""Every time you fill your tank, the oil companies fill their pockets,"" the announcer says. ""Now big oil's filling John McCain's campaign with $2-million in contributions. Because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers, McCain wants to give them another $4-billion in tax breaks.

new ad by the Democratic National Committee

makes a similar claim, alleging: ""[The] oil industry contributes $2-million to McCain campaign.""
 
First, we should note that corporations, oil and otherwise, are prohibited by law from contributing to political campaigns. There are ways around that, including having executives and employees donate in their own names. But saying ""big oil's filling John McCain's campaign"" is a somewhat misleading shorthand.
 
But it would be telling if oil executives and employees gave a couple million to McCain. So let's see about that number.
 
Individuals involved in the oil and gas industries have given about $1.3-million to McCain's presidential campaign, according to the latest federal data compiled and released

here

by the Center for Responsive Politics on July 28. That includes not just multinational and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, but also natural gas pipeline companies, gasoline service stations and fuel oil dealers. Perhaps it's a bit unfair to lump all of them into the category ""big oil.""
 
But more importantly, that's not $2-million. It's also not the whole story, though. McCain's campaign also set up a

joint fundraising committee

with the Republican National Committee and several state affiliates. Our friends at

FactCheck.org have decided

contributions to that committee shouldn't count as contributions to ""McCain's campaign,"" as the ad puts it.
 
We disagree. The joint fundraising committee is called

McCain Victory 2008

. The McCain campaign receives the first $2,300 of each contribution to the joint committee. The RNC gets most of the rest, but it can be hard to distinguish a presidential campaign from the national party anyway.
 
Nonpartisan campaign finance experts at both the Center for Responsive Politics and Campaign Money Watch told us it was reasonable to count contributions to McCain Victory 2008 as contributions to McCain's campaign.
 
""What else would a donor expect when they're giving to the McCain Victory 2008 fund?"" said David Donnelly, director of Campaign Money Watch.
 
So the question is, do contributions from oil and gas executives or employees to McCain Victory 2008, when added to the $1.3-million that went directly to McCain's campaign, top $2-million?
 
The answer is yes, easily.
 
McCain Victory 2008 has reported

7,825 contributions

to the Federal Election Commission. We didn't go through all of them, but we did, with Donnelly's help, look at 40 of the largest contributions from individuals whose employers or occupations are obviously oil-related.
 
We picked only the low-hanging fruit. For example, we counted a $50,000 contribution that Gary Chouest, president of the oil vessel service company Edison Chouest Offshore, made on June 17, 2008, but not a contribution for the same amount that Carolyn Chouest, a homemaker and presumably Gary's wife, made the same day.
 
The total for just those 40 large contributions was $1.04-million.
 
Up to $2,300 from each contribution might already have been counted in the $1.3-million total, since the campaign itself has to report contributions that come to it through the joint committee. So to avoid double-counting, we subtracted $92,000 ($2,300 x 40) from the total, and got $948,000.
 
Combined with the $1.3-million that went to the campaign, that's easily enough to push McCain over $2-million in oil contributions.
 
It's worth pointing out that Obama, too, has accepted at least hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil industry executives and employees, as we note

here

, and the Center for Responsive Politics points out more recently

here

.
 
But we're focusing on the claim that big oil gave McCain's campaign $2-million. It's not unequivocally true, because the phrasing implies that the big oil corporations themselves were the givers, when it was actually their executives and employees, not to mention those of smaller natural gas companies. But energy industry players clearly have given McCain well over $2-million, so we find the claim Mostly True.

Not overinflated (though it sounds like it)
","

UPDATED.


This item has been updated, but our ruling didn't change. See below.

 
Sen. Barack Obama injected a startling claim into the debate on energy, asserting in a Missouri town hall meeting that the country could save more gas from inflating its tires and tuning up its cars than would be gained from drilling more off its coasts.
 
""There are things that you can do individually, though, to save energy,"" Obama said in the July 30, 2008, appearance. ""Making sure your tires are properly inflated — simple thing. But we could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling, if everybody was just inflating their tires, and getting regular tune-ups. You could actually save just as much.""
 
Sen. John McCain and his allies — who advocate lifting the federal moratorium that bans drilling in some areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off the U.S. coasts — immediately mocked Obama for the claim. The McCain campaign even offered to send ""Obama Energy Plan"" tire gauges to anyone who sent in a donation of $25 or more.
 
The McCain campaign's assumption seemed to be that Obama's claim was utterly implausible. And, we admit, it kind of sounds that way. But is it?
 
Under-inflated tires — to say nothing of poorly tuned cars — are actually a serious problem, as government agencies, industry groups, conservationists and outside experts have been saying for years. (The Obama campaign even cited a number of instances when prominent McCain supporters echoed the call for more public awareness about tire inflation.)
 
""A lot of people are driving around on severely under-inflated tires,"" said Robert Sinclair, Jr., a spokesman for the American Automobile Association. ""Try riding a bicycle with under-inflated tires. It's hard for the human engine to push it ahead. Pump it up, it seems like you're gliding on air.""
 
The same thing happens with a car. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by .4 percent for every 1 pounds-per-square-inch drop in tire pressure, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
 
The best estimate available, by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is that at least a quarter of drivers are cruising around on under-inflated tires. In April, the Rubber Manufacturers Association, the Auto Club, the California Highway Patrol and Yokohama Tire Company used those statistics, along with Department of Transportation and Automobile Association of America data, to extrapolate that 2.8-billion gallons of gas are lost every year due to under-inflation of tires.
 
That's an estimate, to be sure, and not one from a published, peer-reviewed study. But remember, Obama said we ""could"" save all the oil available from offshore drilling in the protected areas — not we ""would"" — so if the claim is merely plausible he's on solid ground.
 
So how much oil is available offshore? According to the latest assessment from the Minerals Management Service, the mean estimate of undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil in the Outer Continental Shelf areas that are currently under moratorium is about 18-billion barrels (see

here

.)
 
But it couldn't all be extracted immediately. The agency estimates that if the moratorium were lifted production could start by 2017, and by 2030, oil companies could be producing 2.4-million barrels of oil instead of 2.2-million. That's 200,000 more barrels per day.
 
After refining, a barrel of oil can produce up to 19.5 gallons of gasoline, according to the

U.S. Department of Energy.

So that's 3.9-million more gallons of gasoline per day, or 1.4-billion gallons of gasoline per year.
 
And remember, an estimated 2.8-billion gallons of gas are lost annually due to under-inflated tires.
 
And we didn't even talk about tune-ups. (Repairing a car that is noticeably out of tune or has failed an emissions test improves gas mileage by 4 percent on average, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Fixing a more serious problem, such as a bad oxygen sensor, can improve mileage by up to 40 percent, the agency says.)
 
All of the numbers in this analysis are estimates, we should emphasize. Oil industry experts told us estimates of the amount of oil offshore and how fast it could be extracted vary widely, and the Energy Information Administration's number is fairly optimistic. Likewise, it's highly unlikely any public awareness effort could change behavior enough to save 2.8-billion gallons of gasoline per day.
 
For these reasons, we ruled this claim to be True.
 

Update:

After we published this item, McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb called to dispute it, citing a Government Accountability Office letter of Feb. 9, 2007 that says tire inflation wastes 1.2 billion gallons of gasoline instead of the 2.8 billion estimate we used.
 
The

letter

says: ""The Department of Energy's designated economist on this issue indicated that, of the 130 billion gallons of fuel that the Transportation Research Board estimated were used in passenger cars and light trucks in 2005, about 1.2 billion gallons were wasted as a result of driving on under-inflated tires.""
 
That estimate falls just under the estimated 1.4 billion gallons a year from increased offshore drilling.
 
But that doesn't persuade us to change our ruling, for three reasons. First, 1.2 billion gallons in possible savings from proper tire inflation is still in the ballpark of the 1.4 billion gallons from drilling. Given that all of these numbers are estimates, it's hard to say the difference between these two numbers constitutes a falsehood.
 
Second, it would take years of work to start producing 1.4 billion gallons of gasoline from oil pumped offshore -- the Energy Information Administration estimate contemplates production beginning in 2017. And the oil reserves would not be bottomless. Conceivably, the savings from tire-pressure correction could begin immediately and last indefinitely, thus easily overcoming the marginal difference in the estimates provided by the McCain campaign.
 
And finally, none of this takes into account the impact of tune-ups, which Obama mentioned as part of his claim. If Department of Energy estimates of 4 percent mileage improvement for better-tuned cars are true, that alone would push the total savings above the estimated drilling yield.
 
Goldfarb also pointed out that barrels of oil, in addition to yielding 19.5 gallons of gasoline, yield other products as well, such as jet fuel, lubricants and feed stocks. Point taken, but Obama's statement was made within the context of the current drilling debate, which has been about increasing the supply of domestic oil to ease the strain on the U.S. transportation sector.
 
In the end, estimates are all we have to work with here. Estimates of oil production, estimates of gasoline savings. For our purposes in evaluating Obama's claim, all the available evidence shows that he's on solid ground in saying that better car and tire maintenance would save as much gasoline as drilling would generate. We appreciate McCain's campaign pointing out a GAO source we'd missed in our original research, but it's not at odds with our original ruling, True.

Emergency now, but not then?
","Sen. Barack Obama's new energy plan released on Aug. 4, 2008, includes a curious short-term attempt to relieve high gas prices by tapping into the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
 
It's curious because a month ago Obama balked at just such a proposal.
 
""I do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point,"" Obama said in a news conference in St. Louis on July 7. ""The strategic oil reserve, I think, has to be reserved for a genuine emergency. You have a situation, let's say, where there was a major oil facility in Saudi Arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts, and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market. We wouldn't just be seeing $4-a-gallon oil. We could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all. And that's what the strategic oil reserve has to be for.""
 
The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in response to the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-74. According to the Department of Energy Web site, the SPR's stockpile of 707-million barrels of oil — kept in subterranean caverns in Texas and Louisiana — ""provides the president with a powerful response option should a disruption in commercial oil supplies threaten the U.S. economy."" It was last tapped after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
 
In his ""New Energy for America"" speech at Michigan State University on Aug. 4, Obama talked at length about his long-term plan to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, but as one of his short-term solutions, he said, ""We should sell 70-million barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve for less expensive crude, which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks.""
 
In the eight-page written platform that accompanied his speech, the plan is described as ""releasing light oil from the SPR now and replacing it later with heavier crude more suited to our long-term needs.""
 
""This is similar to the approach that President Clinton and Secretary Richardson took in 2000, when their swap helped bring down the price of oil by 18.7 percent,"" said Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor. ""It is distinct from a straight sale of oil from the SPR, which is limited under current law to a 5-million barrel test sale and emergency or 'anticipatory' emergency instances of supply disruption.""
 
Vietor told PolitiFact that Obama's belief has always been ""that the president should retain his discretionary authority to conduct exchanges or swaps from the SPR as warranted by circumstances.""
 
So what are those circumstances? According to the campaign, ""Barack Obama believes the doubling of oil prices in the past year is a crisis for millions of Americans and the transfer of wealth to oil producing countries, many of them hostile to our interests, is a threat to our national security.""
 
The McCain campaign quickly accused Obama of election-year pandering, saying nothing had changed since Obama rejected the idea a month earlier.
 
Indeed, the McCain campaign is correct that there is a hole in Obama's logic that gas prices have recently caused such an emergency. The price of gas was actually substantially higher on July 7 when Obama dismissed the idea of tapping the reserve. Then, the national average for a gallon of gas was $4.108, less than a penny off the all-time high of $4.114 on July 14.
 
Back on July 7, Obama set the bar at ""genuine emergency,"" and then cited an example of a catastrophic disruption in supply. Obama is now describing the high price of gas as a crisis and a threat to national security. But we fail to see how that's any different than was the case a month ago — when the price of gas was 24 cents a gallon higher — when Obama dismissed it.
 
We rate Obama's proposal a Full Flop.

More compromise than change of heart
","For months, Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain have jousted over the issue of offshore oil drilling. It's an issue that provides clear contrast between the two candidates, with McCain pushing for more offshore drilling and Obama in steadfast opposition. So when Obama said on Aug. 1 that he was open to supporting the New Energy Reform Act of 2008, it signaled a clear shift. The bipartisan compromise bill calls for spending $84-billion over 10 years on research and development of better batteries, fuels and energy-saving technologies and includes tax incentives for people who buy hybrid and alternative-fuel cars and trucks. But it also would allow drilling for oil and natural gas as close as 50 miles from Florida's west coast. In Chicago in June, Obama was unequivocal about his opposition to offshore drilling off Florida's coast. ""And when I am president, I will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off Florida's coasts,"" Obama said. ""That's how we can protect our coasts and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good."" Obama said then that McCain's proposal to lift a moratorium on offshore drilling ""will only worsen our addiction to oil and put off needed investments in clean, renewable energy."" For months, Obama lambasted McCain's calls for opening up new areas off the U.S. coastline to offshore drilling. ""It's a proposal that George Bush's administration says will not provide a drop of oil — not a single drop — for at least 10 years,"" Obama said in a speech in Las Vegas on June 24. ""And by the time the drilling is fully underway in 20 years, our own Department of Energy says that the effect on gas prices will be 'insignificant.' Insignificant."" Instead, Obama repeatedly implored oil companies to drill on 68-million acres of land and offshore areas that they have not yet touched. In a July 11 energy speech in Dayton, Ohio, Obama said, ""If there were real evidence that these steps (lifting moratoriums on offshore drilling) would actually provide real, immediate relief at the pump and advance the long-term goal of energy independence, of course I'd be open to them. But so far there isn't."" So how does Obama now justify throwing tentative support behind an energy plan that would allow offshore drilling within 50 miles of the Florida coast? On Aug. 1, Obama issued this statement: ""For too long, partisan gridlock and special interest influence has blocked progress on some of the most urgent challenges facing the American people, and that is especially true when it comes to our energy crisis. That is why I welcome today's bipartisan effort as an important step in the process of reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, and why I look forward to September's bipartisan energy summit. ""Today's announcement includes many of the policies I've been fighting for during my time in the Senate and over the course of this campaign. It would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel-efficient cars, help our automakers retool, and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power, solar power, and the next generation of clean, affordable biofuels. ""Like all compromises, it also includes steps that I haven't always supported. I remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short-term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long-term, though I do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact. ""But I've always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis, and today's package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning."" Asked by reporters in Florida on Aug. 2 whether his support for the plan was a flip-flop, Obama said he remained highly skeptical about drilling off Florida's coast but that big steps toward energy independence may require compromise. ""What I don't want is for the best to be the enemy of the good,"" Obama said. ""If we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise, in which I have to accept some things I don't like and the Democrats have to accept some things they don't like, when it's actually moving us in the direction of energy independence, I'm open to that. ""What I will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems."" Obama also stressed that he will wait to see the final energy bill proposal before embracing it. Obama's change is that he insisted that as president he would protect Florida's coast from offshore drilling, and now he's open to it as part of the bipartisan compromise energy plan. Obama hasn't sounded like someone who has changed his mind on the issue, so much as someone willing to consider swallowing some offshore drilling as a compromise to get other energy initiatives he really wants. We also note that Obama has not formally endorsed the bipartisan proposal. We reserve the right to revisit Obama's stance on the issue when or if the plan comes up for a vote, but for now, we rule it a Half Flip.","[('Obama campaign Web site,  ""Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: A Serious Energy Policy for Our Future""  in Las Vegas, June 24, 2008', 'http://www.barackobama.com/2008/06/24/remarks_of_senator_barack_obam_81.php'), ('Obama campaign Web site,  ""Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: A Secure Energy Future""  in Dayton, Ohio, July 11, 2008', 'No link'), ('Obama campaign Web site,  ""Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Town Hall on Energy""  in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, July 31, 2008', 'http://www.barackobama.com/2008/07/11/remarks_of_senator_barack_obam_90.php'), ('Obama campaign Web site,  ""Obama Statement on Bipartisan Energy Plan""  Aug. 1, 2008', 'No link'), ('ABC News,  ""Obama Attempts to Explain Shift on Offshore Drilling""  Aug. 2, 2008', 'http://www.barackobama.com/2008/07/31/remarks_of_senator_barack_obam_99.php'), ('St. Petersburg Times,  ""Obama may be shifting toward backing oil drilling off Florida""  by Wes Allison and Adam Smith, Aug. 2, 2008', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2008/aug/05/barack-obama/more-compromise-than-change-of-heart/

Larger estates will be taxed, just like now
","A chain e-mail claims that Sen. Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false.
 
Here, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about McCain and the estate tax, which it refers to as the inheritance tax. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read

our full article here

.
 
The e-mail claims that President George W. Bush ""repealed"" the estate tax, and it now stands at 0 percent. Though Bush reduced the tax, he did not repeal it. Rather, under his 2001 tax cut package, the estate tax reduces every year and then goes away for just a single year — 2010 — before reverting back to higher rates. (See the nonpartisan

Tax Policy Center on estate taxes

for more details.)
 
Currently, the estate tax generally applies only to estates worth more than $2-million (or $4-million for couples). Above those amounts, the tax rate tops out at 45 percent. Both Obama and McCain support renewing the current estate tax with a few changes. McCain proposes to increase the exemption to $5-million ($10-million for couples) and reduce the tax rate to 15 percent. Obama proposes to increase the exemption to $3.5-million ($7-million for couples) and leave the top rate at 45 percent.
 
Although the e-mail captures the broad idea that McCain wants to reduce estate taxes more than Obama, it is wrong when it says McCain wants a ""0 percent"" estate tax, and it's also wrong that the estate tax is at zero percent now. We rate this statement False.

National Democrats, criticizing Rick Perry, say Texas college tuition up 55 percent since 2003
","Democrats criticized Rick Perry for college costs the day the Republican governor gave his valedictory speech to Texas lawmakers. Among the beefs in a Jan. 15, 2015, email blast from the Democratic National Committee: ""College tuition rates in Texas jumped by 55% since 2003, putting the dream of earning a college degree further out of reach for many Texans."" That year should ring a bell; it’s when Perry and the Republican-controlled Legislature agreed to deregulate public college tuition, handing control to appointed college and university governing boards. Committee's source We wondered how much tuition ultimately escalated. By email, Miryam Lipper, a committee spokeswoman, pointed out a September 2012 news story in the Dallas Morning News that said by the paper’s analysis, ""Texas students are paying 55 percent more for tuition and fees at state universities a decade after lawmakers lifted restrictions on costs."" The story also said: ""State officials used to brag about the affordability of college, but the costs have ballooned since 2003, even when inflation is factored in."" Updated data Seeking up-to-date information, we reached out to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, where a staff spokeswoman, Kelly Carper Polden, pointed out a February 2014 board document she described as the most recent publicly available report on Texas tuition and fees. The document said, in part: ""From fall 2003 through fall 2013, the statewide average total academic charges for a student taking 15 SCHs at a public university has increased by 104 percent."" An SCH is a semester credit-hour. According to the document, the board’s calculations were rooted in tuition and fees charged students. Then again, the board said, a ""student's actual charges may vary based on the student's classification and level of enrollment, the college the student attends within the university, the student's specific personal circumstances, or for other reasons deemed appropriate by the institution."" Charts in the board analysis indicate the tuition and fees each year from fall 2003 through fall 2013 for nearly 40 institutions, most of them in the University of Texas or Texas A&M University systems. On average in fall 2003, tuition and fees were $1,934 for 15 semester credit-hours, according to the report. The average in fall 2013 was $3,951, the board said. By phone, Polden confirmed the board’s results didn’t take inflation into account. So we employed a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator to estimate that tuition and fees at the state’s public colleges and universities escalated 61 percent, in real terms, from fall 2003 through fall 2013. But that didn’t bring us to the 2014-15 school year. So we asked for comparable charges on average for a student as of fall 2014. By email, Polden said the fall 2014 statewide average for someone taking 15 SCHs was $4,091, lifting the raw average tuition increase since fall 2003 to 112 percent. Adjusted for inflation, we calculated, the increase was 64 percent. UT Austin Separately, we asked the University of Texas at Austin for its fall 2014 charge for that many credit hours. Spokesman Gary Susswein emailed the amount, $4,905, which we compared with the fall 2003 charge for that university of $2,721. Adjusted for inflation, the hike over the years came out to 40 percent. Out of governor's control? Worth mention: After signing tuition deregulation into law, Perry subsequently had no sway over tuition hikes except to appoint higher education governing boards. In recent years too, Perry called for $10,000, four-year degree programs and for institutions to freeze tuition so an entering student would pay the same tab each year while earning a degree. Our ruling The Democratic group, zeroing in on Perry, said Texas college tuition rates increased 55 percent since 2003. That figure is outdated--the increase through fall 2014 was 64 percent--and it's also worth clarifying the governor didn't directly control tuition, though he approved of the 2003 law deregulating rates and appointed ruling public college and university governing boards.

Scott Walker: Records show Soviets treated Ronald Reagan more seriously after he fired controllers
","As momentum builds for a possible 2016 presidential run, Gov. Scott Walker has spent more time speaking on foreign policy. One of his talking points: Leadership trumps experience when it comes to managing affairs overseas. Look at Ronald Reagan.   That was Walker’s response Jan. 21, 2015 when he was asked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" about the importance of foreign policy experience. First, the governor criticized the secretary of state record of Hillary Clinton, the leading potential Democratic candidate for 2016. Then he turned to Reagan, one of his political heroes, and one of the Republican president’s early acts in office -- the mass firing of most of the nation’s air traffic controllers. In August 1981, after contract talks between the federal government and the union for the controllers stalled, nearly 13,000 controllers walked off the job. Just seven months into his first term, Reagan called the strike illegal and demanded they return to work. When more than 11,000 didn't, Reagan fired them in what was an unprecedented action. In his MSNBC interview, Walker asserted that the move was one of the most important foreign policy decisions ""made in our lifetime,"" showing allies and adversaries around the world ""that we were serious."" Then he added this: ""Years later, documents released from the Soviet Union showed that that exactly was the case. The Soviet Union started treating (Reagan) more seriously once he did something like that. Ideas have to have consequences. And I think (President Barack Obama) has failed mainly because he's made threats and hasn't followed through on them."" So, Walker goes beyond stating an opinion about the foreign policy implications of Reagan’s move. He states as fact that there are Soviet documents showing the Soviets treated the Reagan more seriously because he fired American air traffic controllers. That’s a bold claim. Walker's evidence When we asked for evidence to back the claim, both the governor's office and Walker's campaign cited statements from a variety of people. Each essentially said the firings showed Reagan meant what he said, and that he was to be taken seriously. Some examples: Reagan special assistant Peggy Noonan wrote in her White House memoir that George Shultz, who became Reagan's secretary state a year after the firings, had called the firings the most important foreign policy decision Reagan ever made. Joseph McCartin, the author of a book on the strike, wrote that when House Speaker Tip O’Neill, a Democrat, visited Moscow not long after the strike, ""he learned that the Soviet leaders had been deeply impressed by Reagan’s actions."" And Reagan biographer Edmund Morris wrote: ""Former Soviet apparatchiks will tell you that it was not his famous 'evil empire' speech in 1983 that convinced them he meant strategic business, so much as photographs of the leader of the air traffic controllers union being taken to jail in 1981."" Those are perceptions of Americans, however. Walker's claim was the Soviets treated Reagan more seriously after he fired the controllers, and that Soviet documents prove it.   But he did not provide us anything referencing Soviet documents. And apparently there are no such documents that have been made public. Experts Five experts told us they had never heard of such documents. Several were incredulous at the notion. McCartin, a Georgetown University labor history expert who wrote the book about the strike that Walker cited, said: ""I am not aware of any such documents.  If they did exist, I would love to see them."" Svetlana Savranskaya, director of Russia programs at the National Security Archive at George Washington University, told us she ""had to listen to the Walker interview twice, so ridiculous is the statement about the air traffic controllers. There is absolutely no evidence of this. I would love to see the released Soviet documents on this subject that he has apparently seen."" James Graham Wilson, a historian at the U.S. State Department, also told us he was not aware of any Soviet documents showing Moscow’s internal response to the controller firings. He speculated that there could be such records, given how some Soviet experts characterized the firings. Wilson and other authors have noted the perspective of Richard Pipes, professor emeritus of Russian studies at Harvard University. Pipes said the firings showed the Soviets that Reagan was ""a man who, when aroused, will go to the limit to back up his principles."" But even as the firings gained the attention of the Soviets, there were other U.S.-Soviet matters during 1981 that were also important. With his first budget, Reagan added $26 billion in defense spending, accelerating the placement of new tanks and warplanes, and he embarked on a modernization of the nation’s nuclear weapons. Reagan also wrote to Soviet leaders imploring them to alleviate Cold War tensions and negotiate arms reductions.    In any case, the lack of Soviet records described by Walker is clear. Reagan's own ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, told us: ""It's utter nonsense. There is no evidence of that whatever."" Matlock questioned whether Soviet leaders even paid much attention to the firings, saying: ""At that point, their big question was whether (Reagan) was going to attack them."" Our rating Touching on foreign policy issues, Walker said: ""Documents released from the Soviet Union"" show ""the Soviet Union started treating"" Ronald Reagan more seriously after Reagan fired the air traffic controllers. There is a view, echoed by Walker, that the firings caught the Soviets’ attention. But Walker cited no Soviet documents showing that the firings made the Soviets treat Reagan more seriously. And experts, several of whom felt Walker’s claim is outrageous, told us they are not aware that any such documents exist. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

MARTA official correct about commuters' limited options
","One day before a pedestrian death last Thursday triggered a massive traffic jam that made thousands of Atlanta workers late for work, the head of MARTA posted a provocative Tweet. MARTA General Manager Keith Parker wrote, ""18 percent of jobs are accessible by transit for metro Atlanta residents, 33 percent for those living in the city."" The statement came with the hashtag OpportunityATL, days after yet another major business, Mercedes-Benz USA, announced a corporate relocation that puts it next to both highways and MARTA rail. Is there something to the claim that stretches beyond the miles of snarled traffic on four highways last week? We decided to check it out. First, as the hashtag indicates, the statement did not come out of the ether. Parker posted the figures as he live-Tweeted presentations at a forum sponsored by the Atlanta Regional Commission and St. Vincent de Paul Society. Author Rebecca Burns was the keynote at the Building Opportunity event focused on poverty and transportation. She cited The Brookings Institution for those statistics on a slide during her presentation. To find out if those stats are accurate, we reached out to Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program. That’s the unit that conducts research for cities and their surrounding suburbs and exurbs. A 2011 report, ""Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America,"" found that the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta metro area was among the worst in the nation for residents trying to reach work via transit. The study, the most recent available, looked at how many people can reach work in 90 minutes between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. on a Monday morning. Typical residents in the nation’s largest 100 metro areas can reach about 30 percent of jobs by transit in 90 minutes, the study found. In Atlanta, the transit systems studied included MARTA, Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) and regional bus services in Cobb and Gwinnett counties. Yet workers here can reach just 22 percent of jobs that way. That ranked Atlanta 91st out of the 100 largest metro areas studied. The numbers are, as Parker’s Tweet suggested, even worse for the region’s suburbanites. The study found that 33 percent of the region’s jobs are accessible for city residents by public transportation and just 17 percent for suburbanites. ""In some ways, it’s not surprising, given the age the cities developed in,"" said Adie Tomer, a research fellow at Brookings who co-authored the study. ""Atlanta was really built in the era of the car, and so it’s built out in a suburban style."" So the numbers are pretty on target and somewhat expected.  More than the exact numbers, though, is the overarching point. Tomer said cities with more transit access are effectively providing more options for workers. They can drive to work, ride a train, ride a bike, or even walk. Meanwhile, the traffic jam last week showed the ""virus"" effect a back-up can have on highways as well as surface streets when those options are limited. That ripple effect is prompting more suburban counties to gear up for serious talks about transportation options and has even put ""public transit"" in the mix of the state Legislature’s debate this year about transportation improvements. The challenges are clear. An exclusive Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll recently found that almost 70 percent of Georgians support new bus and rail lines. But only 36 percent said they’d pay higher taxes to pay for transportation improvements. Yet the benefits are just as clear. Mercedes-Benz USA’s CEO recently cited easy access for workers as a factor in its planned to move to Sandy Springs – suburban but adjacent to rail lines. Other major firms, from State Farm to PulteGroup, have made similar statements about their relocations. MARTA and other public transit projects have likewise had a run of good headlines. Clayton County residents voted in November for their county become the third to join MARTA – the first in 40 years. The Atlanta Streetcar's launch in December, the first expansion of a new rail line in years, drew attention nationally. To that end, Parker said he posted that Tweet because the statistics startled him. Looking at them another way, at least six out of every 10 metro workers lacks access by public transportation to jobs. Like Tomer, Parker hopes the existing collaboration between MARTA and bus lines in outlying counties will be seen by policy makers as an option - one to further investigate and expand. ""We want people to look at us as a real alternative to get them to work, to school, to recreation,"" Parker said. ""You can know with a sense of certainty that 95 percent of the time we are on time with train service. I dare say we don’t have that level of certainty on the highway system right now. We want people to see this is a viable option."" So as state and local leaders hash out ideas to discuss those options, can they count on the statistics reflecting workers’ access to jobs by public transit today? Parker posted a Tweet from a forum, claiming 33 percent of people in the city and 18 percent elsewhere have that access. An independent analysis confirmed the point, if not the precise number for suburbanites. We rate the claim True.  ","[('Keith Parker, general manager/CEO of MARTA, post to Twitter, Jan. 21, 2015', 'https://twitter.com/CEOMARTA'), ('The Brookings Institution, ""Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America,"" May 12, 2011', 'No link'), ('The Brookings Institution, ""Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America,"" Atlanta-area data, May 12, 2011', 'https://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2011/05/12-jobs-and-transit'), ('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""MARTA a sudden factor in company moves,"" Jan. 16, 2015', 'No link'), ('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""AJC poll: Georgians back transit, but say no to tax hike to pay for it,"" Jan. 10, 2015', 'https://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Series/jobs%20and%20transit/AtlantaGA.PDF'), ('Interview, Keith Parker, general manager/CEO of MARTA, Jan. 23, 2015', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Adie Tomer, fellow at Metropolitan Policy Program at The Brookings Institution, Jan. 23, 2015', 'https://www.ajc.com/news/business/marta-a-sudden-factor-in-company-moves/njpnF/'), ('Phone interview with Jim Jaquish, spokesman for Atlanta Regional Commission, Jan. 26, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/28/keith-parker/marta-official-correct-about-commuters-limited-opt/

Barack Obama says America 'is stopping' Islamic State's progress in Iraq and Syria
","President Barack Obama briefly updated Americans on the state of the Islamic State during his State of the Union address. ""In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping (the Islamic State’s) advance,"" Obama said. ""Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group."" The comment came during a string of examples of his administration engaging the Middle East — militarily and diplomatically — without the need for large-scale troops. But is his claim that U.S. airstrikes have improved the situation in Syria and Iraq, where the Islamic State wreaked havoc last summer, accurate? We decided to take a look. Iraq vs. Syria There are two elements we will look at: Whether the situation has improved in the two countries, and whether it’s the result of U.S. intervention. First, what’s going on in Iraq and Syria? There’s general agreement among experts that the Islamic State’s movement in Iraq has been halted and, in some cases, reversed since Aug. 8, when the first airstrikes launched. For example, their march toward Baghdad has stopped short of the city, and they’ve been pushed out of the Mosul Dam, a critical victory for the United States in the early days of its military intervention. However, Syria is a different story. The key to Obama’s language is he said the U.S. ""is stopping."" That suggests an ongoing process that’s not complete. And in Syria, it isn’t. ""It’s fluid,"" Defense Department spokesman Carl Woog told PolitiFact. ""It is possible that (the Islamic State) has taken certain areas of the map in Syria (since airstrikes began). I think that is plausible and likely in some cases, but it’s not the case everywhere. This is a large area."" There are disputes over how much area Syria has won, if any, since the airstrikes began. A map published by the Wall Street Journal shows considerable gains by the Islamic State compared to another map of their movements from Aug. 31. However, the airstrikes on Syria did not begin until Sept. 24, so it’s possible that ground was gained before U.S. intervention there, and the source is partially credited to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, an organization of Syrian rebel forces that have called for more U.S. action. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy, said based on his own analysis of the Islamic State’s movements, any gains in Syria have been offset by losses in other regions. For example, the United States has heavily bombed the city of Kobani, a Kurdish stronghold in northern Syria near the Turkish border. In fact, according to an analysis of Pentagon daily briefings by longtime Middle East reporter Robin Wright, 78 percent of all U.S. airstrikes in Syria have come on Kobani. Despite repeated efforts by the Islamic State to overtake the city, the United States through the air and Kurdish fighters on the ground have beaten back those attempts. Reports from Jan. 26, after Obama’s speech, indicate Kurdish fighters have pushed the Islamic State almost entirely out of Kobani. In some ways it makes sense that Syria is a murkier situation. For one, U.S. airstrikes there started a month and a half after the first American bombs dropped in Iraq. The U.S. military has openly admitted it has an ""Iraq first"" strategy, aimed at eliminating the Islamic State in Iraq, while shaping their movements in Syria and training vetted moderate forces there. Iraq is also more familiar territory for the United States, after a decade of fighting there. And it has a government that is cooperating with the United States and supplying forces to fight. The same cannot be said for Syria, which is embroiled in a civil war between President Bashar al-Assad (Obama has called for him to step down) and rebel groups. Additionally, while the Islamic State may be partially halted in Syria, other extremist groups in the region have ""gone on a rampage,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. The bottom line, said Wright, now a joint fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center, is ""we’ve contained (the Islamic State) in terms of stopping their sweep. They’re paying an enormous price and their supply lines have clearly been disrupted. But four and a half months in, (the Islamic State) is still there and has taken over huge chunks of both Iraq and Syria. ""So (Obama’s characterization) is partly true and partly not true,"" she added. ""But this was never gonna happen overnight."" With or without the U.S. How much credit should the United States get for stopping the Islamic State? Experts said U.S. intervention has been key. It has disrupted supply lines, directly killed many fighters, and delivered supplies to Kurdish forces. The terrorist group’s strong march relied on acting as a conventional military force, using humvees and artillery to move across the region. The constant threat of airstrikes has forced them to change strategies. The Islamic State’s stall is also a result of many other influences in the region, many of which have come from the ground while the United States remains entirely airborne. In Syria, for example, as the United States has focused on Kobani, Assad’s forces have prevented the Islamic State from taking over the major metropolitan hub of Aleppo. So while Obama has backed Assad’s ouster, the dictator’s ability to prevent further movement by the Islamic State has been hugely important in Syria. Meanwhile, in Iraq, Iran’s support for Shiite Islamic militia groups fighting against the Islamic State, which practices the Sunni branch of Islam, has stopped their spread into southern Iraq, said Rick Brennan, a Middle East expert at the RAND Institute. Much of the Islamic State’s campaign has involved winning over converts, by force or otherwise, in predominantly Sunni regions, Brennan added, so they were naturally going to have trouble spreading when they tried to push into areas controlled by other populations. ""ISIS made progress when they went through Sunni-controlled areas, but when they went to Shi’a and Kurdish areas, they slowed,"" Brennan said. ""So there are natural demographics at play here as well."" Our ruling Obama said, ""In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping (the Islamic State’s) advance."" Obama’s language is carefully worded not to oversell the United States’ progress or the Islamic State’s lackthereof. And U.S. airstrikes have had a qualitative, if not quantifiable, impact on slowing the group’s swift spread compared with the situation last summer. However, Obama’s statement implies the United States is winning its war against the Islamic State, and that is not at all clear. While the terrorist group has stalled in Iraq, its movements in Syria are much more fluid. Things look improved today, but the situation can change quickly. Additionally, other countries in the region, including those outside our alliances, have played a role in fighting the Islamic State. Obama's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.","[('President Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 20, 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jan/20/barack-obamas-2015-state-union-address-annotated/'), ('Email interview with Carl Woog, spokesman for the Defense Department, Jan. 22, 2015', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Rick Brennan, senior political scientist with the RAND Institute, Jan. 22, 2015', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/23/president-obama-delivers-statement-airstrikes-syria'), ('Phone interview with Robin Wright, joint fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center, Jan. 21, 2015', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy, Jan. 22, 2015', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-led-airstrikes-fail-to-slow-islamic-state-in-syria-1421271618'), ('White House, President Obama Delivers a Statement on Airstrikes in Syria, Sept. 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Months of Airstrikes Fail to Slow Islamic State in Syria,"" Jan. 14, 2015', 'https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/26/middleeast/syria-kobani-fighting/'), ('CNN, ""Opposition group: Kurdish fighters advance in Kobani, Syria,"" Jan. 26, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-america-stopping-islamic-states-/

Deal accurate: Rainy day fund being replenished
","Rebuilding the state’s reserve or rainy day fund is something Gov. Nathan Deal likes to crow about. In his 2013 State of the State address, the governor bragged that the rainy day fund had grown 226 percent since he took office in 2011. His staffers were all a-twitter about it then on, um, social media. The news this year, Deal said in his annual speech, is even better. The rainy day fund has grown a whopping 643 percent. It’s hard for most of us to get our minds around those kind of percentages. We knew it was big when the Dow Jones closed up 7.52 percent for 2014.  When we heard the governor say the rainy day fund has soared 643 percent, our heads and the unflappable AJC Truth-0-Meter started spinning. First, a little background. Georgia, like other states, has a ""rainy day"" fund to carry it through tough economic times. The fund had $1.5 billion, or enough money to operate the state for 30 days, on July 1, 2007. But when the Great Recession hit, hurting Georgia harder than many states, the rainy day fund was drawn down to balance the 2008, 2009 and 2010 state budgets. By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, the state’s reserves had dwindled to $104 million. Most states were in the same boat. State rainy day funds collectively fell from $25.9 billion in FY 2007 to $10.4 billion in FY 2010, although they had bounced back to about $21.6 billion by last fall, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. (Note Alaska and Texas aren’t counted in those tallies because their large reserves skew the state averages.) ""Since the Great Recession, states have done a relatively good job of rebuilding their reserves,’ said Arturo Perez, a financial analyst with NCSL. By the end of the current fiscal year, most states will have fund balances averaging about 5.8 percent of their revenues, Alaska and Texas not included, Perez said. At the low point, the average had dropped to 1.8 percent, he said. Georgia’s was at 4.5 percent at the end of 2014, Perez said. Now to check Deal’s calculations against state records. Georgia’s rainy day fund had $116,021,961 before Deal took office in 2011 and reached $377,971,440 by June 30, 2012, earning the governor a True rating from PolitiFact for his statement in the State of the State  in January 2013. By June 30, 2014, the end of the last fiscal year, the fund had $862,835,447. Deal told lawmakers in his State of the State this month that being conservative had paid off. He said the 2014 budget was based on a conservative estimate that state revenues would increase 3.4 percent. Revenues were actually up 4.8 percent, and the difference went to the rainy day fund, the governor said. ""Every budget cycle since I have been governor, we have added to that fund so that it has increased by 643 percent since I took office,"" Deal said. His numbers add up. The rainy day fund has increased 643 percent since Fiscal Year 2010, the year before he took office. What’s the right amount for tough times? The question that likely worries every family has been debated by officials at all levels of government. Rating agencies recommended in the early 1980s that states set aside 3 percent to 5 percent of their revenues in reserves for economic tough times. The Government Finance Officers Association more recently has suggested that states have 10 percent to 15 percent or two months’ worth of operating money on hand. Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said state officials indicated they wanted 10 percent to 15 percent in reserves when the state raised the cap to 15 percent under former Gov. Sonny Perdue, he said. ""If that’s the case, Georgia has some work to do before its reserves exceed 10 percent,"" Essig said. ""Reserves equal to 10 to 15 percent would be somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion."" The other way to measure reserves to project how many days they could be used for government operations, and the current money would cover about 16 days, he said. In summary, the state had $1.5 billion in its rainy day fund and relied on it to balance the state budget through the toughest years of the Great Recession. The fund is not where it once was nor is it where it needs to be so the state is ready for the next economic downturn. But it is exactly where Deal said it is -- up 643 percent since he took office. We rate Deal’s statement True.","[('State of the State, Gov.

Rick Perry, in Iowa, says unemployment rate has 'been massaged, it’s been doctored'
","Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who plans to say this spring if he’ll again seek the Republican presidential nomination, questioned the validity of federal unemployment statistics as he otherwise extolled the boom in his home state, according to a reporter in attendance. In a tweet, Dave Weigel of Bloomberg Politics quoted Perry saying during a Jan. 26, 2015, breakfast event with Jewish voters in Des Moines that the official unemployment rate is unreliable: ""It’s been massaged, it’s been doctored,"" Weigel quoted Perry saying.  By phone, Weigel told us Perry made his remark while celebrating his state’s economy and did not take reporter questions. At our request, Weigel later emailed us his fuller transcript showing Perry said: ""We've got the lowest participation rate since the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter was president. I'm talking about participation in the work force. That's of really great concern for me."" Perry continued: ""I mean, who is it standing up for these people that I call the uncounted? They've lost hope that they can even get a job, so they're not even counted. When you look at the unemployment rate today, that's not the true unemployment rate, it's been massaged, it's been doctored,"" Perry said. The U.S. unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in December 2014, down from as much as 10 percent in 2009, Democrat Barack Obama’s first year as president. The Texas jobless rate was 4.6 percent, the state’s lowest since May 2008. Indeed, on Jan. 15, 2015, in his last speech to Texas legislators as governor, Perry saluted the state’s job gains, also noting the Texas jobless rate was ""significantly below the national average."" So we were curious what he meant about the rate being doctored and asked Perry aides to elaborate--without success. Jobless rate an imperfect indicator Nationally, the persistence of discouraged workers and declining workforce participation often come up as criticisms of the jobless rate. Perry’s mention of the official jobless rate leaving out discouraged workers was accurate. After Obama’s latest State of the Union address, PolitiFact rated Mostly True the Democratic leader’s declaration the unemployment rate was the lowest it had been since before the financial crisis that blew up around the time of his 2008 election. Still, that fact check noted Obama was citing the most basic version of the unemployment rate, which draws on regular surveys of households that originated in 1940. Another version of the rate, known as U-6, tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weaknesses by accounting for people who are unemployed plus people working part-time who would rather have full-time work -- and people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. By rolling in these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate but is usually a few points higher. And as it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the official unemployment rate -- hasn’t returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The national December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008. This gets us to Perry’s mention of labor force participation, which gauges the number of people in the labor force compared to the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up on finding a job. Historically, workforce participation was down in the national recession at the end of Carter’s tenure and through the start of Ronald Reagan’s presidency, PolitiFact noted in 2012. More recently, the labor force participation rate has markedly decreased since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66 percent; it was nearly 63 percent as of December 2014, the most recent month of available data. So, the participation rate is lately at its lowest point since the late 1970s, which also was a time when fewer women had jobs outside the home. This decrease has partly been influenced by the aging of the workforce (as in Baby Boomer retirements). No signs of doctoring These wrinkles noted, is there evidence the jobless rate has been massaged and doctored, as Perry put it? We found none. In November 2013, after a manipulation charge bubbled up involving the Philadelphia region, the U.S. Census Bureau -- which conducts the Current Population Survey that gathers information from households later converted by the government to the unemployment rate -- posted a statement saying: ""We have no reason to believe that there was a systematic manipulation of the data described in media reports. As a statistical agency, the Census Bureau is very conscientious about our responsibility to produce accurate Current Population Survey data for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and all other surveys we conduct."" The bureau referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office of the Inspector General, which said in May 2014 it had found ""no evidence"" unemployment data had been manipulated in the months leading up to the November 2012 national election. That report also recommended some bureau reforms. None of several experts responding to our inquiries said the unemployment rate has been massaged or doctored. Among them, Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute told us the fact the regular jobless rate doesn’t reflect discouraged job-seekers or part-timers wishing for full-time jobs isn’t a deliberate government misrepresentation. Still, Biggs emailed, it means the unemployment rate doesn’t deliver an accurate picture of the labor market’s health. ""If labor force participation were the same today as prior to the recession, I believe the unemployment rate would be around 8.3%. So the idea that the labor market is really healthy today just isn’t that true,"" he said. In 2013, economists told PolitiFact it would be extremely difficult to alter the unemployment rate. William Shobe, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Studies at the University of Virginia, said it’s important to remember there are many measures of unemployment, including privately produced surveys. ""And they all agree, within the margins of error,"" Shobe said. ""The immediate conclusion that you can draw from that is that no rogue interviewer or group of rogue interviewers have managed to budge the unemployment far (or at all, mind you) from the value it would have had otherwise."" Shobe added that any effort to fudge the national numbers would require the participation of interviewers across the country. ""Otherwise you would see only a localized move which would wash out as noise in the national stats,"" he said. Shobe, reached afresh for this story, said he was unaware of developments that would support the former governor’s claim. ""The whole idea that you could get a group of these statisticians to lie about these survey results they’re collecting and have that stick, that’s just crazy,"" Shobe said.""These are career civil servants. Their incentives are to get the best possible numbers."" Shobe suggested we query University of Wisconsin economist Menzie Chinn who told us by email that he considers such critiques of the rate to be ""specious;"" Chinn pointed us to his October 2012 blog post taking to task a similar statement by business executive Jack Welch. Asked to assess Perry’s comment in full, Chinn said: ""It’s true that had the labor force participation rate not declined, and we used the number of employed actually observed to calculate a rate, then mechanically the unemployment rate would have to be higher."" Regardless, he said, it’s not so that government statisticians changed the procedure for calculations in order to change the reported unemployment number – which Chinn said is how he would define ""doctored."" By phone, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, said nothing notable has occurred to demonstrate the unemployment rate has been doctored or massaged, though in August 2014, Princeton University economist Alan Krueger and others wrote a paper pointing out fewer people are responding to the survey that feeds the rate. A New York Times columnist, David Leonhardt, summarized the upshot as being a seeming ""increase in the number of people who once would have qualified as officially unemployed and today are considered out of the labor force, neither working nor looking for work."" Sinclair speculated by email that Perry’s reference to discouraged workers being left out of the rate means he’d prefer to see the rate calculated with the workers counted. But the words ""massaged"" and ""doctored,"" Sinclair said, each carries a charge, implying the rate is nefariously manipulated. ""We have no evidence of that,"" Sinclair said. Our ruling Addressing Iowans, Perry said the official U.S. jobless rate ""has been doctored, it’s been massaged."" There’s legitimate debate about what statistic best measures the state of the workforce and even agreement that the widely quoted unemployment rate (which Perry stressed as meaningful about a week before this Iowa stop) doesn’t provide the fullest picture of the labor force. But that's a far cry from showing the government is massaging or doctoring numbers, which implies organized underhanded wrongdoing. Perry may yet elaborate. We find this claim factually unsupported and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Dems say assault guns allowed in Va. Capitol while balloons are banned
","House Democrats in the General Assembly have launched a petition drive to show public support for a package of pending gun control bills. The online entreaty calls for ""common sense gun laws"" and, to foster the contention that Virginia’s firearm policies are awry, contains a white and blue graphic of some of the rules regarding public entrance to the state capitol. On the left side of the graphic is the headline ""Banned in the Virginia State Capitol."" Underneath are pictures of a bullhorn, a trumpet, a floating helium balloon and an American flag on a pole. The right side says, ""Allowed in the Virginia State Capitol."" Underneath are pictures of a handgun, a rifle, and two assault guns. ""How does this make sense?"" the bottom of the chart asks in capital letters. We wondered whether the petition accurately described the rules for entry into the Capitol.  David Pourshoushtari, a spokesman for the House Democrats, pointed us to visitors’ rules posted on the General Assembly’s website. The House and the Senate have identical rules for general entry into the Capitol. The conditions vary slightly for entry into galleries in each chamber. Let’s take a look. Bullhorns, trumpets and balloons. The basic rules for entering the Capitol are spelled out in these words on the legislative website: ""Possession or use of any device that may disrupt the conduct of business is prohibited, including, but not limited to: voice-amplification equipment; bullhorns; blow horns; sirens, or other noise-producing devices as well as signs on sticks, poles or stakes, or helium-filled balloons."" That confirms two of four items Democrats said were banned. But what about trumpets? Susan Schaar, the Senate clerk, said they would generally not be allowed since they fall into the realm of ""noise-producing devices."" Schaar said exceptions can be made, such as for a memorial service. Paul Nardo, the House clerk, said flags are allowed to be brought into the building, but not if they’re hoisted on poles. The image on the Democrat’s petition shows a flag on a pole. Nardo explained that the rules apply to everyone, including members of the legislature as well as the general public. Firearms We couldn’t find any rules about bringing guns into the Capitol on the General Assembly’s website. But they do exist. Capt. Randy Howard of the Virginia Division of Capitol Police said firearms access into the Capitol is governed by  rules passed in 2004 by a joint legislative committee. He told us possession is limited to three groups: General Assembly members, law enforcement officials and any holder of a valid concealed handgun permit. Could someone bring an assault rifle into the Capitol? If he is allowed to bring in a firearm, the answer is yes, Howard said. The 2004 rule ""simply says ‘firearm’, so it’s fairly broad,"" Howard told us. ""It doesn’t just say that the only thing they can bring in is a handgun even though that’s what’s covered by the (concealed) handgun permit."" Del. Joseph Morrissey, I-Henrico, held aloft an unloaded AK-47 in the House chamber during a 2013 debate over a gun control measure he sponsored. Morrissey said then that the weapon had been inspected by the Capitol police prior to being brought into the chamber, according to an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The Senate bans firearms in its public gallery looking over the chamber’s floor. There is no such restriction in the House gallery. Our ruling Calling for reform to Virginia’s gun laws, House Democrats noted that firearms -- including assault rifles -- are allowed to be brought in the state Capitol while helium balloons, flags on poles, trumpets and bullhorns are banned. The list of barred articles holds up. The firearms issue is a bit trickier. They can be brought into the Capitol, but only by lawmakers, valid concealed weapons permit holders and law enforcement. They are banned in the Senate gallery. We rate the claim Mostly True.","[('Virginia House Democrats, ""Support common sense gun laws,"" accessed Jan. 19, 2015.', 'https://vahousedems.ngpvanhost.com/form/-7156077511803140352'), ('Email from David Pourshoushtari, a spokesman for the Virgnia House Democrats, Jan. 20, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Interviews with Paul Nardo, House clerk, Jan. 21-23, 2015.', 'http://hodcap.state.va.us/publications/Capitol-Use-Guidelines-Capitol-and-House-1-9-12.pdf'), ('Interview with Susan Schaar, Senate clerk, Jan. 21, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Interviews with Capt.

Is it true Republicans haven’t won presidential race since 1928 without a Bush or Nixon?
","As he moves toward formally entering the 2016 presidential race, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is hammering home the notion that Washington needs a ""fresh face."" It’s a two-edged critique aimed at potential Republican rivals such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and at Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic senator and first lady who is gearing up for 2016. The Clinton-Bush era in the nation’s capital is well known -- from 1980 to 2004, Jeb’s father (George H.W. Bush) or brother (George W. Bush) or Bill Clinton won their party’s nomination for president or vice president. Hillary Clinton, of course, nearly made the top of the Democratic ticket in 2008. But there’s a more sweeping claim making the rounds on social media -- and various websites -- as the 2016 race takes early shape. This is how Washington Post Wonkblog reporter Matt O’Brien put it: Republicans haven’t won a presidential election without a Bush or Nixon on the ticket since 1928. Seems kind of unlikely, doesn’t it? That was our first reaction as we quickly tried to do think back through the roster of GOP presidential and vice-presidential contestants over that 84-year span. It’s right on, though. It’s a testament both to the Bush family legacy and to Nixon’s lengthy, comeback-dotted career. The period in question covers 21 presidential elections starting in 1932. Democrats prevailed 12 times; Republicans 9. The presence of a Bush or Nixon on the ticket turned out to be a boon for Republicans during those eight decades. But it didn’t mean a lock: in two races Republicans fell despite the connection. Here we go: Nixon was Dwight Eisenhower’s running mate in 1952 and 1956 and served as vice president. In 1960, Nixon narrowly lost the presidential contest to John F. Kennedy, but returned to win two terms before resigning amid the Watergate scandal in 1974. George H.W. Bush was Ronald Reagan’s running mate and vice president for two terms, then won the presidency in 1988 before bowing to Bill Clinton in 1992. Finally, Bush’s son George W. Bush was atop the GOP ticket in 2000 and 2004 before Barack Obama reclaimed the White House for Democrats in 2008 and 2012. You have to reach back to the GOP team of Herbert Hoover and Native American U.S. Sen. Charles Curtis in 1928 to break the streak. They won in a landslide over Democrats Al Smith and Joseph Robinson, with Socialist Party candidate Norman Thomas getting a smattering of support. Hoover, of course, was ushered out in 1932 as the Great Depression raged, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt era began. Our rating No Republican has been elected president since 1928 without a member of the Bush family or Richard M. Nixon on the GOP ticket? You could look it up. But now you don’t have to.

Alfonso Lopez says Va. shields ducks better than people from assault weapon violence
","When it comes to protection from assault weapons in Virginia, Del. Alfonso Lopez said ducks have it better than people. Lopez, D-Arlington, has introduced a bill that would ban the future sale in Virginia of gun magazines that hold more than 20 bullets. It has a grandfather clause that would allow those who owned higher-capacity magazines prior to the signing of his bill to keep three of the devices. The grandfathered owners would have to register those magazines with the state police. In a Jan. 19 floor speech, Lopez said his bill is a response to mass shootings around the nation in recent years, including the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy that left 32 dead and 17 wounded. Then, the delegate made an analogy to hunting. ""Since 1931, federal law prohibits me from having more than three shotgun shells in my shotgun when I’m duck hunting,"" he said. ""That means that ducks have more protection than people in Virginia. ""Let me repeat that: Under the law, ducks have more protection than people in Virginia,"" Lopez said. We took a gander at Lopez’s claim. The delegate referred us to federal and state hunting laws. They identically make it illegal to hunt migratory birds with a shotgun capable of firing more than three rounds without reloading. Does that mean ducks are better protected than people under Virginia laws? The very premise of Lopez’s claim is flawed. It’s legal to hunt ducks in Virginia. If you shoot one with a barred firearm for duck hunting, it’s a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum $500 fine. It’s illegal to shoot people in Virginia with any firearm, except in limited instances of self defense. The murder of person in Virginia is punishable by death or lengthy prison sentences. There’s no jail time for shooting a duck, even if it’s done with an illegal shotgun. It’s illegal to even point a gun at another person in Virginia in a menacing way, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison and a $2,500 fine. State law is silent about pointing a gun at a duck. Lopez told us he wasn’t trying to argue that Virginia laws protect ducks better than people from being shot. ""I was talking about  the number of bullets and shotgun shells,"" he said, adding that, perhaps, he could have been clearer in his speech. ""I was talking about high capacity guns."" Our ruling In a speech on the House floor, Lopez said that under Virginia law ""ducks have more protection that people"" from assault gun violence. To drive the point home, he repeated it. There’s simply no basis to this jarring claim. Virginia sanctions duck hunting; it’s a misdemeanor with no jail time if you shoot one with a gun that can hold more than three bullets. It’s a felony to purposefully shoot a person, sometimes punishable by death, and the capacity of firearms doesn’t alter this simple fact. We rate Lopez’s statement Pants on Fire.","[('Del.

"['Georgia', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Nathan Deal']","
Jobs will come with Mercedes move
","The 2014 governor’s race spotlighted two diametrically opposed facts about Georgia’s economy: Different groups ranked the state tops for business at the same time the state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation. Georgia’s  unemployment rate tumbled to 6.9 percent in December (from 7.2 percent in November), and in January, Mercedes-Benz USA announced it was moving its headquarters to metro Atlanta. Newly re-elected Gov. Nathan Deal touted the move in a press release as ""creating at least 800 jobs"" while repeating the state’s top-ranked business environment. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if that meant the move would create jobs to nudge the needle on Georgia’s unemployment rate – still stubbornly well above the national 5.6 unemployment rate. In other words, is moving jobs – in this case, from New Jersey – the same as creating them? First, it’s worth noting that the 800 figure comes from an incentive letter from the Georgia Department of Economic Development to Mercedes. The state is offering a package of grants, tax credits and ""cost avoidances"" worth $23.3 million. Mercedes-Benz USA CEO Steve Cannon has told several media outlets that the firm expects about 40 percent of its workers to relocate to Atlanta. Using the 800 figure, that means 320 people will move and the firm will need to hire for 480 jobs. So does that translate into ""creating"" 800 jobs? Absolutely, said state Economic Development Commissioner Chris Carr. After all, once the auto company sets up shop here this summer, there will be at least 800 jobs that today don’t exist. It’s a net increase of positions, and in an industry that has gradually shifted to the southeast for its manufacturing and office operations. ""This puts Georgia high on the radar for the automotive industry and also for German companies,"" Carr said. ""Whether a Georgian here or new Georgian, Georgians would not have that job except for the sake that Mercedes will move here."" The qualifier of ""at least"" 800 jobs shows the state is looking at the tax credits as an investment, Carr said. ""You have to play for the long game,"" he said. To an economist, the claim is accurate-ish. Once Mercedes moves here, the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics will show it as 800 jobs in Georgia. Those jobs will do the things economists study, like boost demand for housing and increase tax collections on the state and local level, said Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University. That said, it’s incorrect to imply the move means 800 jobs for current Georgians, Seaman said. ""We should be happy, not euphoric. We could be euphoric if this was creating 800 opportunities for existing Georgians,"" he said. The distinction between those soon-to-be Georgians and the folks who already know the pain that is rush hour on the top-end Perimeter? The folks here are the ones paying the taxes that fund those incentives and might wonder what’s in it for them. Georgia’s generous incentives to the film industry answer the question. There was no doubt that most of the jobs tied, say, to Jennifer Lawrence’s first days filming in Bellwood Quarry, came from California. But Seaman said the state’s investment has also created a growing demand for Georgians who know how to do work in that industry, not to mention private-sector investments in sound stages and studios. ""Over time, it is an investment that can pay off,"" Seaman said. ""I think it’s a good thing for the state."" The bottom line is, claiming Mercedes’ move will create 800 jobs is generally correct but lacking in context.

Have Democrats lost 900 seats in state legislatures since Obama has been president?
","If President Barack Obama’s plan to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for middle-class tax cuts and programs won’t go anywhere in the new Republican Congress, why did Obama even spend time discussing it during last week’s State of the Union? ""Because it’s something for people to run on,"" said Cokie Roberts as part of a Sunday pundit analysis on ABC’s This Week. ""He’s lost almost 70 Democrats since he’s been president,"" Roberts said of Congress, ""and more than 900 state legislators. So he needs to give Democrats something to run on."" We had heard iterations of Democratic losses on the congressional level, but never such a large number of losses for Democrats in legislatures across the country. Turns out, Roberts is correct. Our analysis shows Democrats have lost 910 seats since Obama took office. (You can see the changes in every state here.) We took a state-by-state look of lost seats from the best source available, the National Conference of State Legislatures. Using the group’s data, we compared the number of Democratic seats in early 2009, when Obama took office, to the number of seats after the 2014 midterms. The bottom line: Republicans now control about 56 percent of the country’s 7,383 state legislative seats, up 12 percentage points since 2009. Thirty-five states posted double-digit seat losses for the Democrats in state legislatures, including more than 50 seats each in Arkansas, New Hampshire and West Virginia. Democrats actually gained a few seats over the course of Obama’s presidency in New Jersey (one) and Illinois (three), and the number of Democratic seats stayed the same in California. The GOP’s national and local resurgence under the Democratic-controlled White House is not surprising, in part, because of the historical trend for two-term presidencies. Political analysts say it’s a sure thing that a political party prospers when it wins the White House but loses its influence across the country soon after. Remember that before the 2010 and 2012 elections, Democrats made positive gains in the 2006 and 2008 elections, said Larry Sabato, a political expert at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. ""You have a pretty consistent pattern of surge and decline, and you can trace it throughout the two-party era in American politics,"" Sabato said. What is notable about losses under Obama is, with two years to go, they are worse than usual. Sabato and his colleague Geoffrey Skelley recently chronicled the trend of two-term presidents’ sour effect on their parties for Politico Magazine. Their analysis looked at the down-ballot effects of eight two-term presidents, which includes leaders who served two full terms (Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama) as well as the terms of leaders who died or resigned and their successors (Franklin Roosevelt-Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy-Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon-Gerald Ford). Obama’s record for losses, at least through the 2014 midterms, is historically bad having overseen two horrible midterm elections for Democrats. Overall, Sabato wrote, Democrats during Obama’s presidency lost 11 governorships, 13 U.S. Senate seats, 69 House seats, and 913 state legislative seats and 30 state legislative chambers. (Our analysis of legislative seats is off from Sabato’s by three. The small discrepancy is likely due to run-offs and recounts.) The shedding of U.S. House seats, state legislative seats and statehouse control is at least twice the average two-term losses from Truman through George W. Bush, Sabato said. The Democrats’ ""presidential penalty"" is rougher than usual for a few reasons, Sabato explains. First, voters in midterm elections tend to be older and whiter, thus more conservative. Groups that are overwhelmingly Democratic, such as young people and minorities, are more likely to turn out in stronger numbers for presidential elections. Also, Democratic losses in 2010 could not have come at a worse time given redistricting across the country. With more Republicans in control of statehouses, they have authority over the lines that delineate seats for U.S. Senate, House and legislative races. ""There is a heavy amount of gerrymandering,"" Sabato said. Finally, voters and candidates are moving away from centrist voting habits that dominated the 1970s through ‘90s, when voters would deviate from party lines after making their presidential pick. In recent years, Sabato said, ""more and more people will stay in the same column from the White House to the courthouse, voting for either Democrats or Republicans."" Sabato is not alone in documenting this trend. Looking at how parties performed in down-ballot races just under the last three presidents, PolitiFact’s Louis Jacobson also found that losses under Obama were more severe for a column in Governing. Jacobson said the Democratic losses reached 36 percent in governorships and ""a stunning 59 percent in fully controlled state legislatures."" Our ruling Roberts said Obama sought to inspire Democrats across the country in his State of the Union address in part because the party lost ""more than 900 state legislators"" since he took office. We ran the numbers, and Roberts’ claim checks out. Using data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, Democrats have lost 910 seats in statehouses across the country since 2009.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich puts words in Abraham Lincoln's mouth about tax policy
","In his argument against President Barack Obama’s proposed increase in capital gains tax, Ohio Gov. John Kasich invoked the words of a vaunted former president -- or at least he tried. Obama wants to create a nationwide free community college program. How he proposes to pay for it -- partially by increasing taxes on the wealthy via a higher tax rate on income earned from selling assets --  would be ""a prescription for economic slowdown,"" Kasich, a Republican, said on Fox News Sunday Jan. 25. To support his position, he relayed a quote that he said comes from former President Abraham Lincoln. ""You can’t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down,"" Kasich said. ""Abraham Lincoln said it then, and he’s right."" There’s only one problem. Lincoln never said that. The true author is Rev. William J. H. Boetcker, a minister-turned-public speaker, born in 1873, eight years after Lincoln was killed. After he left the pulpit, Boetcker, a political conservative, negotiated labor relations. In 1916, Boetcker published the list of ""10 Cannots,"" a collection of personal truisms largely centered around the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism. The axioms have been mistakenly attributed to Lincoln for decades. Here are all 10 Cannots (Kasich used No. 3.): 1. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. 2. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. 3. You cannot help little men by tearing down big men. 4. You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. 5. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. 6. You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money. 7. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. 8. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn. 9. You cannot build character and courage by destroying men's initiative and independence. 10. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves. So why do Kasich and others these quotes to Lincoln? It stems from Boetcker himself, according to Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions about Abraham Lincoln, a book by Gerald Prokopowicz, a Lincoln expert at East Carolina University. In 1916, Boetcker published leaflets that had a real Lincoln quote on one side and his ""cannots"" on the other. A reader could easily assume these were also Lincoln quotes, and they did. Kasich’s spokesman pointed us to the fact that in 1950, Rep. Frances Bolton, R-Ohio, read the 10 Cannots into the Congressional Record. She supposedly got them from one of the earliest talk show hosts, Galen Drake. A 1950 Library of Congress report said of the frequent misquotation, ""There seems to be no way of overtaking the rapid pace with which the mistaken identity has been spreading,"" according to a 1992 Washington Post column. Probably the most well-documented misuse of these quotes came from Reagan at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston. Reagan said, ""What (Democrats) truly don't understand is the principle so eloquently stated by Abraham Lincoln: ‘You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.’ "" So we’ve established that Lincoln did not say that line Kasich used to support his position against raising taxes on the wealthy -- ""You cannot help little men by tearing down big men."" But we were left wondering if, in any case, does this at all line up with Lincoln’s position on taxes? As it turns out, not really. Lincoln and taxes Well, Lincoln signed the first federal income taxes into law in 1861 in order to fund the Civil War. What’s more is that these taxes were progressive -- meaning that the wealthier people paid higher tax rates on their income. The highest rate -- 5 percent -- applied to incomes roughly equivalent to $1 million today, Prokopowicz told PolitiFact in an email. ""To the extent that signing the bill indicated his approval, Lincoln thus approved of the concept of higher taxes on the wealthy,"" he said. ""This is consistent with Lincoln's politics generally."" (Quick note: Kasich was talking about capital gains taxes specifically, and here we’re talking about income tax. Until 1921, capital gains were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.) Lincoln’s Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase came up with the idea for the tax, which is further evidence that Lincoln supported higher taxes on the wealthy, said Geoff Elliot, expert and author of the Abraham Lincoln Blog. He added that a subsequent act in 1862 created the precursor to the Internal Revenue Service Much of the debate over the Civil War income tax laws centered around whether Lincoln had the constitutional authority to impose these taxes, said Jennifer Weber, a Lincoln expert at the University of Kansas. (In 1881, the Supreme Court held up Lincoln’s authority.) In a reminder of how much political parties have changed, Weber noted that it was the conservative Democrats taking Lincoln, a Republican, to task over executive overreach and implementing taxes. There is ""precious little"" record of Lincoln’s views on taxes, said Ed Steers, author of several books on the Lincoln assassination. But he pointed us to a speech Lincoln delivered to the 164th Ohio Infantry in 1864, where he advocated for the progressive tax law. Lincoln said: ""It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property; but if we should wait before collecting a tax, to adjust the taxes on each man in exact proportion with every other man, we should never collect any tax at all. "" Prokopowicz added that Lincoln believed strongly in ""opportunity capitalism"" and that the government should not adopt policies that would prevent anyone from acquiring wealth. However, Lincoln also believed that the government had a vital role in creating opportunity, and individuals ought to contribute to the government in order to reap its benefits. ""I go for all sharing the privileges of the government, who assist in bearing its burthens,"" Lincoln wrote in 1836 while running for the Illinois state Legislature. Our ruling Kasich said that Lincoln said, ""You can’t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down."" It’s well-established that this is not a Lincoln quote. Many have misattributed it to Lincoln, but its real author was a politically conservative minister and public speaker who was born several years after Lincoln’s assassination. Additionally, Kasich used the idea to support his position against raising taxes on the wealthy. Lincoln, however, instituted the first-ever federal income tax, and it was progressive.

Middle class pays higher tax rates than millionaires, Sen. Tammy Baldwin says
","In his sixth State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called on Congress to raise taxes on the rich and give tax breaks to the middle class. It was a message similar to one issued a week earlier by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. ""For far too long, our tax code has unfairly favored the wealthiest Americans, while middle-class families in Wisconsin have struggled to get ahead,"" Baldwin said in a Jan. 13, 2015 news release issued with U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. ""I’m proud to once again join Senator Whitehouse to introduce the Paying a Fair Share Act, also known as the ‘Buffett rule.’ It is simply unfair to ask middle-class Americans to pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires."" Do middle-class Americans pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires? Some do. And some don’t. The Buffett rule The so-called Buffett rule refers to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. In 2011, he famously pronounced that he paid only 17.4 percent of his taxable income in federal income taxes, a lower percentage than any of his 20 employees. He proposed that federal tax rates be raised for taxpayers making more than $1 million. Obama took note of Buffett's comments in his 2012 State of the Union speech. Later that year Baldwin and Whitehouse introduced legislation that included the so-called Buffett rule: Under the measure, people making more than $2 million per year would pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent, while people making between $1 million and $2 million would see their minimum tax rates increase, on a sliding scale, up to 30 percent. The measure didn’t become law. Thus, the announcement from Baldwin and Whitehouse that they would reintroduce their legislation. Tax rates Hang with us here. The numbers can get kind of heavy. But it’s clear some -- though far from all --  middle-class Americans are paying higher tax rates. To back Baldwin’s claim about the disparity in tax rates, her office cited one portion of a March 2012 analysis of the proposed Buffett rule from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: A ""large proportion"" of millionaires pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than a ""significant proportion"" of moderate-income taxpayers, said the report, which defined moderate-income as taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000. More specifically, roughly a quarter of all millionaires face a tax rate that is lower than the tax rate faced by 10 percent of the moderate-income taxpayers. And on average, according to the report, the below-$100,000 taxpayers paid 35 percent of their taxable income in taxes (income and payroll), while the millionaires paid 30 percent. Of course, some middle-class taxpayers, and some millionaires, paid much lower or much higher rates. For instance, people in the 10th percentile of the below-$100,000 group paid a rate of 14 percent -- less than the 16 percent for the 10th percentile of the millionaire group. But looking at the 90th percentile in each group, the below-$100,000 group paid a rate of 49 percent, more than the 37 percent in the millionaire group. A key point: Higher-income taxpayers who enjoy low  tax rates receive a very high proportion of their income from investment income, which is taxed at low rates, the report says. Conversely, lower-income taxpayers who face relatively high tax rates get most of their income from wages, which are subject to payroll taxes. In other words, your tax rate depends a lot on where your income comes from. We contacted the author of the report, economist Thomas Hungerford, who is now at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. He told us that since his report was published, taxes on wealthier Americans -- including on income, capital gains and dividends -- have been raised. But Hungerford said the thrust of his report remains accurate: A ""substantial number"" of middle-class Americans pay higher tax rates than some millionaires. A more recent report, published in December 2014 by the Tax Foundation, which promotes lower tax rates, noted that the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid a higher effective income tax rate (22.8 percent) than any other group and nearly seven times higher than taxpayers in the bottom 50 percent (3.28 percent). Our rating Baldwin said middle-class Americans ""pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires."" Some do and some don’t. For a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.","[('U.S. Sen.

Professor says right to vote in U.S. ‘has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship’
","Extending voting rights to non-citizens is a hot topic from Burlington, Vt.,  to New York City to San Francisco. Supporters say allowing non-citizens to vote would give members of the community, including large numbers who pay taxes and own property, a voice in local political affairs. Opponents argue that extending voting privileges to immigrants would demean the value of citizenship and effectively disenfranchise legitimate citizen voters by diluting their vote. Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at Queens College, City University of New York,  supported expanding voting rights in a commentary ""Noncitizens voting? It’s only fair,"" published Jan. 1, 2015, in The Providence Journal. Hayduk helped found the Coalition to Expand Voting Rights, a group that supports extending voting rights to legal immigrants in New York City. A movement is afoot there and elsewhere to allow non-citizens to vote and to serve on local boards. A handful of cities and towns nationwide already allow immigrants who have legal residency status to vote in local matters. In stating his case, Hayduk made this provocative statement: ""But what most don’t know is that the right to vote in this country has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship."" When we asked him for his evidence, he referred us to ""Legal Aliens, Local Citizens: The Historical Constitutional, and Theoretical Meanings of Alien Suffrage,"" a law review article by Jamin Raskin, professor of law at Washington College of Law at American University. In addition, Hayduk cited historical research he and a few other historians and political scientists had done. We read Raskin’s article, which was published in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review in 1993; seeking a range of views, we also reached out to eight experts in the field of voting rights. In his article, Raskin defined a citizen as ""an inhabitant of a city or town or a member of a state."" His piece traced American suffrage throughout history, noting that at various points non-citizens voted in more than 22 states. ""It is true that in the 18th and 19th centuries lots of people who were not United States citizens were voting at every level of government,"" Raskin said in an interview. It is also true that not every citizen could vote during that period, namely women, children and free black men. (Hayduk’s research pushed the number of states and territories that extended voting privileges to non-citizens to 40. Rhode Island had no citizenship requirement to vote from 1762 to 1842.) According to Raskin, non-citizen voting played an important part in the building of America until it was undone by ""xenophobic nationalism"" following World War I. After the war, many states enacted laws to restrict voting rights. Since 1926, no state has allowed non-citizens to vote in state or federal elections. Rogers M. Smith, associate dean of social sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that during much of the mid-to late-19th century, Western states, in particular, allowed resident aliens who indicated they had applied for citizenship to vote, a policy aimed at encouraging European immigrants to move west. Like Raskin, Smith also noted that being a citizen didn’t guarantee the right to vote. He cited a Supreme Court ruling from 1875 that concluded that though women were citizens, they still couldn’t vote. (Women finally won the right to vote in 1920 through the passage of the 19th Amendment.) ""Being a citizen didn’t give you voting rights,"" said Alexander Keyssar, professor of history and social policy at Harvard University. Robert Richie, executive director of FairVote, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that advocates electoral reform, emphasized that for decades, black Americans were not allowed to vote, despite being citizens. In addition, voting in America was limited to white male property owners, excluding scores of adult men. Children, too, are examples of citizens who don’t have the right to vote. ""There’s not a connection between citizenship and suffrage,"" Richie said. Ultimately, of course, women, African Americans, and Native Americans gained the right to vote. We also contacted Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, for his take on Hayduk’s statement. ""Citizenship has, in fact, been viewed by many as a requirement of voting,"" Spakovsky said in an email interview. ""But there is no uniform answer because your eligibility to vote was determined by the states and territories – setting the qualifications for voting is a power handed to the states by the U.S. Constitution.""  And over our history, he said, states varied greatly on whom they allowed to vote. Under the Constitution, eligibility to vote in federal elections largely was left to states laws defining who gets to vote in state elections, according to Smith, of the University of Pennsylvania. Social movements over the years, however, brought about voting reforms that expanded access to the ballot for women, non-whites, non-Protestants, and the poor. In 1971, the voting age was lowered to 18 following Vietnam War protests. In the mid-1990s, Congress enacted laws making it a federal crime to knowingly register and vote in federal elections by falsely claiming to be a citizen.   In the past two decades, several communities have granted non-citizens the right to vote in local elections, including a half-dozen towns in Maryland. Chicago allows non-citizen parents of school children to vote in school board elections. And several Massachusetts communities have moved toward so-called ""resident"" voting, according to Hayduk. New York City, too, is poised to take up legislation that would allow non-citizens who are in the country legally to vote in local elections. With more than 22 million non-citizens now living in America, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, both proponents and objectors to such policies say a lot could be at stake. Our ruling Professor Ron Hayduk said ""the right to vote in this country has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship."" We look to the words he used in making that statement. Intrinsic is defined as ""of or relating to the essential nature of a thing"" and never means, well, never. It’s clear that throughout the history of the United States, citizenship has not always been tied to voting, particularly during the expansion of the West, when non-citizens were allowed to vote. Conversely, at times in our history, citizenship was not tied to voting for those citizens  who were women, Native Americans or African Americans. And in many places, citizens who are also felons are currently denied the But over time, voting rights have increasingly been tied to citizenship. Today, citizenship is a requirement for voting in national and state elections. At the municipal level, only a handful of communities allow non-citizens to vote, and only on local issues.

Cornyn says Keystone pipeline through Texas created 4,800 jobs in first year of operation
","After a Republican senator revisited his disagreement with President Barack Obama on the government permitting completion of the Keystone XL pipeline to deliver crude oil from Canada to Southeast Texas, a reader called for the Truth-O-Meter. In a Jan. 20, 2015, post on his Senate website, John Cornyn of Texas noted the newly majority-Republican Senate was starting the year by taking up ""bipartisan legislation, like the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. But the President has already threatened to veto this economy-boosting bill and prevent it from becoming law,"" Cornyn said. The White House earlier announced Obama’s veto threat, saying congressional intervention would circumvent a required federal review to determine if the project crossing an international border serves the national interest. Cornyn continued: ""It’s unfortunate that the President would shut down this bipartisan legislation. In Texas, we’ve seen the direct positive impact of the pipeline on the local and state economy. The Texas leg of the project, which delivers more than 400,000 barrels of crude oil from Cushing, OK to Southeast Texas each day, has already created 4,800 jobs in just the year it's been up and running."" That many jobs since the pipeline started flowing oil through Texas? Cornyn cites TransCanada To our inquiry, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie said the senator’s jobs count came from the owner of the pipeline, TransCanada. A December 2013 Associated Press news story said the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, from Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast, was built and would begin shipping oil Jan. 22, 2014. The story quoted TransCanada spokesman Davis Sheremata saying construction of the leg began in August 2012, ultimately involving more than 11 million hours of labor by 4,844 U.S. workers. Sheremata said the number of workers employed in the operational phase of the leg had not been established, the AP reported. According to an October 2013 TransCanada press release, the 4,844 workers who helped build the southern leg included heavy equipment operators, welders, laborers, transportation operators and supervisory personnel (including environment, safety and quality control inspectors). TransCanada confirms construction jobs gone With construction ended more than a year ago, we wondered how many jobs on the Oklahoma-through-Texas pipeline remain. Brandewie suggested we ask TransCanada whose spokesman Matthew John answered our inquiry in part by saying Cornyn separately made a clear reference to the ""4,800 individuals who found work as a result of its construction"" at a January 2015 celebration of the pipeline held in Beaumont, near Nederland, which is where the pipeline ends. That said, none of the jobs mentioned by Cornyn remained in place after the pipeline was built, John told us. Generally, John said, laborers ""work themselves out of a job every time they clock in. Like any infrastructure project, the majority of jobs are created during construction. This doesn’t mean those jobs never existed or didn’t have any lasting impact on the economy or the lives the American men and women that work those jobs to support their families."" Asked how many people were employed by the pipeline in Texas at the time Cornyn made his statement, John emailed: ""TransCanada has approximately 6,000 employees in North America; about a third are located throughout the U.S. across 32 states. In-service pipelines require maintenance, monitoring and operations jobs that may be directly supplied by TransCanada. However we spend millions of dollars every year with third-party contractors that provide services, (road repair, snow removal, inspectors etc.) in the communities where our infrastructure exists."" We asked for a precise count of jobs created after the pipeline was up and running. TransCanada spokesman Shawn Watson said by email: ""We have almost 750 employees and full-time contractors based in Texas alone – and many of them will provide some level of support to our oil operations and maintenance there. That doesn’t include people in other parts of the U.S. who would provide support or expertise to pipeline operations in Texas, or who may be considered ‘corporate overhead.’"" A national analysis If the entire pipeline is built, the U.S State Department has said, the result would be 3,900 jobs in place for two years and a total of 42,100 positions, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. has noted, though the definition of a job in this sense is a position filled for one year. This total reflects both jobs created directly as a result of construction and manufacturing for the pipeline -- about 3,900 annual positions over two years -- as well as spin-off jobs supported by construction workers who purchase materials for the project or spend their wages in the economy. Much of the construction work would come in four- or or eight-month stretches. After full construction, the pipeline would employ a lesser number, primarily for maintenance. The total number of projected long-term jobs: about 50. Finally, we asked Cornyn if it makes sense that the jobs he described as resulting from the pipeline's first year of operations existed only during construction. Via Brandewie, Megan Mitchell, Cornyn’s communications director, said: ""Our office was correct in noting that 4,800 jobs were created as a result of the Gulf Coast leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Unfortunately, we erred in the timeframe."" Our ruling Cornyn said the Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline project ""has already created 4,800 jobs in just the year it's been up and running."" We didn't learn how many jobs were created in the pipeline’s first year of operations. But Cornyn’s figure reflected the workers who built the pipeline’s southern leg over 15 months--and those jobs no longer existed by 2014. We rate this claim False.

Is online voter registration more secure? Florida state senator says yes
","Florida lawmakers have overhauled many aspects of our elections laws in recent years, but one aspect has remained untouched: Voters can’t register online. The statewide association of elections supervisors, which represents officials in both major parties, wants lawmakers to change that during the upcoming session. Supporters of the legislation argue one of the benefits is that it’s more secure. ""This is actually just simply a more secure, accurate and cost-efficient way of doing voter registration,"" said Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, said at a Senate Ethics and Elections committee hearing Jan. 20. Clemens is sponsoring a bill for the upcoming session.  Pasco Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley, a Republican in favor of online registration, made similar remarks at the hearing. Citing information from a former elections official in Arizona -- the first state to use online registration -- Corley said that ""there is a reduction in fraud."" Is online registration more secure? We decided to check it out. The current system Today, Florida voters fill out a paper form and submit it to a county elections official, or an entity such as a third-party group can submit it for them. Additionally, under the National Voting Rights Act (also known as ""Motor Voter""), a person can verbally relay their voter registration information while applying for a driver’s license. Traditional paper registration opens up the window for fraud or errors in multiple ways, according to Tammy Patrick, an elections expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former elections official in Maricopa County, Ariz. Some voters hand over personal information to strangers who sign up voters, and it may sit around somewhere until submitted several days or weeks later. Then elections officials have to decipher the forms and input the information. (In Florida, third parties must submit forms within 10 days.) With online registration, the exchange and verification of information happens immediately. Clemens’ bill would allow applicants to submit their voter registration applications online, and the state would compare the information with driver’s license records. Floridians could still choose to register to vote by paper. Many advocates of online voter registration say that it saves money, reduces the opportunity for errors from data entry or illegible handwriting and has been successfully used in both blue and red states. We’ll dive more into the security issues below. At least 20 states currently offer online voter registration for new applicants and a few more are in the works. The Presidential Commission on Election Administration, co-chaired by lawyers for the campaigns of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, recommended online registration in their 2014 report. A research report from the Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that online registration systems ""reduce the potential for fraud while improving the accuracy of voter rolls. All states have security procedures and protocols in place, including data encryption and tracking, while limiting those who have access to their system internally. No state has reported a security breach, including Arizona, where voters have been registering online for more than a decade."" How much fraud has occurred nationwide in terms of paper registration? That is difficult to quantify because it depends on how someone defines ""fraud."" Some fraudulent applications are rejected by elections officials (for example, Mickey Mouse), while others might get registered but then not vote. In 2008, ACORN in Florida turned over to law enforcement hundreds of registration applications collected by some of their workers that they deemed suspicious -- including one for the deceased actor Paul Newman. But those forms were never filed with elections officials, and ACORN, a liberal group, later disbanded amid nationwide problems. In 2012, the Republican Party of Florida fired vendor Strategic Allied Consulting amid reports of fraudulent registration forms. Wendy Underhill, an elections expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, says comparing security in online and paper systems is like comparing apples and oranges. ""When people talk about security for online voter registration systems, they’re thinking of hacking and cyber security breaches,"" she said. ""When people talk about security for paper-based registration, the questions are whether the registration application is transmitted to the elections people or never quite makes it there, and whether data from the forms is taken by the groups doing registration drives, and is that secure."" Cybersecurity experts have raised some concerns about a couple of state systems, including Maryland. In 2012, cybersecurity experts wrote to Maryland officials suggesting they take steps to better protect the online system. The driver’s license number is based on a formula involving the voter’s name and date of birth -- so the experts said that if someone had that information, they could alter the registration. (Security experts raised similar concerns about the system in Washington state.) No security breach actually occurred, said Nikki Charlson, Maryland’s deputy state administration for the elections board. However, in response, the state now requires that applicants provide additional information, including their Social Security number and date that their driver’s license was issued. (Washington election officials told us they didn’t have a breach either but have since made changes.) Loyola Law school professor Justin Levitt, an expert on election administration, told PolitiFact Florida that it is difficult to make direct quantifiable comparisons between online and paper systems.  ""In my rough sense of the comparative frequency and magnitude of the risks, I'd agree with the Florida state senator that online registration ends up more secure, accurate, and cost-efficient, as he says,"" Levitt said. ""But I doubt you'll find anyone who's got a reliable study directly comparing the security of the two different methods, just because the precise rate of security breaches is so difficult to assess. (Indeed, it's more difficult to assess in the offline system than the online one.) It's certainly true that the most publicized significant breaches in the past have been with the offline system -- but that's the system states have been deploying for a whole lot longer."" Hans Von Spakovsky, an elections expert who works for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that online registration for individuals for whom the state already has a record, such as driver’s license information, is not a problem. That’s the method recommended by the presidential commission. ""You will find that the states that have implemented online registration have almost all limited it to registration for individuals for whom there is already an existing state record that has been verified and where there is an existing signature,"" he said. The National Republican Lawyers Association is among the groups that support online voter registration. ""When designed and implemented properly, online registration can be a more secure, accurate and cost-efficient way of doing voter registration,"" said Michael B. Thielen, the executive director. Our ruling Clemens said that online voter registration is a ""a more secure"" way of doing voter registration. Experts who study online registration say there have been no reports of actual security breaches or fraud. If designed in a way to account for security, online registration reduces opportunities for fraud and errors. However, experts warned that both online and paper systems can have potential pitfalls -- the question is how do elections officials protect each system. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Florida Channel, ""Senate ethics and elections committee hearing,"" Jan. 20, 2015', 'http://thefloridachannel.org/videos/12015-senate-ethics-elections-committee/'), ('Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections, Position paper on online voter registration, Dec. 11, 2014', 'No link'), ('Florida Senate, Bill 228 Online Voter Application, Filed Jan. 5, 2015', 'http://www.myfloridaelections.org/ew_pages/fsase__position_paperovr_application.pdf'), ('Presidential Commission on Election Administration, ""The American Experience: Report and recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration,"" Jan. 9, 2014', 'No link'), ('Republican National Lawyers Association, Response to the report and recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration, April 10, 2014', 'http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_s0228__.DOCX&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=0228&Session=2015'), ('Pew Charitable Trusts, ""Understanding online voter registration,"" January 2014', 'No link'), ('Florida Division of Elections, Third-party voter registration organization summary, Sept. 1, 2014', 'https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2014/01/Amer-Voting-Exper-final-draft-01-09-14-508.pdf'), ('David Becker op-ed in Boston Herald, ""Elections’ benefit from states use of technology,"" Nov. 4, 2014', 'No link'), ('Verified Voting, Voter registration technology, Accessed Jan. 21, 2015', 'http://www.rnla.org/pecaresponse.pdf'), ('Washington Post, ""Maryland’s online voter registration vulnerable to attack, researchers say,"" Oct. 16, 2012', 'No link'), ('Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog, ""FDLE closes second voter registration fraud case involving GOP vendor, makes no arrests,"" June 20, 2013', 'http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/Assets/2014/01/28/Understanding_Online_Voter_Registration.pdf?la=en'), ('PolitiFact Florida, ""One of the ‘main functions’ of the Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE database is ‘checking voter registration citizenship status’ Ken Detzner says,’"" Nov. 14, 2013', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Florida, ""Mickey Mouse was registered to vote in Florida, Republican House member claims,"" April 26, 2011', 'http://election.dos.state.fl.us/pdf/DE-Guide-0012_Third-Party-Voter-Registration-Organizations.pdf'), ('Interview, Sen.

CEO of Carl's Jr. says 'Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time'
","Critics of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s health care law, have assembled a long list of complaints about the law. One provision that’s getting increasing scrutiny these days is the penalty on employers who don’t provide their workers with health insurance. For workers who are on the job at least 30 hours per week, companies must offer health coverage or be hit with a financial penalty. The Obama administration twice delayed enforcement of this requirement, but it finally took effect this month for companies with at least 100 workers, and it is set to start next year for companies with between 50 and 99 workers. (The rule will not apply to small businesses with fewer than 50 workers.) Some Republicans have urged changing the rule so the cutoff is 40 hours a week, rather than 30. The House has passed a bill to do that; it’s now heading to the Senate, though the White House has pledged to veto it. A reader asked us to check out a Jan. 13 column on this topic in the Wall Street Journal. It was written by Andy Puzder, the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants, which is the parent company of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. In the column, Puzder explained his company’s thought process about whether and how it should provide health coverage to its employees. Puzder’s column makes clear that he’s no fan of the Affordable Care Act, particularly the employer mandate: ""So what does Obamacare’s 30-hour rule accomplish? Some would argue that it does a lot, pointing to the previously uninsured who now have employer-sponsored health insurance. In our company, that would be 2 percent of total employees and 6 percent of eligible employees. ""For results like that, Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time, imposed a tax on lower-income workers who cannot afford it, forced millions of people out of insurance they liked, restricted access to doctors for millions of others, and created an enormous bureaucracy that discourages our doctors and nurses while suppressing health-care system innovation."" Here, we’ll take a look at just one of these claims -- that ""Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time."" The bottom line, we found, is that there isn’t enough data to state a number with any specificity. Suggesting that it’s ""millions,"" as Puzder did, is speculative -- something he acknowledged to PolitiFact. At the same time, the number of people experiencing a cut in hours isn’t trivial, with informed estimates putting it into the low hundreds of thousands of people. Puzder elaborates When we reached out to Puzder, he sent us a detailed response. (We’ve posted the full text of it here, but we’ll excerpt it in this article.) Puzder acknowledged that ""there is no definitive data available"" on the question. That said, ""there is also nothing definitive to the contrary of which I am aware,"" he added. Puzder noted -- and other economists agree -- that employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is imperfect for answering this question. The BLS threshold in hours per week for ""full-time"" employment is different than it is for the Affordable Care Act. In addition, BLS counts someone who works two 20-hour-a-week part time jobs as one full-time worker. Both of these factors complicate any calculations using BLS data. The available evidence is also murky for another reason: It’s impossible to tell whether any changes actually stem from the Affordable Care Act, as opposed to the labor-market dynamics of the recovery to the Great Recession. However, Puzder provided some anecdotal evidence from his own sector -- restaurant chains -- that suggests a plausible case for ""millions."" Many restaurant chains, he noted, are operated as franchises. In his own company’s case, 230 franchisees own 73 percent of the company’s 2,920 restaurants in the United States; the company itself owns the rest. While the parent company employs about 20,000 people, its domestic franchisees employ many more -- about 55,000. And industry leaders like McDonalds and Burger King have more franchises and franchise employees. The disparate nature of franchise ownership makes it difficult to calculate the number of workers who may have had their hours cut. Based on his own experience at his company and the conversations he’s had with other industry CEOs, Puzder thinks it’s reasonable (but, he acknowledges, unscientific) to assume that 20 percent to 25 percent of their operational employees have had their hours cut to under 30 per week due to the employer mandate. And if that’s the case, the math adds up quickly. The International Franchise Association counted nearly 8.1 million employees in 2012, working at 750,000 franchise establishments. If these franchise employers lowered the hours of 20 percent of these employees, that would equal 1.6 million employees. Adjusting the hours for 15 percent would impact 1.2 million. And this number doesn’t include employees of the parent company; nor does it include the employees of retail companies that do not franchise. Puzder also referenced a data set being compiled by Jed Graham, a journalist with Investor’s Business Daily. (Editorially, Graham’s publication has argued firmly against the Affordable Care Act, but several of the economists we checked with said Graham’s information is valuable.) When we accessed Graham’s database in January 2015, he had documented just over 450 employers that had made cuts to work hours or staffing levels as a result of Obamacare. However, this list by itself doesn’t get to ""millions,"" and because it has been compiled anecdotally rather than using scientific sampling, it can’t simply be scaled up to estimate a national figure. (We’ll also note that a full 81 percent of the employers that made cuts documented by his list are government entities; the share of private companies, which were the the focus of Puzder’s op-ed, accounted for just 19 percent of his list.) What all this means is that it’s easy build a scenario in which ""millions"" of workers could see their hours cut. But neither Puzder nor our own research has produced incontrovertible evidence that it has actually happened. What the data shows That said, it’s likely that the law is having some impact on part-time hours, albeit a smaller one than ""millions."" • One study -- authored by Bowen Garrett of the Urban Institute and Robert Kaestner of the University of Illinois and published by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation -- found a modest (0.6 percentage-point) increase in the share of employees working part-time during the first seven months of 2014 compared to what would typically be expected based on previous economic recoveries. However, the authors attributed this finding to the dynamics of the recovery from the Great Recession, rather than to the Affordable Care Act. Ultimately, they found little change during the run-up to the implementation of the employer mandate -- an indication that the provision wasn’t having a big effect on pushing workers involuntarily into part-time work. • Another study, by Helene Jorgensen and Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, did find a ""small rise"" in the share of employees working 25 to 29 hours a week during the first half of 2013 -- but this bump came at the expense of those working fewer than 25 hours a week, not at the expense of those working 30 or more hours a week. That’s not the dynamic one would expect if Obamacare was pushing employers to cut hours. • Neither of the previous two studies offered hard estimates of how many workers saw their hours cut. But one analysis did -- one written by Ben Casselman, the chief economics writer at the website fivethirtyeight.com. When Casselman looked at the data, he found that the proportion of part-time workers working just below 30 hours a week had been rising for about two years, while the share working just over 30 hours was falling. That’s consistent with the trend Puzder pointed to. Here’s a chart that accompanied his story:  Overall, Casselman concluded that ""the health law has likely led a few hundred thousand workers to see their hours cut or capped. That’s small in the context of an economy with 150 million workers. But it isn’t a minor issue for those workers. Most of them are among the economy’s most vulnerable: low-wage, part-time workers who likely have few other options."" Several economists we checked with said Casselman’s estimate of ""a few hundred thousand"" was more plausible than Puzder’s ""millions."" ""I think we can safely say that at this point it's clearly not ‘millions,’ because that size shift would be noticeable in the aggregate data,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. "" ‘A few hundred thousand’ seems a lot more plausible."" It’s worth noting that Casselman’s ""a few hundred thousand"" and Puzder’s ""millions"" are not apples-to-apples figures. Casselman included employees who were already working part-time when their hours were cut, not just those who (as Puzder wrote) saw their full-time jobs shrink to part-time jobs. So Casselman’s figure may actually overstate the number of employees who saw their jobs specifically shift from full-time to part-time. That makes it even harder to reach the ""millions"" threshold. Possible benefits Finally, several of the economists told us that focusing only on the negative aspects of Obamacare-inspired changes in working hours painted an incomplete picture. While it’s true that the law hurts employees who would like to work longer hours, the law also aids unemployed workers who are only too happy to work in newly created part-time jobs, as well as older workers who would like to retire but haven’t yet reached Medicare age and individuals who prefer part-time work and no longer have to take full-time jobs in order to secure health insurance. Indeed, the law makes it easier for Americans to start businesses on their own, since they are able to leave jobs where they work for someone else and still be able to secure affordable health care for themselves and their families. And it may be having that effect: Baker noticed that during the final quarter of 2014, the number of self-employed Americans rose by a whopping 400,000 compared to the previous year’s fourth quarter. Those 400,000 jobs are not counted in the widely reported BLS job-creation numbers, which only survey companies with payrolls. Our ruling Puzder said that ""Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time."" The statistics, in this case, are inadequate to either prove or disprove that ""millions"" of Americans have seen their job go from full-time to part-time due to the law. That number is possible, but unsupported. That said, there’s evidence suggesting that hundreds of thousands of workers may have seen their hours cut as the law’s impact began to be felt. That’s not ""millions,"" but it’s not insignificant either.
