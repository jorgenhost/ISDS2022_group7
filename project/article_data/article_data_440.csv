Hillary Clinton says immigration reform will add $700 billion to U.S. economy
","Hillary Clinton supports plans by President Barack Obama to defer deportation for millions of people in the country illegally, she said at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual gala Sept. 15. But there is more to do beyond defending the programs, the Democratic presidential nominee said, such as closing private detention facilities and stopping immigration raids and roundups. ""No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning, not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home,"" Clinton said. ""So here's the bottom line: Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy, and enable America to be what it's always been, a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation."" We wondered, will an overhaul of the immigration system add $700 billion to the U.S. economy? What we found is that Clinton is citing a reputable estimate, but experts say she ignores the time frame of the economic impact and just what is producing the influx of new money. Clinton’s source Clinton’s campaign said the figure came from a November 2014 fact sheet from the White House on the economic benefits of immigration reform. ""The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that enacting the Senate immigration reform bill would increase real GDP relative to current law projections by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033 – an increase of roughly $700 billion and $1.4 trillion, respectively, in today’s dollars,"" the White House said. The CBO in 2013 estimated the economic impact of a version of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) -- commonly known as the ""Gang of Eight"" bill. The measure, written by four Democratic and four Republican senators, passed the Senate but died in the House. The CBO said calculating the economic impact of the legislation was tricky and questionable. Yet the report says S.744 ""would boost economic output"" and increase real (inflation-adjusted) GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033. It also projects a U.S. population increase of 10 million by 2023 and 16 million by 2033. Changes in direct spending and revenues would also decrease federal budget deficits by $197 billion from 2014 to 2023 and by nearly $700 billion from 2024 to 2033, the report said. Overall, CBO found that enacting the 2013 bill would:  • Increase the size of the labor force (about 6 million in 2023 and 9 million in 2033) and employment  • Decrease wages through 2024, but increase them in 2025 and later years  • Slightly increase unemployment rate through 2020, but no effect on unemployment rate after 2020  • Raise labor productivity and capital (increase in high-skilled immigrants would lead to technological advancements, including new inventions and improvements in production processes)  • Increase amount of capital investment (return on investment would be higher under the proposed legislation)  • Result in higher interest rates (with a greater rate of earnings on investments, federal government ""would face higher interest rates than under current law because it would be competing with the private sector for investors’ money) Caveats The biggest caveat with Clinton’s claim, experts say, is just where that new money would come from. George J. Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues and professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the $700 billion increase in GDP would be almost entirely captured by new immigrants migrating to America. ""Practically all of that increase in GDP would need to be paid to the immigrants as wages and salaries. They are not going to work for free,"" Borjas said. What really matters, Borjas said, is the ""immigration surplus"" — which is the benefit accruing to the native-born population. About 98 percent of the increase in GDP due to immigration goes to immigrant salaries, and about 2 percent goes to natives already living in the United States, Borjas estimates. ""Then the question becomes: who did Hillary refer to when she said ‘our economy’? I take it, in the context of a political speech, that means us — the current population of the United States that is voting in November,"" Borjas said. ""I don’t think she meant the future immigrants who have yet to arrive. And, as a result, I would say the statement is false."" On the flip side, immigration reform would allow people currently living in the United States illegally additional opportunities for advancement, said David Dyssegaard Kallick, a senior fellow and director of the Immigration Research Initiative at Fiscal Policy Institute. A pathway to citizenship would mean currently undocumented immigrants would have greater potential for advancement and result in more productive employees, Kallick said. ""Making sure workers can’t be taken advantage of by employers wouldn’t hurt, either, pushing businesses to compete based on higher productivity rather than evasion of the law,"" he said. Lastly, any GDP increase would not be automatic. The CBO projected it would take 10 years to increase the GDP by $700 billion. And while $700 billion sounds like a lot, it would remain a tiny fraction of the country’s GDP, which today is nearing $18 trillion. Our ruling Clinton said immigration legislation ""will add $700 billion to our economy."" Clinton’s statement stems from 2013 estimates of the stalled ""Gang of Eight"" bill. But that bill couldn't pass, and there's no telling what a future version might look like or mean for the U.S. economy. A Congressional Budget Office report found that if the 2013 bill was enacted, gross domestic product would increase by 3.3 percent in 2023, or roughly $700 billion. Clinton omitted that timeframe in her statement. The report acknowledges that determining economic impact of immigration policies is complex and can be ""uncertain."" While immigration scholars say the $700 billion estimate is a reasonable estimate, some say increases in GDP would mostly go toward future immigrants, not the current population. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab010bac-02c2-4be5-a5ac-adfa943e1569",/factchecks/2016/sep/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-say-immigration-reform-will-add-70/

Trump: U.S. spends more than 'almost any other major country' on education
","While Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was campaigning recently in Cleveland -- not for the first time, and surely not the last down the election’s home stretch -- he made a stop at a charter school. Public schools, he said, are wasting taxpayers’ money. ""Let’s run through the numbers. At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion dollars on K-12 education each year,"" Trump said on Sept. 8, 2016. ""That’s an average of about $12,296 dollars for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools. The federal government pays for about 10 percent of the K-12 costs. The other roughly $560 billion dollars spent on K -12 education comes from the states themselves. We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. And we’re doing very poorly in terms of A-list."" Back in January, Trump made a similar statement about U.S. education spending, saying we were ""No. 1 per-pupil by a factor of four."" PolitiFact rated the statement Mostly False because it is exaggerated. This new claim is a bit more tempered. Does the United States spend more per student than other major countries? ""The question is, how do you define ‘major?’"" said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom. He is a proponent of cutting federal involvement in K-12 education. McCluskey relies on data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,  a consortium of 34 member countries that share internationally comparable statistical, economic and social data. Their education statistics from 2012 were the most up-to-date available at the time of Trump’s statement. According to the OECD, Switzerland spends the most per student at $15,500 per student, followed by Norway, and then the United States. Switzerland ranks first on the Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks economic strength. Norway is a not-too-shabby 11th place. The United States is third.  The United States’ per-student expenditure at the elementary/secondary level was 31 percent higher than the OECD’s average of $9,000. ""It certainly is the case that we spend more than almost any country except Norway and Switzerland,"" McCluskey said. ""Very few countries outspend us in terms of absolute numbers. The United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, they all spend less than we do. I suppose you could say they’re all major."" Trump’s financial figures -- $620 billion on K-12 education nationally, $12,296 per student, on average -- match the totals reported by the National Center on Education Statistics. A conclusion from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a test administered to 15-year-old students in 65 countries, called out the United States for high spending and underperforming. ""While the U.S. spends more per student than most countries, this does not translate into better performance,"" it read. American students’ scores on the test were mediocre. In math, American 15-year-olds ranked No. 26 out of the 34 participating countries. That concurs with Trump’s assessment that ""we’re doing very poorly,"" education-wise. ""For a country that spends as much as we do, you’d think we’d have better outcomes,"" McCluskey said. Our ruling Trump said that in the United States spends ""more per student than almost any other major country in the world."" Trump’s assertion that U.S. taxpayers don’t get enough bang for their relative buck, when our students’ test scores are ranked worldwide, checks out. The most recent numbers put the United States at third for government spending on education, behind Switzerland and Norway.

RNC makes weak case that 'over the past eight years, black youth unemployment is up'
","In recent weeks, Donald Trump has sought to make inroads with African-American voters, a group that overwhelmingly favors Hillary Clinton. Trump has argued that after decades of loyalty to the Democratic Party, black voters should consider voting Republican because the system is broken and ""what the hell do you have to lose?"" Seeking to boost Trump’s message, the Republican National Committee sent a blast email on Sept. 17, 2016, responding to Clinton’s remarks at a dinner for the Congressional Black Caucus. (It’s archived here on the RNC website.) A portion of the email said, ""Over the past eight years, black youth unemployment is up."" This struck us as odd, because the overall unemployment rate has plunged from a high of 10 percent in October 2009 to 4.9 percent in August 2016. Has African-American youth unemployment really moved in precisely the opposite direction as the nation as a whole? We’ve heard talking points like this before, from Democrat Bernie Sanders and Trump himself. Their veracity really depends on how they were phrased. In this case, the RNC is cherry-picking and misinterpreting old research by the liberal Economic Policy Institute, specifically a chart that tracked the ""high school graduates age 17–20 who are not enrolled in further schooling."" According to the chart, the rate rose from 44.8 percent in January 2009 to 51.3  percent in March 2015. But unemployment is not underemployment. ""High school graduates age 17–20 who are not enrolled in further schooling"" isn’t the same thing as all black youths. And unemployment generally has declined since March 2015. ""I'm sure the RNC can cherry-pick an age group or an ‘underemployment rate’ definition for which the situation has worsened,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. But using the standard BLS statistics, he said, the labor-market situation for African-American youths ""has improved since the president took office."" Checking the numbers We looked at the unemployment rate over time for two groups of African-Americans -- one broader (ages 16 to 24) and the other narrower (20 to 24). Both ranges would seem to fit the email’s broad definition of ""black youth."" Here’s what we found when we took the annual average black youth unemployment rate for ages 16 to 24 -- the broader of the two age ranges we looked at -- going back to 2009. This shows that African-American youth unemployment has been going down -- not up -- consistently since 2010 (Obama’s second year in office) and is well below what it was in 2009 (his first year in office). To be precise, the average unemployment rate for black youth fell from nearly 29 percent in 2009 to a bit below 18 percent in 2016. That’s a decline of more than one-third in the unemployment rate over the roughly eight-year period. In fact, 2016 marks the lowest August rate on record since the statistics were first calculated in the early 1970s, said Jed Kolko, chief economist for the jobs site Indeed. The pattern also holds for African-Americans age 20 to 24. Here’s the equivalent graph: Using this narrower age range, the average annual black youth unemployment rate fell from about 25 percent in 2009 to about 15 percent in 2016. So it fell by about two-fifths of its original level over eight years. Our ruling In an email blast, the Republican National Committee said that ""over the past eight years, black youth unemployment is up."" The RNC has pointed to one narrow comparison that shows a higher rate today than in 2009. But the email seeks to paint this specific subset as illustrative of all ""black youth unemployment,"" and it’s not. The broadest, most standard statistics show that black youth unemployment has declined by one-third or more since the 2009, when Obama took office. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/21/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-weak-over-past-eight-years-black-youth-unempl/

Did California spend $5 billion to execute 13 people?
"," California billionaire and potential gubernatorial candidate Tom Steyer joined the debate over ending the state’s death penalty last week by repeating a questionable claim. ""Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death,"" Steyer said in a press release announcing his support for Proposition 62. The measure would abolish capital punishment in the state. Proposition 66, a competing measure on November’s ballot, would keep the death penalty but proposes speeding up its appeals process. There’s no doubt California’s death penalty system is slow and expensive: But $5 billion to execute 13 people? We decided to fact-check that suspect claim. Our research There are more than 700 people on California’s death row, which the Yes on 62 campaign has correctly claimed is the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere. The state has paid incarceration and court costs for all of those inmates, not just the few that have been executed since California reinstated the death penalty in 1978. Steyer based his ‘$5 billion to execute 13 people’ claim on information from the Yes on 62 campaign, according to his spokesman. The campaign has made the death penalty’s high cost a central part of its argument for abolishing executions. The Yes campaign made the same claim as Steyer in a September 12 Facebook post.  The Yes on 62 campaign posted this image on its Facebook page on Sept. 12, 2016.   The Yes on 62 campaign made the same claim on Twitter on Sept. 16, 2016.  It published a more accurate and nuanced statement on its website: ""Since 1978, California taxpayers have paid $5 billion to maintain the death penalty and death row, and executed 13 people."" The Yes on 62 campaign says it extrapolated the $5 billion estimate from a report by California’s Loyola Law School in 2011 that placed the cost of the state’s entire death penalty system at $4 billion. One of the report’s authors, Paula Mitchell, told PolitiFact California that the $5 billion figure is her updated estimate for how much state and federal taxpayers have spent on California’s entire death penalty system since 1978, not just on cases for the 13 people who have been executed. Mitchell said Steyer and the Yes on 62 campaign left out this key context in their claims. ""I think the way to fairly characterize the expense is to say we’ve spent $5 billion on a system that has produced only 13 executions since 1978,"" said Mitchell, who heads Loyola’s Project for the Innocent and is an adjunct professor. Representatives for the No on 62 campaign rejected the claim by Steyer, noting costs are spread across ""a much larger number of cases."" They also called the $5 billion estimate in Mitchell’s report ""a wildly inflated number.""  A guard stands watch over the east block of death row at San Quentin State Prison Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, in San Quentin, Calif. A pair of November ballot measures will decide the future of the death penalty in California. As of Aug. 1, 2016, there were 700 condemned inmates at the prison. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Wildly inflated? We dug a bit deeper to examine whether Steyer not only wrongly attributed the entire cost of the death penalty system to 13 cases, but also used a ""wildly inflated"" cost estimate. Mitchell, who is an advocate for abolishing capital punishment, said she’s worked with the Yes on 62 campaign to discuss death penalty cost estimates. She said her estimates are derived from the cost of pre-trial investigations, trials, appeals and incarceration. Her report cites figures from the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, among other sources. Frank Zimring, a law professor and death penalty expert at UC Berkeley, said he’s relied on the report in the past and finds the cost estimate credible, ""give or take a hundred million or so."" Cost comparison Mitchell’s said her current $5 billion cost estimate represents the amount taxpayers spent ""above what it would have cost us"" without the death penalty. Her report could not reach a conclusion, she said, on how much a life in prison system would have cost taxpayers over the same period. On average, it cost $47,000 per year to incarcerate a prison inmate in California during the 2008-2009 fiscal year, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. The cost to house a death row inmate, however, is $90,000 more per year than for an inmate in the general prison population, said Mitchell. She attributed the higher cost to lengthy and complex death row court cases. Death penalty court cases cost more than others, in part, because more attorneys are legally required to participate and more investigation is required. Costs also mount because death penalty appeals must be heard by the California Supreme Court, which has only seven justices. That creates a bottleneck, Mitchell said, where each case can stretch a decade or more. Without the death penalty, Zimring said the cost of trials and appeals would be ""vastly less."" Our ruling Tom Steyer said recently: ""Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death."" But that cost has been spread over hundreds of cases since 1978, not just the 13 that led to executions. California currently has more than 700 inmates on death row. Prosecuting and housing each costs the state significantly year after year. Steyer’s claim might have been correct if he had said taxpayers have spent $5 billion on a system that’s resulted in 13 executions. Instead, his words leave the impression California paid the entire $5 billion for a fraction of its hundreds of cases. We rate Steyer's claim Mostly False.

PAC wrongly claims Russ Feingold was only vote against Homeland Security Department
","A TV ad from Let America Work, a single-candidate super PAC that supports Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson for re-election, paints Democratic challenger Russ Feingold as someone who weakened the military during his 18 years in the Senate. Feingold, the narrator states, ""voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times"" -- a claim Johnson made that we rated Half True. Feingold did vote 11 times against an annual bill that authorizes defense spending levels and covers policy issues. But those were not votes to defund the military, given that it takes appropriations bills to provide funding. And lawmakers sometimes oppose the annual measure because of policy provisions included in it.

The ad, released Sept. 1, 2016, continues with words on the screen that say Feingold was the ""only senator to vote against military intelligence"" and the ""only senator to vote against Homeland Security."" The two claims are essentially fleshed out by the narrator saying: ""Feingold voted against the Patriot Act and against creating the Department of Homeland Security."" Feingold is well known for casting the lone vote against the USA Patriot Act, the 2001 anti-terrorism law introduced by U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, in his rematch with Johnson, Feingold has done a fundraising appeal explaining his vote. But did Feingold cast the only vote against creating the Department of Homeland Security? No. As reported by the New York Times at the time, the Senate voted in 2002 to ""reorganize broad elements of a scattered federal government around a focused response to terrorism,"" with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security being ""Washington's biggest transformation in 50 years."" ""Not since Congress and the Truman administration upended the nation’s military apparatus to fight the cold war in 1947 has the government been reshaped so dramatically around a single purpose,"" the Times said. The department ""will slowly begin to absorb 22 of Washington's signature functions, including immigration, border protection, emergency management, intelligence analysis and the protection of the president himself."" The roll call vote on the Homeland Security Act shows the measure passed 90-9. Feingold was one of the nine, along with fellow Democrats Daniel Akaka of Alaska, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Carl Levin of Michigan and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. (James Jeffords, a Vermont independent, also voted no, while Frank Murkowski of Alaska was not present. Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl voted yes.) Feingold’s campaign responded to the ad the same day, issuing a statement saying Feingold voted no because the bill contained ""unrelated riders."" The statement included this excerpt from his book, ""While America Sleeps"": Using the same tactics as the drafters of the Patriot Act, the backers knew they could grab a victory on some unrelated agenda because the overall bill was what was known in Washington as a must-pass. Such bills, which Congress has almost no choice but to pass, often attract riders like the one that restricted employees’ rights. The Bush administration and the Republicans in the Senate, hungry to regain the majority, pounced with some gusto on the political opportunities this new climate of fear provided. Let America Work didn’t respond to our requests for information. Our rating Let America Work says Feingold was the ""only senator to vote against Homeland Security."" Feingold was one of nine senators who voted against the 2002 law that created the Department of Homeland Security.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Missouri', 'Eric  Greitens']","
Eric Greitens' claim of Democrats investing in primary checks out
","Republican gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens claims Democrats spent $1 million against him just before the August primary election. On an Aug. 11 Fox & Friends appearance, Greitens said, ""We had the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine come into a Republican primary to try and rig the election by spending $1 million against me in the last couple of days."" That number stood out, so we decided to investigate the claim. We reached out to Greitens' campaign staff for more information. Parker Briden, a campaign spokesman, said Greitens was referring to television attack ads aired against Greitens right before the primary. Campaign finance records Briden referred us to Missouri campaign finance reports filed by the Chris Koster campaign detailing contributions from Jobs and Opportunity, a political action committee. Koster won the Democratic primary for governor and will square off against Greitens in the general election in November. Beginning two weeks before the Aug. 8 primary, the PAC made four ""in-kind"" contributions — contributions of goods and services and not cash — to Koster for Missouri, Koster's campaign. The in-kind contributions carried a total valuation of over $1 million, according to the reports filed by the Koster with the Missouri Ethics Commission. The largest contribution was reported as $713,082, made on July 29. The same week, two other contributions were made — one valued at $112,560, and another for $150,080. On Aug. 5, three days before the election, the committee made a final contribution valued at $25,710.82. After the donations were made, the Greitens campaign issued a press release titled ""Koster Caught in Conspiracy to Hijack Republican Primary."" ""This is an attempt by national Democrats to steal an election in Missouri through meddling in the Republican primary,"" the release read. Attack ad The reported contributions coincided with a series of television ads attacking Greitens that aired in the five days before the primary. A group called Jobs and Opportunity is credited for paying for the ad. A YouTube video of the ad was posted on July 29, about a week before the primary. According to Koster's campaign finance expenditures, his campaign normally pays between $500,000 and $700,000 for media advertising. No other single campaign expenditure comes close to that amount. That puts the PAC's contribution in perspective — it's unlikely a $1 million in-kind contribution would buy anything else. The ad lambastes Greitens for accepting a separate $1 million contribution from Michael Goguen, a California-based tech financier. Goguen is the subject of a pending civil lawsuit with a woman who has accused him of sexual abuse. ""While others returned his money, Greitens says he's honored to take it,"" the ad's narrator says. Greitens is right: the Democratic Governors Association is behind money given to his Democratic opponent. The Washington, D.C. address for Jobs and Opportunity that the Koster campaign reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission is also the address for the Democratic Governors Association. A week before the election, Jobs and Opportunity made a $1 million in-kind contribution to Koster, which coincided with a TV ad attacking Greitens. Although the political action committee is unaffiliated with Koster’s campaign, Koster's campaign had some knowledge of the ad before it aired, since the in-kind contribution was listed on Koster's campaign finance report. PACs that act independently from a candidate do not have to report contributions to that candidate's campaign, said James Thomas, the campaign treasurer for Catherine Hanaway, who was a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the primary. But when the PAC is in contact with the candidate, related contributions need to be reported. For example, the PAC could have discussed when the ad's content or when it would be aired with Koster's campaign, Thomas said. Since Missouri has no limits on campaign contributions, it's okay that the PAC talked to Koster's campaign. It would be a different story if this were a federal election, though, Thomas said. Federal PACs can only contribute $5,000 to a candidate, so Jobs and Opportunity’s $1 million in-kind contribution would be illegal. On July 31, Greitens released an ad in response to the PAC's ad. In the ad, which has since drawn national attention, Greitens fires rounds of a machine gun into an open field. ""Eric Greitens is under attack from Obama's Democrat machine,"" the narrator of the ad says. ""When he fights back, he brings out the big guns."" After the primary, Greitens said no other Democratic groups launched attack ads against any other Republican gubernatorial candidate, according to the Associated Press. We also asked Austin Chambers, Greitens' campaign manager, why Greitens repeatedly cited President Barack Obama's involvement in the ad buy. And though Koster's donations were big, they were legal, despite Greitens' press release connoting Koster's involvement in illegal activity. Koster's campaign directed all questions to the spokesman for the PAC. Marvin Overby, an MU political science professor, said large donations like the PAC's are common before an election. ""This happens a lot. It's just part of the rough and tumble of politics,"" he said. ""I'm not sure the Greitens' campaign wouldn't have done the same thing."" Our ruling Greitens said the Democratic Governors Association and ""the Obama political machine"" spent $1 million against him leading up to the primary election. A PAC with the same address as the Democratic Governors Association made four in-kind contributions totaling that amount in the weeks leading up to the election. And though both Obama and the PAC hired the same company to work on their ads, there's no evidence to support Greiten's statement that the ""Obama political machine"" colluded with the PAC. We rate this claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/21/eric-greitens/greitens-claim-democrats-investing-primary-checks-/

Former Rep. Tancredo incorrectly says eight Americans died in knife attack at Minnesota mall
","In a fundraising email for a ""Secure Our Borders Gun Giveaway,"" former Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo's PAC incorrectly said eight people died in a knife attack at a Minnesota. Tancredo, a Republican who represented the 6th Congressional District from 1999 to 2009, is known for his hard-line crusade against illegal immigration and provocative comments. Fortunately, none of the 10 people who were injured died in the Sept. 17 attack at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud. All the victims -- including seven men, one woman and a 15-year-old girl -- have been released from the hospital, the Associated Press reported.     The only person who was killed was the suspected attacker, a young Somali man dressed as a private security guard, who was shot by an off-duty police officer. A Sept. 19 fundraising email promoting Team America PAC's gun giveaway quoted Tancredo, the group's founder and president, saying: ""I mentioned that we live in dangerous times -- and the events of this week only remind us of that fact once more."" ""The threat of radical Islam is higher than ever as the nation mourns the death of eight Americans at the hands of a Somalian refugee in Minnesota,"" the email inaccurately stated.   ""With these continued threats it's important that we do everything in our power to defend ourselves and our families,"" Tancredo said. ""….I can think of no better way to defend yourself and your family than with an H&K P2000, the same gun used by Border Patrol agents."" The email linked to a Team America PAC website where people could enter the ""Gun Giveaway"" sweepstakes for the .40-caliber Heckler & Koch handgun. A Tancredo statement on the contest page said it's being held to ""To encourage Americans to elect candidates for office who will work to secure our border."" ""After you sign up for the giveaway, please consider making a donation of $100, $50, $25 or even $10,"" Tacredo said. ""We can only continue the fight to secure our borders with your help!"" When PolitiFact partner Denver7 notified Tancredo of the factual error in its fundraising email, he said he was aware of the error and issued this correction to PolitiFact and Denver7: ""My email earlier this morning inaccurately portrayed that the attacks in Minnesota led to innocent deaths and not simply the death of the perpetrator. ""Despite that error, the email was correct in stating that these truly are troubling times, a fact furthered by the shootout and arrest of the Afghani bombing suspect in New Jersey just moments ago. ""Please read the email below for more information regarding how you can protect yourself and your family in the face of these attacks by entering Team America PAC's gun giveaway.

U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy's policies will raise utility bills by $500 a year, Koch-backed group says
","An anti-regulation group is accusing U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of wanting to use the Senate to adopt policies that would raise the cost of just about everything, starting with your utility bills. ""Vote against Patrick Murphy,"" reads a mailer we received Sept. 12, 2016, from Americans for Prosperity Florida. ""We can’t afford his ‘Pay More’ agenda."" The flier cautions electricity and grocery prices will go up as wages go down with Murphy in the Senate. ""Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!"" the flier warns. The group behind the attack is the Florida affiliate of the main political committee for the anti-tax industrialists and billionaires Charles and David Koch. We wondered just what Murphy would be planning that would make utility costs go up $500 annually. There’s a tenuous link between what the Jupiter Democrat supports and the future of energy costs, but it’s not nearly as charged as AFP claimed. Shockingly high The ""Pay More"" Murphy nickname, which is being used by AFP in other attacks, is borne of Murphy’s support for President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The plan was a proposed environmental rule announced by the White House in August 2015. The new regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction. We’ll get back to why this is important in a moment.) The idea was largely to promote cleaner sources of energy than coal-fired power plants, fostering more renewable energy while pushing utilities to upgrade existing infrastructure. But the U.S. Supreme Court put the rule on hold on Feb. 9, 2016, in the face of opposition from corporations and industry groups. Murphy has publicly supported its implementation, signing an amicus brief supporting the plan and calling the court’s decision to block the rule ""misguided."" But as a congressman, Murphy has no direct say over the fate of the final rule, which was created by the Obama administration and would be enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency. So what’s this about surging utility prices? Critics of the Clean Power Plan say it would be expensive for utilities to comply with the new emissions standards, and those costs would be passed on to consumers. An array of reports that examine just how much customers may end up paying resulted. AFP’s mailer points to one specific study from a firm called Energy Ventures Analysis. That study said that by 2020, the average Floridian’s annual gas and electric bills could potentially go up by a combined $464 from what they were in 2012. AFP rounded that up to $500, and made the connection that since Murphy supports the plan, he wants your bill to go up. That’s already a stretch, since Murphy has little to do with the Clean Power Plan. But there’s much more to all these analyses, which make a wide range of assertions about how the plan could affect utility customers. Energy Ventures Analysis’ estimate is near the top end of the scale, but the firm told us it’s already outdated. The analysis was done on the proposed Clean Power Plan from 2014 we mentioned before. Revisions have been made to the rule since the initial proposal. A lot has happened in the energy sector since then. Gas prices have dropped, utility rates have changed, electricity demand has largely decreased, and solar and wind energy is in wider use today, among other factors. ""If they (AFP) are linking it to our website, that’s from some time ago, during the original proposal, and that has now changed,"" Energy Ventures Analysis principal Thomas Hewson told PolitiFact Florida. Because of all the factors involved, predictions on how the plan would affect utility rates are in constant flux, he said. Hewson added that the company had since revisited the Clean Power Plan in a 2015 report for the National Mining Association. Energy Ventures Analysis hasn’t re-evaluated utility rates on a state-by-state basis, Hewson said. The National Mining Association study was about wholesale electricity prices, although it did say those would go up in Florida. Their estimates are on the high end of how much the Clean Power Plan would cost and have been attacked by groups that favor renewable energy. The Natural Resources Defense Council called Energy Ventures Analysis, which has some ties to the coal industry, a ""fossil industry mouthpiece."" Few other studies look at the specific impact on individual states, although most say the plan’s results largely depend on how utilities in individual states supply their power and charge their customers. Those decisions are usually made on a state level, and can drastically change how the Clean Power Plan’s standards come into play. Some of the rosier reports are the complete opposite of the Energy Venture Analysis study. The group Advanced Energy Economy predicted there will be no real change to energy prices at all in Florida. The EPA’s own analysis predicted that the plan will eventually result in electricity prices going down, although most groups predict a modest increase. ""Our modeling shows average annual changes in Florida retail prices of less than 1 percent between the baseline and the policy,"" said Dallas Burtraw, senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that tracks energy policy. ""Our results are consistent with those from the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Nicholas Institute (at Duke University)."" Our ruling Americans For Prosperity Florida said, ""Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!"" The group is attempting to link Murphy’s support for the Clean Power Plan to the possibility of higher gas and electric rates for consumers. But Murphy has no control over the rule, and the study AFP cited is disputed and outdated. Economic impacts of the Clean Power Plan, which is currently on hold by order of the U.S. Supreme Court, are a hotly debated subject with no clear result. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/20/americans-prosperity-florida/us-rep-patrick-murphys-policies-will-raise-utility/

David Jolly attacks Charlie Crist for saying Alabama chain gang was a 'great sight'
","During a congressional debate, Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly attacked his Democratic opponent Charlie Crist for a proposal to bring chain gangs to Florida when Crist served as a Republican state senator. At a televised debate in St. Petersburg Sept. 19, 2016, moderators from the Tampa Bay Times and 10 News WTSP allowed the candidates to ask the other a question. Crist declined, saying he’d rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to paint a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida’s first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation. ""You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in chains, on their knees, on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight. Saying we needed to bring it to Florida,"" Jolly said. ""And you did this — whether you know or not — on the eve of Juneteenth, the day the African-American community celebrates the end of slavery."" Crist replied that he was in favor of chain gangs because of the state’s high crime rate at the time (we fact-checked Crist’s rebuttal). He called Jolly’s insinuation that race had anything to do with it ""appalling."" Did Crist loom over black prisoners in chains and call it ""a great sight""? Jolly is right about Crist taking a trip to Alabama to view work crews in that state, but his details need to be revisited. Crist in Alabama Crist earned the moniker ""Chain Gang Charlie"" by being a champion of bringing chained prison work crews back to Florida, a practice not used since 1946. He sponsored a state Senate bill allowing chain gangs during the 1995 legislative session. Despite criticism that making humans work in chains was inhumane and echoed the days of slavery, the idea gained traction in the state Legislature. In May 1995, he tacked his Senate bill onto an omnibus corrections bill as an amendment, and it passed. ""The Department of Corrections shall implement a plan by Dec. 1, 1995, to require that selected inmates perform labor wearing leg irons in chain gang work groups,"" the measure read. The next month, Crist and state Corrections Secretary Harry Singletary, who had reluctantly agreed to the chain gangs provision, visited the state of Alabama, which had earlier revived the practice. Jolly said the visit was on ""the eve of Juneteenth,"" the anniversary of the June 19, 1865, announcement of the abolition of slavery in Texas. At least one newspaper (the New Orleans Times-Picayune) did run a Cox News Service story about the visit on June 18. But Crist and Singletary actually visited Decatur, Ala., on June 8, the same day the Associated Press snapped the photograph to which Jolly is referring (see above). In the photo, Crist and Singletary are shown watching over at least four inmates having their legs chained together prior to starting work. It’s difficult to determine the races of the inmates in the 21-year-old, black and white photograph, but it was clear from coverage that the vast majority of inmates in the work program were African-American. According to the Cox News Service article, which ran in the Palm Beach Post on June 11, 1995, Crist did say he wanted to bring a similar program to Florida, but he did not call it ""a great sight,"" as Jolly alleged. Jolly spokeswoman Sarah Bascom pointed to that article, in which the reporter wrote, ""For Crist, it was a mighty fine sight."" But that’s the reporter writing, not Crist talking. The story later quotes Crist as saying, ""I see justice. I see justice being done."" In an Associated Press story that accompanied the photo, Crist said, ""I’m very impressed by what I’ve seen so far."" Singletary, meanwhile, had agreed to enforce the law, but was cool to the idea of chaining prisoners together. He said during the trip that he favored chaining a prisoner’s ankles, but not linking a group of people, as Crist and other lawmakers had envisioned. (Crist’s 1997 plan to have chained groups of inmates work along state highways was not heard in committee.) Eventually, the state prison system began the program in December 1995 using only leg irons, calling the groups of inmates ""restricted labor squads"" instead of chain gangs. Our ruling Jolly said, Crist ""stood there, over three African-American prisoners in chains, on their knees, on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight. Saying we needed to bring it to Florida. And you did this — whether you know or not — on the eve of Juneteenth, the day the African-American community celebrates the end of slavery."" Jolly missed the mark on the finer points of the visit and the photograph. Crist went to Alabama to observe chain gangs in action more than a week prior to Juneteenth. He also didn’t say it was ""a great sight,"" although he expressed his approval of the practice. He also wanted to bring the same style of chain gangs to Florida, which had just passed a law allowing it. The Department of Corrections only implemented individual leg irons later that year. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a70ef2b5-29a4-481c-9367-3307b97d5cbe",/factchecks/2016/sep/20/david-jolly/david-jolly-attacks-charlie-crist-saying-alabama-c/

Charlie Crist says Florida was No. 1 in violent crime in the 1990s
","Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist’s past positions as a Republican lawmaker are being brought back to light as Crist seeks to return to elected office as a Democrat. Crist is challenging incumbent Rep. David Jolly, R-Belleair Bluffs, for Florida’s 13th Congressional District, which includes Pinellas County at the western edge of Florida’s pivotal I-4 corridor. At a televised debate in St. Petersburg Sept. 19, 2016, moderators from the Tampa Bay Times and 10 News WTSP allowed the candidates to ask the other a question. Crist declined, saying he’d rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to bring up Crist’s proposal to restore chain gangs to Florida while Crist served as a Republican in the state Senate in the 1990s. Jolly painted a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida’s first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation. ""You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in, chains, on their knees on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight,"" Jolly said to Crist. Jolly closed by asking, ""Did you ever hesitate, or did you just see political opportunity in that moment to be a Republican tough on crime?"" Crist said ""it was beneath"" Jolly to suggest it had something to do with race, and the state needed to be tough given how bad violent crime was in Florida at the time. ""In the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America,""  Crist said. ""The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds,"" Crist added. In a separate fact-check, we examined Jolly’s story about Crist’s visit to Alabama. Here, we are looking at Crist’s rebuttal. When it comes to the facts, Crist is correct on both statistics. Crist’s campaign directed us to data from the Disaster Center, which used FBI Uniform Crime Reports to compare violent crime across states. The data shows from 1991 to 1997, Florida was ranked No. 1 for the rate of violent crimes for every 100,000 people. To calculate the rate of violent crime, you take the total number for each of the violent crime categories (murder, rape, robbery and assault) for every 100,000 population in that year. In 1998, Florida was ranked No. 2., with New Mexico earning the top spot. The number of violent crimes decreased in Florida throughout the 1990s, mirroring a national trend. As for Crist’s other statistic, it was actually happening more often than he said for most of the decade. The year 1993 marked Crist’s first year in the Florida Senate and a record-high amount of violent crimes (161,789). According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement data, a violent crime happened every three minutes and 14 seconds. The figure stretched to three minutes and 19 seconds in 1994, and then to three minutes and 28 seconds in 1995. In 1998, violent crimes were occurring every three minutes and 45 seconds — what Crist said. In 2015, violent crimes happened every five minutes and 37 seconds. Our ruling Crist said, ""in the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America. ... The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds."" Crist is correct on both factual claims. Florida led the nation in the rate of violent crimes per 100,000 population in the mid 1990s. And Florida did see a violent crime committed every three minutes and 45 seconds. In fact, for many years in the 1990s, a violent crime was committed even more often.

Bennet: Glenn said Democrats are 'evil' and he's 'tired of hearing' about reaching across the aisle
","During a U.S. Senate debate in Colorado, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet said his Republican opponent, Darryl Glenn, has said that Democrats are ""evil"" and he's ""tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle.""   The confrontation happened at the end of a Sept. 10 debate at the Club 20 forum in Grand Junction, where three opponents -- Bennett, Glenn and Libertarian candidate Lily Tang Williams -- were allowed to question opponents for three minutes. Bennet, who went last, saved his fire for Glenn, an El Paso County commissioner. ""Over the course of this campaign you said, 'I don't know any elected Democrats I get along with.’ You said, 'I'm running against Democrats, I'm running against evil.’ And you said you're 'tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle,'"" Bennet told Glenn. ""Your policies and views, like privatizing the V.A. and calling for the elimination and defunding of all agencies like the Department of Education and also EPA and Energy, are far to the right of many Colorado Republicans. ""How exactly would you get anything done (in Congress) and live up to your own standards?""  Bennet asked. Glenn didn’t answer the question. Instead he countered that Bennet’s ""idea of reaching across the aisle is supporting the Iran nuclear deal. His idea of reaching across the aisle is having Republicans support the Affordable Care Act when we already know the devastating impact that's happening to people. His idea of reaching across the aisle is supporting EPA standards that are going to result in over 1,200 jobs that are being lost here."" (Watch the exchange at 01:07:00 in the video) In his rebuttal, Bennet said Glenn was wrong and highlighted his bipartisan collaboration on the No Child Left Behind education law and the 2013 immigration bill. In this fact-check, we examine Bennet’s claim that Glenn has described his fight against Democrats as ""running against evil"" and complained about fellow Republicans ""reaching across the aisle."" While Colorado -- like the rest of country -- has passionate political divisions, voters also want their elected leaders to work together for the betterment of the Centennial State. There are more registered independent voters in the state than Republicans or Democrats. Yet, with little money and a shoe-string campaign, Glenn won a surprise upset in a crowded Republican primary. Glenn has repeatedly said that Republicans and Democrats working together is what’s wrong with Congress.   The Denver Post reported that a growing number of Republican strategists are concerned about Glenn's campaign strategy against Bennet and his apparent inability to reach beyond Republican voters. PolitiFact confirmed that Glenn made all the comments quoted by Bennet at the debate -- often repeating his disdain for Republicans who work with Democrats. The Bennet campaign turned a montage of Glenn’s edgy remarks into a video ad called, ""Across the Aisle."" Here's a sampling: ""I'm running against the Democrats. I'm running against evil"" -- Glenn at a North JeffCo Tea Party event, April 16, 2015. ""I don't know any elected Democrats that I get along with"" -- Glenn during a Republican U.S. Senate candidates debate on KUSA-TV, April 5, 2016. ""I'm tired of Republicans complaining. I'm tired of Republicans wanting to just reach across the aisle. We need to stand up and lead"" -- Glenn on KLZ-560 AM on April 11, 2016. Listen to his comments at 2:20 in the interview During a May 25 Republican Senate candidate primary debate on Colorado Public Television, Glenn rebuked a moderator who asked how he'd ""work across party lines and try to find some consensus and some compromise"" and ""get something done"" in a polarized Congress. ""I think your question exemplifies what’s wrong with America and the frustration that's out there. You don't get it,"" Glenn replied. ""The bottom line is it’s not about reaching across the aisle. The bottom line is...leadership. You need to actually have a leader to stand up there and represent the values of what's going on in this country.""  (Watch the exchange at 44:30 in this debate video.)

Our ruling Bennet said that Republican Darryl Glenn has described Democrats as ""evil"" and has said he's ""tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle.""

"['Nevada', 'Education', 'LIBRE Initiative']","
Group correct that Catherine Cortez Masto opposes new school choice program, but fudges details
","The conservative-leaning LIBRE Initiative is using a new school choice program as political ammunition in Nevada’s competitive U.S. Senate race. The grassroots nonprofit, which has financial ties to the billionaire Koch brothers, released a digital ad in English and Spanish on Sept. 13 accusing Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto of opposing an educational program favored by Hispanics. ""Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools,"" the ad says. ""But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it."" The second part of the claim is not in dispute, as Cortez Masto clearly came out in opposition to the program in August, saying it diverts money from public schools. But the ad overstates the Latino support and the number of people who are set to benefit from the ESA program, which has been tied up in lawsuits almost immediately after being passed. ESA 411 Nevada lawmakers approved a bevy of new educational programs in 2015, but one of the most controversial has been the Education Savings Account program. Approved by Republican lawmakers on a party-line vote, the bill creates a program allowing parents to pull their children out of public schools and receive roughly $5,100 (about 90 percent of yearly per-pupil funding) a year to be used for private education expenses — private school tuition, textbooks, transportation, etc. It’s similar to a school voucher system, but program backers say the key difference is that the money is distributed through ""education savings accounts,"" state-run accounts that reimburse parents for approved educational expenses. Other states have created similar programs, but Nevada is unique in that all parents can apply for the program regardless of income or any other factor. Several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union’s Nevada branch, sued before the program could be implemented and successfully had a legal hold placed on the program. The state’s Supreme Court heard arguments on the program in late July, and both sides are still awaiting for a ruling from the court. Total enrollment Constant litigation hasn’t stopped the program from turning into political ad material. The ad text claims that ""more than 450,000 students to benefit from school choice,"" citing a 2015 Lincoln County Register editorial. That’s the total number of students in Nevada (now closer to 467,000), but isn’t anywhere close to the actual number of program applicants, which numbers around 7,800 at the most recent count. The program is open to all students, but it is misleading to say that all of them will ""benefit"" from the program when the number of applicants is so small. LIBRE Initiative spokesman Wadi Gaitan said in an email that continuing legal uncertainty over the program means that the number of applicants is an ""incomplete"" barometer of who the program is helping, as presumably some parents are waiting for the dust to settle before deciding to enroll in the program. The ad’s vocal track differs from the text overlay as well, saying the program would help ""more than 450,000 students access better schools."" Again, there are no barriers for parents to apply for the program, but it’s a bit far-fetched to assume that it will give literally every student in the state access to the school of their choosing given that tuition alone tends to cost more than the projected ESA stipend. Average private school tuition in Las Vegas ranges from $8,700 to $9,600 a year, according to information from privateschoolreview.com. Demographic data released on program applicants shows that the majority of parents applying live in ZIP codes with higher-than-normal average household incomes (though income levels of applicants aren’t disclosed). The ad also cites a 2015 poll funded by the American Federation for Children, a conservative-leaning nonprofit that champions ""school choice."" The group found that 71 percent of Nevada Hispanics polled favored the program. More recent polling found that the program is still supported by voters, though not as strongly as the earlier poll suggests. A KTNV-TV 13 Action News/Rasmussen Reports poll from August found that Hispanic voters polled supported the program on a 47 to 35 percent basis, with 17 percent undecided. Our ruling A new ad from the LIBRE Initiative claims, ""Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools. But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it."" There’s no question that Cortez Masto opposes the ESA program. But the ad exaggerates the size and scope of the program itself. Only a fraction of the state's 450,000 students have actually applied to be part of the program. The ad also accurately cites polls showing Hispanic support for the program, though recent polls show more modest support. Because this ad is accurate but needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/736fb02e-95c9-43ad-a5ea-ec50d5c4839b",/factchecks/2016/sep/19/libre-initiative/group-correct-catherine-cortez-masto-opposes-new-s/

Texas top state for law enforcement deaths in line of duty
","After the July 2016 ambush shootings of five Dallas police officers, there was much discussion about the dangers of police work and if (or how) the shootings, which also wounded nine officers and two civilians, might damage police-community relations. Amid the talk, the Texas Standard, a weekday public-radio program that airs around Texas, drew a claim to U.S. history from Charley Wilkison of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas (CLEAT), a law enforcement advocacy and lobbying group. Laura Rice, interviewing Wilkison, said: ""I wondered if there’s been sort of a heightened sense of fear since Dallas or if officers are also kind of feeling an outpouring of support from communities."" Wilkison, CLEAT’s executive director, replied: ""I think there’s a heightened sense of reality because the fear part, of course officers are trained to deal with that. But Texas has lost the most -- and I say that every time you guys invite me on -- Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America. So that’s absolutely something they (police officers) are aware of coming into the job, coming into the profession."" We wondered if Texas truly is No. 1 by this unfortunate indicator. By phone when we inquired, Wilkison told us his statement was based on figures from the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). He also texted a photo of an ad CLEAT posted to the May 2016 edition of American Police Beat which stated that 1,959 Texas officers had been killed in the line of duty. To our inquiry, the commission’s Ken Mobley, said in an email that the names of ""1,955 law enforcement officers are on the Texas Peace Officer Memorial. These are the individuals who were approved by the commission as per TCOLE rules of eligibility, some (individuals) dating back to the early 1800s."" Wilkison’s figure turned out to be higher than other counts we found of law enforcement deaths for Texas though two other analyses support the notion that Texas leads in officer deaths. As of Sept. 7, 2016, when we looked, the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP) -- which was cited by Wilkison and others as a data source and is curated by a nonprofit that says it’s dedicated to honoring America's fallen law enforcement heroes -- listed Texas’ count at 1,866 officer deaths (plus 12 deaths of K9 dogs) across 27 cause-of-death categories:  SOURCE: Web page, ""Texas Line of Duty Deaths,"" Officer Down Memorial Page,  (accessed Sept. 7, 2016) The group’s Texas tally, which considered deaths as far back as 1837 (before statehood), folded in 1,096 deaths by gunfire including the 1930 death of Uvalde Chief of Police John F. Connor and the July 2016 deaths in Dallas. Another 61 Texas deaths, from 1858 through 2007, were attributed to accidental gunfire. Among other populous states, per the group, California and New York had lost 1,569 and 1,568 officers, respectively, in the line of duty; Illinois had sustained 1,070 such deaths; and Florida had tallied 757 line-of-duty deaths. Seeking other counts, a web search led us to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), which says it’s dedicated to honoring and remembering the service and sacrifice of U.S. law enforcement officers and that as of March 24, 2016, Texas had sustained 1,682 law enforcement deaths--compared to 1,571 in California, 1,375 in New York and 1,013 in Illinois. To our inquiry, a fund spokesman, Steve Groeniger, told us by phone that Wilkison got it right about Texas having the most law enforcement deaths. The fund says on its ""law enforcement facts"" web page: ""New York City has lost more officers in the line of duty than any other department, with 705 deaths. Texas has lost 1,682 officers, more than any other state. The state with the fewest deaths is Vermont, with 23."" Groeniger also mentioned the FBI’s Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted (LEOKA), collected as part of their Uniform Crime Statistics. According to emailed figures provided by Stephen Fischer of the FBI, some 457 officer deaths in Texas since 1980 led other states and accounted for nearly 10 percent of 4,736 officer deaths nationally. California followed closely behind with 436 deaths. Our ruling Wilkison said: ""Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America.""

Will Texas schools lose funding if they keep doors closed amid pandemic?
","Education officials in Texas are grappling with how to safely open schools this fall, as the state continues to report near-record-high coronavirus infections and fatalities. The latest guidance from the state’s education agency gives school districts some flexibility when it comes to opening for in-person instruction. But this decision has raised questions about school funding, which in Texas is tied to attendance. A post shared to the Facebook page of a Dallas-area elementary school said that school districts will lose out on state funding if they do not open their doors for in-person learning this fall. ""(The Texas Education Agency) is allowing online learning with attendance stipulations but will not fund school districts if they do not open their schools,"" reads the post from Wilmer Hutchins Elementary School. ""If schools do not open and are not funded there will be no more teachers or school at all."" The post was removed from the school’s Facebook page after PolitiFact Texas reached out to learn more information, but the question remains: What do the state guidelines have to say about schools opening their doors and how does that relate to school funding? While schools do risk losing state funding if they do not open their doors when the state requires them to do so, it is inaccurate to suggest that all schools that do not open on the state’s timeline will shut down entirely. Examining school funding in Texas Student attendance is a key part of how Texas funds its public schools. With the exception of charter schools, public school districts are funded through a combination of local property taxes and state money, according to Emily Sass, policy director at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. Sass said the state guarantees a certain amount of money per student to each district every year. Depending on how much the district’s local property taxes cover, the state contributes additional funds to ensure each district has a certain amount of funding per child. The number of students that are factored into this calculation comes from average daily attendance for that year, which each district reports to the state. Schools also receive a minor funding allotment per day for students who need extra support, including low-income students and students with disabilities. This means schools with lower attendance rates receive less state funding. What the reopening guidelines say When the coronavirus hit Texas in March, public schools in the state started to close. By mid-April, Gov. Greg Abbott said students would complete the remainder of the spring semester online. Infections, hospitalizations and fatalities started to increase in June, putting the status of the fall school semester in question. The state education agency released its first set of guidelines for the fall semester in early July, detailing requirements for districts in response to the pandemic. The TEA released its most recently updated guidelines on July 17 after pushback from some parents and school districts. The original guidelines as well as the revised guidelines say that public schools must open classrooms for any family wanting a student to learn in person to keep all state funding, even in places where the bulk of learning is happening online. Under the guidelines, if every family at one school opted for online learning this fall, the school would still receive state funding — even if the building is not physically open. But if even one family at a school wants a child to receive in-person instruction, that request must be accommodated in order for the school to maintain its state funding. TEA officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about how much state funding would be affected if a school does not follow these guidelines. The original guidelines released by TEA said this rule does not apply during the first three weeks of school, when districts have the option to limit in-person instruction. The second guidelines, which were released well after the Facebook post was made and deleted, said schools could remain virtual for four weeks with the option of extending to eight weeks with a vote from their local school board. Even with this delay, schools are required to provide on-campus instruction for students who do not have access to broadband internet or computers at home to complete their learning virtually. Local health officials can also order schools to keep their buildings closed without the risk of losing state education funding, according to The Texas Tribune. The latest guidelines also say that the state will not reduce funding to a school that is following the guidelines due to lack of attendance for the first 12 weeks of the school year. Instead, schools that are following the guidelines but struggling to maintain attendance numbers will receive funding based on either a three-year average attendance or an attendance projection. There are two formats that virtual learning can take that still count toward student attendance: virtual class with teachers in real time (called synchronous learning) or a pre-approved plan involving tasks completed on a student’s own time (called asynchronous learning). Schools have the option to use either format or a combination for students learning virtually. For students opting to learn in real-time over apps like Zoom, teachers must teach for a certain number of minutes in order for it to count as a full day of school for attendance purposes. The number of minutes depends on the students’ age, and this style of learning is limited to students in third grade and above. For students learning on their own time, attendance will be based on an approved learning plan and will be measured through daily progress such as check-ins with teachers or the completion of assignments. This is the only virtual option available for students in prekindergarten through second grade, who the state decided are too young to participate in a synchronous learning program. For schools that offer both kinds of virtual learning, students can be considered present for the day for participating in either type of online learning or a combination. It is not clear yet how many families might choose remote learning versus in-person learning for the fall, and schools may opt to ask parents to commit to one option or the other ahead of the start of classes. Schools can also require that families that select online learning stick with that option for the rest of the grading period, which is usually six to nine weeks. The TEA guidelines acknowledge that some schools may need to pause in-person classes ""due to positive COVID-19 cases in schools."" Schools without remote learning options available that are ordered to close under these circumstances will not receive funding for the closed days, unless those days are made up later. The Facebook post also claims that if schools do not open they will essentially close completely. There has been nothing in TEA guidelines or other communications that has suggested that schools that lose funding will stop operating. Rather, without state funding, districts would most likely have to reduce staff and cut certain programs, according to Clay Robison of the Texas State Teachers Association. ""Some districts are in worse shape than other districts. There are some districts out there who will hurt worse than others but it’s going to hurt everyone,"" he said. ""If they enact that penalty to cut off even part of state funding it’s going to hurt districts and they are going to have to make some cuts."" Our ruling A Facebook post shared by a Dallas area school said that the state is ""allowing online learning with attendance stipulations but will not fund school districts if they do not open their schools"" and ""if schools do not open and are not funded there will be no more teachers or school at all."" We found that while schools do stand to lose funding if they do not follow state guidelines when it comes to reopening their doors, districts have some flexibility in holding virtual school at the beginning of the year. This flexibility was expanded after this Facebook post was made. We also found that if a school were to lose its state funding, it would not necessarily shutter its doors. Rather, experts say that it would be a huge financial challenge and programs and staff would have to be cut.

Another Tom Hanks hoax about unfounded criminal allegations
","Ever since Tom Hanks tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia, where he was shooting a movie, misinformation about the actor has spread on social media. One conspiracy theory claims his COVID-19 diagnosis was actually a cover for something more nefarious.  In a July 13 Facebook post, Hanks is pictured wearing a green bandana over his face. In two photos — close ups of his ankles — red circles are drawn around his right ankle.  ""Look who has a new ankle bracelet!"" the post says. ""Tom Hanks. Some of you don’t know it but Mr. Hanks was arrested in Australia for pedophilia. He went on national TV to say he had COVID-19 and he was quarantine himself. Not true. He was in custody for a time then house arrest is n his hotel. Now, he’s a flight risk."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

If he had been charged with sex crimes against children, it would have been widely covered in the media.  On March 11, the actor announced on Twitter that he and his wife, actor Rita Wilson, had tested positive for COVID-19. He said that they would follow the directions of medical officials.  ""We Hanks’ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires,"" he said. ""Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?"" Several days later, they were released from the hospital in Queensland, Australia, but remained in self-isolation while they recovered from the coronavirus.  By March 28, American news outlets were reporting that Hanks and Wilson were both back stateside and had been photographed driving around Los Angeles, where they live.  The Daily Mail published the photos of Hanks that appear in the Facebook post in May 2020. Captions of the images say Hanks is in Los Angeles, not Australia.  ""Despite already having beaten COVID-19, Tom Hanks wasn’t willing to take any chance on Wednesday, with the Forrest Gump star covering his face with a green bandana when he ventured out in Los Angeles,"" one caption says.  The story didn’t mention him wearing an ankle bracelet (something else that would definitely draw the attention of reporters and the paparazzi). The area around his ankle looks more like a gathering of fabric from his pants. QAnon groups have pushed the unfounded claim that Hanks among other celebrities — like Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey — have been arrested in connection with a child sex trafficking ring. USA Today searched for both DeGeners and Hanks on California's sex offender registry and the U.S. Department of Justice’s national sex offender registry and found no records. Oprah responded publicly to the accusations.  ""NOT TRUE,"" she tweeted. ""Haven’t been raided, or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world. Stay safe everybody.""

Postal service says its policy is to deliver even mail ballots lacking postage
","With more Americans expected to cast election ballots by mail as the coronavirus pandemic persists, this warning was shouted on Facebook: ""TWO STAMPS NEEDED FOR MAIL-IN BALLOTS MAKE SURE THIS GETS PASSED ON !!!!!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s not entirely right.

Here’s what we know from a July 10 report, ""Voting Outside the Polling Place: Absentee, All-Mail and other Voting at Home Options,"" by the National Conference of State Legislatures: In most cases, it is up to the voter to pay for postage, although voters often also have the option of using official drop-off sites or dropping off their ballots at election offices in person. 18 states require local election officials to provide return postage for mailed ballots: Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. For military and overseas voters, federal law generally specifies that ballots can be returned using a free postage-paid symbol. The Postal Service has repeatedly said it will deliver ballots even if they lack sufficient postage. ""As required by federal law, appropriate postage must be affixed to all mailpieces entering into the U.S. postal service mail stream,"" the postal service said in a statement in April, according to The Guardian newspaper.

""We are proactively working with state and local election officials on mailing requirements, including postage payment,"" the postal service said in a similar statement reported by the Associated Press in July. ""In cases where a ballot enters the mailstream without the proper amount of postage, the Postal Service will collect postage from the appropriate Board of Elections.""

Yes, taxpayers have sunk at least $70 million into developing remdesivir
","We may be months — at least — away from a vaccine to protect against COVID-19, but in the meantime the public is turning its eyes to drugs that could be used to treat it.  Among the first to be lauded as a possible solution was the antiviral drug remdesivir, which attacks the coronavirus to prevent it from making copies of itself and spreading. A clinical trial run in April found that patients who took the drug were more likely to recover from the disease — and do so faster — than patients who took a placebo pill.  But as excitement about remdesivir amps up, criticism has followed over the price that Gilead Sciences, the drug’s manufacturer, wants to charge for it.  U.S. insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, will pay $3,120 for a five-day course of the drug, while other developed countries will pay about a third less because they’ll purchase from generic manufacturers to which Gilead has licensed production.  The move has angered many, including the progressive advocacy group and think tank Public Citizen, which tweeted on June 29, 2020 about the price declaration, writing, ""Taxpayers spent $70,000,000 to develop this drug. It should be in the public domain. Instead, Big Pharma is robbing us blind."" Parts of the tweet, course, are opinions. But the $70 million claim is stated as a fact. How much did taxpayers spend to develop remdesivir?  Let’s dig in.  To back up the organization’s claim, Peter Maybarduk, Public Citizen’s Access to Medicine director, sent a May 7, 2020 post published on their site titled, ""The real story of remdesivir.""  Amid the worldwide Ebola outbreak in 2015, the U.S. government partnered with Gilead to identify a drug that targeted the Ebola virus and was successful in blocking the infection in Rhesus monkeys.  That drug would later come to be known as remdesivir. In 2017, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report noted that an entity within the Department of Defense would cost-share with Gilead for ""continued development of this product,"" noting its antiviral activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses.  The Department of Defense has spent $34.5 million so far on this effort.   Also in 2017, the National Institutes of Health issued a $6 million grant to researchers at the University of North Carolina to speed the development of remdesivir.   And as the novel coronavirus made its way into the world, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of NIH, announced it would funnel $30 million into the aforementioned clinical trial for remdesivir.   Since the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health are funded through federal taxes, these three payments add up to what Public Citizen claimed.  Public Citizen wrote that taxpayers paid $70 million to develop remdesivir.  Three separate projects from agencies that are funded by taxpayer dollars, adding up to $70 million, have commenced since 2015.  We rate the claim True.

What Joe Biden said about the coronavirus in January
","When presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden appeared on the July 20 premiere of Joy Reid’s MSNBC show, ""The ReidOut,"" he repeated an assertion about how he was more aware of the risks of the novel coronavirus early on than his opponent, President Donald Trump. Referring to Trump, Biden said, ""I, all the way back in January, warned him this pandemic was coming. I talked about what we needed to do."" Other news outlets have previously fact-checked similar assertions by Biden, but we’ll take a crack at his newest remark on Reid’s show. We found that Biden did warn about a potential pandemic as long ago as January, and talked about some steps the administration should take. A fuller, detailed plan came weeks later. Biden’s primary warning about the coronavirus came in a USA Today op-ed he published on Jan. 27, which was six days after the first coronavirus case in the United States was announced.  Here are the op-ed’s key passages about the novel coronavirus: ""The possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president. … The outbreak of a new coronavirus, which has already infected more than 2,700 people and killed over 80 in China, will get worse before it gets better. Cases have been confirmed in a dozen countries, with at least five in the United States. There will likely be more. … To be blunt, I am concerned that the Trump administration’s shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic that will come sooner or later."" While Biden told Reid that he had ""warned"" Trump that ""this pandemic was coming,"" his January op-ed did not word it so definitively. In the op-ed, Biden referred to ""the possibility of a pandemic"" and he said one ""will come sooner or later."" The World Health Organization did not declare a pandemic until March 11. Trump was tweeting as late as Feb. 24 that the coronavirus ""is very much under control in the USA."" Still, Biden’s wording in the Reid interview suggested that his warnings were more definitive than they were. His comment to Reid that he ""talked about what we needed to do"" as far back as January was more big picture than specific. Much of the op-ed set forth the ways in which the Obama administration, which Biden served as vice president, handled the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak, including marshaling a cooperative international response and relying on sound science for decision-making. Biden contrasted the Obama playbook with the ways that Trump, then a private citizen, ""sought to stoke fear and stigma"" about Ebola. International cooperation and a reliance on science are big-picture elements of fighting a disease outbreak in its early stages. Biden also wrote in the op-ed that, as president, he would ""ask Congress to beef up the Public Health Emergency Fund and give me the power to use the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to declare a disaster if an infectious disease threat merits it. I will also renew funding — set to expire in May — for the nationwide network of hospitals that can isolate and treat people with infectious diseases, and fully fund the Global Health Security Agenda so the world is ready for the next outbreak."" Beyond that, Biden did not offer much specificity for battling the coronavirus in January, when public-health officials around the world were just beginning to grasp the nature of the virus and the steps that would be required to contain it.  In the U.S., public-health officials were beginning to contemplate the potential need for extensive social-distancing measures in February and early March. Biden held an in-person rally in Detroit as late as March 9 before canceling a rally for the first time on March 10. The following day, the NBA abruptly suspended its season, triggering a cascade of cancellations of events and gatherings around the country. On March 12, Biden offered a more detailed plan. In remarks posted on Medium, Biden thanked those ""who are already making sacrifices to protect us — whether that’s self-quarantining or cancelling events or closing campuses.""  He went on to say that fighting the coronavirus ""will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings."" Biden also urged free testing for everyone who needs it; making sure communities have the hospital beds, staff, medical supplies and personal protective equipment needed to treat patients; efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Defense Department to provide temporary hospitals; and fast-tracking of vaccine clinical trials by the National Institutes of Health and approvals by the Food and Drug Administration. Biden’s plan came four days before the White House issued recommendations that senior citizens and people with serious health concerns should stay home, initially for 15 days. The White House formally declared a national emergency on March 13. Biden’s campaign told PolitiFact that an op-ed was not the venue to flesh out a full plan; it was intended more as an outline. Biden said, ""I, all the way back in January, warned (President Trump that) this pandemic was coming. I talked about what we needed to do."" Biden expressed concern about the coronavirus weeks before Trump did, and he recommended the Obama approach on Ebola, including international cooperation and the use of sound science, in January. He warned of the possibility of a pandemic several weeks before the WHO declared one, and predicted that there would be more cases in the U.S.  But while he spoke broadly in January about how the U.S. should approach the crisis, he did not offer a detailed plan until March 12, a day after the WHO declaration.

A few weeks later, Trump said that Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., had thanked his administration for building temporary hospitals. And in April, Trump made a point to bring up that Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., publicly thanked him for supplying ventilators and COVID-19 tests, while the media had given him ""very little credit for the great job."" Yes, Trump would like some credit. But a recent post on Facebook that includes ""an actual Trump quote"" similar to these comments didn’t really happen. The quote from Ridin’ With Biden, a Facebook group started by Occupy Democrats, reads as follows: ""Everybody says I’ve done a tremendous job with COVID. My leadership has been extraordinary, best in history. My quick actions have all but wiped out the virus, saving millions of lives, and I’ve got the economy ready to roar back to better than ever before. I think a little gratitude would be nice.

This has created a number of misleading claims on social media, including one we debunked that falsely said the coin shortage was planned.  Now some posts claim that businesses are bound by law to accept cash, since it’s designated as legal tender.

We called the phone number on the Facebook post, and the woman who answered said, ""We don’t handle anything like that."" However, a number of other states and cities have passed, or are considering, bans on cashless stores. Supporters of no-cash policies, including some big retailers, say they help speed up transactions and reduce the risk of theft. But critics say they discriminate against poor consumers who may not have access to credit cards, bank accounts or electronic payment systems. The Coinage Act of 1965 states that U.S. coins and currency are ""legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues."" But the Treasury Department explains on its website that while those forms of money are valid for repaying debts to a creditor, there is ""no federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services.""  ""Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a state law which says otherwise,"" the Treasury says. ""For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large-denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy."" Mississippi state Sen. Chad McMahan recently claimed on his Facebook page that businesses in his state that decline to accept cash were breaking the law by refusing legal tender. That’s wrong. Mississippi has no ban on cashless businesses. But a number of other states and localities do. Massachusetts has had a law in place since 1978, and New Jersey and Rhode Island passed similar laws in 2019. A handful of cities, such as San Francisco, Philadelphia and New York City, require businesses to accept cash as well. The rules allow for fines against violators. There are various exceptions to these laws. For example, in New Jersey, municipal parking facilities are exempted, and airport stores can decline to accept cash as long as two others that sell food in the same terminal take cash. Car rental businesses can be cashless in New Jersey if they accept cashier’s checks and certified checks.  In New York City, businesses with devices that convert cash to cards, like laundromats, are exempt under certain conditions. Social media posts are claiming that businesses that don't accept cash are breaking the law and can be fined and sued. Whether this is true depends on where the business is. There is no federal law that says merchants must accept cash. But a handful of states and municipalities have passed laws barring businesses from refusing cash.

Biden was quoting a memo during a Senate hearing
","""Black lives do matter, but one person disagrees,"" begins a video attacking Joe Biden that was recently posted on Facebook by an account called Committee to Defend the President.  ""He’s praised KKK members,"" the narrator says as the words ""Praised KKK member Robert Byrd"" flash on the screen.  ""Wrote a bill that jailed Black Americans,"" the narrator continues, ""repeated the N-word twice on camera and said busing would turn schools into a racial jungle."" Two quotes attributed to Biden appear: ""We don’t need any more N***** bigshots"" and ""My children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ve previously fact-checked some of the claims in this video.  Biden was friends with former U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan. But Byrd renounced his views, and his public expressions of regret and shame over his involvement with the racist organization were well-documented by the time Biden — and former President Barack Obama — praised him at his memorial service in 2010.  Biden also opposed court-ordered busing to integrate public schools, saying in 1977 that ""unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions built so high that it is going to explode at some point."" But in this fact-check, we’re addressing the other quote attributed to Biden, in which he uses the N-word.  The video cites a C-SPAN video from June 5, 1985. We found a clip that a user created on Feb. 11, 2020 and titled: ""In 1985, Joe Biden twice says the N-word.""  In the clip, Biden is referring to a court ruling when he says: ""The court concluded, quote: ‘The governor’s opposition to the Nunez plan was predicated in significant part on his delineation of a majority Black district centered in Orleans Parish.’ And in confidential portions of your staff memo, they brought to your attention the allegation that an important legislator, in defeating the Nunez plan in the basement, said, quote: ‘We already have a (n-----) mayor; we don’t need another (n------) big-shot.’""  Here’s what you need to know.  Biden was speaking from his perch on the Senate Judiciary Committee during one of the confirmation hearings for William Bradford Reynolds, who then-President Ronald Regan nominated to be associate attorney general of the United States.  The court ruling Biden was reading from struck down a Louisiana redistricting plan because it was biased against the state’s Black residents. Reynolds, who headed the Justice Department’s civil rights section, had told the state of Louisiana the federal government wouldn’t object to the plan. Biden focused on the case during his hearing in part because the former head of the civil rights section during the Nixon administration described the plan as ""a blatant racial gerrymander,"" the Washington Post reported at the time. The Senate committee ultimately rejected the nomination.  Biden was wielding the quote with the racist slur as evidence against Reynolds’ fitness for the position. ""There was clear, clear evidence of intent to discriminate against Black folks,"" Biden went on to say during the hearing, addressing Reynolds. ""I have been here 13 years, and you are one of the best lawyers we have ever had sit in front of us that worked for the federal government. And you are clearly not a racist. You are not out there saying, ‘Man, I want to get those Blacks.’ And then I sit back and I ask: If that is the case, how could he look at all this and not come to the conclusion that something was rotten in Denmark?""  Our ruling It’s true that Biden twice used the word on camera, as the video says. But context matters, and the video doesn’t make clear that Biden was quoting from a passage in a court ruling when he said it. Someone watching this could understandably — and wrongly — believe that these were Biden’s own words. They weren’t.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/22/viral-image/biden-was-quoting-memo-during-senate-hearing/

No, Obama did not sign a law allowing protesters to be snatched off the streets
","As President Donald Trump threatened to deploy federal agents beyond Portland, Ore., to other Democratic-led cities where crime has spiked amid protests, an image shared on Facebook claimed the controversial policy is actually a Democrat’s doing. Above a photograph of a smiling Barack Obama, text in the image declares: ""When everyone just blames Trump but forgets who actually signed the law authorizing federal agents to snatch protestors off the streets in Portland."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The reference appears to be a law Obama signed regarding the military detention of suspected terrorists, not law-abiding domestic protesters. It doesn’t apply to the current situation. Federal agents can detain law-breaking protesters, but they don’t have authority to merely snatch them off the streets. In recent days, federal agents have cracked down on protesters in Portland, where some demonstrations have turned violent. The fact that many federal agents there are not wearing identifiable law enforcement gear and not driving law enforcement vehicles has raised legal questions about the agents’ presence. Commenters on the Facebook post cited another image. It claims that Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act, and that Section 1021 allows the president to detain anyone indefinitely for any reason.  Law professor Stephen Vladeck, an expert in constitutional and national security law at the University of Texas, told PolitiFact he has seen the same reference, but it’s erroneous.  Vladeck said the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act signed by Obama includes controversial provisions concerning military detention of terrorism suspects — but it has nothing to do with what’s happening in Portland.  He said a provision known as Section 1315 — which is what the federal Department of Homeland Security says allows agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enforce federal laws in Portland — was enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. That was signed into law by President George W. Bush. It is that provision that is cited by the Trump White House as the legal basis for the federal agents’ actions.  Federal agents can only enforce federal law, unless they are specifically authorized to enforce state law by the state, said Vanderbilt University law professor Christopher Slobogin, whose specialties include criminal law.   ""So, federal agents cannot snatch any protester off the street, only those threatening federal property or personnel, or who are also committing some other federal crime such as drug trafficking or national security laws,"" he said. Put another way, said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania who focuses on constitutional law, federal agents have authority to arrest people attacking a federal courthouse, but no government official has the authority to arrest peaceful protestors.  We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/22/viral-image/no-obama-did-not-sign-law-allowing-protesters-be-s/

Attack ad exaggerates John James’ health care stance
","A major labor union’s attack ad targets Michigan Republican Senate candidate John James for his position on health care. The ad features a woman with multiple sclerosis who claims that James ""wants to allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions."" The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said it ran the ad for two weeks, and reportedly spent at least $1 million on it. The ad lists two sources to support its claim. The first, a 2018 article from the Houston Chronicle, summarizes a study that found that more than 100 million Americans could lose their health coverage if the Affordable Care Act were overturned. The second, a Talking Points Memo article, references a deleted video James posted during his failed 2018 campaign against Sen. Debbie Stabenow, in which James calls the ACA a ""monstrosity"" and calls for repealing and replacing the health law. The ad puts those two facts together to reach its conclusion, but it’s not an accurate reflection of James’ stated position. James, a Detroit-area businessman and combat veteran, has noted his opposition to the ACA, which codified new protections for people with preexisting conditions, ensuring that they could buy health insurance without steep premiums. In the video James posted during the 2018 campaign, James said, ""Our failure to repeal and replace Obamacare is the surest sign that we need new conservative leadership in Washington,"" and he called for a ""new, market-based, fair, and patient-centered solutions."" He has not laid out any more detailed policy proposals. But in a 2018 debate with Stabenow, James said his vision for a better health care system would include covering preexisting conditions. And in two different Fox News appearances, James reiterated this position. In his current campaign to unseat incumbent Sen. Gary Peters, James said he remains committed to this vision. In response to a similar ad attack from the pro-Democratic Senate Majority PAC, James released a statement claiming he has ""never supported eliminating protections of preexisting conditions"" along with his own ad vowing he ""will always protect anyone with a preexisting condition."" ""John wants to keep the parts of the Affordable Care Act that work, protect seniors and people with preexisting conditions,"" wrote Abby Walls, director of communications for James’ campaign in an email to PolitiFact Michigan. How the ACA protects people with preexisting conditions Supporters of the Affordable Care Act consider its provisions on preexisting conditions to be one of the law’s signature achievements. Before the passage of the ACA, people with a health condition could be denied coverage or charged higher premiums in the individual health insurance market. ""When insurance was a voluntary, competitive market not subsidized, insurers were masterful at cherry-picking,"" says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The ACA ended this practice, requiring insurance companies to sell coverage to anyone who wants it at a price that does not factor in their health condition. Analysis from the Department of Health and Human Services found that the share of Americans with preexisting conditions who did not have health insurance at any point during the year decreased 22% between 2010 and 2014, when the ACA’s signature reforms were enacted. What would repealing the ACA mean for individuals with preexisting conditions?  In 2018, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 27% of nonelderly adults, those age 18-64, in the U.S. have a preexisting health condition — about 53.8 million. In Michigan, the share is slightly higher: An estimated 29% — just over 1.7 million — of nonelderly Michiganders had a preexisting condition in 2018 that would likely have resulted in their being declined coverage under the pre-ACA underwriting practices of the individual health insurance market. Repealing the ACA has been an aim of Republicans for a decade. Just recently, the Trump administration submitted a brief to the Supreme Court in a case seeking to have the ACA ruled unconstitutional. If the administration is successful, the ACA’s protections for people with preexisting conditions would fall away. ""If the ACA were gone, the industry would revert back to cherry-picking so fast it would make your head spin,"" Pollitz says. Shirin Bidel-Niyat, AFSCME’s assistant director for political action, said in a statement that James has ""failed to publicly oppose the Trump administration’s lawsuit seeking to gut the ACA. Meanwhile, he continues to advocate for the repeal of Obamacare, the only law that currently offers protections for those with preexisting conditions."" Some Republican proposals to repeal and replace the ACA promised to keep protections for individuals with preexisting conditions in place. Sen. Thom Tillis’s Protect Act — introduced in the current Congress — notes ""Obamacare is not the  only way to protect Americans with preexisting conditions."" The Republican proposals so far don’t ensure the same level of protection and affordability guaranteed under the ACA. But that does not mean that someone who wants to repeal and replace the ACA wants to revert to allowing health insurers to discriminate based on  preexisting conditions. James’ claims that he would cover and protect individuals with preexisting conditions suggests he does not support letting insurance companies deny someone coverage based on their medical history as the AFSCME ad says. But, it is unclear what specific provisions of the ACA James supports that also offer protections for individuals with preexisting conditions such prohibiting health insurance companies from charging higher prices for those with a preexisting condition or requiring that health care plans offer comprehensive coverage that insures essential health services. Our ruling The attack ad against James claims he ""wants to allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions."" This claim misstates James’ stated positions on health care. James has called for repealing and replacing the ACA. He has not indicated his support for a specific health care reform package. James has not held elective office and so has never had to take a vote on Republican proposals to replace the ACA that would weaken protections for people with preexisting conditions achieved through the ACA. James has said many times that he supports a health insurance system that covers and protects people with preexisting conditions. His critics have a legitimate point that he could provide more detail on how he’d achieve that position, but this ad goes too far in stating that James supports allowing insurance companies to deny coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions.

Yes, the average American family pays more in hospital expenditures than federal taxes
","Americans pay a lot for health care, and the system may be the one thing in life that everyone -- regardless of political affiliation -- would like to change.  When it comes to agreeing on what changes to make, though, it gets tricky.  U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, proposed a bill on Feb. 14, 2020 aimed at forcing health systems to lower costs: the Transparent Health Care Pricing Act of 2020, which would require providers to publicly disclose the price of their products and services. It echoed a similar bill Gallagher cosponsored in 2019 that won bipartisan support.  The new bill was referred to committee that same day and hasn’t moved since, but Gallagher appeared June 25, 2020 on a Fox News program to discuss its effects if enacted.  On the segment, Gallagher said health care consumers don’t act as conventional consumers because they don’t compare prices before purchasing.  And rising costs, he claimed, have led to an unusual circumstance: ""The average family in America forks over more of their hard-earned income to their local hospital than to the IRS.""  Is Gallagher correct?  When asked for backup for the claim, a Gallagher spokesman pointed to a Jan. 26, 2019 Forbes opinion piece aptly titled ""In 2018, The Average Family Paid More To Hospitals Than To The Federal Government in Taxes.""  The piece was written by Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a right-leaning think tank based in Austin, Texas. He breaks down the math problem he’s used to examine hospital costs and payments to the IRS.  He started with what Americans spend on hospital care overall: $1.2 trillion in 2018.  That is on the money — according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 33% of the nation’s $3.6 trillion in health spending during 2018 went to hospital care.  When divided by the 327.2 million people who lived in the U.S. that year, each person accounted for about $3,667 of that sum. Using census data to determine that the average American family consisted of 2.5 persons, Roy asserted that the ""average"" family’s share of money spent on hospital care was just under $9,280.  That’s about 14.7% of the 2018 median household income, which the census bureau placed at $63,179.  Comparatively, Roy says, the average family pays a lower percentage of its income in federal taxes. He points to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the federal Joint Committee on Taxation estimated would bring the average tax rate for a median-income household down from 14.8% to 13.5% for households that brought in $50,000 to $75,000 per year in 2019.  A median household income would fit into that range, and -- based on the earlier math -- would pay a larger share than that in hospital costs.  Gallagher said the average American family pays more to hospitals than in federal taxes.  Of course, ""average"" does not point to a singular real-life scenario here — no American family has 2.5 children and makes exactly the median income. Indeed, many families have no hospital expenses in a given year. But numbers behind the claim relating to average situations add up. We rate the claim True.

Despite Trump talk, antifa has not been designated as a terrorist organization
","You may have heard that federal officers in unmarked vehicles have detained people protesting against police brutality in Portland. According to some reports, officers have given no explanation for the arrests. Why? One Instagram post has a theory. ""Here is what is going on since Trump labeled ANTIFA a terrorist organization their rights were stripped by the Patriot Act which states if someone is labeled a terrorist they are not afforded due process,"" reads the July 18 post. ""PS: Obama suspended habeas corpus too!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)  The Instagram post is a screenshot of a Facebook post from a comedian named Sam Tripoli. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. (Screenshot from Instagram) Antifa stands for ""anti-fascist."" It’s a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that’s been around for decades, but has had a resurgence since the election of President Donald Trump.  The Trump administration has repeatedly blamed antifa activists for the violent protests that erupted after the death of George Floyd in late May. There’s no evidence that antifa played any significant role, but Trump said May 31 that the United States would designate the movement as a terrorist organization.  The post is inaccurate. Antifa is not a designated terrorist organization, and even if it were, American activists would still have due process rights. Despite Trump’s tweet, antifa has not been designated as a terrorist organization. It is not listed on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations. National security experts told PolitiFact there is no legal process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. If the Trump administration did try to designate antifa as a terrorist organization, it would likely be challenged in court.  Also, antifa is not a structured organization — it has no leaders and is organized into autonomous local groups.  ""It’s a little bit like feminism,"" Mark Bray, a historian and part-time lecturer at Rutgers University, told PolitiFact. ""There are feminist groups just like there are antifa groups, but neither feminism nor antifa is a group."" Second: If antifa groups were designated terrorists, American activists would still have due process rights thanks to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Patriot Act, which passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, does not give federal officers the right to detain suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens without probable cause. The legislation mainly expanded law enforcement’s ability to use wiretaps in counter-terrorism investigations. It was re-authorized and revised in 2015 to place limits on how much telecommunication data intelligence agencies can collect from Americans. If antifa isn’t a terrorist organization, then why are law enforcement officials detaining protesters in Portland? It has to do with the federal government’s response to ongoing protests over police brutality. Demonstrators in Portland have been protesting against police brutality and racism against Black Americans since the death of George Floyd in late May. On July 14, reports surfaced that federal law enforcement agents were using unmarked cars to detain protesters in Portland. Over the next few days, videos shared on social media showed the detentions. Federal agents in Portland include members of the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and a unit from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. U.S. Border Patrol told CNBC that agents were deployed to Portland in support of a June 26 executive order from Trump and a new Homeland Security task force for protecting American communities. The Trump administration says the officers are needed to restore peace in Portland, where protests devolved into rioting July 18. But Oregon officials and Democrats have criticized the federal government’s crackdown.  The Oregon attorney general filed a lawsuit July 17 that alleges the federal government violated citizens’ rights by detaining them without probable cause. On July 19, House Democrats called for an investigation into allegations that federal officials were unlawfully arresting protesters. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley — all Democrats — have criticized the Trump administration’s use of force against protesters. It’s unclear to what extent antifa activists are among the protesters detained in Portland. The city is home to the oldest antifa cell in the country, and activists associated with the movement have been involved in recent protests there. One purported antifa activist faces charges for alleged crimes that took place during the demonstrations. The Instagram post claims that, since antifa is a terrorist organization, its members’ due process rights are stripped by the Patriot Act. That’s wrong. Antifa is not an organized group and has not been designated as a terrorist organization. Even if it were, American antifa activists would still have due process rights afforded to them by the Constitution. The Patriot Act does not give federal law enforcement officials the right to detain suspected terrorists who are U.S. citizens without probable cause. The Instagram post is inaccurate.

No, Joe Biden doesn’t want to ban fracking or kill the Pennsylvania jobs it supports
","The controversial drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has long been a flashpoint in Pennsylvania politics. On a Trump campaign call last week, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly took aim at Joe Biden’s vision for the sector. ""If Joe Biden really cared about Pennsylvania, why would he propose killing over 600,000 jobs supported by fracking?"" said Kelly, a Republican congressman from Butler County, in northwest Pennsylvania. We wondered whether Kelly accurately described Biden’s position on fracking, which has lifted the economy in southwest Pennsylvania but also sickened some residents who live near the wells that extract natural gas from miles beneath the earth’s surface. Biden wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public land, but he has not called for banning fracking outright. He also would allow existing fracking operations to continue. His official position hasn’t changed, but it became muddled when Biden, now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, misspoke during a March debate with Bernie Sanders, his last opponent standing in the race for the nomination. Here’s an excerpt of their exchange: ""I’m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,"" Sanders said. ""I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet — no ifs, buts and maybes about it."" ""So am I,"" Biden replied. ""Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that,"" Sanders said. ""No more — no new fracking,"" Biden said. Biden seemed to be saying he wanted to ban fracking entirely – a sharp departure from his official position. And the former vice president’s critics pounced. Republican operatives quickly cut a short video of Biden’s remarks to use as a cudgel in races against moderate House Democrats, The Washington Post reported. And Sanders supporters accused Biden of misleading voters about his policy, which wouldn’t ban fracking outright, like Sanders wanted to. The Biden campaign retracted his remarks the night of the debate, but that hasn’t stopped conservative media outlets from inaccurately reporting that Biden supports a total ban on fracking. The misstep is now being used against Biden in battleground states like Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the statistic Kelly mentioned on the campaign call – the 600,000 Pennsylvania jobs supported by fracking that he says Biden wants to eliminate – comes from a 2019 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute. It estimates that 609,000 jobs connected to fracking would be eliminated across the state by 2025 if fracking were banned. The figure has popped up in several recent emails from Trump Victory, a political group led jointly by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, and it flashes across the screen at the end of a television ad released last month by America First Action, a Republican super PAC that supports President Donald Trump’s reelection. The 30-second spot has appeared in several Pennsylvania media markets, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics. However, only 21,000 of the jobs the report says are set to disappear over the next five years are positions directly within the fracking industry. The others comprise companies that do business with the industry or benefit from it indirectly, and the report doesn’t specify which jobs would be at risk. It also hypothesizes that a ban on fracking would mean higher energy costs for American families and that with less disposable income to spend in their communities, local businesses would struggle and ultimately shed jobs. The report says the 609,000 jobs figure is calculated using economic modeling software that ""tracks monetary transactions within the economy between different industries, the government, and households,"" but it offers no other explanation of the math.  A recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report shows that 20,146 people are currently employed in Pennsylvania’s oil and natural gas industry. Kelly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kelly said Biden proposed ""killing over 600,000 jobs supported by fracking.""  Biden does not support an outright fracking ban, even though he spoke inaccurately about his stance on the debate stage in March. In addition, the 600,000-job figure comes from a report published by an organization that opposes limits on fracking and failed to fully explain how it calculated its projections on job losses We rate Kelly’s statement False. ",/factchecks/2020/jul/21/mike-kelly/no-joe-biden-doesnt-want-ban-fracking-or-kill-penn/

Spanberger vs. Ocasio-Cortez: Who is less supportive of Trump?
","Del. Nick Freitas will try to convince voters in the 7th Congressional District that they were fooled in 2018 when they elected Democrat Abigail Spanberger to the U.S. House of Resentatives. Freitas on July 18 won the Republican nomination to challenge Spanberger this fall. Spanberger won the seat, long held by the GOP, in 2018 when she defeated incumbent Dave Brat.  Freitas, in the days leading up to his nomination, said Spanberger has broken her promise to be an independent, moderate Democrat. He repeatedly said that Spanberger has voted to the left of most Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a self-described democratic socialist. ""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez votes with President Trump more than Abigail Spanberger does,"" Fretias said during a July 11 interview on Breitbart radio. He repeated the claim during a July 16 radio interview on WRVA. We wondered if he’s right. Freitas said his claim is based on information published by FiveThirtyEight, a website focused on statistical analyses of politics, economics and sports. It keeps a chart gauging how many times each member of Congress votes with and against President Donald Trump. Neither Spanberger nor Ocasio-Cortez has offered much support to Trump. They voted to impeach Trump and opposed the president on major issues such as health care, border security, environmental regulations and gun control. According to the chart, Trump has staked out positions on 80 of the bills the full House has voted on since the start of 2019. Spanberger has voted with the president six times; Ocasio-Cortez has 10 times.  Spanberger’s 7.5% presidential support is the 55th lowest among 233 House Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez’ 12.5% support is the 71st lowest.  So raw statistics indeed show Ocasio-Cortez has voted with the president more often than Spanberger. But numbers don’t tell the whole story. A deeper look at the votes undercuts the theory that Ocasio-Cortez has been more supportive of Trump than Spanberger.  On many of the occasions when Ocasio-Cortez voted with Trump, she was expressing polar disagreements with the president on the issues at hand. For example, in June 2019, Trump opposed a government funding bill in part because it didn’t ban U.S. funds to be spent overseas on abortions. Ocasio-Cortez, in contrast, voted against the bill because it continued a ban on federal funds to being used for abortions in the U.S. In January 2019, Trump threatened to veto three funding bills that would have ended a government shutdown because they didn’t contain money to combat illegal immigration by expanding the southern border wall. Ocasio-Cortez opposed the bills in part because she thought they had too much money to battle immigration and didn’t abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Here’s a breakdown of the instances when Ocasio-Cortez or Spanberger voted with Trump: Spanberger and Trump vs. Ocasio-Cortez  May 15, 2020: Spanberger voted against the Heroes Act, a $3 trillion tax cut and spending bill aimed at easing the economic downturn from the coronavirus. The bill includes nearly $1 trillion for state, local governments; direct payments to individuals, up to $6,000 per family; $200 billion for hazard pay for essential workers; $75 billion for coronavirus testing and student loan forgiveness. But the Democratic-led House also put in the bill several measures not directly aimed at COVID-19 that Trump vehemently opposes: more funding for the U.S. Postal Service and a requirement that all voters be allowed to cast ballots by mail this November. Spanberger said she opposed the legislation because lawmakers ""have decided to use this package as an opportunity to make political statements and propose a bill that goes far beyond pandemic relief and has no chance at becoming law…"". The bill passed the House and is pending in the Senate. Feb. 28, 2020: Spanberger voted against a bill that would ban the manufacture and sale of flavored e-cigarettes, menthol cigarettes and tobacco flavors. She joined lawmakers from rural districts with a history of tobacco farming in opposing the measure. Trump said the legislation would hurt the economy. The bill passed the House and is pending in the Senate. Dec. 19, 2019: Spanberger joined Trump in backing a trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico that will make it harder for other countries to send goods into North America tariff-free. Trump has signed the bill. July 17, 2019: Spanberger joined a majority of House Democrats and Republicans in killing an impeachment resolution against Trump for telling four congresswomen to ""go back"" to their home countries. (Spanberger supported two different impeachment articles against Trump in December 2020). Trump and Ocasio-Cortez vs. Spanberger Nov. 15, 2019: Spanberger voted to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which offers financing to foreign nations importing U.S. products. Although Trump supports the bank, he threatened to veto this bill amid GOP complaints that it wouldn’t ban the bank from helping state-owned enterprises in China. Ocasio-Cortez opposed the bill for a different reason, saying it lacked environmental safeguards for energy projects financed abroad. The bill passed the House but stalled in the Senate. In December 2019, Trump signed an appropriations bill that, among many other things, reauthorized the bank for seven years. July 25, 2019: Ocasio-Cortez voted for a Trump-backed budget deal that raised domestic and defense spending. It also suspended caps on government borrowing. Spanberger voted against the bill, saying it would increase national debt by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Trump signed the deal. July 12, 2019: Spanberger voted to authorize $733 in defense spending for the budget year that started Oct 1, 2019. She praised the bill for offering a 3.1% raise to service members, addressing military housing issues and reaffirming support for soldiers stationed on the Korean peninsula. Trump and Ocasio-Cortez opposed the bill for different reasons. Trump wanted a $750 billion appropriation and objected to an amendment that would have required him to get congressional approval before waging war with Iran. Ocasio-Cortez opposed it after failing to gain support for an amendment that would have barred the president from deploying troops at the Mexican border to enforce immigration laws. The amendment also would have prevented the Defense Department from housing migrants at its centers.  Trump eventually signed a $738 billion compromise.  June 25, 2019: Spanberger voted to send $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid to the Mexican border to help immigrants. Trump threatened a veto, saying the bill had provisions that would restrict his ability to control the flow of immigrants. Ocasio-Cortez said she voted against the bill at the request of constituents who are opposed to Trump’s immigration policies. June 19, 2019: Spanberger voted for a $983 billion funding bill that would keep much of the federal government open through September 2019. Trump and Ocasio-Cortez opposed the bill, but for different reasons. Trump objected to provisions that would have blocked the administration from diverting funds to build the border wall and allowed U.S. aid to be used for aborrtion services overseas. Ocasio-Cortez voted against the bill  after failing to pass an amendment that would have ended a ban on federal funds being used for U.S. abortions. Jan. 23-24, 2019: Spanberger voted for three funding bills that would have ended what became a 35-day government shutdown. Trump threatened to veto the bills because they didn’t include money to build the border wall. Ocasio-Cortez opposed the bills in part because they funded the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, which she campaigned on eliminating. All together On two bills, both Spanberger and Ocasio-Cortez voted in accordance with Trump. March 14, 2020: They backed a successful bill that provided enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing, tax credits to small- and medium-size businesses, and additional funds for food assistance and Medicaid. Dec. 19, 2019: They opposed increasing the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes in 2019.  The bill passed the House and has not been taken up in the Senate. Our ruling Freitas says, ""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez votes with President Trump more than Abigail Spanberger does."" In raw numbers, his statement certainly holds up. Trump has taken a position on 80 of the bills that have come up for vote in the full House since the start of 2019. Ocasio-Cortez voted in accord with him 10 times and Spanberger did six times. Neither congress member can be listed as a Trump advocate. But the suggestion that Ocasio-Cortez was somewhat friendlier to the president withers when we look behind the numbers. When Ocasio-Cortez voted with Trump, it was usually for reasons that were antithetical to his agenda. The same pattern isn’t visible in Spanberger’s record. So Freitas’ statement tells half the story, and we rate it Half True.  ",/factchecks/2020/jul/21/nick-freitas/spanberger-vs-ocasio-cortez-who-less-supportive-tr/
