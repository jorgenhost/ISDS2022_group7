Scott Walker cut taxes for rich, raised them on 140,000 families, Mary Burke says
","In a TV ad released Sept. 11, 2014, Democrat Mary Burke looked into the camera and showed a bit of a whimsical side. ""You know who had a really good idea about taxes?"" she asked. ""Ronald Reagan. Surprised you, didn't I?"" Burke praised the late Republican president’s 1986 expansion of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit. It reduces the income taxes owed by low- and moderate-income workers, or enables them to collect a tax refund. Burke then pivoted to GOP Gov. Scott Walker. ""You know who had a really bad idea? Governor Walker,"" she said. ""He did just the opposite, cutting taxes for the wealthiest and raising them on 140,000 Wisconsin families."" Is that Walker’s record on taxes? Tax cuts ‘for the wealthiest"" Let’s start with ""cutting taxes for the wealthiest,"" the first part of Burke’s claim. Has Walker helped richer folks? Sure. His first state budget, for 2011-’13, plus other measures adopted in 2011, provided tax cuts to corporations, businesses, manufacturers and investors, among other groups. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the nonpartisan scorekeeper on state budget matters, estimated their value at $2.33 billion over 10 years. The largest tax cut, done through tax credits for production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses, helps not only corporations but also individual owners of smaller businesses.    Indeed, we rated Mostly True a claim that the credits would enable a factory owner -- in some scenarios -- to pay less in state income tax on those production earnings than a minimum-wage fast-food worker. But Walker has also cut income taxes across every income bracket. His second budget, for 2013-’15, lowered rates (while reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four) And later, in 2014, Walker signed legislation that dropped the lowest rate again (from 4.4 percent to 4 percent). Here are examples are for married couples filing jointly.   Taxable income Tax rate/Previous law Tax rate/Current law Up to $14,540 4.6% 4% $14,540 to $29,090 6.15% 5.84% $29,090 to $215,000 6.5% 6.27% $215,000 to $320,250 6.75% 6.27% $320,250 and over 7.75% 7.65% *Taxable income levels shown are current. The income levels were slightly lower under the previous law. For example, the first tax bracket was up to $14,000 income, rather than $14,540. A few points on the table: The lowest bracket applies to all taxpayers. In other words, all tax filers are subject to the 4 percent tax rate on their first $14,500 of income, then the rates go up as taxable income reaches higher levels. Reduced tax rates don’t help if your income is so low that you don’t owe any income tax. In that vein, some groups advocate for expanding the state Earned Income Tax Credit, which can result in more taxpayers receiving income tax refunds after their returns are filed. Burke’s campaign pointed out that couples earning $29,090 got a tax rate reduction from 6.15 percent to 5.84 percent, but couples earning up to $320,250 got a larger reduction, from 6.75 percent to 6.27 percent. In addition, the income tax changes enacted under Walker include other breaks for people across many income levels, including those with health savings accounts and those who send their children to private schools. So, Walker cut taxes for the wealthy, but for a broad cross-section of taxpayers, as well. Tax increases Now to the other part of Burke’s claim -- that Walker raised taxes on 140,000 families. Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, contained what the Legislative Fiscal Bureau classified as $49 million in tax increases. The largest change was a reduction in the state Earned Income Tax Credit which, as we’ve noted, reduces the amount of income taxes a person owes or enables the person to get a tax refund. The fiscal bureau calculated that about 140,000 recipients would see their credits reduced. In other words, they would pay more in taxes or get a smaller tax refund. Here’s how the maximum credits were reduced for families with two or more children:   Family size Maximum EITC/Previous Law  Maximum EITC/Current Law One child $124 $124 Two children $716 $562 Three or more children $2,473 $1,955   So, 140,000 fewer lower-income people received the state Earned Income Tax Credit. About three-fourths of the money in the state Earned Income Tax Credit program pays for income tax refunds for those lower-income people, rather than reducing any state income tax they owe. Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the Wisconsin Budget Project, which is part of the liberal advocacy group Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said most of the 140,000 who lost their credits would not save enough from the reduction in income tax rates to make up for that loss. In other words, they’d be paying more in income taxes or be getting a smaller refund. Dale Knapp, research director of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said he believes most of the 140,000 would benefit to some extent from the tax rate cuts, but that he didn’t know whether that savings would offset the lost tax credit. Our rating Burke said Walker cut ""taxes for the wealthiest"" and raised taxes ""on 140,000 Wisconsin families."" Walker cut taxes for wealthier residents and raised taxes for people on the lower end of the scale. But he also made tax cuts that applied across the board. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

Catherine Taylor says plethora of tent permit rules exemplifies red tape snarling R.I. businesses
","In her campaign for lieutenant governor, Catherine Taylor has talked broadly of boosting the Rhode Island economy by, among other things, streamlining business regulations. During a recent appearance on Channel 6’s ""On the Record,"" Taylor, a Republican who resigned from her position as head of the state Division of Elderly Affairs to run for office, argued that red tape at the local level is impeding business. She referred to the experience of one Rhode Island company to illustrate her point. ""I go back to the Newport Tent example,"" she said on the show that aired Sept. 7. ""Every time they work in a city or town they have a whole different set of permits that they have to get in order to pitch a tent."" This particular claim about Newport Tent sounded familiar to us. It turns out that former Journal staff writer Cynthia Needham (now an editor at the Boston Globe) wrote about the company’s struggles with permitting in a May 4, 2010 story with the headline ""New bills could reduce red tape."" In the story, Newport Tent owner Bill Corcoran complained about the time and effort it takes to comply with all the differing rules in Rhode Island’s 39 cities and towns. During the busy season in spring and summer, one employee devotes her time to driving around the state getting all the necessary permits, he said at the time. But that was four years ago. Weren’t the nine proposed bills written about in that article supposed to create more uniform permitting processes and put time limits on how long communities have to complete requests? When we contacted Taylor’s campaign, her campaign manager, Zach Sherman, first pointed us to the Rhode Island statute that requires Newport Tent -- or any other tent company - to obtain permits from local authorities. The link he sent was out-of-date. The General Assembly recently changed the law, increasing the minimum size of tents subject to local approvals from 120 square feet to 350 square feet. Sherman also gave us Corcoran’s number, so we called him. Our first question was the obvious one. Haven’t things gotten better since that 2010 package of legislation won passage? No, he said flatly. The problem isn’t so much that each of the state’s cities and towns requires a permit before Corcoran’s company can put up a tent, it’s that the requirements for those permits vary so widely, he said. Some communities require a trip to the building inspector and then the fire department. Some reverse the process. Others call for two visits to the building department. There is little consistency, he said. For example, he said, Providence requires a signed form from a property owner authorizing a tent to be put up. No other community requires such an authorization. We looked at regulations in other cities and towns and found more differences.  In Cranston, tent stakes must be installed at least 10 feet apart and aisles must be at least 44 inches wide, according to rules posted by that city’s Fire Department. The Watch Hill Fire Department in Westerly isn’t so specific, requiring only that there be no trip hazards in the tent. Corcoran also said Newport is the only community in the state that allows his company to do business by phone or mail, largely because of the company’s 40-years-plus year history of work there. Permit applications in all other cities and towns must be done in person. Corcoran says there’s more flexibility in Connecticut and Massachusetts. In Connecticut, where his company erected a tent last weekend, everything was done by phone and email, he said. ""That was easy,"" he said. ""They had the forms right online."" In Rhode Island, he said, he still has an employee who works nearly full-time on permitting in the state. Our ruling Catherine Taylor said that tent companies such as Newport Tent must meet different permit requirements in each of Rhode Island’s cities and towns. Although the state legislature has worked to ease the regulations governing Newport Tent and other tent companies, one thing hasn’t changed. Those companies must still seek permits from cities and towns through processes that vary widely and have differing requirements. We rule Taylor’s claim True.

Rachel Maddow: 'Not even old Gen. Eisenhower … saluted military personnel' as president
","You likely heard this already, but some conservatives and members of the military are upset that President Barack Obama saluted to Marines on Tuesday while holding a cup. Others are coming to Obama’s defense. We can summarize the incident in three short snippets. (And don’t worry, there’s a fact-check coming.) First, here’s video of the incident, which was released on the White House Instagram page:  And here’s a slice of the reaction, this one from Fox News commentator and former President George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove.  ""Look, he knows there are going to be two Marines at the bottom of Marine One when he gets off, and the idea that I’m going to just jaunt out there with my chai tea, and give them the old … you know it’s not a latte salute, it’s a chai salute, because he drinks chai tea, but I mean please, how disrespectful was that?"" Rove asked. Lastly, we found this defense of Obama on the website, Taskandpurpose.com. ""There’s no regulation that stipulates presidents must salute the troops. In fact, for the first 192 years of our republic, it didn’t happen. None of the first 38 commanders in chief did it,"" wrote Brian Adam Jones. To prove it, Jones quotes from MSNBC host Rachel Maddow’s 2012 book Drift. Maddow says saluting was a thing started by Ronald Reagan. ""Soldiers were supposed to salute their president; the president was not supposed to salute the soldiers. No modern president, not even old Gen. Eisenhower, had saluted military personnel. It might even be, well, sort of, improper."" (The passage starts on Page 36.) We wouldn’t normally dig up a claim a few years old, but the current fascination with the presidential salute and Jones' post had us wondering about Maddow’s claim that ""not even old Gen. Eisenhower, had saluted military personnel."" YouTube and archival video proves this claim wrong. As President-elect, Eisenhower visited Korea during the Korean War. In this video, Eisenhower clearly salutes American and United Nations troops. The salute is about 2 minutes, 30 seconds in. If you need proof of Eisenhower saluting the troops after taking the Oath of Office and in civilian clothes, he did so on Nov. 10, 1954, while attending the dedication of the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial. Footage of the dedication clearly shows Eisenhower saluting military personnel, first when he exits a car and later as he is walking past Marines.  Or here’s a clip from 1953, where Eisenhower is awarding the Medal of Honor to Korean War soldiers. He salutes at the 1:15 mark and again around 2:57. This 1959 video shows Eisenhower saluting what appear to be Italian troops, about 40 seconds in, and again at about 1 minute, 15 seconds. So clearly Eisenhower did salute military personnel as president, contrary to Maddow's claim. We suspect Maddow’s basis for her description may have roots in a 2007 New York Times opinion piece by Garry Wills, a professor emeritus of history at Northwestern University, as well as a 2004 op-ed by then-Reagan military aide and now-Minnesota U.S. Rep. John Kline. Wills was writing about presidents saluting soldiers when they board and exit Marine One (just like Obama on Tuesday). ""We are reminded, for instance, of the expanded commander in chief status every time a modern president gets off the White House helicopter and returns the salute of marines. ""That is an innovation that was begun by Ronald Reagan. Dwight Eisenhower, a real general, knew that the salute is for the uniform, and as president he was not wearing one. An exchange of salutes was out of order."" We couldn’t locate a copy of Kline’s op-ed, which ran in The Hill, but a 2008 Reuters account of the op-ed describes Reagan taking up the saluting issue with Gen. Robert Barrow, who was the commandant of the Marine Corps. Reagan explained as much in a 1986 speech to service members and their families. ""I can't resist telling you a little story that I've just told the marine guard at the Embassy. The story has to do with saluting. I was a second lieutenant of horse cavalry back in the World War II days. As I told the admiral, I wound up flying a desk for the Army Air Force. And so, I know all the rules about not saluting in civilian clothes and so forth, and when you should or shouldn't. But then when I got this job -- (laughter) -- and I would be approaching Air Force One or Marine One and those Marines would come to a salute and I -- knowing that I am in civilian clothes -- I would nod and say ‘Hello’ and think they could drop their hand, and they wouldn't. They just stood there. So, one night over at the commandant's quarters, Marine Commandant's quarters in Washington, and I was getting a couple of highballs, and I didn't -- (laughter) -- know what to do with them. So, I said to the commandant -- I said, ‘Look, I know all the rules about saluting in civilian clothes and all, but if I am the Commander in Chief, there ought to be a regulation that would permit me to return a salute.’ And I heard some words of wisdom. He said, ‘I think if you did, no one would say anything.’ ""So, if you see me on television and I'm saluting, you know that I've got authority for it now -- (laughter) -- and I do it happily."" For the record, Army regulations simply say soldiers are not required to salute when they are in civilian clothes. What to make of all of this? Reagan does appear to be the first president who made the presidential salute commonplace, especially when exiting or boarding Air Force One or Marine One. But Eisenhower did return salute of military members while he served as president, including when he was in civilian attire. In an emailed response to PunditFact, Maddow said Reagan started the presidential salute as a regular, daily feature. ""He started it -- other presidents have continued the practice since then,"" Maddow said. ""That’s the truth. ""Acknowledging that truth is not the same thing as saying that no president ever threw a salute, on occasion, before then,"" she said. Our ruling Maddow wrote, ""Not even old Gen. Eisenhower … saluted military personnel"" as president. For the record, no president is required to salute military personnel. And presidential salutes did not become commonplace until Reagan became president. But Eisenhower, a five-star U.S. Army general, did salute ""military personnel"" as president, at least occasionally. We searched archived videos for about 90 minutes and found video evidence of seven salutes. Does that mean he did it all the time? No. Reagan perhaps made the practice routine, but Eisenhower did salute military personnel. We rate Maddow's claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8A5080>],/factchecks/2014/sep/24/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-not-even-old-gen-eisenhower-saluted-/

NBA vs. NFL? Or Congress? Answer to Facebook meme is none of the above
","Whose pants are the most on fire: the NBA, the NFL, Congress or Facebook memes? Several readers sent us Facebook messages this week asking about a meme popping up on their newsfeed. It’s a list of statistics about crime, corruption and generally bad behavior, and it asks the viewer to guess if the list describes players in the NBA or the NFL. Surprise! It says it’s actually describing Congress. The meme struck us as suspect right off the bat. It says, of Congress’ 535 members: Wowza. One version on Facebook was posted Sept. 18 and already has more than 328,000 shares, The meme has appeared on Reddit a few times this week, too. Our friends at Snopes and FactCheck.org debunked the claims in this image years ago. But with the NFL’s current scandal concerning spousal and child abuse, it makes sense that this meme is circulating again. So we’re going to debunk it again. We don’t dispute that some lawmakers are involved in nefarious activities. Take, for example, former Rep. Trey Radel, R-Fla., who resigned earlier this year after he was caught buying cocaine from a federal agent. There’s no comprehensive database about all congressional crime and generally unsavory behavior, so we can’t come up with the real numbers on our own. But we know enough about where the meme originated to say that these statistics can’t be trusted. We searched the news, Congressional Quarterly membership profiles and other sources and couldn’t find anywhere near 84 arrests for drunk driving, 14 arrests for drug-related charges, 36 accusations of spousal abuse or any of these other accusations. We’re not even sure how you’d measure things like indirectly bankrupting a business or a person’s bad credit. The meme gives no author or source information. However, Snopes examined a near-identical 2012 version that references a 1999 series of articles by Capitol Hill Blue, an online politics publication. (Capitol Hill Blue has had several issues with credibility in the past.) Keep in mind that if these statistics were true -- and we’re reasonably certain they’re not -- they’re 15 years old. Only 100 members of the current Congress were in office in 1999, when Capitol Hill Blue published the stories. The Capitol Hill Blue articles say the authors’ research revealed each one of the statistics listed above, though sometimes with slightly different wording. (With one exception: the article says 29 members have been accused of spousal abuse, rather than 36.) The authors mention ""public records, past newspaper articles, civil court cases and criminal records,"" but do not quote specific documents. They also say plainly of some of their sources, ""We have talked with former associates and business partners who have been left out in the cold by people they thought were friends."" So these sources possibly had an agenda in talking to Capitol Hill Blue. We can’t even check which members of Congress Capitol Hill Blue is talking about. The article says, ""We will not run lists of every member who has written a bad check, punched somebody out or been charged with slapping a spouse."" All of this makes it difficult to take these allegations seriously. Even further, the series has been removed from Capitol Hill Blue’s website. It’s only accessible through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which periodically saves web pages. As far as we can tell, it was removed mid 2013. (In the last version that was saved, editors had removed the statistics from the article completely.) We reached out to Capitol Hill Blue for comment but haven’t heard back. Our ruling A Facebook meme says Congress includes 36 people accused of spousal abuse, 84 arrested for drunk driving in the past year, 71 with terrible credit and more. These accusations appear to be fabricated. The statistics come from an article written 15 years ago, and the original source, Capitol Hill Blue, has removed the original article from its website. Congress’ record isn’t blemish-free, by any means, but these statistics have no basis in fact.

With a nod to Rick Perry, Carlos Curbelo calls Social Security and Medicare a 'Ponzi scheme'
","Congressional candidate Carlos Curbelo sided with Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s depiction of Social Security and Medicare as a ""Ponzi scheme"" in a talk with college Republicans. ""I speak about both of these programs as one because they both suffer from the same long-term insolvency, meaning that they won't be around for us, meaning that we're paying into a system that, you know, is a Ponzi scheme,"" he told college students at George Washington University in Washington on Sept. 18 . ""Rick Perry said that. That's one of the few things I think Rick Perry contributed when he ran for president last time -- and I worked for him, so I can say that."" The Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog wrote about Curbelo’s comments captured by a tracker when he was in Washington fundraising. (Many of the students who heard Curbelo speak are from Florida.) Curbelo faces U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, in a district that includes many seniors from Miami to Key West so his comments drew a lot of attention. PolitiFact has rated several claims about whether Social Security is a Ponzi scheme including two we rated False by Perry leading up to the 2012 presidential election. We found some similar problems with Curbelo’s claim about Medicare. Social Security differs from Ponzi schemes We asked Curbelo’s campaign spokesman for evidence showing the programs are Ponzi schemes. Wadi Gaitan emailed us a statement that Curbelo was using ""a figure of speech"" and wants to preserve the programs for current and future generations. He provided no evidence that the programs are Ponzi schemes. Curbelo has made some broad suggestions for reform, including indexing benefits to life expectancy, (which already happens in part in Medicare) and changing how the cost of living adjustment is calculated. But first, what is a Ponzi scheme? The term originates with Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100 percent in 90 days on investments in foreign postal coupons. After first-round investors harvested those profits, others flocked to Ponzi, unaware his ""profits"" consisted of money paid in by other investors. That strategy is unsustainable. In contrast, Social Security is more like a ""pay-as-you-go"" system transferring payroll tax payments by workers to retirees. A 2009 Social Security Administration online post stated: ""The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days."" Mitchell Zuckoff, a Boston University journalism professor who has written a book on Ponzi, noted three critical dissimilarities between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme. We will summarize Zuckoff’s comments from an earlier fact-check: • ""First, in the case of Social Security, no one is being misled,"" Zuckoff wrote in a January 2009 article in Fortune. ""Social Security is exactly what it claims to be: A mandatory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed on their incomes to pay benefits, with no promises of huge returns."" • Second, he wrote, ""A Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is eventually exhausted."" While Social Security faces a huge burden due to retiring Baby Boomers, it can be and has been tweaked, and ""the government could change benefit formulas or take other steps, like increasing taxes, to keep the system from failing."" • Third, Zuckoff wrote, ""Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme. ... At the height of the Great Depression, our society (see 'Social') resolved to create a safety net (see 'Security') in the form of a social insurance policy that would pay modest benefits to retirees, the disabled and the survivors of deceased workers. By design, that means a certain amount of wealth transfer, with richer workers subsidizing poorer ones. That might rankle, but it's not fraud."" Michael Tanner, an expert on Social Security at the libertarian Cato Institute says that Social Security and Ponzi schemes share some characteristics -- for example, in the early stages there is a huge windfall while those later on get smaller returns. However, Ponzi didn’t have the power of the federal government. ""In the end the Ponzi scheme collapses and can’t make people continue to give him money, but Social Security can always force people to pay,"" Tanner said. ""In theory Social Security can always go out and raise taxes to keep benefits flowing."" Medicare Medicare, which pays for medical care for senior citizens, as well as for younger people with certain disabilities, covers 51 million people. (You can read more detail in a fact-check of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s claim that Medicare is going broke which PolitiFact Wisconsin rated Mostly False.) Medicare has two main components and they are funded differently. The primary source of financing for Part A, Hospital Insurance, is the FICA payroll withholding. In other words, it’s pay-as-you-go: the contributions of current workers (and their employers) finance the care for current beneficiaries. Most of the costs for Part B, which helps pay for doctor, outpatient and other services, are covered by the government’s general fund and, to a lesser extent, premiums paid by beneficiaries. Part B also has a trust fund, but it’s different from Part A in that whenever expenditures exceed revenue, the difference is automatically covered by transfers from the general fund. There is also a Part C -- Medicare Advantage, which is a private-insurance alternative to Part A and has no trust fund. And there is Part D, a prescription drug benefit included in Part B. Both Social Security and Medicare face a huge burden in the future and are susceptible to problematic demographic trends as the number of workers supporting every retiree has declined dramatically over decades. However, budget experts say neither are Ponzi schemes. The programs face shortfalls in part because the number of new workers paying into the system grows more slowly than seniors receiving benefits. But both programs get funds from general revenues to bridge the gap, said Edward Lorenzen, senior advisor at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""While a Ponzi scheme is by its nature inherently unsustainable, the Medicare and Social Security programs can be made sustainable with changes in benefits and taxes,"" Lorenzen said. However, ""the longer we wait to make those changes, the magnitude of the changes that will need to be made will be greater."" Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates for balanced budgets, said. ""The only difference with Medicare is that on its face it is even less ‘like’ a Ponzi scheme because for Medicare part B and D the system is designed to have general revenues (not dedicated taxes) pay for 75 percent of costs -- just like any other government program is paid for by the general revenue pool."" Our ruling Curbelo said that Social Security and Medicare are ""a Ponzi scheme."" A Ponzi scheme is by definition an illegal crime and an unsustainable set-up that crashes very quickly. Social Security and Medicare, which have been around for decades, are not criminal schemes. Both programs face the massive challenge of fewer workers paying for the benefits of current retirees, and budget experts say Congress could make changes to make them more sustainable in the future -- though many politicians are reluctant to gamble with the support of current senior voters. Curbelo raises a legitimate point about the need for reform, but that’s entirely different than calling these programs ""Ponzi schemes."" We rate this claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA46380>],/factchecks/2014/sep/24/carlos-curbelo/nod-rick-perry-carlos-curbelo-calls-social-securit/

Greg Abbott lacks clarification on investigation into cocaine-for-votes scheme in Rio Grande Valley
","In a debate with his Democratic foe, Republican gubernatorial nominee and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said Texas’ voter-identification law is needed because voter fraud does occur. Cocaine may have even been traded for votes, he said. Abbott said during the Sept. 19, 2014, debate against state Sen. Wendy Davis: ""Voter fraud is real. It must be stopped. And voter identification is one of the tools to put a stop to it."" State lawyers this week finished defending the law against a federal challenge heard in U.S. District Court in Corpus Christi. A moment later, Abbott said: ""I almost hesitate to bring this up, but you know that one of the challenges that’s going on as we speak is the fact that the FBI is involved in an investigation about people in the Rio Grande Valley who are using cocaine to buy votes. We cannot accept or tolerate this kind of lack of integrity in the election process."" We wondered: Is the government checking into ongoing trades of cocaine for votes? For starters, the McAllen Monitor newspaper reported on the investigation and the arrests of two women in a Sept. 1, 2014, news story. The story was based on court filings indicating the FBI was looking into allegations that a Hidalgo County commissioner’s campaign manager had used cocaine to draw votes in the 2012 primary election. Neither the commissioner nor campaign manager was identified in news story or the filings, which were posted online by Breitbart.com, the conservative news website. But, the Monitor reported, Veronica Saldivar and Belinda Solis, who worked as politiqueras – paid political campaign supporters who have been known to drive voters to the polls and even pay for votes – had just appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Ormsby in McAllen. In one of the filings, dated Aug. 28, 2014, Brandon Cook, an FBI special agent, said Solis had told him in a January 2014 interview that a campaign manager gave ziplock bags containing ""dime bags of cocaine to politiqueras"" to give to voters in exchange for their votes. In the other filing, Cook said that in early 2014, a person identified as ""Campaign Worker 1"" said he worked for a county commissioner in the 2012 primary election and bought $50 worth of cocaine, split it up and gave it to Saldivar and a person identified as ""Campaign Worker 2"" to give to voters in exchange for their votes; that worker, Cook said, told the FBI a campaign manager for a candidate gave ziplock bags containing cocaine to Saldvivar and to them to give to voters for votes. Cook said Saldivar recalled giving baggies of cocaine to two voters. Cook also said Saldivar gave authorities a list of individuals she recalled paying with cash, beer, cigarettes or cocaine in exchange for votes. We asked Michelle Lee, an FBI spokeswoman in San Antonio, if trades of cocaine for votes remain under investigation. ""Until a case if fully adjudicated, we view it as still under investigation,"" Lee said by phone. Lee noted, too, Justice on Sept. 19, 2014, issued a press release revealing the arrest in Illinois of a campaign manager, Francisco ""Frankie"" Garcia, of Donna, who had been charged with conspiring to buy votes, paying for votes and aiding and abetting others to buy votes. A federal indictment returned Sept. 16, 2014 said Garcia worked as a campaign manager for four candidates to the Donna School Board up to the November 2012 general election. After the voters at issue cast their votes, the indictment says, some would be brought to Garcia, who would himself pay in cash or baggies of cocaine. ""During that time, he allegedly bought votes and worked with other campaign workers to pay voters and to offer to pay voters in this election to vote for particular candidates,"" Justice said. ""The indictment alleges that Garcia paid voters by giving the voters either cocaine or cash in exchange for their votes.""

Wendy Davis says Republican Party of Texas platform calls for repeal of Voting Rights Act
","State Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth opposed the mandate adopted by the 2011 Legislature requiring most Texas voters to present a photo ID at the polls. She was among Democrats who argued that the hurdle attacked non-existent fraud and would disproportionately affect lower-income and minority populations. In a Sept. 19, 2014, gubernatorial debate, Davis broadened her criticism of voter ID -- and her opponent Greg Abbott’s support for it — by saying that Abbott’s party fully objects to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was signed into law when Texan Lyndon B. Johnson was president. At the time, the law took aim at methods used to prevent African Americans from voting. The act specified that no ""tests or devices"" could be placed between citizens and their ballots, spelling out examples such as literacy tests. Section 5 required certain jurisdictions -- states or smaller political entities that had recently employed such methods and had less than 50 percent voter participation or registration in the last presidential election -- to get federal approval before changing election laws. But this element was invalidated in 2013 by the U.S. Supreme Court with Abbott among state attorneys general urging the decision. In the debate, Davis said Abbott ""heads up a party whose platform calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act."" Is all that so? Davis is right about the platform adopted by delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in June 2014, which says: ""We urge that the Voter Rights Act of 1965, codified and updated in 1973, be repealed and not reauthorized."" That provision appears, though, after another entry: ""We support equal suffrage for all United States citizens of voting age who are not felons."" Similar declarations -- favoring voting rights for non-felons and repeal of the Voting Rights Act -- appeared in the party’s 2012 platform. But the platform adopted by delegates to the party’s 2010 convention didn’t have the call to repeal. We see how a governor could be viewed as helming her or his political party. But the Republican Party in Texas is chaired by Steve Munisteri, a lawyer repeatedly elected by convention delegates to the post. And while we found no news reports on Abbott backing or opposing the 2014 repeal plank, a June 2014 news story in the San Antonio Express-News, quoted Munisteri saying generally: ""It's not the Greg Abbott platform. He has his own platform."" Abbott campaign spokesman Avdiel Huerta then said Abbott’s platform stresses jobs, education, roads, water and securing the border. Abbott’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries about whether Abbott personally favors repeal. Our ruling Davis said Abbott ""heads up a party whose platform calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act."" This claim is accurate about the state party platform. But Abbott may or may not support repeal; he also isn’t his party’s chief, though it’s fair to suggest any governor has a role in guiding his or her state party.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Republican Governors Association']","
GOP attacks Carter on education votes in the Senate
","The too-close-to-call race between Republican incumbent Nathan Deal and Democratic challenger Jason Carter has the Republican Governors Association plunking down more money in Georgia. The RGA has already spent $1.6 million on Georgia’s governor’s race and is upping its investment with a new ad that started airing Tuesday in most parts of the state. The association has previously taken to the airwaves in Georgia to attack Carter, a state senator from Atlanta, as a ""liberal trial lawyer"" and a champion of expanding Medicaid as part of Obamacare. The new 30-second challenges one of Carter’s biggest campaign promises -- his vow to improve education funding. ""Jason Carter promises to invest more in education. But Carter actually opposed more funding for education in the Senate,"" the ad states. That’s a frequent claim out of the Deal campaign. It’s also very similar to a claim that PolitiFact has examined previously and deems worthy of a second look -- given that education is one of the hottest topics in the race and one of taxpayers’ biggest investment. (This year alone, the cost of K-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 percent of the state’s $18.3 billion budget.) The ad from the Republican Governors Association specifically takes aim at Carter’s vote in the most recent General Assembly session on the 2015 state budget (though the RGA gives a wrong citation in the ad for HB 744, the 2015 appropriations bill). Out of 56 state senators, Carter was one of only four who voted ""No"" on the budget,"" state records show. The budget included austerity cuts to education, totaling $747 million. But they were the smallest cuts since 2009 and, as such, were viewed by leaders in education as largely positive. This past spring, when Deal signed the 2015 budget into law, Carter explained his opposition was rooted in a belief that having a separate education budget would restore all, not just some, of the previous cuts. ""Budgets reflect values, and this budget shows that Gov. Deal does not value our students, teachers and classrooms,"" Carter said in a statement in April. Carter has since expanded on his idea of a separate education budget, including a questionable funding stream from tax cheats to boost spending. Republicans argued that Deal increased education funding every year, a claim PolitiFact found overstated his record. On the campaign trail, Carter has repeatedly attacked Deal for underfunding education. Most of his public statements as a state senator focused on education and called for more money, both on the K-12 and college levels. ""To say he does not support more funding is completely erroneous,"" Carter spokesman Bryan Thomas said. ""It’s precisely the opposite. He does not want our schools to continue to be shortchanged."" Republicans, however, have suggested that Carter’s vote against the 2015 budget was strictly political posturing. They point out that he voted in favor of Deal’s three prior state budgets, all of which had larger education austerity cuts. (Georgia’s 180 school systems collectively were underfunded more than $1.1 billion in 2012, $1.1 billion in 2013 and nearly $1.1 billion in 2014, according to allotment sheets from the Georgia Department of Education.) Austerity cuts reflect the difference in what school systems qualify for and actually receive from the state under the education funding formula, the Quality Basic Education Act of 1985. Carter has voiced concerns about the state’s commitment to public education during his short Senate career. His criticism, specifically of Deal on education, has sharpened in recent months, with his campaign manager at one point calling Deal Georgia’s worst education governor. (See PolitiFact’s Pants On Fire ruling of that claim.) Around the nation, there are 36 governor’s races this fall and about a third of them  -- including the one between Deal and Carter -- are considered competitive, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. ""Deal is one of five incumbent Republicans who is in some degree of difficulty,"" Sabato said. ""Deal is a slight favorite, but Carter has kept it close."" In summary, the RGA ad claims that Carter ""actually opposed more funding for education."" It would be accurate to say Carter voted against the current state budget that expanded money for schools. Carter has called for more education funding for nearly all of his short political career. But when it came down to votes in the state Senate, he voted with Gov. Deal on three budgets that contained austerity cuts and against the governor on a budget that had the smallest austerity cuts in years. The GOP was careful in wording its latest ad to say Carter opposed more funding for education ""in the Senate."" That statement needs that context but is largely on target. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE5F7C0>],/factchecks/2014/sep/24/republican-governors-association/attack-mostly-target-carter-opposed-education-fund/

Rep. Peter King says Islamic State tried to attack Fort Knox in 2011
","There’s considerable debate in Washington whether the Islamic State, the terrorist group now occupying parts of Iraq and Syria, presents a direct threat to the homeland. But to Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., there’s little doubt the threat is real. Why? Because, he said, they’ve tried to attack the United States before. ""They're coming at us, and we have to be on our guard at all times,"" King said Sept. 21 on Fox News Sunday. ""If (the Islamic State) went into Australia, they could certainly come into the U.S. In 2011, they attempted to attack Fort Knox."" An attack on Fort Knox? That claim caught us by surprise. Maybe it shouldn’t have, though, because it’s not even the the first time King has said it. We found at least seven instances of King making similar comments — including more than a year ago — in multiple variations. Aug. 31 on CBS: ""I believe strongly that ISIS does plan on attacking the United States. Even three years ago their predecessor organization attempted to attack Fort Knox, and two people were arrested and convicted in Kentucky for that attempted attack."" July 10 on Fox: ""In fact, three years ago when they called themselves al-Qaida in Iraq, there were three of them, three members were arrested attempting to attack Fort Knox in Kentucky."" July 31, 2013, on CNN: ""It was a (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)-related program that uncovered an al-Qaida cell in Sen. Paul's own state of Kentucky, which apparently was going to attack either Fort Campbell or Fort Knox."" Is it two people or three? Was the plot against Fort Campbell or Fort Knox? No matter how many times he repeats it or how he says it, there’s no public evidence that it’s accurate. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, does not list an attempted attack on Fort Knox (or Fort Campbell, for that matter) on its extensive list of 60 terrorist plots in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. Similarly, researchers at the University of Maryland National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism went through their database of foiled terrorist attacks for PolitiFact and told us ""nothing came up."" Iraqi nationals in Kentucky King’s office did not respond to multiple calls and emails over several days asking for more information. Nonetheless, based on his various comments, we were able to discern that King was referencing the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi nationals in western Kentucky on federal terrorism charges. The details of the case are indeed alarming. In September 2009, the FBI, based on a tip, launched an investigation into Waad Ramadan Alwan, an Iraqi nationalist living in Bowling Green, Ky. A confidential source for the FBI started talking with Alwan in 2011. Alwan discussed how he previously worked as a bombmaker in Iraq. He boasted about blowing up American Hummers and targeting U.S. soldiers, claiming he used improvised explosive devices, referred to by the military as IEDs, hundreds of times, according to court documents. The FBI even matched a fingerprint from Alwan to an unexploded IED that was discovered by the military in 2005. (If you can believe it, there’s a warehouse outside of Washington that houses thousands of bombs found by the military). Through that, investigators were able to determine that Alwan likely killed U.S. troops while in Iraq. The confidential source continued to meet with Alwan and recruited him to assist in an operation in the United States to send explosives, firearms and money to al-Qaida of Iraq. Let’s stop here for a second. It is reasonable to consider al-Qaida of Iraq a predecessor of the Islamic State, said Gary Ackerman, director of the Unconventional Weapons and Technology Division of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. What is now the Islamic State is rooted in the Iraqi branch of al-Qaida after multiple name changes and fusions with other groups. ""The core ideology and leadership have remained the same, with the strategy evolving from expelling the U.S. from Iraq and sectarian warfare in Iraq, to include toppling (Syrian President Bashar al) Assad, and eventually forming a Caliphate,"" Ackerman said. The sting On five occasions, Alwan helped procure and load money and weapons he believed were going to help al-Qaida of Iraq fight U.S. troops. In January 2011, Alwan recruited a friend to assist him — Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, another Iraqi who had moved to Bowling Green after first living in Las Vegas. (Alwan and Hammadi entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork.) From January to May 2011, the two worked together on five missions to send grenade launchers, machine guns, explosives, sniper rifles, hand grenades, missile launchers and $565,000 to al-Qaida of Iraq. Of course, this was all a sting operation. While Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping insurgents in Iraq, in reality, the FBI was monitoring all of their actions. The weapons, which the FBI rendered unusable, were merely transferred from one location under FBI control to another. In May 2011, Alwan and Hammadi were arrested. In December 2011, Alwan pleaded guilty to a 23-count indictment, including conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad and multiple charges of weapons and terrorist activities. Hammadi pleaded guilty to a 12-count indictment, including attempting to provide material support to terrorists. For cooperating with authorities, Alwan received a reduced sentence of 40 years in prison followed by a lifetime under house arrest. Hammadi was sentenced to life in prison. The charges None of the charges filed against Alwan and Hammadi were for domestic terrorism plots. There is no mention of a plot against Fort Knox in their charging documents or in the affidavit of their activities from investigators submitted at trial. They were not convicted of any crimes related to domestic terrorism. All of the charges against these individuals were for actions committed while in Iraq or for trying to assist terrorist groups operating overseas. We combed through hundreds of pages of court documents available online. The only conceivable reference to any other terrorist activity is in Hammadi’s sentence appeal. There, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit wrote: ""Hammadi and Alwan also plotted to murder a U.S. Army Captain whom they knew from Iraq."" An ABC investigative report had slightly more details: ""Alwan had been caught on an FBI surveillance tape talking about using a bomb to assassinate an Army captain they'd known in Bayji, who was now back home — and to possibly attack other homeland targets."" It’s possible this captain was located at Fort Knox, which was about 90 miles from Bowling Green (for what it’s worth, Fort Campbell is about 70 miles away). Perhaps King, who sits on the House intelligence committee, knows more details about this. However, even in the most generous interpretation of the facts, King’s account is still radically misleading. For starters, his comments inferred (and, in fact, he has said as much in the past) that the individuals were arrested for attempting to attack Fort Knox. Again, nothing in the charging documents goes so far as to even mention a domestic plot. Second, while it’s fair to say Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping a predecessor of the Islamic State, al-Qaida of Iraq had no communication with them. Even if Alwan and Hammadi had discussed a domestic attack, it would not be accurate to say the plan came from the Islamic State or al-Qaida of Iraq. They would have been acting alone, without any approval from an actual terrorist organization. This was more or less two Iraqis with dangerous background who were duped by the FBI into believing they were helping Islamic insurgents fight Americans overseas. Our ruling King said, ""In 2011, (the Islamic State) attempted to attack Fort Knox."" There is no public account of such a plot and King’s office did not respond to us to provide any evidence to suggest a foiled domestic attack on Fort Knox. In 2011, two Iraqi nationals were arrested in Kentucky about 90 minutes outside Fort Knox for attempting to help al-Qaida of Iraq by sending weapons, explosives and money to insurgents fighting overseas. However, their efforts were actually part of an FBI sting operation, and they never helped or connected with al-Qaida groups operating in Iraq. The two ultimately pled guilty to multiple counts of terrorist activities; however, there was no mention of a domestic plot in any of the charging documents. No doubt this is a troubling case, but the public record does not back up King’s conclusions about it. We rate King’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDC5880>],/factchecks/2014/sep/23/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-isis-tried-attack-fort-knox-20/
"['Oregon', 'Stimulus', 'Bloggers']","
Was Martha Kanter 'dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million' to save Craig Robinson's job?
","Every two years, just like clockwork, here it comes -- a chain email claiming that a federal assist worth millions of dollars saved Craig Robinson’s job as Oregon State University basketball coach. ""Thank Goodness For The Stimulus!!!"" trumpets the anonymous email, which first popped up in March 2010. ""But $17 million for one job? I wonder what mine is worth?"" An updated version is making the rounds again, urging people to vote this November. A PolitiFact Oregon reader received it from an acquaintance and passed it along to us. The claim: The email focuses on Robinson, who is first lady Michelle Obama’s brother and President Barack Obama’s brother-in-law. The piece alleges that Oregon State officials in 2010 were ""seriously considering"" firing Robinson after his team’s ""dismal"" start to the 2009-10 basketball season. ""When word reached Washington, D.C.,"" it continues, ""Undersecretary of Education Martha Kanter was dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university. Craig Robinson’s job is safe for another year."" It notes the first family connections and closes: ""If this doesn’t anger you, nothing will … remember to vote this fall!!!!"" The analysis: The crux of the claim involves the charge that Bob DeCarolis, Oregon State’s athletic director, was preparing to fire Robinson after a ""dismal 8-11 start (2-5) in the Pac 10 Conference."" The university changed its mind, supposedly, only after Kanter, formerly the Obama administration’s highest-ranking higher education official, was ""dispatched"" to Corvallis with oodles of stimulus money. We called Steve Clark, OSU’s vice president for university relations and marketing. ""It’s interesting that it comes up again now,"" he said, ""just a few months before the elections."" As for stimulus money -- from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, passed by Congress and signed by Obama after the 2008 onset of the Great Recession -- Oregon State did receive some. ""As did public universities throughout the nation,"" Clark said. OSU’s share totaled $26.4 million. ""That funded 61 research projects and some infrastructure,"" he added, ""all associated with issues consistent with Oregon State’s research mission."" However, a problem of timing surfaces immediately. By Oct. 12, 2009, OSU had already received and spent $17.8 million in stimulus money, according to a story by education reporter Betsy Hammond of the Oregonian (the remainder was spent later, on a rolling basis). So that’s likely where the $17 million referred to in the chain email came from. But when OSU’s 2009-10 basketball season came along, that money was already gone. The Beavers didn’t get to two wins and five losses in league play -- the point at which DeCarolis, according to the email, was mulling firing Robinson -- until their Jan. 23, 2010, road loss to California. It should also be noted that the funds came through the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, a program set up to help educational institutions retain top teachers and professors. Individual states, not the federal government, chose the recipients. We emailed Kanter, now a visiting professor at New York University Steinhardt. ""I have no idea where this rumor stems from,"" she wrote. ""I never traveled to Corvallis to award $17 million in stimulus money in 2010, nor do I personally know Craig Robinson."" She also provided a link to another fact-checking site that debunked the claim. OSU officials said they have no record of Kanter showing up in Corvallis around that time, nor is there any evidence of news stories detailing a trip. DeCarolis has flatly denied the story several times. It would also be highly unusual for any major college program to fire a coach so early in a season, especially considering that Robinson’s team the year before finished with an 18-18 win-loss record and earned OSU’s first post-season championship by winning the 2009 College Basketball Invitational. As for Robinson, the run didn’t last forever. DeCarolis fired him May 5, 2014, after six seasons and a win-loss record of 94-105. The ruling: A recycled chain email claims OSU basketball coach Craig Robinson -- Michelle Obama’s brother and the president’s brother-in-law -- avoided losing his job in March 2010 only because a high-ranking administration official was ""dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university."" Records show that OSU had spent $17.8 million in stimulus funds months before the point when Robinson’s job was supposedly on the line. And there is no evidence that an administration official was ""dispatched"" to Corvallis. The state, not the feds, also chose how to spend the money. The claim has been debunked repeatedly, but keeps cropping up with nothing changed but the date. It’s not only false, but ridiculously so.

Mary Burke ‘supports Obamacare unequivocally’ and wants to expand it, says Scott Walker
","Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign released one of those ominous-mood TV ads on Sept. 18, 2014. The ad opens with flames on the screen and a siren wailing in the background as a narrator with a deep voice intones: ""It’s been called the Lie of the Year."" The reference is to PolitiFact National’s 2013 Lie of the Year, which was President Barack Obama saying about his Affordable Care Act: ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" Moments later, the narrator states: ""But while millions have lost their doctors and their plans, Mary Burke says she still supports Obamacare unequivocally and wants to expand it."" We’ll check Walker’s claim about Burke -- that she says she backs the law ""unequivocally"" and that she wants to expand it. Obamacare, Medicaid, rollout The Affordable Care Act, of course, is Obama’s signature piece of legislation. Among its many provisions, the health care reform law mandates that people have health insurance, through an employer, a government program or by buying it with a government subsidy through an online marketplace that was created as part of the law. The law also provides for the expansion of Medicaid, the federal- and state-run health care program for the poor, by making millions more low-income people eligible for it. Walker, however, refused the expansion for Wisconsin, saying he didn’t trust the federal government to keep its promise to pick up the vast majority of the cost. Obamacare has been law since March 2010, but its provisions took effect in stages. One milestone occurred on Oct. 1, 2013 when the online marketplaces were opened. That rollout was badly marred by technical problems. Walker’s evidence To back the claim about Burke and Obamacare, Walker’s campaign cited an April 2014 MSNBC.com article about Burke’s candidacy for governor. It contained just one sentence about Obamacare: ""Burke is an unequivocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act and wants to expand Medicaid in the state, which Walker has refused to do."" There was no attribution for the statement, nor quote to that effect from Burke. So, the Walker campaign is picking up the reporter’s characterization, not Burke’s own words. Also in April 2014, Burke was asked by the Green Bay Press-Gazette if she supports Obamacare. She said, as she has on many occasions, that unlike Walker she backs the Medicaid expansion part of the law. ""Well, what I support is I would have taken the federal Medicaid money that Governor Walker turned down,"" she said. ""This is hundreds of millions of dollars a year that not only makes health care more affordable in Wisconsin, but it helps fuel our economy."" It’s worth noting that after she elaborated on what she views as the advantages of taking the additional federal money, Burke referred to problems with the online marketplace rollout. ""Certainly, Obamacare has its problems. I mean that was a really rough rollout,"" Burke said. ""And I think time will tell how many people sign up. Certainly the latest numbers look quite encouraging. But we have to make sure that it is a system that’s working. And it needs to be changed if it’s not working."" The Walker ad includes some video clips previously posted by the Wisconsin GOP of Burke, prior to her candidacy, defending Obamacare. But for the most part during the campaign, Republicans have tried to call out Burke for not being more clear on her position on Obamacare or for backtracking on her support of it. Indeed, while Burke has been clear on her contrast with Walker on the Medicaid expansion, she generally has avoided making comments about the overall law, although she has indicated support. We asked Burke’s campaign for Burke’s position on Obamacare. A spokeswoman replied by referring us to comments Burke made in the Green Bay newspaper interview. We also looked at some of Burke’s other statements. Asked in a Milwaukee TV interview in December 2013 if she supports the law in principle, Burke essentially sidestepped the question. But she said Wisconsin should have created its own online marketplace, or exchange, rather than having Wisconsin residents use the federal one, which is what Walker opted to do. ""I look at how Minnesota has handled it, and Minnesota actually has been able to do it in a way that benefits the people of Minnesota. And we had the same opportunity here in Wisconsin, but first and foremost we needed to accept the federal Medicaid money,"" she said. Similarly, Burke told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in August 2014: ""With our own online insurance marketplace, we could have negotiated with insurers to hold down prices. Obamacare has problems that need to be fixed, but we have to hold down healthcare costs to become a thriving, top 10 economy."" Our rating Walker said Burke says she ""supports Obamacare unequivocally and wants to expand it."" Walker provided no evidence that Burke has expressed unequivocal support for the Affordable Care Act, and we are not aware of any. At the same time, Burke does back the law and she supports expanding it through making more people eligible for Medicaid. Walker’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

Hume: Obama put more force into combating Ebola than ISIS
","Before President Barack Obama launched a wave of bombers, fighter planes, drones and cruise missiles against Islamic State at its key bases in Syria, some commentators had disparaged the administration’s willingness to take on the extremist group. On Fox News Sunday on Sept. 21, Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said Obama is ""not putting the full effort into"" defeating the group also called ISIS or ISIL. ""Consider the difference between the president's response to ISIS and his response to the Ebola outbreak,"" Hume said. ""He's sending a large force, much larger than ISIS is getting, to deal with this Ebola outbreak."" Hume’s comment came in the context of a discussion over the approximately 1,600 U.S. military advisers and trainers deployed to Iraq to reverse the territorial gains ISIS made there. Via Twitter, we asked Hume to flesh out his claim that Obama is sending ""a much larger"" force to deal with Ebola ""than ISIS is getting."" Hume said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ""told Congress (the) U.S. has 1,600 troops in Iraq. Obama announced 3,000 to fight Ebola in Africa."" The White House announced Sept. 16 that 3,000 troops would help with logistics and setting up medical facilities to contain the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in five West African nations. Prior to the Sept. 22 attacks on targets in Syria, the Pentagon said about 1,600 American troops were in Iraq. The problem is, Hume's claim applied to Obama's overall military strategy to combat ISIS, which involves far more than the 1,600 military advisers and troops he sent to Iraq. ""Boots on the ground is a terrible metric,"" said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based think tank that supports larger defense budgets. Gunzinger is a retired Air Force colonel and served in the Pentagon during the administration of President George W. Bush. Gunzinger factors in the airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq. Before Sept. 22, there had been over 170 strikes by American fighter jets, bombers and drones. ""A single aircraft carrier has a crew and air wing that can run from 5,000 to 6,000 people,"" Gunzinger said. ""I think it's accurate to say that the level of effort for air and ground operations in Iraq ...  far exceeds the level of effort now underway for (the Defense Department)'s humanitarian operations in Africa."" A senior Defense Department spokesman also noted the number of soldiers needed to launch airstrikes and pointed to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s inventory of military assets in the region. In a 2013 speech in Bahrain, Hagel said there are more than 35,000 military personnel in and around the Persian Gulf, including a carrier strike group and airbases. Those bases support a range of aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, B-1 bombers, drones and F-22s. We asked Hume about the airstrikes. He said if one were to count the aircraft carrier crew, one would need to include the personnel needed to protect the 3,000 troops in Africa. However, it is possible that the 3,000 includes that protective force. More broadly, we found a 2011 list of active duty military stationed in Africa, posted by CNN. It showed fewer than 700 troops. U.S. Africa Command currently reports that it has about 2,000 assigned personnel, including military, government civilians and contractors. None of these figures seem to reach the level of troops used against ISIS as of Sunday, Sept. 21. Our ruling Hume said the president is sending a much larger force to deal with Ebola than ISIS was getting. Hume’s statement only holds water so long as you limit the tally to the additional ground forces assigned to each mission. But that framework ignores the airstrikes, the main tool the president had used against ISIS as of Sept. 21, before the strikes were expanded to ISIS targets in Syria. If ISIS was ""getting"" something, what it got came from forces already in the region, and it seems to make little difference if an ISIS position was destroyed by a soldier newly arrived in the theater or one who had been there a while. At the very least, those strikes relied on carrier-based war planes. According to a former Air Force colonel and the Pentagon, the number of soldiers needed to launch those attacks is larger than the 3,000 troops deployed to fight the Ebola outbreak. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE34640>],/factchecks/2014/sep/23/brit-hume/hume-obama-put-more-force-combatting-ebola-isis/

""Graham was a Washington lobbyist and liberal political consultant who has taken thousands of dollars from Nancy Pelosi and her special interest allies,"" the commercial said. It also said she is ""hiding the truth"" that she supported the Affordable Care Act and was ""handpicked"" by Pelosi -- the House Democratic leader -- to run for the congressional seat. Politicians often turn to lobbying when their public careers have ended, but it’s less common for a lobbyist to run for office. Rep. David Jolly, who won a special election in March to succeed the late C.W. Bill Young in Pinellas County’s 13th District, spent years as a lobbyist, but he won despite attacks on his lobbying history by his Democratic opponent, former state CFO Alex Sink. Graham has been touting her resume as an attorney and employee of the Leon County School District. Did she once serve as a Washington lobbyist? Curriculum vitae In 1988, Graham graduated with a law degree from American University. She then worked with the firm Andrews & Kurth, a law firm that also did lobbying for some clients. One of those clients was the Secondary Lead Smelters Association. Southerland’s team pointed to lobbying disclosure records from 1989 and 1990 that list Gwendolyn G. Logan, Graham’s married name at the time. The lobbying paperwork says in part that the work was to ""promote battery recycling legislation and other legislation affecting the secondary lead industry."" In addition, Southerland points to an October 1990 handwritten staff note on the Lead Exposure Reduction Act from Bob Graham’s archive at the University of Florida. The note included the sentence from a staffer, ""Put lead bill & materials in envelope to Becky for Gwen from BG,"" which Southerland’s camp considers proof of influence. Graham’s campaign quickly responded that her name being on disclosure forms was not proof of lobbying, because she did not participate in any such activity. It was her employer who listed her name on the forms. She even supplied a letter from her former Andrews & Kurth supervisor to prove it. The supervisor, Rob Steinwurtzel, wrote in a letter that the documents in question were not proof of Southerland’s claim. ""We listed everybody in our group on the form, regardless whether they actually performed lobbying activities or not,"" Steinwurtzel told the Tampa Bay Times. ""She came as a first-year associate and basically, first-year associates spend a lot of time in the library. She did not go to meetings with legislators or advocate on behalf of clients. I’m pretty certain about that."" As for the handwritten note, the campaign said at the time the note was written, Graham was bed-ridden for a high-risk pregnancy. She gave birth to daughter Sarah three weeks later and soon left the firm. The staffer’s direction from her father could have referred to anything, the campaign said. Graham’s campaign had D.C. law firm Sandler Reiff explore the legality of Graham’s name being listed on the forms. The firm concluded that the filings in question fell under the purview of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, which preceded the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act in effect today. Under the earlier rules, Graham would have had to have been in direct contact with members of Congress for herself or her clients, self-report her work, have done substantial work on the legislation in question, and register herself a lobbyist, although doing a certain amount of work for a client fell under the reporting threshold. She had done none of these things. It was also common practice for a firm to list all support staff, with no regard to what they had actually done for the client, Sandler Reiff’s Joshua Rosenstein concluded. Lobbying experts we spoke to agreed that rules were much different before the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and that undermines Southerland’s attack. ""I think her firm is right by saying they were being overly compliant,"" said Lisa Gilbert, director of the Congress Watch Division for liberal consumer-advocacy group Public Citizen. ""Under the definitions at the time she certainly did not perform lobbying activities. That said, to a layman, her support would seem like lobbying. You can’t tell from the documentation."" Dan Auble, a lobbying researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics, said he wasn’t entirely familiar with requirements the earlier Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, but the weakness of the paperwork is that you have to take Graham’s employer’s word for it. ""If you take what the law firm is saying on its face, then she really didn’t,"" Auble said, although it’s possible the firm is stretching the truth. He said things have changed in Washington in the last 25 years -- and that’s something to keep in mind when considering Southerland’s claim. ""People used to list names in the report because there was no stigma related to the word ‘lobbyist,' "" he said. ""Now no one wants to be called a lobbyist."" Our ruling Southerland said Graham ""was a Washington lobbyist."" Even if it’s true that Graham lobbied, it would have been for a brief period a quarter-century ago. But it’s not at all clear that the charge is true. Southerland’s campaign based their attack on paperwork from the law firm Graham worked for after earning her law degree, listing her among the support staff. However, Graham provided a note from her supervisor saying that she was a researcher at the time and had not done actual lobbying work. She was listed because listing junior and support staff was a common practice at the time, according to a law firm retained by the Graham campaign. Experts we talked to agreed. At most, Graham’s inclusion on disclosure forms may have technically made her part of a lobbying effort, but there’s little evidence to suggest what, if anything, she did. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E8A20580>],/factchecks/2014/sep/23/steve-southerland/steve-southerland-says-gwen-graham-was-washington-/

Gov. Rick Scott highlights regulation freeze in first State of the State speech
","
Over and over during his campaign for governor, Rick Scott said state government regulations were killing jobs and that state spending had spun out of control. 
Scott used part of his first State of the State speech on March 8, 2011, to highlight what he'd done to rein back government red tape. 
""On my first day in office, I ordered a review of every regulation in the pipeline and every contract exceeding $1 million,"" Scott told a joint session of the Legislature at the start of its 60-day legislative session. 
Is Scott right? 
Mostly. 
Within an hour of his inauguration, Scott issued Executive Order No. 11-01, which required ""all agencies under the direction of the governor to immediately suspend all rulemaking."" The order also imposed a 90-day suspension on contracts with a value in excess of $1 million. 
As part of the order, both the contracts and rules needed the approval of the governor's new Office of Fiscal Accountability and Regulatory Reform. 
Scott denied his first contract on Feb. 18, according to the St. Petersburg Times, rejecting an $18 million Medicaid contract between MedSolutions and the Agency for Health Care Administration for outpatient imaging services. 
Here's the text explaining the governor's decision to reject the contract. ""Beginning Fiscal Year 2005-06 through Fiscal Year 2008-09, the following proviso was inserted and continued in the General Appropriations Act: From the funds in Specific Appropriation XXX, the agency is authorized to implement a utilization management program for outpatient diagnostic services. To date, the agency never implemented a utilization management program for outpatient diagnostic services. Proviso language is only valid for one year. The last time the above-mentioned proviso was in the General Appropriations Act was Fiscal Year 2008-09. It is uncertain if the agency would still have authority to implement such a program. The agency is unable to provide an independent study or other supporting data which would validate significant savings to the Medicaid program if such a $18,000,000.00 program were implemented."" 
The caveat here is that while the governor instituted the freeze for the offices he controls, many state agencies were not asked to comply, including those led by members of the Florida Cabinet. 
On Jan. 14, the three members of the Cabinet, all Republicans -- Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam -- told the Times that they would not comply with Scott's request to have pending regulations in their offices frozen and then reviewed by the governor's office before becoming effective. 
""We are not sending our rules to the governor's office,"" Atwater spokesman Sterling Ivey said. ""We are looking at all of our rules internally to make sure they align with the direction the commissioner wants to go with the department."" 
Scott is right that he froze regulations and certain contracts upon taking office. But it didn't apply to all state agencies, and we've only found one contract that's actually been denied since the freeze took effect. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB830140>],/factchecks/2011/mar/08/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-highlights-regulation-freeze-first-/

Sen. Sherrod Brown says Hitler, Stalin and Mubarek all opposed independent unions
","
Ohio's Sherrod Brown took the floor of the U.S. Senate last week to recall some history he considered pertinent, given current events involving public worker unions in Ohio and Wisconsin.

""I look back at history,"" he said, ""and some of the worst governments we've ever had, you know one of the first things they ever did? They went after the trade unions. Hitler didn't want unions. Stalin didn't want unions. (Former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak didn't want independent unions. These autocrats in history don't want independent unions.""

Brown hastened to say that he was not drawing an analogy.

""I'm not comparing what's happening to the workers in Madison or in Columbus to Hitler and Stalin,"" he said. ""But I am saying that history teaches us that unions are a very positive force in society that creates a middle class, and it protects our freedom.""

Recent history also teaches us that nuance and context are lost when someone drops the H-bomb. Mentioning Hitler in political discussion obscures any other point.

The Washington website Politico.com quickly posted a partial video of Brown's speech that carried the headline, ""Sherrod Brown compares Republicans to Hitler.""

Chris Bond, press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released video of part of the speech, with the headline: ""Sherrod Brown invokes Hitler in his latest political attack.""

E-mailed and tweeted video links started making the rounds. Brown's office noted that some of the links and postings did not include the full context of his remarks, but that should not have come as a surprise.

Brown apologized the next day.

""I should not have mentioned the hostility of tyrants like Hitler to unions,"" he said. ""I don't want my mistake to distract from the critical debate in Ohio, and I apologize for it.""

But fact-checking is our business. Even accepting that Brown did not intend a comparison, PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine the accuracy of his history.

We thought it was important, in particular, because of postings by some bloggers and commenters claiming Hitler did not oppose unions -- that he wrote favorably about them in ""Mein Kampf,"" that he proclaimed May Day a workers' holiday, and that he even started a union.

We looked at contemporary and historical accounts and a transcript of the Nuremberg Trials, and we consulted Kenneth F. Ledford, associate professor of history and law at Case Western Reserve University. He is a social historian of modern Germany and an authority on German legal and labor history.

Citations from ""Mein Kampf"" come from the chapter ""The Problem of the Trade Unions""  -- ""which is really pretty incoherent,"" Ledford said.

""It is not an endorsement of trade unions but a call to subordinate the message of class solidarity to one of national solidarity"" and ""a call for the quiescence of labor to favor heavy industry,"" he said.

In saluting unions, as in naming the Nazis the National Socialist German Workers' Party, Hitler ""was using words he knew had appeal. It was as if they had been focus-grouped. Those were hot-button words that had resonance in the revolutionary period after 1918.

""The reality is, the (Nazi) party could not make inroads into the organized, unionized, working-class electorate in Germany,"" Ledford said.

May Day was first celebrated as an international day of labor in New York in the 1880s. Hitler made it an official paid holiday, not just a negotiated day off, on May 1, 1933 --  and used it to rally for his regime and industrialization. William Shirer (The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich), who was there, called it ""an elaborate piece of trickery.""

The next day, on May 2, 1933, unions were dissolved, their assets were confiscated, their offices were occupied and their leaders were arrested. Hitler then outlawed strikes, abolished collective bargaining and established the German Labor Front, a corrupt party organization.

""It wasn't even a sham labor union,"" Ledford said.

In Russia, he noted, ""Stalin didn't have to eliminate unions -- Lenin already had."" And Stalin's first Five-Year Plan converted labor groups into oppressive mechanisms for increasing worker productivity.

Mubarak does not belong in the same category as Hitler and Stalin. But his government did routinely suppress worker protests by force. The government-run Egyptian Trade Union Federation was given a monopoly on labor organization in 1957 by the Trade Union Act, which prohibits union freedoms.

Brown’s statement about tyrants and unions may have been distracting and ill-advised given the current standoffs, but it also is historically accurate. We rate Brown’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAA8880>],/factchecks/2011/mar/08/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-hitler-stalin-and-mubarek-a/

Michele Bachmann charges health care bill spent $105 billion 'secretly'
","
Tea party favorite Michele Bachmann used a recent appearance on Meet the Press to attack the health care law for what she said was secret spending.

""It is shocking the revelations of all the money that's been spent,"" said Bachmann, R-Minn. ""There is a Congressional Research Service report that just was issued in February, and we discovered that secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress, over $105 billion was hidden in the Obamacare legislation to fund the implementation of Obamacare. This is something that wasn't known.""

Just in case you missed her point, she said the number ""$105 billion"" seven more times, and waved a sign that said ""$105,464,000,000.""

Readers e-mailed us immediately, asking us to fact-check whether it was true.

We contacted Bachmann’s office to ask where she got the number, but we didn’t get a response.

So we turned to a February report from the Congressional Research Service titled, ""Appropriations and Fund Transfers in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).""

The $105 billion

To explain the report’s findings, we should first tell you a little bit about how federal spending works when it comes to authorizations versus appropriations. Laws can either authorize money to be spent, appropriate money, or both authorize and appropriate. An authorization means it’s legally permissible to spend money on a particular program; an appropriation actually supplies the money. The real power lies in appropriation.

House members like Bachmann had hoped to stop the new health care law by simply refusing to fund it with appropriations. What they’re finding out, though, is that doing so won’t shut the money spigot entirely, since the law already included some appropriations and transfers from other sources when it passed.

The CRS report detailed the programs that received funding in the bill. (Fund transfers work a little differently than appropriations, but the important thing for analyzing Bachmann’s comment is that they both provided immediate funding.) The CRS report doesn’t add up all the numbers, but we did, and we got $104 billion -- very close to Bachmann’s number. A few programs are funded contingent on adjustments for inflation, so the grand total can vary a bit.

The largest chunk of funding, $40 billion, went to the state Children’s Health Insurance Program, to fund it for 2014 and 2015. (Soon after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, Democrats approved funding through 2013.) A new Prevention and Public Health Fund -- a state-based effort aimed at preventing chronic disease -- got the second biggest chunk, $15 billion over 10 years. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation got $10 billion over 10 years to test payment and service-delivery models that might reduce health care spending and improve care.

The ""shocking"" revelation

But is that $105 billion a ""shocking"" revelation -- something that ""wasn’t known"" and passed ""secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress""?

Bachmann has a point if you look at the amount of media coverage the appropriations and transfers inspired. There was hardly any.

Using a variety of terms to search the Nexis database, we found only one document that explained in any detail how the health care bill included appropriations and transfers -- a news release by the conservative Heritage Foundation that raised an alarm about abortion funding. The bill, Heritage said, would ""directly appropriate $7 billion over five years in operating funds for (federally qualified health centers) ... funds (that) would not need to be included in the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Labor and HHS.""

But Bachmann didn’t say that the media failed to pay attention; she went further, charging that the provisions were passed ""secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress."" We find that contention questionable.

We poked around the versions of the health care law that were up for consideration and found older versions that included both appropriations and fund transfers, some of which made it to the final bill. The CRS report Bachmann cited may have compiled the appropriated funding information into an easy-to-understand format, but it’s not as if the spending was approved secretly.

Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense said it was no secret: the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan budget-analysis agency -- extensively detailed the spending in the bill.

""I’m not saying that everybody knew everything that was in the health care bill, because it’s almost impossible to do that. But it was documented that the money was in there,"" Ellis said. ""Shame on them if they didn’t know that.""

We asked experts in federal budgeting whether the health care bill’s use of appropriations in an authorizing bill was unusual. They said it was not.

""Congress has routinely provided appropriations in authorization bills, for multiple years of availability, and has also routinely transferred funds from one account to another,"" said Roy T. Meyers, a former CBO analyst and now a political scientist at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County.

We should also note that versions of the health care law were posted to the Internet for 72 hours before a vote was held. That’s not a lot of time, but it’s far from a secret process, said Gabriela Schneider of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that urges greater government openness and transparency.

""At the time, we commended Congress for taking an unprecedented step and Speaker Pelosi for making sure every version of the health care bill was posted online 72 hours before consideration,"" she said.

The process worked well, Schneider said, and House Republicans have subsequently adopted the 72-hour window.

""It's a bill -- the text is public!"" said Alec Vachon, a former Republican congressional staffer who’s now a health care consultant. ""Is Congresswoman Bachmann saying there are no House Republicans, members or staff, who can read a bill?""

One final point: Contrary to the implication of Bachmann’s comments, the spending provisions in the health care bill are not written in stone. ""Congress can always revisit the spending decisions, including entitlement and direct spending, of past Congresses,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican aide to the House Rules Committee.

Our conclusion

Bachmann said that ""secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress, over $105 billion was hidden in the Obamacare legislation."" She’s right that there’s about $105 billion of already approved spending in the health care bill that may be difficult to rescind. But that does not mean that the process was secret. While the pre-approved spending provisions didn’t attract media attention, they were in the plain language of the bill and did not vary dramatically from past congressional practice. And the bill was made public before the vote. On balance, we rate Bachmann’s statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E8A33140>],/factchecks/2011/mar/08/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-charges-health-care-bill-spent-10/

Wisconsin officials claim cleaning up the state Capitol will cost $7.5 million
","
After nearly three weeks of protests, including large groups of people sleeping in the Wisconsin Capitol, the administration of Gov. Scott Walker decided to clean up the joint.

On the eve of Walker’s March 1, 2011, budget address, the building was shut down to almost everyone. You had to have an appointment with a legislator and make it through a police checkpoint to get inside.

Organizers of protests against Walker’s plans to curtail collective bargaining rights for most public employees went to court to demand the Capitol be reopened. A three-day hearing was held before Dane County Circuit Judge John Albert.

We won’t rehash all the details here.

But in the spirit of spring cleaning, we want to return to a statement -- since withdrawn -- that was made about how much the Capitol cleanup would cost.

The number, stated in court on March 3, 2011: A whopping $7.5 million.

Think of it this way: If you paid someone $20 an hour, with a standard 40-hour workweek, that person would be peeling tape and scrubbing marble for 180 years.

The $7.5 million figure came from the state Department of Administration, headed by Secretary Mike Huebsch. The words were spoken by an attorney for the department, Cari Anne Renlund. But, following PolitiFact protocol, which assigns statements from spokesmen to their bosses, we’ll attribute this number to Huebsch.

To duplicate the reaction we -- and many readers -- had at the time the number was first used, we have to type in capital letters: IT WILL COST $7.5 MILLION?

And: THAT’S A LOT OF CASH.

In court, Renlund said the estimate included $6 million to repair damaged marble inside the Capitol, $1 million for damage outside and $500,000 for costs to inspect the damage.

The culprit: Tape used to put up protest signs. The tape adhesive is acidic, the marble is a base, so, over time, the tape could etch the stone.

The damage claim rocketed around the Internet (such as here and here and here) and on news reports and talk shows around the world (here and here). Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch posted the figure on her Facebook page, generating more than 125 comments -- mostly from people condemning the protesters and the extraordinary level of damage they allegedly caused.

But other testimony and news reports from the Capitol indicated that something was amiss.

Protesters had, by all accounts, policed themselves, including creating cleanup details and other organizational efforts. They used blue painters’ tape to hang their signs -- at the request of state officials. Some protesters said the state had actually provided the tape to avoid lasting damage.

One day before the eye-popping damage estimate came out, a Madison historic preservation expert posted a blog item praising the conduct of the protesters.

The protesters ""have adopted an ownership ethic in the building, treating it with the utmost care and respect,"" wrote Jason Tish, executive director of the Madison Trust for Historic Preservation and a local field representative for the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

He called the demonstrators ""evangelistic about their respect for the building.""

""Handwritten signs on glass display cases, rest room doors and granite pillars demand care, cleanliness, and respect for the building they call ‘Our house.’  High humidity and salt and dirt residue may add to the cumulative impact on floors and painted surfaces, but any damage to the building is unintended,"" he wrote.

Such observations were seen and heard by reporters and others covering the Capitol day after day. So when Renlund uncorked her estimate, it was especially jarring.

As one blog posting noted, you could replace large sections of marble for $7.5 million. Indeed, that’s more than the $7.2 million that the state spent to build the Capitol, which was completed in 1917.

On March 4, 2011 -- the day after the number was revealed -- Huebsch’s office issued some documents backing up the alleged pricetag.

This included a March 2, 2011, memo from state architect Dan Stephans, who oversaw a $145 million restoration project in 2001. The memo says 400 hours of  time by a ""qualified team"" would be needed to inspect the building and grounds for damage at a cost that could reach $500,000. In addition, he wrote, 240,000 square feet of the building need attention -- and it would take a crew of 20 a minimum of 12 weeks. That’s $6 million for the interior, and another $1 million to replace sod and shrubs outside.

Twice in his memo, Stephans said he’s providing an ""educated guess"" about the repair costs.

But the memo was not operative for long.

The same day, the state provided a different memo, from Peter Maternowski, deputy administrator of the Division of State Facilities. It was written that day, addressed to Huebsch.

That memo said the cleanup would cost $347,500 if the work did not require a historic preservation specialist. That’s 20 times less than the original claim.

Among other things, the budget-priced memo said Stephans’ estimates included restoring portions of the building to way they were in 2001, after the major rehab project was done. That sounds like a lot of work for painter tape removal.

By March 7, 2011, the Department of Administration reported that all signs and banners in the Capitol had been removed. Some of the signs are being considered for preservation by the Wisconsin Historical Society or the Smithsonian Institution.

Tish, the preservationist/blogger, returned for a look that same day.

""The extent of what I saw today is just chips and nicks -- cosmetic damage,"" he said in an interview. ""I don’t see how they (protesters) could have conducted themselves any better.""

Tish said the building bore the signs of the ""accelerated cumulative effects of lots of people going through the building. I saw no intentional damage.""

Maternowski said the state has hired Charlie Quagliana, a Madison architect, to evaluate the building’s condition and recommend how to proceed. Quagliana worked on the 2001 restoration project and is an expert in historic buildings, Maternowski said.

""Depending on what he finds, he may call others in,"" he said.

Let’s assess the damages.

While urging a judge to scale back protests, a state Department of Administration official said the state Capitol sustained $7.5 million in damage. State officials could not immediately provide a basis for the number, and later backtracked from it.  The new estimate: $347,500, some 20 times less than the original one. And there are indications that even that could be high.

This smells like an effort to pour gas on the anti-protester fire. The claim was ridiculously high. And that gets a Pants on Fire rating.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC95DA80>],/factchecks/2011/mar/08/mike-huebsch/wisconsin-officials-claim-cleaning-state-capitol-w/

Gov. Bob McDonnell says education funding grew six times faster than enrollment
","
On Feb. 24, PolitiFact Virginia rated as True a statement by Gov. Bob McDonnell that public education funding over the last decade grew six times faster than enrollment. We based that ruling on raw state budget and K-12 enrollment numbers. Subsequently, several readers pointed out that we did not factor in inflation. They were right, inflation accounted for most of the imbalance between increases in education and gains in enrollment. So we are changing our rating to Half True because there is some validity to McDonnell’s claim but his numbers are out of context. And we are providing a new analysis, which appears below.

In the closing days of this winter’s General Assembly session, Gov. Bob McDonnell unsuccessfully tried to build support for a $50 million cut in public education funding.

The governor told the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a story that ran Feb. 20, that K-12 education funding has grown six times faster than enrollment over the last decade.

We graded McDonnell’s math.

His data was compiled by Dan Timberlake, Director of Virginia’s Department of Planning and Budget. Timberlake told us he decided to compare budget levels from the 2002 fiscal year with those currently allocated for the 2012 fiscal year, which will begin July 1.

Timberlake said he measured three major, state-generated sources of education dollars: Virginia’s general fund, lottery proceeds and the Literary Fund. His figures did not include federal money and a few very small funding sources.

General fund revenue primarily comes from income taxes on individuals, though it also includes some sales tax revenue, contract fees, and profits from the state-run liquor stores. The money pays for general services such as schools, public safety and health.

Lottery funds, which were pulled from the general fund fund in 2007 and siphoned directly to education, provided $430.2 million to education last school year.

The Literary Fund gets revenue from criminal fines, fees, and forfeitures, unclaimed property; unclaimed lottery winnings and interest on low-cost loans that are used for school construction projects.

State funding from these three sources was $4.01 billion in the 2002 fiscal year and is slated to be $5.47 billion in the 2012 fiscal year. That’s an increase of 36.2 percent.

Next Timberlake tracked student enrollment in the state’s public schools, and so did we. Enrollment grew from 1,147,673 in the fall of 2001 (which is in the 2002 fiscal year) to a projected level of 1,220,523 in the fall of 2011. That’s an increase of 6.3 percent.

So education spending grew 36.2 percent while student numbers grew 6.3 percent. That would make the spending increase just shy of six times larger than the enrollment increase.  

But there’s a catch to these numbers: inflation accounted for most of the increase and McDonnell did not factor it into his equation.

When your stir in the 22.5 percent rise in the national consumer price index over the last decade, you end up with a 13.7 percent inflation-adjusted increase to education spending. That’s slightly more than double the rate of enrollment growth.

You get a similar result when consider the 23 percent inflation rate over the decade in Southern states, where the Bureau of Labor Statistics includes Virginia in its regional calculations. Unfortunately, BLS does not measure inflation in individual states.

Why did new funding outpace enrollment over the last decade?

Charles Pyle, director of communications for the Virginia Department of Education, said much of the money was needed to pay for Standards of Learning mandates the state set for public schools, including an algebra readiness initiative and early-reading program.

Pyle said funding has also increased for pre-school initiatives that serve children not covered by the Head Start program. And he said major investments have been made to upgrade technology in schools. Additional funding has also been directed towards resource teachers in elementary schools and English-proficiency instructors.

A closing note: The General Assembly ended up approving a $75 million increase for public schools before adjourning on Feb. 27.

Let’s review. The governor claimed state K-12 funding grew six times faster than student enrollment during the past decade.

According to the Virginia Department of Planning and Budget, education spending from state sources has climbed 36.2 percent in the past 10 years. During that period, the number of K-12 students in Virginia has climbed 6.3 percent. So McDonnell is technically right, but his claim is misleading.

When you consider inflation over the last decade -- which the governor did not -- new spending slightly more doubled growth in enrollment. Much of that increase came from new Standards of Learning requirements that McDonnell strongly supported as a legislator.

We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6C9F80>],/factchecks/2011/mar/08/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-education-funding-grew-six-/

E-mail says state employees in Wisconsin will have to pay 100 percent of pensions and health insurance after 2012
","
Rumors of dire consequences for state employees flew the morning after Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced deep cuts in the 2011-’13 state budget.

Employee angst centered on fears of new financial sacrifices -- beyond Walker’s previously announced proposal that state workers pay 50 percent of their pension costs and a bigger chunk of health insurance premiums.

Department of Corrections employees in the Racine area openly fretted in an e-mail they forwarded to co-workers, families, friends and fellow union members.

Citing specific pages in the budget repair bill, the email said a major surprise awaited employees after 2012.

""Page 58 Sec 62.623 --  In 2013 the state will NO LONGER PAY ANYTHING toward our medical and pension fund. The state employees will be required to pay the entire cost, roughly $1500.00 a month for each employee.""

That would mean about $18,000 a year. 
The e-mail reflects concerns on the tips of employees' tongues for weeks, said Matt Stohr, spokesman for the state Department of Employee Trust Funds. 
""Every day it seems there is another rumor to react to,"" Stohr said. 
The e-mail was forwarded to us by one of its recipients, Corrections employee Catherine Weishan. 
Weishan said it alarmed her because taking on the full cost of health insurance and pensions would mean payments from employees of well into five figures each.

""If this is true, and especially if the $1,500 estimate is true, then I cannot afford to keep my job with the state,"" Weishan said. ""When I came to work for the DOC I took an hourly pay cut and, like many, expected to do so in return for benefits. If my benefits become unaffordable, in particular the health insurance, I need to find a job with insurance that I can afford.""

Given the widespread rumors, we thought it was worth getting to the bottom of this one.

After all, the stakes are high -- health premiums alone average $14,700 per state employee. In 2010, the state picked up $997 million of the cost while employees kicked in $60 million, Stohr said. 
The email Weishan received had some odd cut-and-paste qualities. 
It mixed in references to two different Walker proposals -- his 2010-'11 budget-repair bill introduced in mid-February, and his 2011-'13 budget released March 1, 2011. At times it confused the two. 
So, is there any truth to its claim that state workers, after 2012, will have to pay the entire cost of health premiums and pensions? 
In a word, no -- at least based on what we know now.

We could find no evidence of such a plan in our review of the two bills.

Under Walker’s plan, the state could unilaterally set the worker contribution at any amount. And if costs rise, that would mean more out of pocket from employees. But there’s no indication in the bills of a plan to go to 100 percent employee share -- nearly eight times the contribution Walker is seeking in his plan.

Two state officials, Stohr from the Employee Trust Funds department and Gov. Scott Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie, said there was absolutely nothing to the claim.

""No truth to it,"" Werwie said of the e-mail claim.

Said Stohr: ""I haven’t seen anything like that in the budget.""

The claim appears to be a misreading of the budget-repair bill.

The section on page 58 of the budget-repair bill -- the part cited in the email -- actually refers to City of Milwaukee employees, not state employees.

Walker’s repair bill makes this pension change for state employees, city and county of Milwaukee workers and other local employees covered by the state pension system.

The page in question outlines how City of Milwaukee employees will have to pay half of the pension contribution required annually. In Milwaukee that translates to 5.5 percent of salary for general city employees and 7 percent for elected officials.

We confirmed those points with Dennis Yaccarino, a manager in the City of Milwaukee budget office.

Where does this leave us?

A chain e-mail makes various claims about how state employees will suffer under Walker’s two budget bills. Those claims go way beyond the governor’s actual plan to get state employees to share more of the cost of pension and health insurance.

We could find no evidence to back the e-mail’s claim that employees will pay 100 percent of their benefits as of 2013. State officials flatly deny it as well.

That rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9A0E40>],/factchecks/2011/mar/08/chain-email/e-mail-says-state-employees-wisconsin-will-have-pa/
"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says government workers in Wisconsin pay $500 to $1,000 per year in union dues
","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has tried to sprinkle sugar on what many government workers see as the bitter pill he’s proposing in his controversial budget-repair bill.

Let’s see if what he is sprinkling is as sweet as he says it is.

For many state and local government workers, losing collective bargaining power is the bitter pill. The bill also would require most public employees to pay more for pensions and health insurance.

The hit would be $5,400 per year for a state employee who earns the average wage -- $50,000 -- and chooses the least-expensive family plan for health insurance, Walker’s administration says.

The sugar, at least the way the Republican governor presents it, is in another provision of the bill. It would prohibit union dues from being withheld from public employees’ paychecks. That means state and local government workers would have to pay their unions directly.

According to Walker, if workers opt out of the union, they could save a fair amount of money.

On Feb. 20, 2011, on the ""Fox News Sunday"" program, Walker said ""for those workers who don't want to be a part of the union, if you don't want that deduction each month out of the paycheck, they should be able to get that $500, $600 or in some cases, $1,000 back that they can apply for their health care and their pension contribution.""

Walker made a similar statement three days earlier on Fox television’s ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren."" And Washington Post columnist George Will wrote that Walker told him that many employees could save $500 or $600 per year in union dues and that teachers could save up to $1,000.

Let’s find out if the governor’s figures are correct.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie sent us a document that he said came from the state payroll department. Payroll would know the amount of union dues for state workers, since it withholds them from state workers’ paychecks.

The document indicates that annual union dues are as low as $208 for certain legal employees and $300 for apprentice sheet metal workers; dues are as high as $3,180 for plasterers and $3,465 for plumbers.

The exact range, however, could be different because dues for some employees are a percentage of their pay, and the document does not spell out those amounts. Moreover, the document does not specify how many employees pay the various dues amounts that are listed, and it does not provide any averages. We asked Werwie for more information, but he had not responded by publication time.

So, we contacted some of the major public employee unions to ask what their members pay annually in dues. Our list is not comprehensive, but it does cover tens of thousands of state and local government workers.

General employees

Most of the 23,000 state workers who are members of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 24 pay $420 per year in union dues, though some pay $492, said Bob Allen, spokesman for AFSCME-Wisconsin.
They tend to be ""front-line"" workers such as correctional officers, administrative support staff, probation and parole officers and custodians, he said.

Members of Local 1914 -- one of the units of Council 24 -- pay $470 per year, according to the dues page on that local’s website. Those 300 members are state employees in Eau Claire, Chippewa, Rusk, Clark and Taylor counties, and hold non-academic jobs at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.

Members of AFT-Wisconsin who earn over $34,000 per year pay about $510 per year in dues, said president Bryan Kennedy. AFT says it represents 17,000 public workers in 500 different classifications.

Health care workers

Annual dues for the 15,000 members of the Professional Patient Care Unit of Service Employees Union International range from about $192 for home care workers to $864 or more for senior nurses, said president Dian Palmer.

Teachers

Milwaukee Public Schools teachers paid $995 in dues in 2010, while educational assistants who worked more than 20 hours per week paid $469, according to the figures from the website of the Milwaukee Teachers’ Education Association.

That union says it represents more than 8,200 employees, including 6,000 teachers.

Green Bay public school teachers pay $834 in dues, said Lori Blakeslee, spokeswoman for the Green Bay Education Association.

The typical Wisconsin teacher who belongs to the state’s largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, pays $450 per year for the state and national portions of their dues, said WEAC spokeswoman Christina Brey. But the additional amount in local dues paid varies and Brey said she did not know what the range is. Both Milwaukee and Green Bay belong to WEAC.

Let’s return to the statement.

In pushing his budget-repair bill, Walker said state and local government workers could stop paying union dues and take home $500 to $1,000 more per year in pay. He didn’t say most or many, but his statement suggests that a significant number of public employees pay dues in that range. And we found thousands of public employees who do.

We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB27E80>],/factchecks/2011/mar/08/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-government-workers/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Andy Brown']","
Andy Brown says nobody in higher education believes $10,000 bachelor's degree is possible
","
UPDATE, 2:05 p.m., March 8, 2011: The article below corrects the name of the Midland newspaper. 
In a Feb. 22 web post objecting to slashes in education funding, the chairman of the Travis County Democrats sounds a skeptical note about GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s Feb. 8 call on higher education to devise a way that students could earn bachelor’s degrees at a cost of $10,000, including textbooks.

""As for the governor’s preposterous scheme to serve up $10,000 college degrees, nobody in higher education believes that is even possible,"" Andy Brown writes. ""Tuition and books for a single year easily add up to that amount, and tuition likely will increase in the face of state funding cuts.""

Granted, four years in college costs a bundle. But no one believes a $10K degree is even possible?

We reached Brown, who said by e-mail that there is ""probably someone out there who thinks it is possible at most Texas institutions, so the word ‘credible’ probably should have been included as a modifier"" after nobody. ""Regardless, it's not a realistic option for most higher ed institutions in Texas,"" Brown said, ""and for Perry to imply otherwise is ridiculous.""

Next, we read news accounts following Perry’s State of the State address. Skepticism and uncertainty abound, the reports suggest.  On Feb. 10, the Dallas Morning News quoted state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, who chairs the Senate Higher Education Committee, saying that it’s not going to happen. 
Among officials in higher education, Mike McKinney, chancellor of the Texas A&M University System, was quoted in the Feb. 12 Austin American-Statesman as telling state senators he has no idea how to meet Perry’s goal. The newspaper said McKinney also testified: ""I'm not going to say that it can't be done."" 
A Houston Chronicle news article, likewise published Feb. 12, says some education leaders say a $10,000 degree could be achieved at community colleges. The article quotes Bruce Leslie, chancellor of the San Antonio-based Alamo Colleges, saying: """"We already have the facilities, the infrastructure, the doctorate faculty. You could take community colleges and do that without building a whole new infrastructure, or forcing existing four-year universities to downsize."" 
The story quotes Shirley Reed, president of South Texas College in McAllen, saying: ""It is an idea that is long overdue."" At the college, resident tuition for 120 credit-hours--which colleges typically require to earn a degree--is currently about $7,600, according to its website. According to a Feb. 10 Texas Tribune news article, South Texas College and two other community colleges are already authorized to offer a bachelor’s degree in Applied Technology, costing in the range of $10,000.

Next, we asked the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board if anyone in higher education has rated the $10,000 degree possible. Spokesman Dominic Chavez replied by e-mail: ""We interpret the $10,000 degree challenge by the governor as just that—a challenge...The question from the board’s perspective is not ‘is $10,000 the right target or a reasonable target?’ but rather ‘what can we do to get as close to it as possible?’""

For national perspective, we contacted Beth Hagan, executive director of the Florida-based Community College Baccalaureate Association, which seeks to improve access to bachelor’s degrees. Hagan told us bachelor’s degrees costing $10,000 are now available through community colleges in 17 states. However, she said, they generally aren’t in the academic studies available through four-year universities. Besides, she cautioned, very few community college students get the four-year ""niche"" degrees, which tend to involve technologies or special skills such as nursing or teaching.

Hagan said of Perry’s proposal: ""If you asked a group of (community) college administrators and presidents if this could be done, they would laugh at you. Of course, it’s possible."" But Perry’s call, she said, was akin to challenging a chain steakhouse to offer $1 hamburgers. ""Can they do it? Sure. But they don’t want to.""

Perry’s communications director, Mark Miner, called Brown’s statement unfortunate, adding that it’s ""just like the establishment to say it can’t be done, without trying."" Catherine Frazier, Perry’s deputy press secretary, pointed out a Feb. 10 news article in the Midland Reporter-Telegram describing Midland College’s applied technology bachelor’s degree, which the article says can be earned for about $10,000. The article also says the program might not be funded in the next state budget.

No doubt, there’s skepticism in higher education about Perry’s call. But it’s a stretch to say nobody believes $10,000 degrees possible. Four-year technology degrees at around that price point are already an option for some Texas students.

We rate Brown’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFA69C0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/08/andy-brown/andy-brown-says-nobody-higher-education-believes-1/
"['Education', 'Labor', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Florida Chamber of Commerce']","
Chamber says protesters were bused to Central Florida teacher rally
","
Government union bosses are busing in protesters to picket state elected leaders.

In Florida.

And it's happening right now, says the Florida Chamber of Commerce.

""We've see the images on television: government unions from around America staging protests in Wisconsin,"" chamber president Mark Wilson says in a radio ad that began airing March 3, 2011. ""They're not fighting for ordinary citizens, but grappling for power and money. Unfortunately, Florida is next on the union bosses' hit list. They're busing protesters to Central Florida right now to harass your courageous representatives.""

Are union mercenaries already targeting Florida as the next Wisconsin by busing protesters to staged events? PolitiFact Florida wanted to find out.

The chamber ad, which is airing on Central Florida radio markets, is a response to staged rallies outside the district offices of three Seminole County state legislators -- Scott Plakon, Chris Dorworth and Jason Brodeur. Chamber spokeswoman Edie Ousley said the ad actually began airing four hours prior to the 4 p.m. March 3 rallies, and was based on reports about the event-planning that the chamber had acquired.

Ousley wouldn't detail those reports, but she said the protests were organized through large union e-mail lists that included affiliations with groups like MoveOn.org, and members of the former ACORN community organizing group.

""Providing transportation is classic government-union strategy 101,"" Ousley said.

We first looked at media reports from the events. The Orlando Sentinel covered the events and wrote about it under the headline ""Seminole teachers picket lawmakers over merit pay, pensions."" Sentinel writer Dave Weber described the protest at Plakon's Longwood office, saying that about 60 teachers and supporters protested plans to tie teacher pay raises to student test score results and a plan to make teachers take a de facto pay cut by forcing them to contribute to their retirement. Weber never mentioned busing and quoted only a local teacher, Melissa Cole.

Here's what Weber told us via e-mail: ""I was at one of the three protest sites in Seminole, by a strip mall in a busy suburban roadway area just off I-4 in Longwood. There were no buses around and I did not perceive anyone had been bused in. I recognized many of the teachers. Had no sense that anyone was there who did not belong. Those I interviewed by random selection all were local teachers.""

The Sanford Herald covered the protest of Brodeur's office in Sanford. Writer Gary Roberts described the crowd as being more than 60 teachers and support staff and said that ""mourners"" dressed in black and carried R.I.P. signs. They were ""decrying proposed cuts in the education budget and collective-bargaining rights, along with a merit-pay system that would develop teacher-performance evaluations that are at least 50 percent based on student-learning growth,"" Roberts wrote.

Roberts quoted local special education teacher Katie Murphy as saying: ""We want to make sure the teacher's voice is heard. Strong schools must have strong teachers, and we need to have a strong voice."" Again, no mention of buses. Roberts told us in an interview on March 7 that there were no buses. ""They were teachers,"" Roberts said. ""They were not professional demonstrators.""

We were unable to find news coverage of the protest of Dorworth's office in Heathrow. Katie Betta, a spokeswoman in the House speaker's office, said Dorworth received around 50 notecards from protesters urging him to not attack teachers. Protesters mostly filled out the cards anonymously, she said. 
The rally was organized by Gay Parker of the Seminole Education Association, so we asked her whether people were bused as part of the protest.

""That's just a lie,"" Parker said. ""There's no other way to describe it. The chamber was trying to create a scene that was non-existent.""

Parker said the protesters were made up of teachers, education officials and parents of students. The closest thing to a bus was a person in a wheelchair who needed to take a special van to reach the protest. Here's the write-up of the event provided by the Seminole Education Association. A total of about 300 people participated, the teacher association estimated.

Parker provided PolitiFact Florida with what she said was the original e-mail announcing the protests. Parker said the e-mail was sent to a list-serve made up of members of the Seminole Education Association. The e-mail asks protesters to call a number to RSVP and to identify which rally they would be attending. The e-mail also asks people to show up 10 minutes before the protest was set to begin to organize the crowds. The e-mail, if accurate, makes no mention of busing or offers buses to attend the protests, nor does it reference MoveOn.org or ACORN. (MoveOn.org is promoting a series of rallies in more than two dozen Florida cities being organized for March 8 by a group of progressives, Democrats and union sympathizers. But those rallies, part of something called Awake the State, were created independently of the Seminole County teacher protest ) 
Lastly, we talked to Plakon, the lone legislator at his office during the protest. Plakon said he spent more than an hour with the protesters. He didn't notice any buses, and said most of the people he talked to seemed to be local teachers, though he didn't ask everyone where they were from. 
""I think most of them came from our area, but I didn't specifically ask them,"" Plakon said. 
Plakon told us he heard the chamber radio ad. He said that as early as the morning of the protest, he had no idea if 10 people would be showing up at his office, or 500. ""I would have believed either of those numbers,"" he said. 
Ousley, with the chamber, offered no evidence that anyone was bused in. She said that it's possible the chamber's ad -- which started airing before the 4 p.m. rallies started -- might have stopped the busing from happening. ""It's highly possible (the ad) diffused protesters from arriving via organized transportation like buses,"" she said.

Even if that's true, it still makes the ad wrong.

A quick note: Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have looked into the protesters gathered in Wisconsin as well. You can read their work here.

The Florida Chamber of Commerce said government unions bused protesters to a series of Central Florida rallies on March 3. They didn't. This claim is not only wrong, based on the evidence, but it plays on stereotypes of government unions to try to demonize union workers (in this case, teachers). The Truth-O-Meter sees through the rhetoric. We rate it Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEE7900>],/factchecks/2011/mar/07/florida-chamber-commerce/chamber-says-protesters-bused-central-florida-educ/

Rep. Anthony Weiner: Law clear that Justice Clarence Thomas must recuse himself from health care case
","
A recent Fox News interview of Rep. Anthony Weiner was compelling TV -- if you enjoy political sparring. The New York Democrat argued that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas must recuse himself from the case challenging the constitutionality of the health care law because his wife, Virginia, made more than $700,000 working for groups that oppose the law.

In the interview with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, there were feisty exchanges back and forth, and lots of cross talk. It ended with Weiner's sarcastic kicker, ""Great interview. Aces.""

But in between, the two sparred on a couple of important issues that are sure to be debated as lawsuits over the health care law make their way to the Supreme Court. The court's vote is likely to be close, so if any justices were to recuse themselves, it could decide the case.

In this item, we're focusing on Weiner's argument that Justice Thomas must recuse himself.

Here's some of Weiner's back and forth with Kelly:

""What it comes down to is a pretty clear federal law that requires judges and justices to recuse themselves whenever there is … an appearance of any bias in the case,"" Weiner said.

The law, he said, ""has certain categories where you must recuse yourself, and one of them is if you or your household, your spouse has any financial interest in the outcome. And we found out recently that Ginni Thomas, the spouse of Justice Thomas, has received more than $700,000 from organizations whose existence is based on making sure the health care law is ruled unconstitutional.""

Indeed, federal tax records show Virginia Thomas earned nearly $700,000 between 2003 and 2007  as a liaison between the conservative Heritage Foundation and George W. Bush's White House. Heritage has advocated strongly against the health care law passed by Democrats in 2010, and has consistently called for its full repeal (though Thomas obviously left Heritage before the law passed). In addition, she helped organize Liberty Central, a conservative advocacy group that argues the health law will discourage hiring and drive up health costs.

Weiner added that ""It got worse over the weekend because Justice Thomas basically said he agreed with his wife.""

The congressman is referring to comments from Thomas, speaking to a conservative group, in which he said that his wife was involved in organizations ""in defense of liberty"" and that ""we believe in the same things, we are focused on defending liberty.""

""So now it's pretty clear he's stated his bias in this case before it's reached him,"" Weiner said. ""And under the clear letter of the law, he must recuse himself.""

Kelly said Supreme Court experts she spoke with -- including some on the left -- told her that ""having any sort of professional interest in a case, as his wife arguably does, is not grounds for recusal.""

""It'd be a different thing,"" she said, ""if Clarence Thomas himself had stock in some company that was being affected. But they say this is not that.""

Said Weiner: ""I'll read you from U.S. Title 28: 'Any justice must disqualify himself in any of the following circumstances: he individually, or his spouse, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy.' ""

Our fact-check here is Weiner's claim, ""Under the clear letter of the law, (Justice Clarence Thomas) must recuse himself.""

Let's start with the section of U.S. Title 28 cited by Weiner.

Under Section 455, it states that ""Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.""

It then lists specific circumstances under which justices should disqualify themselves.

One of them, ""He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.""

One of the key phrases in there is ""financial interest,"" which is defined later in the section as ""ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, adviser, or other active participant in the affairs of a party.""

Weiner's argument is that Virginia Thomas' work for a group that actively opposed the bill means she has a ""financial interest"" in the outcome, and that Justice Thomas must therefore recuse himself.

But several legal experts we spoke to disagreed.

Rex Perschbacher, a professor at University of California-Davis School of Law, said the law ""applies to more direct financial interests than Mrs. Thomas’.""

""It would have to be a financial interest in a corporation that was itself before the court rather than someone employed by an organization with an interest in one of the outcomes,"" Perschbacher said. 

""A greater problem here is that Supreme Court Justices have always considered themselves the ultimate arbiters of their own disqualification or recusal, and they do not apply an evenhanded or uniform standard whether it comes to family members or bias or relatives who may be involved as lawyers in the cases before them,"" Perschbacher said. ""The justices of the Supreme Court see themselves, with some reason, as unique among the federal judiciary such that statutes like 455 (applicable to all members of the federal judiciary) apply to them with less force than to the usual district or circuit judge.""

David Garrow, a professor at the University of Cambridge who follows the Supreme Court, and a self-described liberal Democrat, said, ""Justice Thomas should not recuse himself, and the recent boomlet of contentions that he should, in this matter and/or others, because of Ginni's beliefs and work, is entirely unmerited.""

Weiner ""is clearly wrong,"" said Washington, D.C., attorney Tom Goldstein, founder of ScotusBlog, a widely read blog on the Supreme Court.

""The provision he cites about having a financial interest has always required something more direct,"" said Goldstein, who noted that he spoke to Fox's Kelly before the Weiner interview. ""For example, a justice will recuse if he or she or a spouse owns stock in a company in the case. The justices also have a rule that they will recuse if a child has a financial interest – for example, the child is a lawyer in a firm in the case and the firm’s profits are affected by the case. So, the financial interest has to be in the litigation (as opposed to a general issue) and has to be much more direct than is true for Ginni Thomas.""

Paul F. Campos, professor at the University of Colorado Law School, agreed with Weiner that Thomas ought to recuse himself. He argues that Virginia Thomas has a ""strong interest in the precise outcome of the litigation.""

""If the standard for recusal is, 'Does it look really bad?' I think it looks really bad,"" Campos said.

But even Campos acknowledges that ultimately it ""depends on the interpretation of direct financial interest. It's not a completely clear-cut case.""

Asked for backup for Weiner's claim that the law is clear, and that Justice Thomas must recuse himself, Dave Arnold, a spokesman for Weiner, pointed us toward comments made by several law experts who argued Thomas ought to recuse himself.

One of them, Monroe H. Freedman, a Hofstra Law School professor specializing in legal ethics, told the New York Times that Justice Thomas ''should not be sitting on a case or reviewing a statute that his wife has lobbied for. If the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that creates a perception problem.''

Another was Steven Lubet, a law professor at Northwestern University School of Law, who noted in a Chicago Tribune op-ed that Virginia Thomas founded Liberty Central, ""an organization with strong ties to the tea party movement and whose Web site has demanded the repeal of 'ObamaCare,' which it has characterized as 'tyranny,'""

""That alone will lead many observers to wonder whether Justice Thomas can maintain the appearance of impartiality when constitutional challenges reach his court,"" Lubet wrote.

We called Lubet and asked whether the law was ""clear"" that Justice Thomas should recuse himself. 
""It's not,"" Lubet said. ""First, I think it is not correct to say that he has a financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding."" 
Having a wife who works for an advocacy group  is not the same as having a financial interest in the outcome, he said. 
""If his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that's a much closer issue,"" Lubet said. ""I wouldn't say it's clear, though. That's a matter of judgment."" 
And ultimately, Lubet and other legal scholars said, it is Justice Thomas who will determine whether he ought to recuse himself. 
""Unfortunately, only Justice Thomas gets to vote on that question,"" Lubet said. ""It's a one-man decision."" 
Trevor Burrus, a legal associate at the libertarian Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, said Weiner's argument assumes Virginia Thomas would profit from the law being declared unconstitutional.

""In fact,"" Burrrus stated, ""there is a better case to be made that upholding the law would give his wife more 'business' in the future when as-applied challenges are brought against Obamacare.""

Our aim here is not to settle a dispute between legal scholars about the application of federal ethics laws. But Weiner said that ""under the clear letter of the law, (Justice Clarence Thomas) must recuse himself."" A legitimate legal argument can be mounted for that position. But that's all it would be, an argument. It is by no means ""clear"" under the letter of law that Justice Thomas must recuse himself. 
In fact, there is a great deal of disagreement among legal experts we spoke to that Virginia Thomas' previous jobs meet the definition of ""financial interest"" or whether it's enough to establish that Justice Thomas' ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" Weiner's statement suggests the letter of the law is clear cut in backing his position, and it is not. Even those who support Weiner's position allow that it boils down to a matter of interpretation. And so we rate Weiner's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC78B1C0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/07/anthony-weiner/rep-anthony-weiner-law-clear-clarence-thoma/

Rep. Anthony Weiner says Elena Kagan has recused herself on Supreme Court even when she didn't have to
","
On March 2, 2011, Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly engaged in a heated debate about when it’s appropriate for justices to recuse themselves from cases before the Supreme Court. After the exchange became a mini-sensation on YouTube, several readers suggested we fact-check it.

Weiner argued that Justice Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from any case that challenges the constitutionality of the health care law backed by President Barack Obama. Weiner argued that Thomas’ wife, Virginia, worked for groups that oppose the law, which, he said, gives Justice Thomas a financial stake in the outcome of the case.

We’ve decided to check two separate claims from the testy interview, which ended with Weiner's sarcastic kicker, ""Great interview. Aces.""

In this item, we’ll look at Weiner’s statement that Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself in ""many cases where she had little role"" as solicitor general, ""simply because the appearance (of a conflict of interest) was there."" (In a separate item, we scrutinize Weiner's argument that Justice Thomas must recuse himself in the health care case.)

Before Kagan became a Supreme Court justice last fall, she served as solicitor general -- the official who argues the Obama administration's position on cases before the court.

Due to the solicitor general’s extensive role with the court -- the position is often called the 10th Justice -- anyone who moves from solicitor general to the court will inevitably encounter cases that their former office handled and must decide whether to recuse themselves.

Here’s the dialogue between Weiner and Kelly addressing Kagan and her recusals:

Weiner: ""You said (Kagan) had to recuse herself. She did not. She chose to in many cases where she had very little role in, simply because the appearance was there. That’s what Justice Thomas should do….""

 Kelly: ""If you were a lawyer in the case, you have to recuse yourself even if you signed a brief. Even if you signed a brief, you have to.""

Weiner: ""She did not recuse herself only in those circumstances. That’s the point. (She recused herself) any time she was even in a meeting (where the case was discussed).""

We should start by noting there is no official log of recusals. So we’re reliant on data compiled by Supreme Court journalists, including Tony Mauro of the National Law Journal and Tom Goldstein of SCOTUSblog, who look through opinions and other official court documents and count the number of times justices recuse themselves. (While a justice’s recusal is noted for the record, the court does not release the reason for the recusal.)

A SCOTUSblog tally lists 21 final rulings in which Kagan recused herself. The number is higher if you include cases that aren't tallied, such as decisions not to hear a case.

Kagan -- and the senators who questioned her at her confirmation hearings -- were well aware of her need to recuse herself from cases during her first term on the court.

""I would recuse myself from any case in which I've been counsel of record at any stage of the proceedings, in which I've signed any kind of -- of brief,"" Kagan testified in response to a question from Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., during a confirmation hearing on June 29, 2010. ""So that's a flat rule. In addition to that, … I would recuse myself in any case in which I'd played any kind of substantial role in the process. …  I think that that would include any case in which I've officially formally approved something. So one of the things that the solicitor general does is approve appeals or approve amicus briefs to be filed in lower courts or approve interventions.""

True to her word, Kagan has followed through by recusing even in cases that may seem minor.

Goldstein wrote that in at least four cases, Kagan recused herself because she had signed a ""no-participation slip"" for a case that later went to the Supreme Court. Such a document simply says that the government has no interest in becoming involved with the case.

""It is my sense,"" said Rex R. Perschbacher, a professor at the University of California-Davis School of Law, ""that she has been particularly sensitive to the issue of recusing herself whenever she had a modest involvement with the case or issues as solicitor general.""

But was she simply abiding by the law?

The law in question is one that Weiner cited in the Fox interview. The law says that ""any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,"" or if ""he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy.""

In Kagan’s case, she appears to be following the law and recusing herself in instances not only when she was ""counsel, adviser or material witness"" but also where she has ""expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy"" -- even if it is in a routine memorandum bearing her signature that says the government is not taking sides.

Contrary to Weiner's claim that she is going beyond the law, this strikes experts as playing precisely within the rules.

Robert Alt, deputy director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that Weiner’s error is in assuming that Kagan’s recusal even for minor participation in a case means she’s recusing herself because of appearances alone. In fact, Alt argues, Kagan is required by law to do so.

""Having ‘little role’ is not the standard and is not an exemption, even if the role is slight,"" Alt said. ""As a government attorney, if you just provide legal advice but are not counsel of record, you are still required to recuse.""

Goldstein agrees. Kagan has ""recused from any case in which she played a role while previously working in the government, even a trivial role,"" he told PolitiFact. ""That’s a good, broad, bright-line rule.""

Ronald Rotunda, a professor at Chapman University School of Law, testified during the confirmation hearings that ""if the participant, not simply as a counsel, but as an adviser, whether his opinions are public or private, whether they're oral or written, if he's expressed an opinion concerning the merits of a particular case or controversy, he must disqualify himself. …  (It) doesn't matter that she's no longer the counselor of record, that the deputy solicitor general has taken over. She also has to recuse herself if she was an adviser concerning the proceeding -- that is, gave advice about the particular proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of a particular case or controversy.""

So where does this leave us? We should first note that the Supreme Court is tight with information about recusals, so we can’t be entirely certain about Kagan’s thought process. It’s possible that she has taken part in some cases in which she’s had a minor but tangible role.

But in making the case that Thomas should recuse himself on the health care bill, Weiner held up Kagan as an example of a justice who went beyond what the recusal law dictated, adhering instead to what the appearance would be. But while Weiner is right that Kagan has chosen to recuse herself even when her participation in a given case seems minor, she still made her decision based on what the law demands. We see no evidence that she’s gone further than the law would for the sake of appearances. On balance, we rate Weiner’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDDF1180>],/factchecks/2011/mar/07/anthony-weiner/rep-anthony-weiner-says-elena-kagan-has-recused-he/

DCCC says Rep. Jim Renacci budget vote would force Social Security worker furloughs, delay benefits
","
The GOP spending plan that passed the House of Representatives on Feb. 19 won’t become law because Democrats who control the U.S. Senate and hold the White House won’t let it become law.

But that won’t stop Democrats from using its hypothetical cuts as campaign points.

House Republicans say the cuts they approved show they’re serious about tightening the government’s belt and cracking down on pork-barrel spending. Democratic critics say its provisions would destroy thousands of jobs and undermine everything from education to food safety.

Since passage of the spending package, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has dispatched a steady drumbeat of news releases targeting GOP supporters on aspects they believe will be politically unpopular. A Feb. 22 missive titled ""Representative Jim Renacci and House Republicans Vote to Cut Social Security and Delay Benefits"" made the following claim:

""In slashing $1.7 billion from the Social Security Administration,  Rep. Jim Renacci may end up forcing the entire agency to have to shut down for a month, causing seniors to not get their benefits on time, halting claims processing, and forcing new retirees and disabled workers into a backlog before seeing their benefits.""

It sounded like a draconian enough accusation for PolitiFact Ohio to check out.

The news release attributes its projections to Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, who estimated the cuts would force month-long furloughs at SSA, and an assessment by National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare CEO Barbara Kennelly, formerly a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut.

Kennelly said that further cuts in Social Security funding would mean seniors would have to wait longer to get an appointment to file for benefits, would not receive timely benefit decisions or have their documents processed promptly, and that significant numbers of SSA employees would be furloughed.

But the Democrats’ $1.7 billion figure uses the $12.5 billion that President Barack Obama proposed for the Social Security budget for 2011 as the baseline from which they claim cuts are being made.

But that money was never allotted because no 2011 budget was passed. SSA has operated  at the same $11.5 billion funding level it got in 2010.

Republicans use $11.5 billion as a baseline to cite a lower level of cuts. Renacci spokeswoman Karin Davenport says the GOP bill would lop $125 million in administrative cuts from the agency’s 2010 spending level. More cuts would come from rescinding another $118 million from a computer center that’s not scheduled to be built until 2015, and from reclaiming $500 million from a ""reserve"" fund that Democrats say is already being tapped.

If we set aside $1 billion of the Social Security cuts Democrats cite as phantom cuts coming from a budget that never materialized, that still leaves $700,000 that are acknowledged by both Republicans and Democrats.

SSA did not return repeated telephone calls we made to determine the impact of those cuts. In their absence, we turned to Witold Skwierczynski , who heads the American Federation of Government Employees union that represents most of the nation’s SSA workers. While SSA isn’t talking to reporters, it is talking to his union.

Skwierczynski says SSA has told the union that if Congress reduces Social Security’s funding at all beneath FY 2010 levels, some level of furloughs would be imposed. SSA sent the union a letter on Feb. 17 that requested bargaining over the possible implementation of furloughs, though it didn’t specify how long the furloughs might last.

""It is important to note that the Commissioner has not decided to effectuate a furlough,"" the letter said. ""However, given the potential of reduced Congressional appropriations for the remainder of the fiscal year, the Agency is issuing this notice at this time in the event that a furlough may become necessary.""

Skwierczynski says Obama requested a $1 billion increase in SSA’s 2011 funding because of increased demands for its services, and called potential passage of the GOP budget ""a nightmare scenario for Social Security.""

""You have to understand that we are a growth agency,"" he said. ""We are taking more and more claims because of the baby boom generation’s retirement and also because of the economic problems we have in this country. If people are laid off, they will file for retirement early. Many will file for disability, looking for a benefit they can receive to enable them to survive with out a job.""

If SSA workers are furloughed because of budget cuts or a government shutdown, beneficiaries would still get their regularly scheduled checks, Skweirczynski said. But furloughs would mean fewer workers available to process new claims and appeals. That would result in backlogs and delays in processing new paperwork. That’s what happened when furloughs were implemented during the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996.

Where does that leave Democrats’ claims about Renacci?

"['Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Ken Cuccinelli']","
Ken Cuccinelli says health care law charges 10 years of taxes for six years of benefits
","
No one has fought President Barack Obama’s health care reform law more effectively than Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli.

The Republican is spearheading the legal challenges against the bill, especially the ""individual mandate"" provision that would require most Americans to buy health insurance. Cuccinelli won a major victory in December 2010 when a federal judge found that provision of the law to be unconstitutional, and the case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

During a March 1 appearance on Fox News, Cuccinelli was asked about Obama’s recent statement that he would support legislation that would allow states opt out of the mandate if they can find another way to expand coverage without driving up health care costs. Cuccinelli said he doesn’t expect much to come from the president’s comments.

""They put four enormous conditions on what they call the opting out or providing some flexibility, and one of them that I would point to first is that it has to be deficit-neutral, which for a president who's counting six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue to call his [proposal] balanced, you think he's going to let the states do that?"" Cuccinelli asked. ""I doubt it.""

The claim that the health care bill charges 10 years of taxes and for only six years of services is widely used by Republicans. We have checked it before, as has PolitiFact’s national staff.

Brian Gottstein, director of communications for Cuccinelli, said the attorney general ""was referring to how the taxes begin four years before the services do.""

Two of the highest-profile elements of the bill start in 2014, roughly four years after the law took effect. The virtual marketplaces known as health care exchanges would start that year, enabling those who are uninsured or who do not have access to coverage through an employer to buy insurance. Also starting that year would be subsidies to help people buy coverage on the exchange.

In addition, that's the year for a major expansion in eligibility for Medicaid. And a 10-year phase out of the ""doughnut hole"" -- the gap in Medicare drug coverage -- began last year.

The Republican argument that benefits don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at those big provisions. But many smaller provisions have already taken effect. As PolitiFact has previously reported, there are plenty of examples:

• Small business tax credits. From 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost.

• Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Soon after enactment, people with pre-existing conditions who haven't had coverage for at least six months could obtain coverage through a ""high-risk pool"" with subsidized premiums. This would be a temporary solution until the exchanges begin in 2014.

• Assistance for early retirees. Starting last year, a temporary reinsurance program will help cut the cost of health coverage for retirees not old enough to be eligible for Medicare.

• Dependent coverage to age 26. Shortly after enactment, all insurers were forced to offer dependent coverage for children up to age 26.

• No more recisions. Existing plans can no longer terminate beneficiaries when they get sick.

• Enhanced preventive care. Soon after enactment, qualified health plans were forced to provide certain preventive services without cost-sharing. Starting this year, patient cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid are eliminated.

The other half of this claim is that taxes kicked in immediately.

Some of the tax provisions that help pay for the plan are already in effect. A 10 percent levy on indoor tanning began last year, and an escalating annual fee on drugmakers begins this year. Individuals with flexible spending plans and health savings accounts -- tax-advantaged accounts linked to health care expenses -- have already been hit with certain exclusions and limits.

But many of the major tax changes will be delayed by a few years.

• Medical device taxes. A new levy on medical device makers worth about $20 billion over 10 years kicks in 2013.

• Taxes to benefit Medicare Part A. The bill's hike of payroll taxes for individuals earning $200,000 or couples earning $250,000 and a new tax on unearned income for higher earners will start in 2013.

• Insurance sector fees. Fees on health insurers totaling $67 billion over 10 years become effective in 2014.

• Mandated coverage. Two of the bill's provisions most controversial to Republicans -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance and that employers of a certain size offer affordable health insurance, under penalty of a fine -- would not begin until 2014. The individual mandate would start low that year and then phase in through 2016.

• ""Cadillac tax."" The most recent version of the bill pushes back the tax on higher-cost health plans until 2018.

Now, let’s look at numbers to get a sense of proportion.

According to the Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress' bipartisan judge of revenue impacts from proposed laws -- the tax provisions collect minimal revenue for 2010, $2.9 billion for 2011 and $5.5 billion for 2012. They start getting enormous 2013, when revenues increase to $31.9 billion, eventually peaking at $86.9 billion in 2019.

Indeed, of the total $409.2 billion in increased taxes over the 10-year window, only 10 percent of that amount is raised in the first four years -- the period when, according to Cuccinelli and other Republicans, the government is collecting taxes without providing care.

Meanwhile, on the benefits side, it's true that the cost increases significantly four years after enactment. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's Office of the Actuary, the first four years account for about 1 percent of the 10-year cost of increased coverage.

The ""statement that you have 10 years of taxes and six years of benefits is obviously an oversimplification,"" said Paul N. Van de Water, Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""But overall, it is generally true that more taxes kick in a little bit earlier than the benefits do.""

Van de Water said the larger question is whether this is a gimmick and a long-term problem. The answer to that, he said, is no.

""Despite the fact that it’s true that some of the taxes kick in on average a bit earlier, by the end of the 10-year period the health reform bill still produces a modest reduction of the deficit, according to the CBO estimate,"" he said, ""and in the subsequent 10-year period the reduction of the deficit gets even larger.""  

Let’s review.

Cuccinelli says the health care reform law charges 10 years of taxes for six years of benefits. It suggests we're paying all of the taxes now and getting none of the benefits.

Cuccinelli and other Republicans are correct that the bill's biggest expansions in coverage do not happen until 2014, including the exchanges, the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. He's also right that some taxation has already begun, albeit it minor. The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost.

But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014. Some of the bill’s most popular provisions -- including no cancelation of health insurance for pre-existing conditions, guaranteed coverage of dependents to age 26, and tax credits for small businesses -- have taken effect and other components will be implemented before 2014.

Rep. Frederica Wilson claims credit for closing down a garbage plant outside her school
","
On Feb. 27, 2011, the Washington Post invited six new members of Congress to ""tell their tales in their own words."" Two of them were Floridians: Republican Rep. Allen West from District 22 and Rep. Frederica Wilson from District 17, both in Southeastern Florida.

Wilson, the Miami Democrat who was elected to Congress for the first time in November, recalled how, when she was principal at Skyway Elementary in the Carol City neighborhood outside Miami, Miami-Dade County permitted a garbage plant to be built across the street from her school.

The outcome, she said in the Washington Post article:  ""We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down.""

We knew Wilson had a long track record as an educator before turning to politics. But she had a hand in closing a multimillion-dollar plant? We had to check it out. 

The plant in question was called Agripost and was built in November 1988 across the street from Skyway, the Carol City elementary school. Wilson, a veteran with the school system, was the principal.

County Hall had hoped that Agripost would help solve Miami-Dade’s trash problems by turning household trash into compost through a process of shredding and fermenting. The plant was to use the composting technology to convert household garbage into a soil additive for agricultural use.

""The county was looking for innovative ways to deal with the waste,"" Clerk of the Courts Harvey Ruvin, who then served as a commissioner, said in an interview.

But it didn't turn out as planned.  

After it opened, the plant at 20600 NW 47th Ave. emitted an odor that troubled Wilson and her students.

""It was awful,"" Wilson said by telephone. ""It smelled like rotting eggs and dog poo.""

And so the students made phone calls, wrote letters to government officials, and showed up at commission and school board meetings in red ""Skyway"" T-shirts. They stood on their tiptoes to reach the microphones.

""She was very forceful on behalf of the children, as I recall,"" Ruvin said.

Newspaper accounts credit Wilson for leading the charge.

""What was the plant's biggest nemesis?"" a Wall Street Journal report asked in a December 1991 article. ""The Skyway Elementary School across the street. Principal Frederica Wilson is a self-proclaimed environmentalist. But she claimed a stench from the plant permeated school grounds, causing children to vomit or have nosebleeds, and she led a revolt against the plant.""

The plant closed in January 1991, barely two years after it opened. One report in the Miami Herald, on Nov. 25, 1990, said Agripost spent $20 million to build the plant. Another, on Dec. 23, 1990, said it was a $25 million plant. 
Agripost appealed the commission's decision, and in 1994 sued the county for $140 million. According to a Miami Herald report on Oct. 4, 1994, the lawsuit claimed the company had invested $40 million in the plant and also sought $100 million in damages for the ""destruction of the company"" when county commissioners voted to revoke the company’s zoning authorization. The decision threw Agripost into bankruptcy.

Wilson said, ""We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down."" (As for the different estimates for the cost of the plant, Wilson said by phone: ""You know how long that’s been? I don’t remember everything."") But after 20 years, her memory in the Washington Post article was on target. We rate this True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBE7540>],/factchecks/2011/mar/07/frederica-wilson/frederica-wilson-claims-credit-closing-garbage-pla/

New York Times columnist Gail Collins say Texas ranks third in teenage pregnancies and first in repeat teen pregnancies
","New York Times columnist Gail Collins isn’t on board with cutting education spending to balance the budget in Texas, one of the fastest-growing states in the land.

""Nobody wants to see underperforming, overcrowded schools being deprived of more resources anywhere. But when it happens in Texas, it’s a national crisis,"" Collins writes in her Feb. 16 column.

The column continues: ""The birth rate there is the highest in the country... Texas ranks third in teen pregnancies — always the children most likely to be in need of extra help. And it is No. 1 in repeat teen pregnancies.""

We wondered if Collins pegged how the state ranks.

Responding to our request for backup information, Collins pointed us to data from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit that produces statistics and other information frequently used by teen pregnancy prevention groups. Citing the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the campaign reported in December that Texas had the third-highest teen birth rate among girls age 15-19 in 2008, behind Mississippi and New Mexico.

Collins also cited Susan Tortolero, director of the University of Texas Prevention Research Center in Houston whom Collins quotes in her column, as a source.

In an interview, Tortolero told us that Collins referred to pregnancy rates when it would have been more accurate to cite birth rates. Texas has the fourth-highest teen pregnancy rate nationally, Tortolero said, but the third-highest teen birth rate. ""We’re No. 1 in teen repeat births, not pregnancies,"" she said.

Next, we sought teen pregnancy data from the Washington- and New York-based Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health.

In 2005, the most recent year for which there’s state-level data, Texas had the fourth-highest teen pregnancy rate among women ages 15-19, an institute report says. States with higher rates were Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, which led the nation with 93 pregnancies for every 1,000 teenage women.

States with large teenage populations also had high numbers of teen pregnancies, according to the report. California reported the highest number of teen pregnancies in 2005 (96,490), followed by Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois (30,000-70,000 each).

Teen pregnancy rates declined in every state from 1988 through 2000, according to the report, and in every state save North Dakota from 2000 through 2005. Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind told us that according to institute studies on teen sexual behavior, improved contraception use accounted for approximately three-quarters of the decline in teen pregnancies.

Over the past couple decades, Texas has been among the 10 states with the highest teen pregnancy rates. In 1988, it had the 10th highest rate, according to the report. It had the eighth highest rate in 1992, second highest in 1996, and fourth highest in 2000.

Rochelle Tafolla, a spokeswoman at Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, told us she didn’t know of a repeat teen pregnancy study — ""pregnancy is a harder data point to track,"" she said. But according to September 2009 data by Child Trends, a nonprofit Washington-based research group, Texas led the nation in the percentage of all births to mother under age 20 that are repeat births in 2006.

When we asked Collins whether she confused birth rates and pregnancies in her column, she said: ""You’re right.""

Summing up? Collins incorrectly referred to Texas’ teen birth rate as a pregnancy rate — Texas actually ranks fourth in teen pregnancies, not third. We couldn’t find data for repeat teen pregnancies, but Texas leads the nation in repeat teen births.

We rate her statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE5A900>],/factchecks/2011/mar/07/gail-collins/new-york-times-columnist-gail-collins-say-texas-ra/
"['Oregon', 'Sam Adams']","
Sam Adams says Portland’s finances show a one-time $22 million surplus
","
Despite these hard economic times, the city of Portland is doing just fine. It’s doing so well, in fact, that it’s running a budget surplus. At least, that’s what Mayor Sam Adams has been telling residents.

The news seems to have first cropped up in Adams’ own blog on Dec. 8, 2010: ""In last two years, because of our more conservative revenue forecasting, a federal accounting rule change & tamped-down spending (ex: no CPI raises for city staff) results in $21 million one-time surplus.""

In recent weeks, Adams has been using the line with some frequency. In a question-and-answer with Willamette Week published Feb. 16, 2011 he said, ""You asked me what I was proud of. And we have a budget surplus. A one-time budget surplus. We’re in a very different position than most major cities in the United States and most of the governments around us.""

He repeated the claim in more detail during his State of the City address on Feb. 18, 2011. In fact, he repeated it twice:  ""Let me repeat. Next year we begin with a $22 million, one-time, general fund surplus.""

If that’s true, it’s a pretty good reason to be self-congratulatory. After all, like Adams said, most other budgets aren’t looking so good these days. Take, for example, the multibillion-dollar shortfall the state is facing going into the next two-year budget cycle.

But, we wondered, is it true? Could Portland really be running a surplus when all we hear about are deficits? So, we decided to  check out the mayor’s State of the City claim that Portland is starting next year with a $22 million one-time surplus.

In order to see what the city’s finances look like, we turned to a 5-year budget forecast that was released in December.  

The document, on first glance, seemed to back Adams up. Resources for the upcoming budget should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $398 million while required expenditures are estimated at $376 million. Take the latter from the former and you get a budget surplus of $21.7 million.

If you keep reading, though, the numbers get murky. For instance, Table 1 mentions an additional $10.5 million in ""continued unfunded ongoing"" expenditures. Basically, that category is made up of things that traditionally get funded but aren’t ""required."" You throw that into the equation and suddenly the city’s surplus is halved ($11.2 million to be precise).

The confusion doesn’t end there. Continue on to Table 2, and the report offers a separate scenario. Again, we start with a $21.7 million surplus, but then, it says, there are two new categories to consider: ""new one-time"" expenses and ""additional on-going spending."" Those two bits add up to $15 million. Take that from the $21.7 million surplus and the city is left with $6.7 million.

What’s more, the forecast goes on to say that the city really shouldn’t spend that $6.7 million. See, the city budgets with five-year forecasts. The idea is that the budget being crafted this year will pave the way for a zero-balance budget five years down the road. In order to get to that zero balance, the city needs to hold onto that $6.7 million, according to the report. So, the forecast concludes, the city’s surplus might not even exist.

City of Portland economist Josh Harwood puts it this way: ""We're not in crisis mode. We're not short-selling the house, but we're not buying a new car either.""

Until the details of the budget are hammered out, it’s difficult to tell what surplus -- if any -- will remain. According to the December analysis, that remaining balance could be as high as $21.7 million or as low as, well, nothing. We gave the mayor’s office a call to see if we’d missed something.

""The number is accurate,"" Roy Kaufmann, the mayor’s spokesman said, referring to the $21.7 million figure. But ""it does not take into account the one-time spending.""

""We're too early in the budget process to know ... how that all is going to shake out,"" Kaufmann added. ""I think that the point that the mayor was making was demonstrating to city residents how Portland was being fiscally responsible and fairly fiscally conservative since he was elected, even before he was sworn in.""

That may be true, but if it’s too early in the budget process to know how the one-time funding is going to shake out, it seems to us that it’s also too early to be trumpeting a surplus at all -- let alone a pretty optimistic one of $22 million.

We rate Adams’ claim that Portland has a one-time surplus of $22 million as Half True -- the statement is partially true, but it leaves out some pretty important details.

Immigration bill foes label legislation an Arizona ""copycat""
","
Foes of a tough illegal immigration bill that recently passed the state House of Representatives say it gives them a case of deja vu.

One day before House Bill 87 sailed through the chamber, the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, one of the bill’s major opponents, rallied its members with an e-mail.

""YOUR voice is needed ASAP,"" it said. ""The Georgia House of Representatives will vote on the newly revised HB 87, a copycat version of the Arizona law SB 1070 with additional provisions.""

Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 is the illegal-immigration measure that stirred so much furor when it passed last year. Some groups boycotted the state. The U.S. Department of Justice sued. But the law was so popular among Georgians that Democrat Roy Barnes and Republican Nathan Deal backed an Arizona-style crackdown during last year’s governor’s race.

Arizona’s law is now being considered by a federal appellate court.

So is Georgia’s bill Arizona all over again?

HB 87 passed the state House of Representatives on Thursday by a largely party-line vote. Among other things, it would authorize state and local police to verify the immigration status of suspects, make it a crime to harbor or transport an illegal immigrant or encourage one to come to the state, and require certain businesses to verify their new employees can work legally in the U.S. It also would let legal residents sue if a government or agency is not adequately enforcing the law.

Arizona’s law requires police to verify immigration status in some cases. It makes it a crime to harbor or transport an illegal immigrant or encourage one to come to the state, and it lets legal residents sue for inadequate enforcement.

SB 1070 includes provisions not in Georgia’s bill that make it harder to hire day laborers and strengthen Arizona law on barring employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants.  

We called up Jerry Gonzalez, the executive director of GALEO, who noted that Arizona’s law turned that state into a constitutional battleground. His group thinks the Arizona bill leads to racial profiling.

Gonzalez referred us to GALEO board member Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-area immigration lawyer and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which opposes the Arizona bill.  

He cited three key provisions of HB 87 that he said echo portions of Arizona’s law.

Both measures have provisions that increase law enforcement officers’ role in verifying the citizenship of suspects. Like Arizona’s law, the Georgia bill would also make it a crime to transport or harbor illegal immigrants, or encourage them to enter the state.   

But Georgia’s bill does include language its sponsor thinks will avoid the kind of constitutional challenge SB 1070 faced, Kuck acknowledged. But Kuck believes the law will be struck down.

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Matt Ramsey, called the ""copycat"" accusation ""silly."" The Peachtree City Republican changed the original draft after receiving input from Georgians and said he designed it to ensure it is constitutional.  

There are obvious differences. For instance, Georgia’s bill would require businesses with five or more employees to use the federal E-Verify system, which checks whether employees are authorized to work in the U.S. Arizona already has an E-Verify law. It’s being challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court.

GALEO’s e-mail calls HB 87 ""a copycat version of the Arizona law SB1070 with additional provisions."" We think the E-Verify requirement counts as an ""additional provision"" and doesn’t impact on our ruling.

We’ll go with a dictionary definition of ""copycat,"" which means two things that closely mimic or imitate each other. Since GALEO is primarily concerned with racial profiling and constitutional concerns, we’ll focus on these issues.   

First, let’s consider racial profiling. Georgia’s HB 87 says that officers who have ""probable cause to believe that a suspect has committed a criminal offense"" would be authorized to verify that suspect’s immigration status.

HB 87 also would prevent an officer from considering ""race, color, or national origin in implementing the requirements of this Code section except to the extent permitted by the Constitutions of Georgia and of the United States.""

That provision appears to ban racial profiling, but it might have the opposite effect, said Gabriel ""Jack"" Chin, a University of Arizona law professor who has studied SB 1070 and thinks that it is unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that it is constitutional for the Border Patrol to factor in whether occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry when they stop vehicles near the U.S.-Mexico border -- so long as it’s not the only consideration.

Chin and three other Arizona professors raised this issue in a paper in August.

Since officers would not be able to engage in racial profiling ""except to the extent permitted by the Constitution of Georgia and of the United States,"" and the U.S. Constitution does allow for some racial profiling, Georgia’s bill does, too, Chin argues.  

There are also concerns Georgia’s bill might conflict with federal immigration policy. Arizona’s law requires officers to determine immigration status in some circumstances. A federal judge blocked that provision from taking effect, saying it likely interferes with the U.S. Congress’ aim to regulate immigration in a uniform, national fashion and prevent people here legally from ""inquisitorial practices and police surveillance.""

Georgia’s bill is different. It wouldn’t require officers to check immigration status; it would only authorize them to do it. And they would only be able to do so if they have ""probable cause"" to think that another offense has taken place. In Arizona, officers need only to have ""reasonable suspicion"" that a person is an illegal immigrant for them to check.

This might improve HB 87’s chances at being constitutional.

This is by no means an exhaustive comparison of the two bills. However, we did determine that HB 87’s backers have tried to address constitutionality concerns.

But Georgia’s bill won’t avoid Arizona’s troubles entirely. Important issues remain unresolved, and critics are watching closely. If the bill passes as is, Georgia’s in for a fight.  

GALEO’s statement is accurate but does not acknowledge important details about efforts to make HB 87 constitutional. We therefore rule GALEO’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE4BEC0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/07/georgia-association-latino-elected-officials/immigration-bill-foes-label-legislation-arizona-co/
