Back to Basics PAC says the Texas jobless rate has grown more than the nation's
","
In its latest print advertisement, placed Oct. 5 in 41 newspapers statewide, the Back to Basics PAC angles to turn Gov. Rick Perry's favorite selling point against him: the Texas economy. 
Perry often touts job gains on his watch; in a recent TV spot, titled ""Texas: Open for Business,"" he says Texas has gained more jobs than all other states combined from January 2001 to June 2010, a statement we recently rated True. Yet the latest Back to Basics ad finds fault, pointing out that Perry fails to acknowledge that lawmakers balanced the latest state budget partly by accepting billions of dollars in federal stimulus money. 
The ad then lists some economic changes that have occurred since the governor wrote President Barack Obama in February 2009 assuring him that the state would accept the federal dollars. Punch line: ""Perry won't tell you that the Texas unemployment rate has even grown more than the nation’s as a whole."" 
Really?

On its website, Back to Basics points to statistics from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that the Texas unemployment rate between February 2009 and August 2010 rose from 6.8 percent to 8.3 percent, up 1.5 percentage points. During the same period, the U.S. unemployment rate grew from 8.2 percent to 9.6 percent, up 1.4 percentage points. 
The number of jobless people in Texas grew by 204,400 during that time — an increase of 26 percent. Meanwhile, the nation as a whole experienced a 17 percent increase. 
We checked with Cheryl Abbot, a bureau economist in Dallas, who told us that the figures used by Back to Basics were correct. She also told us that there were no statistical or logical problems with comparing the increase in the state's unemployment rate with that of the United States. 
""I would probably phrase (the statement) more correctly as 'the unemployment rate has increased at a faster rate in Texas,' but saying that it's grown more, there's probably nothing wrong with putting it that way,"" Abbot said. 
We asked Abbot how best to interpret the 0.1 percentage point gap between the changes in the national and state unemployment rates. She said ""there is very little difference"" between 1.5 and 1.4 in this context, noting that one interpretation of the numbers could be that during those 18 months, Texas' job performance was about the same as the nation's. 
That's part of Back to Basics' point, said Cliff Walker, the group's director. Those numbers show Perry ""isn't as good as he says he is,"" he said. 
Next, we looked into whether changing the time period for comparing unemployment rates also changes the result. 
We tried five different starting points -- January 2009, December 2008, November 2008, January 2007 and December 2000 -- and in all those cases, the Texas unemployment rate increased by the same number of percentage points as the national rate, or less. (December 2000 was when Perry entered the governor's office, and January 2007 was the beginning of his current term.) 
When we asked Walker why Back to Basics started its time period of comparison with the month of Perry's letter to Obama, he told us that the group is ""trying to draw attention to the fact that Perry took federal stimulus dollars — a fact that many Texans, more than a year and a half later, still do not know."" 
Our take: Back to Basics' statement accurately recaps a specific time period — the 18 months following Perry's acceptance of federal stimulus aid for Texas in February 2009 — that shows unemployment rising faster in Texas than the nation as a whole. As our analysis shows, though, lengthening the time period often yields a different result, with unemployment in Texas rising more slowly than the nation.

Wallin says Kilmartin voted to expand 'good behavior' law to jailed sex offenders
","
There are few things that scare the public more than the possibility of sex offenders running loose on the streets.

So when Republican candidate for attorney general Erik Wallin issued a news release warning voters that his opponent, Democrat Peter Kilmartin, voted to allow sex offenders to shave time off their prison sentences for good behavior, it caught our attention.

His claim began like this: ""Erik Wallin, candidate for Attorney General, today criticized Representative Kilmartin for his vote in favor of expanding the 'good behavior' statute to sex offenders and called for its overall repeal for those who commit violent felonies (including sex crimes) and domestic violence offenses.""

He repeated much of that accusation in a subsequent appearance on WPRO 630-AM's ""John DePetro Show.""

The good behavior statute he's talking about is part of a state law that dictates when and how prison inmates are allowed to earn time off their sentences. He is referring to a change in that policy enacted by lawmakers in 2008.

But let's go back to what the law said before that rewrite. Since 1976, the statute has allowed well-behaved prison inmates -- except those serving life sentences -- to trim up to 10 days a month off their prison stays under a formula that was tied to the length of their sentence.

For example, an inmate sentenced to eight  years could knock eight days per month off his or her prison time, while someone serving five years could earn up to five days off a month. Prisoners could also earn small amounts of additional time off for what is known as meritorious service.

Sex offenders were not excluded from those guidelines. Nor were violent felons or anyone else besides those with life sentences.

In 2008, faced with cost concerns, crowding and calls for a good conduct policy that would allow those serving short sentences to earn as much time off as those imprisoned for more serious crimes, the state convened a panel to revamp the policy. That group was made up of prosecutors, public defenders, state police, the chief judge of the Superior Court, corrections officials and legislators.

The result was a line item in Governor Carcieri's midyear budget that would have allowed all inmates except those serving life sentences to earn up to 10 days per month off their time -- a full third -- regardless of their crimes.

The proposal also allowed inmates to earn up to five days more per month off for participating in rehabilitation programs such as substance-abuse treatment and anger management.

House leaders later decided to consider the measure as a separate bill, rather than a budget item.  (It is worth noting that as the House whip, Kilmartin was a member of that leadership team.)

But as that bill made its way to the House floor, a small group of legislators on both sides of the aisle roared in protest. The new rules, they said, did not specifically exclude sex offenders, meaning they too were eligible for the increased good behavior benefits.

House lawmakers rewrote the bill to specifically exclude sex offenders from benefiting from the new policy. In other words, they were still governed by the less generous statute from the 1970s. The legislation passed March 27, 2008, with Kilmartin voting yes.

For procedural reasons, it found its way back into the midyear budget bill. It passed, complete with the language excluding sex offenders, in May of that year.

Kilmartin again voted yes. But neither of his two votes that year gave any new privileges to sex offenders, as Wallin suggests. In fact, they did exactly the opposite, targeting sex offenders as the only inmates -- along with  those serving life sentences -- who could not benefit.

""Basically every other inmate at the [Adult Correctional Institutions] got a real benefit from this change, and the sex offenders did not,"" said Patricia Coyne-Fague, chief legal council for the state Department of Corrections.

So why did Wallin accuse Kilmartin of a vote the representative never made?  

Wallin acknowledged that the new rules excluded sex offenders, and he said his initial new release contained ""bad wording,"" noting that he sent out a subsequent statement that downplayed the sex offender side of what he said.

In retrospect, Wallin said the essence of his claim had more to do with what Kilmartin didn't do than what he did.

""My argument is simply that [Kilmartin] voted for a bill that continues to allow sex offenders to get credit for good behavior ... He failed to close the loophole,"" or repeal the older portion of the law that rewards sex offenders.

Wallin is right about that. Sex offenders are still eligible to trim time off their sentences under a policy that some voters might not approve of. But that is the result of a law that passed in 1976, when Kilmartin was 14 years old. It had nothing to do with the 2008 votes.

The claim stops short of receiving a Pants on Fire because Wallin acknowledges that the news release was poorly worded. But that doesn't change the fact that he accused his opponent of voting in favor of something he didn't vote for.

We find this claim False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/07/erik-wallin/wallin-says-kilmartin-voted-expand-good-behavior-l/

In follow-up to 'Taliban Dan' ad, Alan Grayson slams Daniel Webster over working mothers
","
Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., one of the most outspoken Democrats in the House, garnered attention -- much of it negative -- for a stinging ad he released on Sept. 25, 2010, labeling his Republican challenger, former state House Speaker Daniel Webster, ""Taliban Dan"" due to his longstanding connection to a conservative Christian group. PolitiFact Florida ruled one part of the ad False and another part Half True. In fact, the national and local attention became so intense that Webster experienced a surge in fundraising among voters who thought that Grayson's attack had gone too far.

On Oct. 6, 2010, the Grayson camp released a new ad that covers much of the same territory, but which eliminates some of the more provocative language and claims from the first ad. (In what may be a sign that the Grayson campaign is distancing itself from the ""Taliban Dan"" ad, the YouTube link to it has now been made inaccessible to the general public.)

As soon as we heard about the new ad, we knew we had to fact-check it. So we'll analyze several claims from the ad separately.

Here's a full transcript of the new ad:

Daniel Webster's Washington backers are attacking Alan Grayson on women's issues. The facts on Webster's record:

Fact: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships.

Fact: Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home.

Fact: Webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child.

Those are the facts. Don't let Daniel Webster make the laws we will have to live with. 

The one we'll check now is the claim that ""Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home.""

As we noted in our fact-check of the earlier ""Taliban Dan"" ad, the Grayson campaign is referring to a conservative Christian group called the Institute in Basic Life Principles. Webster has been involved with the group for nearly 30 years and continues to participate in training sessions and speak at seminars. In a 2003 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, Webster said he home-schooled his six children using the institute's curricula and said that the group's teachings have had a major influence on his life.

Since that 2003 article, Webster has kept up his ties to the group -- in fact, the allegation from the ""Taliban Dan"" ad that we rated False stems from an address Webster made to the group in 2009. So we have no quarrel with Grayson's description of Webster as someone who continues to be ""an advocate"" for the group.

What about the notion that the institute ""teaches that mothers should not work outside the home""? We see strong indications that that's the case, but we'll also mention some notable caveats.

As we reported in our earlier analysis, the institute helps teach Christians how to find success by following scriptural principles, and some of its specific teachings are controversial. The institute teaches that married couples are to abstain from sex 40 days after the birth of a son, 80 days after the birth of a daughter and the evening prior to worship, and that people should avoid rock and even contemporary Christian music because it can be addictive.

In web-based instructional materials titled, ""How a Wife’s Attitudes Can Preserve Her Marriage: Seven Key Areas of Respect and Submission,"" the institute writes, ""The specific roles of husbands and wives are defined in Scripture: 'Let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband' (Ephesians 5:33). A wife who respects her husband’s leadership and submits to him greatly strengthens the marriage relationship.""

Among other things, the institute's materials tell wives, ""Do not threaten your husband or make demands,"" and they warn that ""if you lack inward Godliness and outward neatness and modesty, your husband can lose respect for you and be more easily tempted by other women.""

We looked through the institute's website and found hints that the group doesn't expect mothers to work outside the home, but we couldn't find an explicit teaching on that point.

For instance, the institute teaches, ""Trust God to provide for your family’s financial needs through your husband’s leadership.""

It also teaches wives to ""maintain personal neatness in your appearance. Wear your clothes and hair in a way that honors your husband’s preferences. As an expression of how important your husband is to you, do your best to look nice when he comes home from work."" The implicit assumption in that teaching is that the man will be working outside the home and the woman will be taking care of the children.

And a 1997 St. Petersburg Times profile of Webster quoted the Rev. Tom Brandon, identified as an institute director, saying that it would not be natural for a woman to work outside the home and the man to raise the children. ""That puts a wife in a role that she's not equipped for inwardly or outwardly and puts the man in the same position,"" he said. ""A man is the lover and leader. (The wife's) role is to trust God to supply her needs through the leadership of her husband and to serve with him and fulfill his needs.""

Brandon's quote gets us closer to confirming Grayson's claim, but it's still focused on the idea of house-husband, which muddies the message a bit.

So while the view that mothers shouldn't work seems consistent with the institute's teachings, we can't find anything in the institute's materials explicitly requiring mothers to forgo work in order to stay home.

But we perceive a more important omission in Grayson's ad  -- it ignores substantial evidence that Webster has not adhered to this particular tenet, at least in his official duties.

For starters, he has employed numerous working mothers in his office. A Webster spokeswoman said that he employed at least three as senior aides in the legislature: Ann Drawdy, his chief legislative assistant in the House and Senate; Allison Carter, a policy analyst during his tenure as Senate Majority Leader; and MaryPat Moore, his health care policy director during his tenure as speaker. The spokeswoman added that Webster currently has working mothers on his congressional campaign staff.

In addition, colleagues in both parties have said that Webster has not sought to push his religious beliefs on them. The 2003 Times profile quoted two of them -- former Democratic House Speaker Peter Wallace and state Sen. Nancy Argenziano, a moderate Republican who served with Webster in the House.

""He's a very religious man, but he never imposed that on anybody,"" Argenziano said. ""If he had a personal agenda for his personal beliefs, he never made it the will of he House, so to speak. He was the best speaker I've seen.""

So where does this leave us? An institute director and some of the teaching materials give strong hints that mothers are expected to be at home, but we don't find anything explicitly requiring mothers to forgo work in order to stay home. But even if that is the group's belief, Webster has employed several mothers in senior positions, and colleagues have said he didn't push his beliefs in the Legislature. That contradicts the impression given in the ad that Webster is personally opposed to mothers working outside the home. So we rate the ad's claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/06/alan-grayson/follow-taliban-dan-ad-alan-grayson-slams-daniel-we/

Alan Grayson tones down rhetoric, but not attacks in new ad targeting Dan Webster
","
U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is continuing his pointed attacks against Republican opponent Daniel Webster, and Webster's stance on women's issues.

Only this time, he's ditching the lines about religious fanaticism and the comparisons to the Taliban.

Grayson, a Democrat from Orlando, caught flak for airing an ad that compared Webster's beliefs to those of the Taliban, and for distorting Webster's words in a speech Webster gave to a Christian group. Grayson played clips in a 30-second ad called ""Taliban Dan Webster"" that showed Webster saying wives should submit to their husbands. But an unedited clip of the speech showed that Webster was in fact telling husbands to love their wives. The distortion, which earned a False rating from PolitiFact Florida, gave Webster's campaign national attention (including tweets of support from Sarah Palin) and helped him raise more than $100,000 in 48 hours, his campaign said.

In response, Grayson released a toned-down version of the ""Taliban Dan"" ad on Oct. 6, 2010, called ""The Facts."" Gone are the terrorists holding machine guns, the people burning American flags and the women wearing burqas. Also gone are references to religious fanaticism, Iran and the Bible.

(Gone, too, we found, is the ""Taliban Dan Webster"" ad from Grayson's YouTube website. The video is now marked private.) Here's a transcript of the new ad: 
Daniel Webster's Washington backers are attacking Alan Grayson on women's issues. The facts on Webster's record:

Fact: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. 
Fact: Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. 
Fact: Webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child. 
Those are the facts. Don't let Daniel Webster make the laws we will have to live with. 
In another item, we're analyzing the claim that Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. 
In this fact check, we'll focus on the first ""Fact"" -- that Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. It's a slightly different take on a claim in the first ad when Grayson claimed that Webster ""wants to make divorce illegal,"" even for abused women. 
Both claims track back to a piece of legislation Webster introduced as a member of the state House in 1990. 
That year, Webster authored HB 1585, a bill that ""creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery.""

Florida law then and now allows married couples to divorce if a court finds that the marriage is ""irretrievably broken."" It's a common standard throughout the country, often called no-fault divorce. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy.

Webster's legislation sought to make getting a divorce more difficult, at least for couples that voluntarily entered the covenant marriage.

Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring:

""I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me.""

Once a couple agreed to a covenant marriage, the only way they could get a divorce is for adultery. That means physical or sexual abuse was not grounds for a divorce.

Webster's legislation went nowhere in Florida -- Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote -- but it did help launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide.

Three states -- Louisiana, Arkansas and Arizona -- adopted a version of Webster's law, though the laws on the books in those states were all less restrictive than what Webster proposed in Florida, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage.

In his first ad, ""Taliban Dan Webster,"" Grayson said that Webster ""wants to make divorce illegal,"" even for abused women.

But as our research proves, Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. Rather it would make divorce more difficult, but not impossible, for couples who chose to form a covenant marriage. Even couples who chose Webster's form of covenant marriage had a small window out for adultery. We rated Grayson's original claim Half True.

It appears the Grayson campaign listened.

In his new ad, ""The Facts,"" Grayson says ""Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships.""

In 1990, Webster sponsored HB 1585, which would create a new form of marriage called covenant marriage. If women agreed to form a covenant marriage, they would not be allowed to divorce because of physical or sexual abuse.

The only out under Webster's legislation was adultery.

Fact-checking Marco Rubio's Social Security stance
","
Charlie Crist's latest attack ad targets Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and hits on a touchy subject for elderly Floridians: Social Security.

The 30-second ad aims to sway votes in a key demographic. Florida's 60 and older population makes up more than 30 percent of registered voters, and more than 40 percent voters who cast ballots in 2006.

The ad, released Oct. 5, 2010, is called ""Protect."" Here's a transcript:

Work longer, get by on less.

That’s the Marco Rubio retirement plan. 
Rubio wants to raise the Social Security retirement age. That means you’ll work harder and longer for your money.

And Rubio wants to cut benefits, though it’s already tough enough to make ends meet.

That’s Washington for you – balance the budget on the backs of seniors.

There’s a better choice.

Charlie Crist is against raising the retirement age.

He'll protect Social Security because our seniors have earned it.

The claim that we're checking is that Rubio ""wants to raise the Social Security retirement age"" and ""cut benefits.""

The Rubio campaign was ready and waiting for the Crist attack. The campaign issued a press release criticizing the ad at 10:32 a.m. on Oct. 5, 13 minutes before the Crist campaign sent out its press release announcing the ad (Apparently, the ad was posted earlier in the morning on the website YouTube).

""In his latest desperate attempt to say and do anything to win an election, Charlie Crist has launched a desperate false attack ad designed solely to mislead Florida voters and scare seniors about Marco Rubio's Social Security position,"" the press release starts. ""The ad falsely claims that Rubio wants to cut Social Security benefits to 'balance the budget on the backs of seniors.' This claim is demonstrably false.""

Within 30 minutes of Crist's announcement about the new ad, conservative commentator Stephen F. Hayes had penned almost 700 words about the Crist ad in a blog post titled, ""A Desperate Charlie Crist Dishonestly Attacks Rubio,"" that regurgitates Rubio's talking points.

And within three hours the world heard from former Gov. Jeb Bush.

""Charlie Crist should be ashamed of his false attack against Marco Rubio on Social Security. Charlie Crist is purposely trying to scare seniors in order to win votes,"" Bush said. ""The fact is, Marco Rubio will protect Social Security. His own mother relies on Social Security and he has repeatedly stated that he would not support or propose any benefit reductions for current retirees or people who are close to retirement.""

Thanks for the input spin, guys, but we'll handle the fact-checking, okay?

More than 3.5 million Floridians receive Social Security benefits, according to the U.S. Social Security Administration. To be eligible to receive full benefits, a person must be between 65 and 67 (depending on what year they were born), be disabled, be a survivor of a worker who died, or be a dependent of Social Security beneficiaries.

Social Security was a New Deal program created in 1935 to help elderly and other Americans with economic hardships. The program is funded by payroll taxes.

This year, for the first time, Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it takes in. The deficit, approximately $41 billion, will be offset by money in the Social Security trust fund. By 2014, as the baby boomer generation retires, deficits are expected to increase, according to the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees. By 2037, the trust fund will be empty, trustees predict, and incoming taxes will only be able to pay out 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2084.

So something needs to change between now and 2037 -- whether it's raising the retirement age, altering benefits, or something else -- to keep Social Security solvent.

Rubio on the retirement age

Rubio has suggested that one solution is to gradually raise the retirement age.

Speaking to reporters in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010, Rubio said the ""retirement age issue is going to have to be confronted at some point as part of a measure to reform Social Security.""

Rubio talked about raising the retirement age in a Wall Street Journal interview published March 13, 2010. ""I know . . . people don't like to talk about it,"" the article quotes Rubio as saying. ""Privatization of the accounts has come and gone, (but) there are other alternatives, such as [raising] the retirement age, how you adjust payments in the future, 'need' measures, et cetera.""

And then the retirement age came up again during a March 28 Fox News Sunday debate with a then-Republican Crist. Host Chris Wallace asked Rubio if he would raise the retirement age.

""I think that has to be on the table. That's got to be part of the solution. The retirement age that gradually increases for people of my generation, I think has got to be part of ...,"" Rubio says before getting cut off.

He has reiterated that position throughout the campaign, with one important caveat -- there would be no changes for people nearing or now retired.

""I think if you're 55 years of age or older or close enough to retirement ... I think this is off the table,"" Rubio said in the Fox interview. In the Wall Street Journal interview, he said any retirement age changes wouldn't affect people within 10 years of retirement.

Rubio on benefit cuts

Rubio also suggested changes in the cost-of-living adjustments Social Security beneficiaries receive.

In the March Fox News debate, Rubio was asked if he would change cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security.

""I think all of that has to be on the table, including the way we index increases in cost of living. All of these issues have to be on the table,"" Rubio said. ""They have to be options that I would be open to.""

Rubio said as much again on Sept. 26, 2010, in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation.

""Younger workers like myself, people 39 years of age like I am -- we're going to have to accept that there's going to be some changes to Social Security,"" Rubio said. ""And perhaps they're going to have to change the way the benefit is indexed. Perhaps we're going to have to continue to allow the retirement age to fluctuate, as it has been doing since the early 1980s.

""But again, that's for younger workers like myself who have 20 or 30 years to prepare for this. People that are on the system now, or let's say 10 years from retirement or 12 years from retirement, these folks can't all of a sudden make a change to adjust for it. So I think we have to start talking honestly about the long-term challenges facing a very important program, Social Security, because we want to save it. It's important. We want to preserve it.""

That full quote probably best explains Rubio's position, in his own words. He supports what amounts to benefit cuts and raising the retirement age, in order to keep Social Security solvent, but not for current retirees or folks nearing retirement. His point is that without changes, Social Security won't be able to meet its obligations.

And on that point he's right (not that Crist is going to admit it). Rubio's stance has won him praise from the editorial board of the St. Petersburg Times, which said his position included ""the sorts of straight answers Floridians deserve from serious candidates,"" and conservative commentator George Will, who said, ""Rubio's responsible answer to a serious question gives the nation a glimpse of a rarity -- a brave approach to the welfare state's inevitable politics of gerontocracy.""

What the Rubio folks are all bothered about

Crist's ad claims that Rubio ""wants to raise the Social Security retirement age"" and ""cut benefits."" Rubio, in his own words, says as much.

So what has the Rubio campaign all angry?

First, the ad fails to mention the caveat in Rubio's thinking -- that any adjustments to Social Security, whether to the retirement age or benefits, would not affect either current retirees or people nearing retirement.

That, and the images that go with the ad. The ad includes images of white-haired and wrinkled-faced retirees that goes along with the narrator's script. When the ad cuts to Charlie Crist, it shows him talking and shaking hands with seniors.

""Crist knows that Rubio has pledged to protect and preserve Social Security for those who are at or near retirement,"" Rubio's campaign said in their press release.

Crist spokesman Danny Kanner responded: ""In an ad about Social Security, I don't think it's irrelevant to include images of senior citizens.""

We should note that the ad also says that Rubio wants to ""balance the budget on the backs of seniors."" That's not true. The changes to Social Security Rubio supports are to make the Social Security program solvent long term, not to create extra tax revenues to use to balance the budget, fund other federal programs or to pay down the federal debt.

Crist's ad, ""Protect"" is correct in pointing out that Rubio supports proposals to keep Social Security solvent past 2037 by raising the retirement age and potentially reducing benefits. Rubio says changes are necessary or the Social Security program will go broke, a sentiment shared by the trustees who manage the federal program. But the ad fails to mention that Rubio's proposals would not affect any current retirees, or people nearing retirement (Rubio most often has said people within 10 years of reaching the Social Security retirement age). The ad certainly doesn't convey that half of the story. So, we think it's appropriate to rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/06/charlie-crist/fact-checking-marco-rubios-social-security-stance/

Republican Party of Florida says Alex Sink was in charge of pension losses
","
Update:  This item has been corrected to distinguish between the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund and the Local Government Investment Pool. Both were controlled by the State Board of Administration, but they are separate funds.                                                        
You should believe our attack ad, because we found a lot of newspaper stories that support our case!

Okay, so campaign attack ads don't really say that. But it seems to be the unstated premise of several ads featuring newspaper headlines and quotes from stories rushing across the screen.

Take the latest attack ad from the Republican Party of Florida, which is campaigning against Democrat Alex Sink for governor. Her opponent is Republican Rick Scott, a former health care executive.

Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost. Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink.""
   
Meanwhile, the screen flashes quotes and dates from the St. Petersburg Times: ""the state of Florida made bad investments that lost hundreds of millions"" and ""Florida pension fund plummets.""
   
The ad then cuts to video of Sink: ""I'm the fiscal watchdog for the citizens of our state, I have to look over how our citizens money is invested.""
   
The narrator goes on: ""The press says our government skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments. Auditors blamed Sink for a 'weak controls and a lack of oversight.' And now she wants a promotion?""
   
The screen flashes more quotes from the Times: ""Florida's State Board of Administration skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments,"" and ""weak internal controls and a lack of external oversight by trustees.""
   
Three of the four quotes are from a Times story published Sept. 19, 2010: Florida's State Board of Administration skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments. The other quote is from a story published Nov. 17, 2008, Florida pension fund plummets.
   
The Republican Party of Florida has released other ads against Sink and the state pension fund; we rated a previous ad Barely True. We wanted to see if this latest attack was more accurate. We're going to examine its claim in two parts.
   
""Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost.""
   
The Florida Retirement System Trust Fund is a massive investment account, today worth about $117 billion and holding the retirement assets of about 1 million current and retired state employees. It is one of the largest retirement funds in the nation. When Wall Street melted down in 2008, the value of Florida's retirement fund fell, too. In Sept. 2007, the fund was at its peak at about $138.4 billion and by June 30, 2010, the value had declined to $109.34 billion, a $29 billion drop in value. Still, according to the last actuarial report completed in 2009, the fund is 88.5 percent funded -- meaning if every employee retired today, they would get 88.5 percent of their retirement benefits. A funding level of 80 percent is considered healthy.
   
The State Board of Administration oversees the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund, as well as 33 additional public funds, including the Local Government Investment Pool. Hundreds of governments and organizations use this short-term fund like a money market fund and count on it for investments that are safe and easily converted to cash.
       
The St. Petersburg Times story from Sept. 19, 2010, detailed the local fund's risky investments over the past few years. The investigation found that state officials aggressively sought exceptions to rules intended to stop the local fund from buying high-risk securities.
       
From the story:
       
""Going back at least seven years, state money managers had been trying to find a way around rules that restricted them from buying certain risky securities. Time and again they asked, time and again lawyers told them no.
       
""But so eager were Florida's money managers for higher yields, they bought them anyway. In two months at the brink of the housing market meltdown in 2007, the state invested at least $9.5 billion in securities it was not authorized to buy, a review of confidential memos shows.""
The ad mixes state pension fund and the Local Government Investment Pool together.

Where the SBA ""skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments,"" according to the St. Petersburg Times was not with the pension fund, but  with the Local Government Investment Pool, which had chafed under rules that prevented it from buying higher risk (and possibly higher return) investments.

The losses in the pension fund are assets that have declined in value. Some previous ads have confused this issue, implying that the money lost was cash that disappeared out of bank accounts. But this ad makes pretty clear that it's talking about declines in value in investments made from pension funds, which are commonly referred to as losses. We find the claim that Florida ""lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost"" to be mostly accurate.

""Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink.""
   
The ad then targets Sink in her role as chief financial officer, an elected position in Florida that oversees several functions, including overseeing the state's auditing and accounting functions. But the specific claims of lost pension money and bad investments is related to Sink's role as one of three members of the Board of Trustees on the State Board of Administration, or SBA, the board charged with overseeing both the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund and the Local Government Investment Pool.
   
The other members of the board are Gov. Charlie Crist and Attorney General Bill McCollum. (Crist recently left the Republican Party to run as an independent for U.S. Senate against Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek. McCollum lost to Scott in the Republican Party primary for governor.)
   
According to statute, the three-member board ""may retain investment advisers or managers, or both, external to in-house staff, to assist the board in carrying out the power specified,"" and the board ""shall create an audit committee to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities."" So the board doesn't directly invest and administer the money but delegates the responsibility to an executive director. Ash Williams is the current executive director, and the job of investing the state's assets is divided between in-house investment managers and external investment managers. So as a member of the board, Sink is ""in charge,"" but she's in charge along with the two other trustees. And she's not responsible for day-to-day investment decisions.
   
Still, in April 2008, the board commissioned an audit that found many questionable purchases of securities, purchases that were riskier than what state rules should have allowed. The auditors said they were not hired to do a criminal investigation, and it was ''outside the scope"" to determine if the problems were the result of fraud or illegal acts. But the audit found weak internal controls and a lack of external oversight by the trustees -- Crist, Sink and McCollum.
   
It's a fair question to ask whether Sink, as a member of the board, asked enough questions and demanded enough answers. It is not accurate to imply, as the ad, does that she alone was in charge. The Times investigation repeatedly mentions that Sink, Crist and McCollum were the three charged with oversight of the funds and does not single out Sink for blame.
   
Our ruling
   
In the context of making investments, the ad rightly claims that Florida ""lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost,"" as the St. Petersburg Times stories reported. But the ad is misleading with its implication that Alex Sink was in charge of the funds as chief financial officer. She was one of three members of an oversight panel during a historic decline in investment values, and there are other people who bear responsibility for what happened to Florida's pensions funds, including internal and external financial managers. Still, Sink was one of three members who were in charge of defending the state's interest. The newspaper stories that the ad mentions don't single out Sink as being ""in charge."" So we rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/06/republican-party-florida/republican-party-florida-says-alex-sink-was-charge/

Ohio Democratic Party charges that Tom Ganley supports a 23 percent national sales tax
","
Taxation and spending are two topics of political debate in which specifics can be in short supply. A notable exception is the ""Fair Tax Act,"" introduced most recently by Republican congressman John Linder of Georgia.

The legislation specifically calls for abolishing most federal taxes - including personal and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes - and replacing them with a national sales tax on private consumption, home interest payments and government spending. It would have a rate of 23 percent.

Backers say the plan would be progressive on consumption and increase savings and investment. Opponents say it would be regressive and increase taxes on middle-income earners. (Detailed examinations of the proposal can be found in FactCheck.org’s ""Unspinning the fair tax,"" published May 31, 2007, and PolitiFact.com’s ""Adding up the fair tax,"" published Jan. 23, 2008.)

Promoted by such groups as Texas-based Americans for Fair Taxation the Ohio FairTax Association, the proposal has been embraced by many in the Tea Party movement, whose ""Contract from America"" supports a ""single-rate tax system.""

The Ohio Democratic Party says the plan is supported by Tom Ganley, the Republican challenging Rep. Betty Sutton in the 13th Congressional District. The claim is posted as a fact on a website paid for by the Democratic party that Sutton-authorized:

""Tom Ganley supports a 23 percent national sales tax that would raise taxes on the middle class while giving a huge tax break to millionaires like himself.""

Just one problem: Ganley's campaign says he does not support the FairTax.

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity going. Does he or doesn't he? The answer rests on the fine line between ""support"" and ""supportive.""

Sutton's campaign cites a survey of candidates that was posted in May by Ohioans for the FairTax. It has Ganley's position checked in the category of ""favorable/supports.""

Steven Curtis, the group's state director, said the listing was based on discussion with Ganley's campaign staff. ""They told me he was supportive,"" Curtis said. ""They told me he was favorably inclined toward the FairTax.""

That echoes a member’s posting on the Fair Tax Nation website last November, after Ganley spoke to a breakfast meeting during the Senate run he left for the congressional race: ""His PR man said Tom is very supportive of the Fair Tax.""

Sutton also points to a statement by Ganley on his own website: ""We need to consider basing our tax structure on alternate tax methodologies such as the Fair Tax and others which can be utilized to help people invest and save.""

Ganley spokeswoman Meghan Snyder said that the call for consideration does not constitute support.

""The current system is broken and ideas such as the Fair Tax and Flat Tax are on the table for consideration, but Mr. Ganley has not endorsed either plan,"" she said in an emailed statement. ""Though there are many proposed solutions, lowering taxes to grow the private sector will ultimately help bring our country back to prosperity.""

Ganley has called for ""fair taxes,"" but we could not find his ""supportive"" position on the Fair Tax  plan, or his stated openness to it, translating into a direct endorsement.

So there’s a shred of truth to the claim. He has called for the Fair Tax to be considered, but:

NRCC blasts Arkansas Democratic candidate Chad Causey for having been a ""bureaucrat""
","
The federal government is a convenient villain in many campaigns. But who can fairly be labeled a government bureaucrat? That's what we wondered as we watched an ad placed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans.

The ad targets Chad Causey, a Democrat who is running to succeed the man who was until recently his boss -- retiring Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark. Here's the narration:

""Washington, D.C. -- that's where Chad Causey lived and worked until very recently. He was a Washington, D.C., bureaucrat. Causey left the D.C. payroll and came straight to Arkansas to become a politician himself. Now guess who's helping fund Chad Causey's campaign? You guessed it - Washington, D.C., liberal labor unions and Nancy Pelosi's team. Remember, you can't spell Chad Causey without 'D.C.'""

We were immediately struck by the ad's use of the term ""bureaucrat."" Could a former Congressional aide really be described as a bureaucrat?

We first looked up Causey's background and found his government work has been exclusively in the legislative branch.  According to an Associated Press biography, Causey was born in Jonesboro, Ark. He earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Arkansas and a law degree from Catholic University in Washington. He spent 10 years with Berry, from 2001 to 2010, until Berry announced his retirement, and Causey became a candidate to succeed him. During his time with Berry, Causey served as a field representative, a legislative assistant, legislative director and district director. Starting in 2006, he served as Berry's chief of staff.

Now, let's go to the dictionaries. We first looked at the one sitting on our desk, Webster's New World Dictionary, third college edition. It defines ""bureaucrat"" as ""an official in a bureaucracy, especially one who follows a routine in a mechanical, unimaginative way, insisting on proper forms, petty rules, etc."" It defines ""bureaucracy"" as ""the administration of government through departments and subdivisions managed by sets of appointed officials following an inflexible routine"" or ""the concentration of authority in a complex structure of administrative bureaus.""

We then turned to Safire's Political Dictionary, a trenchant glossary written by the late William Safire, the former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon and longtime New York Times columnist. It calls bureaucracy ""administrative agencies of government ... manned for the most part by career personnel and characterized by rigid adherence to rules and established procedure; almost always used in a derogatory sense. ... King or president, mayor or mandarin, every ruler needs help running things. The first echelon below the top has typically been a kind of aristocracy, whether by appointment, heredity or election. Below that comes the civil service, or bureaucracy.""

To us, the discussion of ""departments,"" ""subdivisions,"" ""administrative bureaus,"" ""administrative agencies"" and supreme leaders of various types sounds a lot more like the executive branch than Congress.

Experts we spoke to agreed with us.

""'Bureaucrat' is not an official term, but it is commonly applied to executive branch civil service employees, rather than to the staff of the legislative or judicial branches,"" said Senate historian Donald Ritchie. Stephen Hess, a scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution who once worked in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations, said he's ""never heard a congressional staffer referred to as a bureaucrat.""

Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institue, agrees. ""If one uses the technical definition of bureaucrat, ... it is someone appointed for a position because of his or her specific, technical qualifications, in a job that can be for a career,"" Ornstein said. ""A congressional staff member, often appointed for reasons that have little to do with 'technical expertise' and in a job that can disappear every two years, would not meet that definition. A broader definition -- someone who is a cog in an organization -- could be stretched to fit, especially for a chief of staff. But the term here is being used not as a descriptive but as an epithet.""

Jock Friedly, whose website Legistorm was cited on screen as the source of the ""bureaucrat"" description, also objects. Legistorm is a database that allows users to look up publicly available information about Congressional staffers, including their salaries.

""To call Chad Causey a ‘D.C. bureaucrat’ might mislead some viewers,"" Friedly said. ""The term ‘bureaucrat’ is usually reserved for an official working for the executive branch, and often used derogatorily to imply someone devoted to enforcing proper procedures at the expense of sensible results. Instead, Causey worked for congressional offices, which are usually -- for better or worse -- much more entrepreneurial in their approach of focusing on results more than the process.""

In fact, two of the positions that Causey held -- field representative and district director -- are based in the lawmaker's home district, not in Washington. Serving as chief of staff, meanwhile, is a job based in D.C. that requires frequent travel to the district. The other two positions mentioned -- legislative assistant and legislative director -- typically are based in Washington.

When we contacted the NRCC, a spokesman pointed us to two online dictionary entries. He pointed out that the Merriam-Webster site defines ""bureaucrat"" as ""a member of a bureaucracy"" and, in turn, ""bureaucracy"" as ""a body of non-elective government officials.""

Meanwhile, the spokesman also cited ""The Growth of Congressional Staffs,"" an academic paper published in 1975 in the Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science by Harrison W. Fox Jr. and Susan Webb Hammond. In the paper, the authors discuss the expanding size of Congress' personal, committee and related staff, calling it ""a growing Congressional bureaucracy.""

But we don't think their passing use of the phrase ""bureaucracy"" justifies the NRCC's decision to use the word to describe Causey. (We wanted to ask Hammond, who's now retired from her job as a professor at American University, if she thought that was a valid justification for calling Causey a bureaucrat, but we were unable to reach her. We weren't able to track down Fox.)

The NRCC does have a point that Causey has spent a lot of time in D.C., and specifically working for Congress, an institution that isn't so popular these days. (The RealClearPolitics average of recent congressional job approval polls shows 21 percent approval and 72 percent disapproval.) In general, we have no quarrel with candidates who try to portray their opponents as out of touch with constituents -- it's a venerable tradition in electoral politics.

""It’s entirely fair to say he is a D.C. insider,"" said Friedly of Legistorm. ""As a decade-long congressional staffer, he has played the political game from the inside for a lot longer than most staffers remain in that position. And, as someone with experience on the Appropriations Committee, Causey has had the potential for not-inconsiderable influence on how Washington spends taxpayer dollars.""

Even so, notwithstanding the NRCC's efforts to find scholarly precedent, we feel that being a Washington insider is not the same thing as being a ""bureaucrat."" And we agree with Ornstein that a legislative employee is not a bureaucrat. So we rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/06/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-blasts-arkansas-democratic-candidate-chad-cau/

Rev. Franklin Graham says churches and synagogues are forbidden in most Muslim countries
","
On ABC's This Week on Oct. 3, 2010, host Christiane Amanpour held a town hall debate on whether Americans should fear Islam.

Naturally, the issue of the so-called Ground Zero mosque came up.

Amanpour asked the Rev. Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, about his comments following 9-11 that Islam is a ""very evil and very wicked"" religion.

""I understand what the Muslims want to do in America,"" said Graham, president of both the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) and the international Christian relief organization Samaritan's Purse. ""They want to build as many mosques and cultural centers as they possibly can so they can convert as many Americans as they can to Islam. I understand that...I understand what they're doing. And I just don't have the freedom to do this in most Muslim countries. We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden.""

Imam Osama Bahloul, leader of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, Tenn., and a panelist on the show, said Graham was incorrect.

""For someone to say we are not allowed to build a church in a Muslim country, this is absolutely not right. You can Google this,"" Bahloul said.

We spoke to several experts on religion and government in Muslim countries. And the consensus was clear: there are, in fact, Christian churches and/or synagogues in almost every Muslim country.

""Reverend Graham is wrong,"" said Yvonne Haddad, Professor of History of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations at Georgetown University. ""Churches are flourishing in Jordan and Syria. In Egypt, the Christians find restrictions on church construction which has recently been partially lifted.""

  Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic relations, agreed that Graham was incorrect. ""There are lots of Christian churches and synagogues in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Indonesia, Qatar, Kuwait ... If you go to any number of so-called Muslim countries you will see thriving Christian and Jewish populations.""

One member of the Iranian parliament is Jewish, Hooper noted.

""The only one where you don't see it, where you can't have a Christian church or synagogue is Saudi Arabia,"" Hooper said. ""It's only an issue in Saudi Arabia.""

The cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia are considered the two holiest cities in Islam, explained Akbar S. Ahmed, chair of Islamic Studies at American University. And so, he said, no churches or synagogues are allowed there.

""That is like the Vatican in terms of Catholicism,"" Ahmed said.

But where he grew up in Pakistan, for example, Ahmed said, there is a huge Christian church. While there are now very few Christians left there, the building is deserted but remains untouched. After 1948, he said, most Jewish people living in Muslim countries migrated to Israel. But there are still many churches in Muslim countries, as well as synagogues. One of the top advisers to the king of Morocco is Jewish, he said.

There may be periods of turmoil, or some narrow-minded leaders who have attacked churches over the years, Ahmed said, but there is nothing formalized in Islamic law that forbids the building of churches or synagogues.

""Today, because of the general atmosphere in the air, there are many untruths being spread about Islam,"" Ahmed said.

While the facts about whether most Muslim countries allow churches or synagogues is pretty cut-and-dried, there is another facet to this claim. Graham was speaking in the context of Muslims building mosques in order to convert people to Islam in the United States. And so we think it's fair to also look at whether it's possible to build a church or synagogue in most Muslim countries with the aim of converting people. And on that point, Graham is on firmer ground.

According to a 2007 Council on Foreign Relations ""backgrounder"" on religious conversion and sharia law, authored by Lionel Beehner, ""Conversion by Muslims to other faiths is forbidden under most interpretations of sharia and converts are considered apostates...Some Muslim clerics equate this apostasy to treason, a crime punishable by death.""

According to the report, while a vast majority of Muslim countries no longer prescribe death for apostates (instead opting for some lesser form of punishment), ""some states, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, still do hand out death sentences.""

Shireen Hunter, visiting professor at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, said that Graham ""cannot be more wrong,"" about there being a prohibition against churches or synagogues in most Muslim countries.

But, she said, ""conversion is a totally different thing.""

There is a great deal of debate in the Muslim community about Islamic law regarding conversions. Some argue Islam teaches there is no compulsion to faith. And while enforcement of religious laws against conversion is more aggressively applied by some Muslim countries than others, ""this is an issue that is there.""

In many countries in the Middle East, religion dictates your legal status as well, explained Nathan Brown, an expert on Islamic law at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. While legal enforcement of bans against conversions from Islam are rare in most Muslim countries, ""conversions are practically difficult,"" he said.

We think a Catholic church recently built in Qatar is a good example of how this is handled.

According to a March 2007 Al Jazeera story about the construction of a Catholic church: ""Although the country's native inhabitants are entirely Muslim -- and are prohibited by law from converting to another faith -- the new Catholic church will cater to the large number of Christian migrants who have come to the Arabia Gulf state in search of work.""

Archbishop Paul Hinder, the Catholic Church's Bishop of Arabia, explained in the story that he oversees churches in Qatar, UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen and even in Saudi Arabia, ""the birthplace of Islam, where Christianity is practiced behind closed doors."" On the Christian communities in Saudi Arabia, Hinder clarified: ""It's not an open church. Privately the Christians may gather in their houses in a very discreet manner.""

We think Graham erred when he said that in most Muslim countries, ""We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden."" That's demonstrably false. The construction of churches is not forbidden in most Muslim countries, only Saudi Arabia. And so, on balance, we rate Graham's comment False.",/factchecks/2010/oct/06/franklin-graham/rev-franklin-graham-says-churches-and-synagogues-a/
"['County Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker says he has given back more than $370,000 of his salary to Milwaukee County
","
For years, folks in southeastern Wisconsin have heard about Scott Walker, the Milwaukee County executive, giving up thousands upon thousands of dollars of his salary.

Elsewhere, the claim may be more of a jaw-dropper.

In March 2010, after launching his campaign for governor, Walker used a TV ad to tout the money he has returned and the amount is also proclaimed on Walker’s campaign website:

Since being elected in 2002, Scott Walker has ""given back over $370,000 of his salary to the county.""

The returned money was part of a 2002 campaign promise to cut the job’s salary by $60,000 per year. Walker, the Republican candidate for governor, made the pledge in the wake of a scandal over lavish county pensions.

His Democratic opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, has taken a jab at Walker, pointing out Walker has reduced his annual giveback from $60,000 to $10,000. The Barrett campaign points to a 2002 Walker flier, which includes the promise to reduce the county exec salary by $60,000 per year.

That promise, however, didn’t specify for how long Walker would reduce the salary by $60,000. And in April 2008, he was re-elected after telling voters he would reduce the giveback to $10,000. (Walker joked at the time, according to a news report, that his decision to give back nearly half of his $129,114 salary had been unpopular with his wife.)

(For those wondering, Barrett has taken six furlough days, two in 2009 and four in 2010, according to an aide. He has been taking his full salary, which this year is $147,335, according to the city comptroller’s office.)

So now the $370,000 question: Has Walker really given back that much back?

Let’s find out.

To get our tallies, we went first to the Walker gubernatorial campaign, which referred us to the county Department of Administrative Services. That office reports directly to Walker, so we also asked for figures from Milwaukee County Treasurer Dan Diliberti, a Democrat.

Both offices agreed on the figures.

Taking into account the partial year Walker served after being elected in 2002, and an odd number of pay periods in 2003 through 2005, Walker returned the equivalent of $60,000 per year from 2002 through 2007.

In 2008, which was covered partly by the $60,000 promise and mostly by the $10,000 promise, Walker returned $18,846. And in 2009 and so far in 2010, Walker not only returned the equivalent of $10,000 per year, but he’s also written checks to the county, for just under $500 each, for one furlough day in 2009 and six more furlough days in 2010.

The grand total?

Walker has foregone $375,070 in salary since being elected county executive in 2002 -- $5,070 more than what he has claimed during the gubernatorial campaign.

Our summation is as simple as the math:

In his initial campaign, Walker made a pledge to return $60,000 a year, though he later was re-elected on a smaller give-back pledge. He said his checkbook is more than $370,000 lighter -- and the county’s coffers that much better off. The record shows Walker’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/06/scott-walker/gop-governor-candidate-scott-walker-says-he-has-gi/

Lynn Howe says Sal Esquivel wants to tax milk, bread, eggs
","
Yet more sales tax shenanigans!

In Southern Oregon, Rep. Sal Esquivel, R-Medford, is campaigning for his fourth term representing House District 6. His Democratic challenger is Lynn Howe, who lost to him two years ago by a margin of 46 percent to 54 percent.

Howe’s campaign issued a mailer stating that Esquivel ""wants a 5 percent sales tax."" The backside of the flier features a mother and child in a grocery aisle with a shopping list. ""Buying milk, bread, eggs, cereal, bananas, chicken, tomatoes? SAL ESQUIVEL WANTS TO TAX IT.""

A tax on food staples? That’s rare, even in states with a sales tax. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check out the claim.

The Howe campaign flier cites House Bill 3269, which was introduced by Esquivel and five co-sponsors in the 2009 legislative session. It was assigned to the revenue committee and never acted on. The bill, which ran 59 pages, included many ideas related to taxation -- reducing income and property taxes, adding a general sales tax. But a tax on groceries was not one of them.  
  
SECTION 102. Food products. (1) There are exempted from the taxes imposed by the 
Sales and Use Tax Law the gross receipts from the sale of and the storage, use or other 
consumption in this state of food and food ingredients. 
(2) The exemption under this section does not apply to prepared food. 

The proposed tax also would have exempted prescription drugs, fuel, water and utilities. The bill went nowhere.

Most of the bill’s sponsors have been serious players in Oregon’s longtime quest to stabilize revenue: Rep. Vicki Berger of Salem, Rep. Scott Bruun of West Linn, Rep. Bob Jenson of Pendleton, and Sen. Frank Morse of Albany. All are Republicans. Sen. Ginny Burdick, a Portland Democrat and the Senate’s top person on finance in 2009, also was a co-sponsor.

Howe now admits that the bill would have exempted groceries, but she said people need other items that could have been taxed: school supplies, diapers, shoes, refrigerators.

It’s true Esquivel has advocated for a sales tax, in exchange for lowering other taxes. But Howe takes this too far, by saying he’s going after bread-and-butter kitchen staples. The bill specifically exempts food items. Combine that with the dearth of information on what the bill, in its entirety, would have done and PolitiFact Oregon rates this Pants On Fire.

Robitaille says Rhode Island's unemployment compensation is ""very generous"" compared with other states
","
John Robitaille, Republican candidate for governor, believes that one reason more Rhode Islanders aren't back at work is that the state pays too much to people who have lost their jobs.

During an Oct. 4 appearance on The Helen Glover Show, Robitaille asserted that unemployment compensation and welfare payments can discourage people from accepting jobs that are available, which is why the system needs to be changed to wean them from such programs.

""One contractor who's a friend of mine told me that he had two people turn him down flat [for a job] because they were making more money on unemployment than wanting to go to work for $15, $17 an hour. That's wrong,"" he said. ""Rhode Island has a very generous unemployment compensation rate compared to most other states and, couple that with our very generous welfare programs, and there's not really an incentive for people to go back to work.""

As of August, 37,298 Rhode Islanders who had lost a full-time or part-time job were receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Whether those payments discourage people from accepting jobs is a matter of opinion. We were interested in the question of whether the unemployment benefits are truly generous compared to other states.

According to the latest numbers from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (RIDLT), during the first quarter of 2010, the average unemployment insurance payment was $390.53 per week, the fifth highest in the nation. Only Hawaii ($419.27), Washington state ($401.95), Massachusetts ($400.57) and New Jersey ($400.55) paid out more per person.

Another way to look at the question is the maximum benefit you can receive. In July 2010, the cap for a single Rhode Islander was $551 per week. Five other states had a higher ceiling. Massachusetts was tops at $629 weekly.

When dependents are factored in, Rhode Island ranks second, at $688 per week. (Massachusetts was the highest, at $943.) But that ranking is misleading because, according to RIDLT spokeswoman Laura Hart, different states have different limits on how many dependents you can claim. In Rhode Island, the limit is five.

And that's not the whole story.

Living expenses vary from state to state, and New England is noted for having a higher cost of living than many other regions.

It's an important consideration, but not an easy one to gauge. The federal government puts out a cost of living index for different regions, but not on a state-by-state basis.

Instead, RIDLT compared the average weekly benefits in each state with the average weekly wage in those states, using data from the U.S. Department of Labor.

By the latest measurement, during the first quarter of 2010 Rhode Island ranked second in the nation. The state paid the typical recipient 47.8 percent of the average weekly wage of $816.71. (Hawaii topped the list, at 54.8 percent. Massachusetts, by that measure, was at 37.3 percent, ranking it 29th.)

Put another way, the average hourly wage in Rhode Island during the first quarter of 2010 was $20.42. The average person receiving unemployment insurance got the equivalent of $9.76 per hour. The benefit could be as much as $13.76 an hour for an individual or $17.20 per hour for someone with five or more dependents.

By all these measures, Rhode Islanders receiving unemployment benefits are doing better than out-of-work people in most other states, so we rank Robitaille's statement True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/06/john-robitaille/robitaille-says-rhode-islands-unemployment-compens/

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Ohio Democrats can feel positively fawned upon by American Crossroads, the deep-pocketed conservative political action group conceived by Karl Rove and former Republican National Committee chair Ed Gillespie.

A TV ad the group is running against Democratic Senate candidate Lee Fisher, in support of Republican Rob Portman, is almost a frame-by-frame copy of a spot run by Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.

The Obama spot, ""Rearview Mirror,"" opened with the shot of a highway and man inside a car adjusting the mirror. The voiceover said, ""Wonder where John McCain would take the economy? Look behind you."" The ad cut to a shot of George Bush in the mirror, followed by a series of blue and green signs, roadside and overhead, spelling out the ad's talking points. It closed with a shot of McCain and Bush in the mirror.

The American Crossroads spot, ""Behind,"" opens with the shot of a highway and a man inside a car adjusting the mirror. The voiceover says, ""Where will Lee Fisher take our economy? Just look behind you."" It cuts to a shot of Fisher in the mirror, followed by a series of blue and green signs, roadside and overhead, spelling out the ad's talking points. It closes with a shot of Fisher in the mirror.

But imitation is also the sincerest form of television, and ads don't necessarily win or lose points for originality. Our concern is content, and the ad's three points also display a taste for recycling.

First is the statement, ""Fisher served as Gov. Strickland's top official on job creation, yet Ohio has lost almost 400,000 jobs."" PolitiFact examined this claim earlier, and rated it Half True. Fisher was in charge of the state agency most responsible for bringing new jobs to Ohio, but that doesn’t mean he is solely responsible for the job losses. And the state didn’t lose that many jobs while he was head of the Department of Development.

The spot also asserts that Fisher ""even supported Obama's stimulus that failed to create jobs."" The critical point is the contention that the stimulus failed to create jobs, another claim that PolitiFact has examined and found untrue and, in one case, rated as Pants on Fire.

Wedged between those claims in the Crossroads ad is the assertion that Fisher ""wanted a $1.1 billion tax increase which could have driven countless jobs out of state.""

That charge is new to this campaign, and the claim that PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at. But it’s such a blast from the past that you need the Hubble Space Telescope to see it, not a rearview mirror.

Asked for sources, American Crossroads said the charge is based on Fisher's support for a plan proposed in 1997 to raise the state sales tax from 5 cents on the dollar to 6 cents.

The so-called plan was a state ballot issue proposed by then-Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican, who was leaving office to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by John Glenn.

Both candidates to replace Voinovich -- Fisher, the Democrat, and Secretary of State Bob Taft, the Republican -- voiced support for the ballot issue. Fisher also vowed that as governor he would not seek any increase in state sales or income taxes without voter consent.

The 1-cent sales tax was intended to generate $1.1 billion a year -- $550 million for schools and $550 million for homeowner property-tax relief. Voters rejected it at the polls in May 1998.

But the way it is used in the ad is misleading: 
It is true that Fisher, as well as leading Republicans in Ohio at the time, supported the sales tax issue that would have raised $1.1 billion. That’s one element of accuracy. But the ad leaves out important details needed to fully present the statement in proper context.

We rate it Half True.

Joe Radinovich, running from the law? CLF ad touts 18 crimes
","There are bad apples and then, says a Republican-allied PAC, there’s Democrat Joe Radinovich. His troubles run so deep that ""he’s spent his life running from the law,"" says an ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC with ties to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan. ""Charged with 18 crimes,"" the ad’s announcer says of Radinovich. ""Thirty traffic violations. Five times, Joe Radinovich had his driver’s license suspended. The cops even charged Radinovich with possession of drug paraphernalia. Fast times. Broken laws."" Does this sound like a guy fit for Congress? Before you answer, let’s look at the veracity of the ad. Its sponsor, the Congressional Leadership Fund, wants to retain a Republican majority, and that means keeping Democrats like Radinovich, a former Minnesota state legislator, from winning the open U.S. House seat. Radinovich is running against Pete Stauber, a retired Duluth police officer and current county commissioner. Radinovich’s campaign has said before that the candidate had a rough patch as a teenager, and newspaper clips suggest why. His mother was shot and killed in a family murder-suicide when Radinovich was in high school. Furthermore, PolitiFact can stipulate already that from the time he turned 18 until now, 32-year-old Radinovich has had more than 30 parking or driving citations resulting in pleadings or findings of guilt. We examined those already when the Congressional Leadership Fund launched a different ad. We rated the claim Mostly True rather than True because of the ad’s clumsy characterization that suggested Radinovich has been cited 30 times for not paying court fines. That number -- 30 -- accounted for underlying charges, not delinquent court payments. His offenses ranged from repeated parking meter violations to four speeding convictions. As for his delinquencies in paying court fines, we found the Congressional Leadership Fund was correct when it said Radinovich was referred to a state collections agency eight times. But what of the 18 ""crimes"" the newest ad cites? After asking the PAC for a list of offenses it was counting, we turned again to online Minnesota court records to check. We found that most of the 18 ""crimes"" counted in the new ad, with the exception of the drug paraphernalia charge from when Radinovich was 18, were already factored into the previous ad. That ad, however, did not go as far as characterizing Radinovich as a man with a life of crime. And that ad used a higher count, of 30, because it included parking tickets. The new list of ""crimes"" is smaller because it generally relates to driving -- speeding, driving without proof of insurance, obstructing traffic, driving on a suspended or revoked license. But were those 18 offenses really crimes? Most were catalogued by Minnesota courts as ""petty misdemeanors,"" and that’s an important distinction in court, say Minnesota attorneys. ""A petty misdemeanor such as traffic offenses are not crimes under Minnesota law,"" David Schultz, a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, told us in an email. ""One might have broken the law but legally one is not a criminal."" Minnesota statutes spell this out. ""‘Crime’ means conduct which is prohibited by statute and for which the actor may be sentenced to imprisonment, with or without a fine,"" says Minnesota Statute 609.02. That can mean a felony or a regular misdemeanor, since a misdemeanor can result in a jail sentence of up to 90 days. But the statute defines petty misdemeanor as ""a petty offense which is prohibited by statute, which does not constitute a crime and for which a sentence of a fine of not more than $300 may be imposed."" Charles N. Nauen, an attorney for the Radinovich campaign, pointed out the statute in a letter to Minnesota TV stations, asking them to take the ad down because, he said, it smeared the candidate with false and misleading claims. But the Congressional Leadership Fund said the ad was still running. The PAC told PolitiFact that it used the word ""crime"" correctly because the word is commonly understood to mean breaking the law, whether that results in a prison punishment or not. ""Crime"" is defined in dictionaries that way, the PAC said. ""Joe Radinovich’s admittedly long rap sheet is full of numerous violations punishable by the state -- in other words, crimes,"" said Michael Byerly, a spokesman for the PAC. Referring to a whimsical line in our last piece on Radinovich’s parking and driving record, he added, ""As PolitiFact wrote previously about Radinovich, do the crime, pay the fine."" So what about these 18 ""crimes"" alleged of Radinovich by the Congressional Leadership Fund? Where do they fit on the Minnesota crime-versus-petty-misdemeanor continuum? Looking at online records, the first thing PolitiFact discovered is that two of those 18 charges against Radinovich were dismissed in court. As for the remaining 16 charges, 12 were petty misdemeanors for such things as speeding, driving without a vehicle registration or license plates, obstructing traffic and failure to drive with due care. Four were straight misdemeanors, the kinds defined as ""crimes"" under Minnesota law. The last time Radinovich was accused and later convicted of one of these true ""crimes,"" as defined by Minnesota statute, was in early 2007, when he was 20 and was caught driving on a suspended license, records show. If you were to use the PAC’s broader crime definition that includes petty misdemeanors, however, Radinovich’s most recent offenses were in 2017, when he was charged once for driving 69 mph in a 55 mph zone and once for failure to ""drive with due care."" As for the drug case, on Feb. 4, 2005, when Radinovich was 18, he was charged by Deerwood, Minn., police with failure to signal and possession of drug paraphernalia. The drug paraphernalia was related to marijuana, Radinovich’s campaign says. The teen initially pleaded not guilty. That summer, the charge, a petty misdemeanor, was dealt with in court with a disposition called ""continued for dismissal."" It is basically an agreement that no conviction on the charge would result if the defendant stayed out of trouble. Radinovich also was charged $100 in court fees for the case, records show. So did Radinovich stay out of trouble? The Congressional Leadership Fund suggests he didn’t. Radinovich’s first bit of fresh trouble after the drug charge came a month after the plea agreement: He was delinquent in paying the $100 in fees, records show. So the court several weeks later ordered that his driver’s license be suspended. It was reinstated four months later, a time that matches his payment of the fees, the court records show. During that driver’s license suspension, however, Radinovich drove anyway, records show. After being stopped two days after Christmas in 2005 for failing to stop at a stop sign, he was charged with driving under suspension, failure to stop at a stop sign and driving without insurance. He was 19 by then. The insurance charge was dismissed. Radinovich was fined $304 for the other offenses, and was late in paying, records show. He had his license suspended again in 2007, a week after turning 21, and this time was unlicensed for nine months. Regardless, the court docket says the drug-paraphernalia charge was ultimate dismissed, with ""conditions met or expired."" The Congressional Leadership Found says Radinovich has ""spent his life running from the law, charged with 18 crimes."" The ad has a few elements of truth. But the numbers make it sound far worse than Minnesota law would allow. Most of Radinovich’s offenses were driving-related. Most were petty misdemeanors -- a legal distinction, for sure, but an important one in the state where voters who follow that law will decide this race. You could argue about those numbers. But by casting the candidate as someone who has ""spent his life running from the law,"" the ad omits critical facts and takes liberties in characterizing a life with traffic and driving issues, not holdups and getaway chases. By the standards of the Truth-O-Meter, that gives the claim a rating of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/17/congressional-leadership-fund/joe-radinovich-running-law/

No, Florida couple didn't get arrested for selling golden tickets to heaven
","Golden tickets to heaven? You know that’s too good to be true, even in Florida. ""Couple Arrested For Selling ‘Golden Tickets To Heaven,"" reads a headline on City World News. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story, in circulation since 2015, said Jacksonville residents Tito and Amanda Watts were selling wooden slabs spray-painted with gold paint on the street for $99.99. ""I don’t care what the police say,"" the story quoted Tito Watts as saying. ""The tickets are solid gold… it ain’t cut up two by fours I spray painted gold."" The story even quoted an unnamed Jacksonville Police Department spokesman. It said the police confiscated over $10,000 in cash, five crack pipes and a baby alligator. Just like tickets that reserve a spot in heaven, the story is a fabrication. The Jacksonville Sheriff’s office found no records of such a case. The story would have likely made headlines; but we found no coverage by local newspapers of the event, either.

Republican AG candidate misleads in attacking opponent over property taxes
","Complaining about corruption and high property taxes is the low-hanging fruit of election politics in Illinois, and Republican attorney general candidate Erika Harold hits on both in a recent ad targeting her Democratic opponent, state Sen. Kwame Raoul of Chicago. The TV spot starts off with Harold stating, ""In Illinois, politicians have turned corruption into an art form."" ""I’m Erika Harold and this scheme is one of the worst: Mike Madigan and Kwame Raoul team up to raise property taxes,"" she continues, as a picture of the Democratic House Speaker and Raoul flashes on-screen with text characterizing their collaboration as a ""scheme."" ""In Chicago, Madigan’s business does property tax appeals for the powerful,"" she goes on to say. ""Higher taxes, higher profits. And Kwame Raoul? His top donor gets massive tax breaks from the county, while you get higher taxes. I’m Erika Harold. As attorney general, I’ll make the politicians pay for their corruption—not you."" Harold’s ad contains a hodgepodge of accusations and innuendo, including that reference to Madigan’s property tax business to which Raoul has no connection. Yet it’s all framed around a central implication that Raoul and Madigan somehow participated in a corrupt ""scheme"" to line their pockets by hiking property taxes. That makes her statement about the two teaming up to raise property taxes much more provocative. So we decided to give it a closer look. Harold’s ad refers to a 2014 bill sponsored by Raoul in the Senate and Madigan in the House that sought to get two of Chicago’s ailing pension funds for city workers back on financial track. The measure was aimed at facilitating a plan of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s to reduce a multibillion-dollar pension shortfall by cutting city worker retirement benefits and requiring both workers and the city to increase contributions into the municipal and laborers’ pension funds. Then-Gov. Pat Quinn, as well as lawmakers from both parties, quickly objected to language in the bill Quinn said would ""gouge"" city property owners. Within days, Raoul, Madigan and Emanuel pulled that language. The watered-down bill eventually passed and was signed into law by Quinn, though it was later struck down as unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court. Harold campaign spokesman Aaron DeGroot acknowledged Raoul and Madigan carried the bill at Emanuel’s request and that they removed the property tax provision before its passage. Even so, DeGroot said the context was immaterial. ""The reason they all sought the property tax is irrelevant,"" DeGroot wrote in an email. ""We never claim property taxes were raised as a result of the legislation. We do say, though, that Raoul and Madigan endorsed a property tax increase. That is true. The additional context or final result does not make that fact any less true."" Without that context, however, Harold’s accusations amount to cleverly misleading wordplay. By stating that Raoul and Madigan teamed up ""to"" raise property taxes, she erroneously implies that raising taxes was the proposal’s central aim. What’s more, among those speaking in favor of the bill on the day it passed in the House was the chamber’s Republican leader, Jim Durkin. ""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he said, later adding ""I don’t want to see the city of Chicago fall in line with Detroit."" ""The sponsors were acting in response to the city’s request to change the state law,"" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago. ""Everybody recognized the city’s contributions were too low."" There’s another reason context is critical in making sense of Harold’s property-tax claim: the on-screen text reiterating that Raoul and Madigan’s proposal was a ""scheme"" right after she’d called it ""one of the worst"" in the sordid history of public corruption in Illinois. Framing the bill that way suggests Raoul used his public office for personal gain. There is no evidence for such a claim, and Harold’s campaign did not attempt to support it when we asked for proof. Instead, DeGroot argued Raoul is complicit in what he described as Illinois’ ""inherently corrupt"" property tax system, contending he’s not only supported property tax increases but has also ""been silent on reform."" As for the allegation about Raoul’s top donor benefitting from lucrative tax breaks, that was a reference to Neil Bluhm, chairman of Rivers Casino in Des Plaines as well as the finance chair of Raoul’s campaign. In making the charge, Harold’s ad cites a 2016 investigation by the Better Government Association that showed how Rivers had received lucrative property tax breaks after appeals filed with Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios. The article made no reference to Raoul, and DeGroot did not say the Democrat was involved with the Rivers tax break. ""We say Raoul’s top donor was the recipient of a million-dollar tax break,"" DeGroot wrote. ""Nothing more."" Harold says ""Mike Madigan and Kwame Raoul team up to raise property taxes."" Her statement contains an element of truth in that Raoul and Madigan did sponsor legislation in 2014 that initially contained a proposal from Emanuel for a new property tax levy for several ailing pension funds. But the tax component was not the primary aim of the bill, which also sought to shore up the funds by cutting city worker retirement benefits and requiring both workers and the city to put more money into them. That tax language didn’t even make it into the final version of the bill. Yet Harold’s claim spuriously suggests Raoul teamed up with Madigan for the express purpose of hiking taxes, leaving out all mitigating context.

Like insurers, Leah Vukmir opposed Wisconsin law forcing insurers to make oral chemo more affordable
","A TV ad by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin attacks Leah Vukmir, her Republican rival in the Nov. 6, 2018, election, over oral chemotherapy and insurance companies. The ad from the Wisconsin Democrat, unveiled Sept. 10, 2018, features a Manitowoc woman who says: I’m 44 and I just finished my last chemo for a brain tumor. It was oral chemo, the only chemo for my kind of cancer. So, I’m glad that Republicans and Democrats made the insurance companies in Wisconsin cover oral chemo. Who would say no to that? Leah Vukmir. She was just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies instead of the people. Leah Vukmir, you ought to be ashamed. At one point, a photo of Vukmir is shown with these words on the screen: ""Voted against oral chemotherapy."" The references are to votes by Vukmir, who is a state senator, on a bill that was later signed into law. Let’s see if Vukmir was ""just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies"" and ""voted against oral chemotherapy.""
  All our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. The law, signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker in April 2014, makes it easy for cancer patients to afford oral chemotherapy, such as the pills the woman in the ad took. It prohibits health insurance plans from charging higher copayments, deductibles or coinsurance for oral chemotherapy than they do for injected or intravenous chemotherapy. Before the law, health plans typically covered oral chemotherapy under prescription drug plans that could have high copays; for some health plans, those copays could run into many thousands of dollars. In contrast, chemotherapy administered at a hospital or clinic was covered as part of a health plan's standard medical coverage — with no additional cost to the patient after the deductible was reached. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Vukmir was one of two Republican senators to come out vocally against the bill and in support of insurers. She said at the time: ""I have a consistent record of opposing insurance mandates. A state mandate would only impact the insurance companies regulated by Wisconsin and not those regulated at the federal level, creating an uneven playing field and driving up costs for consumers."" The bill was opposed by the Wisconsin Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group, as well as another trade group, the Alliance of Health Insurers, and individual insurers. Insurers said the measure would drive up costs on insurance premiums and make it harder for employers and consumers to afford coverage. When the measure came to a vote in the Senate, Vukmir and GOP Sen. Paul Farrow cast the only no votes. The measure passed, 30-2. After changes were made to the bill in the Assembly, the Senate approved the bill again, 26-7. Vukmir again voted no because of her opposition to putting mandates on insurers; the other six senators said the changes weakened the bill. So, Vukmir was nearly alone in her opposition to an oral chemotherapy bill that was opposed by insurance companies. Her campaign told us that ""when government mandates price structures, providers eliminate coverage options and fewer people end up with quality care.""  But to be clear, her vote wasn’t against oral chemotherapy, per se. Rather, the law requires that insurers treat oral chemotherapy like traditional chemotherapy when it comes to how much patients must pay. Baldwin says Vukmir was ""just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies"" and ""voted against oral chemotherapy."" On the main vote on a chemotherapy bill, Vukmir aligned with insurance companies that opposed the bill and was one of two state senators to vote no. That said, Vukmir’s vote wasn’t against oral chemotherapy. It was against stopping insurers from charging patients higher deductibles, copayments or coinsurance for oral chemotherapy than they would pay for traditional chemotherapy. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/14/tammy-baldwin/insurers-leah-vukmir-opposed-wisconsin-law-forcing/

Apple offbeat in claim about ‘first’ EKG consumer product
","During the unveiling of the latest Apple watch in San Francisco this week, the company’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams made a claim that’s been described as ""alternative facts"" by another Silicon Valley CEO and called into question by recent news reports. Here’s what Williams said about the Apple Watch Series 4’s new built-in electrocardiogram feature, or ECG: ""This is the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers,"" he claimed at the Apple event on Sept. 12, 2018.  Williams makes his claim in the video above.  Electrocardiograms, also abbreviated as EKGs, are commonly used at hospitals to check a heart’s electrical activity, to test for poor blood flow or for a heart attack. Apple’s previous watches have included heart monitors for fitness tracking, but not for medical usage. Was Williams off-beat with his claim? We decided to check the facts. At PolitiFact we typically fact-check politicians. But we also investigate claims by media pundits from Rush Limbaugh to Joe Scarborough, along with athletes and celebrities, such as Colin Kaepernick, who wield a lot of political influence. In this case we fact-checked a California-based company that’s very influential with the goal of holding it accountable for what it says, too. Our research A spokesman for Apple declined to respond on-the-record. The company’s Apple Watch Series 4 starts at $399 and includes a model for $499. The product starts shipping later this month, though the electrocardiogram feature won’t be available until sometime later this year, according to news reports. The strongest push back against Williams’ statement comes from Vic Gundotra, CEO of Mountain View-based AliveCor. His company also produces over-the-counter ECG devices and has been doing so for several years. Specifically, it makes an FDA-cleared band for the Apple Watch, called KardiaBand, which sells for $199, as well as a version that attaches to a smartphone, called Kardia. CEO claims Apple used 'alternative facts' ""We were watching [the announcement], and we were surprised,"" Gundotra told Business Insider on Thursday. ""It was amazing, it was like us being on stage, with the thing we've been doing for 7 years,"" referring to AliveCor's product for detecting atrial fibrillation (AFib), a tough-to-spot heart disorder that manifests as an irregular, often quick heart rate that can cause poor circulation. ""Although when they said they were first to go over-the-counter, we were surprised,"" Gundotra continued. ""Apple doesn't like to admit they copy anyone, even in the smallest things. Their own version of alternative facts."" When we asked AliveCor about the issue, a spokesman provided a toned-down statement from Gundotra: ""Apple’s advances in cardiac monitoring validate the need for this mobile ECG technology -- a path which AliveCor paved with our Kardia products,"" the statement said. ""These still stand as the first and most clinically validated over-the-counter FDA-cleared consumer ECG devices.""  Apple unveiled its new Apple Watch Series 4 in San Francisco this week. Associated Press file photo.  Statement falls short? In addition to Gundotra’s comments, a New York Times report called out Williams’ claim. So did an article at TechCrunch.com: ""While Apple loves to be first to things, that statement is false. AliveCor has held the title of first since 2014 for its KardiaMobile device, a $100 stick-like metal unit you attach to the back of a smartphone."" The article links to a 2014 AliveCor press release announcing it had received federal over-the-counter clearance for the AliveCor Heart Monitor, a single-channel ECG recorder. Subtle difference? A CNBC article presents what it calls a subtle difference between AliveCor and Apple’s new product: It says: ""Once a consumer buys an AliveCor device, they take an EKG reading (via a smartphone attachment or their Apple Watch band), and wait until a doctor unlocks it within 24 hours to get an initial reading on the app. Apple designed its system differently. The FDA cleared the company to provide these readings to consumers right away, allowing users to share the results with a physician if they choose."" Turning back to AliveCor, the company’s website says a physician’s reading is necessary only for the first test of its product. ""Due to regulatory necessity, new U.S. accounts are required to have their first EKG reviewed by a U.S. board-certified cardiologist free of charge (a $19 value within the app). You will be blocked for up to 24 hours from EKG features until the review is complete (although it is often much faster)."" Our ruling Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said the new Apple Watch Series 4 ""is the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers."" That claim ignores the fact that start-up AliveCor has produced over-the-counter ECG devices for several years. The AliveCor device requires a cardiologist to review the first test, while that won’t be necessary for the Apple watch. This is a very subtle distinction and not enough to stand up Williams’ claim.

$1 billion Florida tax hike? Andrew Gillum proposes increasing state corporate tax
","A TV attack ad portrays Florida Democrat Andrew Gillum as so ""far out"" that he is on another planet. ""Gillum wants to increase Florida taxes by a billion dollars. Disaster for the economy,"" says an ad by the Republican Governors Association showing Gillum’s headshot floating in space. The 30-second ad also attacks Gillum over his support for Medicare for All and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But here, we’ll focus on whether Gillum wants to raise Florida taxes by $1 billion. He does, though the ad doesn’t make clear what taxes Gillum wants to raise, who would pay, and how Florida would spend the additional revenue. Gillum has proposed increasing Florida’s corporate tax rate from 5.5 percent to 7.75 percent to generate an additional $1 billion a year. His opponent, Republican Ron DeSantis, has signed a pledge not to raise taxes. Gillum said he would put that extra revenue toward education, including a minimum teacher salary of $50,000 and raising pay for veteran teachers to the national average. Gillum also plans to invest in early childhood education programs and vocational training. The state corporate tax currently generates about $2.5 billion a year. Most businesses, however, are exempt from paying any tax because the state exempts the first $50,000 in taxable income. Gillum’s campaign said he would keep that exemption to protect small businesses, but said he wants to close loopholes that allow other corporations to avoid paying taxes. Put simply, Gillum’s plan is to have Florida’s biggest corporations pay $1 billion more a year in taxes. That could affect average Floridians, experts told us. But it is difficult to put a dollar figure on it. Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at Florida TaxWatch, said that if a business is forced to pay more in taxes, it can raise prices, reduce employment, reduce costs or investment, or reduce profits.    ""Those outcomes would all potentially have negative impacts on residents,"" Wenner said. ""The magnitude of those impacts would be hard to quantify, especially factoring in any economic increase from increase government spending."" There’s also no way to guarantee that the full $1 billion would flow into the state’s revenues. Corporations could take legal tax planning measures to reduce their liability. That could make funding Gillum’s education priorities more challenging. At the same time, an increase in the tax rate could have negative impacts on corporations’ decisions about where to locate and whether to expand. Richard Auxier, research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said the cost of corporate taxes is shared among stockholders and, unintuitively, among a broader group of workers and investors. The Tax Policy Center assumes 80 percent of the burden is borne by investment returns (dividends, interest, capital gains, etc.), with the remaining 20 percent weighing on wages and other labor income. ""Would average Floridians pay some of a corporate tax hike (in the form of lower wages and/or higher prices)? Yes. Would they pay a lot? Nope,"" Auxier told PolitiFact. ""Would investors and managers (who are not all in Florida because multi-state companies pay the tax, too) pay a lot? Yup."" Randall G. Holcombe, a Florida State University economics professor, said that a higher tax would discourage business. ""Floridians who do not directly pay corporate income tax will still bear a cost of slower economic growth in Florida,"" he said. ""They may also pay higher prices if corporations are able to pass through that tax increase to customers, but the big cost will be slower economic growth."" The Republican Governors Association said that ""Gillum wants to increase Florida taxes by a billion dollars."" The ad leaves out the details that voters might want to know about Gillum’s proposal. Gillum proposes raising the corporate tax rate from 5.5 to 7.75 percent, generating about an extra $1 billion from Florida’s biggest corporations to put toward education. The tax wouldn’t directly target the average Floridian, but experts say at least some of the cost could trickle down. The claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/14/republican-governors-association/republican-ad-correct-andrew-gillum-wants-raise-fl/

No, congressional candidate Scott Wallace does not want to tax families for 'breeding'
","Scott Wallace’s family foundation has caused quite a few headaches for the multimillionaire, who is running for U.S. Congress in Pennsylvania’s 1st District. The GOP and conservative media outlets have used grants made by the Wallace Global Fund, which the candidate led for more than a decade, to paint the Democrat as anti-Israel and anti-police. Wallace will face Republican incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick in a recently redrawn district that includes Bucks County and left-leaning Philly suburbs. A number of stories published this summer by right-leaning outlets focused on grants the foundation made to so-called population control groups. Now, a particularly incendiary claim has made its way into a TV ad created by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The ad claims Wallace ""wants to tax families of five for ‘irresponsible breeding.’"" The NRCC released a similar web ad that states Wallace ""thinks families with more than two children should be ‘taxed to the hilt.’"" Does Wallace, who has three children, actually advocate for a multi-child tax?

When contacted for comment, NRCC Regional Press Secretary Chris Martin cited a Fox News article from July that reported on the Wallace Global Fund’s donations to groups that advocate limiting population growth. As Fox News reported, the Wallace Global Fund donated money to a group called Zero Population Growth — now known as Population Connection — between 1997 and 2003. From the article: The group, shortly after being founded in 1968, released a brochure advocating abortion to stabilize population growth and claimed that ""no responsible family should have more than two children."" To deal with larger families, it also called for families to be ""taxed to the hilt"" for ""irresponsible breeding."" According to Wallace’s spokesperson, Zoe Wilson-Meyer, the candidate inherited the foundation from his parents in late 2003, after the donations were made. While the foundation's 990 tax form for that year lists Wallace as ""president,"" internal meeting minutes show he was elected to that position in December 2013, according to Wallace Global Fund Executive Director Ellen Dorsey. Regardless of when Wallace took over his family’s foundation, it’s clear that he supports the aims of groups that seek to stabilize population growth through voluntary family planning. His father, the late Robert B. Wallace, was co-chairman of Population Action International, which advocates for increased access to birth control and other family planning methods. ""When my generation took over the foundation in 2002 after my parents had both passed away, we developed an increasing focus on the climate crisis, which has only reaffirmed the importance of our population work,"" Wallace wrote in an essay for the Universal Access Project. ""The population trajectory, combined with the inevitable aspirations of people in emerging economies to burn more fossil fuels and own more stuff – just like Americans! – is worse than unsustainable; it’s a pathway to disaster. And population growth won’t abate unless women have access to voluntary family planning, and girls are protected against coerced early marriage and childbearing."" Under Wallace’s leadership, the foundation gave grants to Population Action International as well as the Population Council and Worldwatch Institute. The grants were earmarked for purposes including eradicating female genital mutilation, ""research on population and the environment,"" and ""global reproductive health and rights,"" according to the foundation’s Form 990 tax documents. The NRCC’s Martin also pointed to an endorsement for Wallace by the Population Connection Action Fund, the political arm of the group that produced the 1968 brochure. This isn’t the first time the NRCC has tried to link candidates endorsed by the fund to the brochure’s content. As The Morning Call reported, Martin emailed reporters about the organization’s endorsement of Democrat Susan Wild in Pennsylvania’s 7th District: ""Out of curiosity, how many children does Susan Wild think families should be able to have before they’re taxed to the hilt?"" Brian Dixon, a spokesperson for the Population Connection Action Fund, told the paper, ""We do not advocate for increasing taxes on parents of any size family. We believe that parents should have exactly the number of children that they want."" Dixon reiterated that statement when contacted by PolitiFact Pennsylvania, adding that he has never seen the 1968 brochure. ""Even if it exists, it was written 50 years ago,"" Dixon said. ""The world has changed a lot since."" Wallace's campaign spokesperson said he does not personally advocate for a multi-child tax, and PolitiFact Pennsylvania was unable to locate any public records to contradict that statement. When Scott Wallace held the reins, the candidate's family foundation awarded grants to nonprofits that advocate for family planning in order to limit population growth worldwide. An NRCC ad attempts to link Wallace to statements made in a 50-year-old brochure produced by a group his family foundation gave money to between 1997 and 2003. But Wallace has never personally called for the taxation of people with more than two children or accused them of ""irresponsible breeding.""

Conspiracy website objects to Barack Obama calling out conspiracy theories
","Shocker! A conspiracy-minded website is appalled that former President Barack Obama dismissed a conspiracy theory.

(And by the way, Obama gave the speech in question a day earlier, in Illinois. He made no mention of Benghazi or conspiracies in Anaheim.) Obama was decrying what he saw had happened to the Republican Party, how, as he put it, the GOP had become home to ""the politics of division, of resentment and paranoia."" Obama gave his list of measures a Republican Congress had championed. ""Handed out tax cuts without regard to deficits,"" he said. ""Slashed the safety net wherever it could. Cast dozens of votes to take away health insurance from ordinary Americans. Embraced wild conspiracy theories, like those surrounding Benghazi, or my birth certificate."" Note, he spoke of conspiracy theories surrounding Benghazi, not that the deaths that took place were themselves a conspiracy theory. After eight congressional investigations and a report by a review board, the broad finding was that the State Department failed to adequately address security concerns in Libya or could have done more to prevent the attack. But if they found bad bureaucratic decisions, none found bad intent. That didn’t give American Viral Patriot any pause.

PAC backing Ted Cruz falsely says Beto O'Rourke voted against body armor for border sheriffs
","A super PAC backing the re-election of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas portrays Democratic nominee Beto O’Rourke, who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, as careless about border security. A TV ad from the Texans Are PAC that we spotted on Austin’s Fox 7 Sept. 12, 2018, associates O’Rourke, who opposes the border-long wall sought by Republicans led by President Donald Trump, with taxpayer-funded benefits for immigrants and ""sanctuary cities,"" a term that usually refers to communities that deter local law officers from asking individuals to share their immigration status. The ad’s narrator follows up the mention of O’Rourke’s support for sanctuary cities by saying, about O’Rourke, ""while voting against border armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border."" The ad also shows these words on screen: ""No body armor for Texas sheriffs."" A 2014 House vote Fine print below the ad’s mention of sheriffs and body armor helped us start our factual review. It said the claim about denying body armor to border sheriffs ties to an O’Rourke vote in June 2014 on the ""Grayson Amendment."" Separately, we noticed, Cruz’s campaign posted a press release in May 2018 mentioning the June 19, 2014, vote on the amendment. In that House-posted vote, O’Rourke was among 62 members (counting 43 Democrats) to vote for the amendment from then-Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, which was rejected by 355 members (including 145 Democrats). Cruz’s release said ""O’Rourke voted in favor of a bill that would prevent funding for the Defense Department’s Excess Personal Property Program."" The release said the program had provided law enforcement in the El Paso area with more than $9 million in equipment, including 156 units of body armor for the sheriff’s office; 90 night vision units for the local border patrol; helicopters for the city police and border patrol; and other items such as trauma gear, fencing and generators. According to the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the program, more than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate. ""Law enforcement agencies use the equipment in a variety of ways,"" the agency says. ""For instance, four-wheel drive vehicles are used to interrupt drug harvesting, haul away marijuana, patrol streets and conduct surveillance.  The 1033 Program also helps with the agencies’ general equipment needs, such as file cabinets, copiers and fax machines that they need but perhaps are unable to afford."" Our web search for more information about the roll-call vote cited in the Texans Are ad led us to the text of Grayson’s failed amendment to the Defense Department’s appropriations act. That text forbade expenditures toward aircraft, tanks and weaponry provided from the personal property program to local law enforcement--but it made no mention of body armor. Let’s get specific: Grayson’s amendment said that no funds made available by the act ""may be used to transfer aircraft (including unmanned aerial vehicles), armored vehicles, grenade launchers, silencers, toxicological agents (including chemical agents, biological agents, and associated equipment), launch vehicles, guided missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, mines, or nuclear weapons (as identified for demilitarization purposes outlined in Department of Defense Manual 4160.28) through the"" personal property program. Via the C-SPAN video archive, we watched Grayson present his proposal, which he said would restrict the Defense Department from militarizing community police agencies. Military weapons, he said, ""have no place in our streets regardless of who may be deploying them.""  Two Republican members spoke in opposition before Grayson’s proposal was rejected. ""We welcome this equipment; it’s not misused,"" Rep. Rodney Frelilnghuysen, R-N.J., said. Texans Are leader notes another House vote After we’d scoured the cited amendment, Jason Johnson, who runs the PAC, told us by email that the proposed restriction indeed extended to denying body armor to border sheriffs. He didn’t say how. After we published this fact-check, we learned from the DLA that it stopped providing body armor to local jurisdictions years before the O'Rourke vote on Grayson's amendment. Spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill advised by email that the program ""stopped providing body armor in 2008.  When DLA Disposition Services receives excess body armor from the military services, it is destroyed. What we do provide,"" McCaskill wrote, ""are tactical vests but without the body armor inserted in them. Law enforcement can purchase body armor with their own funds or with federal grant money."" Earlier, Johnson also told us that in June 2014, O’Rourke voted against an amendment to the 2016 Defense Authorization Act successfully offered by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, ""that included border security activities on the list of preferred applications the Defense Department should consider when transferring excess property to other federal agencies."" We turned to the Congressional Record transcript of that debate to learn that for the purposes of border security, McCaul’s amendment placed the Department of Homeland Security on equal footing with other law-enforcement agencies in access to Defense Department excess equipment. The transcript shows that neither the amendment nor House floor debate touched on body armor for border sheriffs. O’Rourke spoke in opposition to McCaul's amendment, it further shows, by saying DHS already had access to such equipment which, he said, wasn’t needed on the border anyway. O’Rourke said we ""do not need to militarize the border"" and he said the amendment creates ""further anxiety and fear about the border at a time that is not warranted,"" according to the transcript. The transcript shows O’Rourke ultimately requested a record (rather than voice) vote on the amendment. In that roll call vote, O’Rourke was among 162 Democrats and four Republicans voting ""no"" while McCaul was among 235 Republicans plus 18 Democrats voting ""aye."" Our ruling Texans Are said O’Rourke voted against providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border. In 2014, O’Rourke voted in favor of barring the Defense Department from providing excess aircraft, tanks and military weaponry to local law agencies in general. However, the proposed restriction did not extend to body armor and made no mention of border sheriffs. Contrary to the ad's claim, there was no up-or-down vote on providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 10:07 a.m., Sept. 21, 2018: We revised this story to add the DLA's advisory that it had stopped providing body armor to local law enforcement agencies years before the House vote singled out by Texans Are. This addition didn't affect our rating of the claim.",/factchecks/2018/sep/13/texans-are/pac-backing-ted-cruz-falsely-says-beto-orourke-vot/

McCaskill's right: Hawley's lawsuit would end Affordable Care Act protections
","A major talking point in Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill's re-election campaign has been a pending lawsuit by her opponent, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, to repeal parts of former President Barack Obama's health care law — the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ""Josh Hawley decided to use your taxpayer dollars to file a lawsuit that would take away important prescription drug coverage for seniors through Medicare and end all of the consumer protections under the ACA,"" she wrote in an op-edfor the Springfield News-Leader on Aug. 23. We're wary of words so absolute as ""all."" We wanted to know whether McCaskill was overstating the effects of Hawley's lawsuit. A 2012 lawsuit to repeal the health care act failed at the Supreme Court because the law had a tax included in its pre-existing conditions mandate as a penalty for not maintaining health coverage. The Supreme Court found that Congress had the power to tax given to them under the Constitution. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in 2017, Congress left the mandate in place but reduced the tax to zero. The lawsuit Hawley signed on to, alongside 17 other Republican attorneys general and two GOP governors, argues that ""once the heart of the ACA — the individual mandate — is declared unconstitutional, the remainder of the ACA must also fall,"" and asks a judge to order an injunction on all Affordable Care Act activity, essentially repealing the entire thing. The results depend on whether the states in the lawsuit can prove that the mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the health care law is so tied up with the mandate that it should go, too. If the lawsuit can prove either or both, insurance companies can go back to pre-Affordable Care Act standards of determining health coverage with pre-existing conditions. ""Sen. McCaskill is correct,"" said Nicholas Bagley, law professor at the University of Michigan Law School. ""The states that brought the Texas lawsuit have asked the court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act — lock, stock and barrel."" No consumer protections in the individual health market stipulated under the act would remain because the whole law would be gone. However, consumer protections listed under Medicare and Medicaid would still exist as they are social insurance programs, which means federal or state governments are required by law to guarantee health care to those who fit certain requirements such as old age, unemployment or disabilities. As consumers, those who qualify can't be denied service or have their eligibility or benefits restricted unless Congress were to pass new legislation redefining what is considered a medical necessity. Before the health care act, many Medicare recipients dealt with a ""doughnut hole"" in their drug coverage. This meant that once a person's spending reached a certain amount, a coverage gap began where they were responsible for 100 percent of the cost for future drugs. The act shrunk that percentage. For example, in 2018, if someone spent over $3,750 on prescription drugs, he or she would then pay up to 35 percent for covered prescriptions. Starting in 2019, Medicare enrollees will pay just 25 percent of the cost for name-brand prescriptions after reaching the coverage gap. The senior prescription drug coverage would not be completely repealed with the health care act, as it was the result of former President George W. Bush's Medicare Modernization Act in 2003. Only the monetary limit some Medicare recipients experience could widen. McCaskill said that Josh Hawley's lawsuit ""would take away important prescription drug coverage for seniors through Medicare and end all of the consumer protections under the ACA."" McCaskill's claims about the lawsuit have a ring of truth — Hawley's lawsuit would repeal the entire health care act and hence all of its consumer protections, including those for the doughnut hole. The Republican Congress has not passed any substitute health care plan to replace the act, so it is unclear if Hawley and his fellow Republican attorneys general would have a new system in place with consumer protections like those under the Affordable Care Act.

The Huntington District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created the lake in the 1960s.   Justice’s tweet links to an article on wvtourism.com, published by the West Virginia Tourism Office, an agency of the West Virginia Department of Commerce. The article describes the lake as great for swimming, boating, and underwater exploration. The destination has dive sites where rock formations can be seen 100 feet underwater. However, the WV Tourism article did not offer a specific source for the claim. We contacted the office, and they did not respond. When we reached out to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Huntington District, Toby Wood, project manager for Summersville Lake, said that the label ""The Little Bahamas of the East"" originated with a SCUBA magazine. ""We consider that a claim-to-fame, and we repeat it often,"" Wood said.

More broadly, however, Wood has ""no way of knowing if the lake is the ‘the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River,’ as the governor claimed."" We reached out to Peter Oliver, editor-in-chief of the National Association of Underwater Instructors’ magazine, Sources, and he said that from his experience, Summersville Lake has the same color as most lakes and reservoirs. ""You’d be OK, I think, to call Summersville ‘one of the clearest,’ but it has that green tint common to almost all freshwater lakes and reservoirs. The water in the Florida spring systems is what we usually call ‘gin clear’ and since the water does not stand in the small lakes but flows out it stays clear,"" Oliver said. Meanwhile, Christine McCrehin of the American Water Resources Association told PolitiFact that ""her organization does not track the information about the clarity of lakes."" Justice tweeted, ""According to SCUBA divers, Summersville Lake is the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River."" This facts on this claim are more opaque than the governor lets on. There’s no question that Summersville Lake attracts divers who appreciate its clear waters, and there is evidence that it has long been called ""the Little Bahamas of the East."" Justice’s tweet went beyond that, saying specifically that the lake is the clearest in the eastern United States.

Did Joe Manchin stick with Hillary Clinton after controversial coal comment?
","Appearing at a rally with President Donald Trump in Charleston, W.Va., Patrick Morrisey -- the Republican challenger to Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin -- riled up the crowd by invoking a particularly embarrassing remark by Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential nominee of Manchin’s party. ""Joe Manchin strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after she said, ‘We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work,’"" Morrisey told the crowd after Trump turned over the podium on Aug. 21, 2018. Morrissey's statement has a basis in truth, but it glosses over some context. (We're not addressing the portion of Morrisey's remark about how Manchin voted, since ballots are cast privately, making it impossible for us to verify independently.) On March 13, 2016, as she was running for president, Clinton appeared at a televised town hall in Columbus, Ohio. At one point during the event, Clinton said, ""I’m the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity — using clean, renewable energy as the key — into coal country. Because we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" She continued, ""And we're going to make it clear that we don't want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on."" While the latter portion of her comments communicated empathy for coal-mining families, her remark that ""were going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"" drew intense criticism, not only from Americans in coal country but also with her allies, who said Clinton’s phrasing seemed to trivialize the seriousness of coal workers’ economic dilemma. So how did this episode affect Manchin’s support for Clinton? Let’s review. Manchin and Clinton had known each other for years, and he endorsed her on CBS’s Face the Nation on April 19, 2015. ""I support Hillary Clinton. I know Hillary Clinton, and I find her to be warm and engaging, compassionate and tough. All of the above, "" Manchin said. After the town hall remark, MetroNews reported that a senior advisor to Manchin was ""troubled and concerned by the comments and reached out directly to the Secretary and her senior advisor for energy."" In June 2018, Manchin told Politico that he repeatedly threatened to revoke his support for Clinton after her remark. ""First, Manchin told Bill Clinton that he would withdraw his support, as the former president pleaded with him not to,"" Politico reported, ""Then Hillary Clinton called him. ‘She said, ‘Please don’t. Let me come to West Virginia, I need to explain.’ I said, ‘That’s a bad idea, you shouldn’t come,’"" Manchin recounted. But the two sides reconciled, and on March 15 -- two days after the town hall -- Clinton formally reacted to the fallout from her remark, sending a letter to Manchin. ""Simply put, I was mistaken in my remarks,"" she wrote. ""I wanted to make the point that, as you know too well, while coal will be part of the energy mix for years to come, both in the U.S. and around the world, we have already seen a long-term decline in American coal jobs and a recent wave of bankruptcies as a result of a changing energy market — and we need to do more to support the workers and families facing these challenges."" She also said in the letter that she supported the Miners Protection Act backed by Manchin, which would provide health benefits and pensions for former miners and family members. ""I pledge to you that I will focus my team and my Administration on bringing jobs to Appalachia, especially jobs producing the carbon capture technology we need for the future,"" Clinton wrote. About six weeks later, on May 2, Clinton came to West Virginia for a roundtable at the Williamson Health and Wellness Center. At that event, she talked with Manchin and a former coal miner, Bo Copley. ""I don't know how to explain it, other than what I said was totally out of context from what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time and I did put out a plan last summer,"" Clinton said. ""It was a misstatement, because what I was saying is that the way things are going now we are going to continue to lose jobs. What I said was that is going to happen unless we take action to try to help and prevent it."" At the roundtable, Manchin also expressed his discomfort with Clinton’s initial statement. ""I have two ways to go when that statement came out,"" Manchin said. ""I could have said, 'I thought she was my friend, by golly I'm done, I'm gone.' Now that's not the way we were raised, I wasn't raised that way. So, I said I'm going to call"" her instead. He added, ""If I thought that was in her heart, if I thought she wanted to eliminate one job in West Virginia, I wouldn’t be sitting here, and she wouldn’t be sitting here if she felt that way."". Manchin’s office did not respond to an inquiry, but CNN reported on June 17, 2016, that Manchin remained one of the Democratic Senators who were ""backing"" Clinton for president. And in the 2018 Politico interview, Manchin called his decision to stick by Clinton ""a mistake. It was a mistake politically."" But the article added that to Manchin, ""her $20 billion commitment to his state was too much to pass up. ‘Is this about me? Or trying to help a part of my state that’s never recovered and is having a tough time?’"" Morrisey said Manchin ""strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after she said, ‘We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work.’"" It’s worth noting some of the context that Morrisey left out -- that Clinton had also expressed empathy for coal miners’ economic challenges in her initial remark, that she later clarified what she had meant to say, and that Manchin had worked to convince Clinton of why her remarks had been unacceptable. Still, none of that changes the gist of Morrisey’s assertion -- that Clinton said the remark, and that Manchin remained in her camp through the election (while we know he endorsed her, we do not know for sure he voted for her, as ballots are secret). We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/sep/13/patrick-morrisey/did-joe-manchin-stick-hillary-clinton-after-contro/

Despite Steve Chabot's claim, Aftab Pureval didn't have a deficit
","When you want a job promotion, it helps to demonstrate success in your current position. Aftab Pureval wants voters to promote him to Congress. To get that job, he’d have to oust an incumbent in Ohio’s 1st Congressional District, which includes parts of Cincinnati. Does he deserve the job? Not at all, says the incumbent, Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot. As proof, Chabot cites a ""projected $400,000 deficit"" in Pureval’s current office as the Hamilton County, Ohio, clerk of courts. It was the first deficit projection in years, Chabot’s campaign says, showing that the challenger can’t even handle his current job. Pureval disputes the claim. But his denial prompted a counterclaim in a Chabot ad that started airing Sept. 6. In the ad, an announcer says, ""Aftab’s lying about his office’s $400,000 projected deficit."" Was there a projected deficit? If it was projected, did the numbers come in as expected? Was the clerk of courts responsible for this gap? And did Chabot characterize the budget accurately? The answers offer a look into the budget complexities of Ohio county government, and the perils of shoehorning an attack into a 30-second TV ad. The clerk of court manages a lot of the administrative functions of local courts, including collection of fines and fees. That’s the revenue side, and frankly, it’s largely dependent on the people who owe fines and not the business acumen of the clerk. The clerk has a staff to pay and administrative office expenses that require money. That’s the expense side. The clerk’s office has historically taken in more money than needed to cover its expenses, so it has turned over the surplus to help the county take care of other needs. But a set of Hamilton County general fund budget projections for 2018 showed a recorded shortfall of more than $500,000: $12.023 million in projected revenue but $12.532 million in expenses. That was according to Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Alluotto’s budget recommendation to county commissioners presented on Oct. 16, 2017. Those projections were the basis for Chabot’s claim. Considering previous surpluses in the clerk’s office and Pureval’s time in the office so far, two years, ""I think it’s mismanagement of the office,"" Cody Rizzuto, Chabot’s campaign spokesman, told PolitiFact. In two years, he said, Pureval has ""turned it into a deficit operation."" Pureval’s campaign say there will be no deficit. It forwarded a memo from Rene Cheatham, the chief financial officer in the clerk’s office, to Pureval saying as much. The Sept. 6 memo said, ""After discussions with Hamilton County’s budget and finance departments, we have revised projections"" for the general fund. Now the clerk’s projected revenue for the fund is $12.67 million. The projected expenditures are now $12.47 million, the memo says. Viewed this way, the numbers show a surplus. ""As confirmed by Hamilton County, there is no projected deficit for the Clerk’s office,"" Cheatham, who works for Puerval, wrote in a memo. Pureval campaign manager Sarah Topy added in an email to PolitiFact: ""Let me be absolutely clear that there is no deficit at the Clerk's office -- there never was and there never has been. The Cincinnati Enquirer even wrote a correction that made that point and that also pointed out (correctly) that Aftab Pureval has nothing to do with the revenue generation from the courts."" The newspaper’s correction was a result of a July 7 guest column that said Pureval ""inherited a clerk's office that had been operating with multi-million dollar surpluses for at least 10 years. In just over a year, he has turned those surpluses into a roughly half-million dollar deficit."" The correction, an unusual five paragraphs, said Pureval is projected to be under budget in 2018, ""which is a savings to taxpayers."" How can these figures and interpretations differ so dramatically? Cheatham and other county officials walked us through it, but we also found it in quarterly county budget documents and other records. Two reasons explain the difference. First, money coming into Pureval’s office has little to do with how he operates, because it ""is all driven by fees and fines,"" Budget Director John P. Bruggen told us. ""It’s stuff that has nothing to do with the day-to-day operation of the clerk’s office."" Second, the general fund -- the one that Chabot said shows Pureval had a projected deficit and was ""lying"" about it -- is not the entirety of the clerk’s budget. It is the major part, and it is called the ""general fund"" because it is integrated into the county’s overall budget or general fund, available for transfers in and out of other departments as county budget officials deem necessary if it shows a surplus. But the clerk also has a so-called restricted fund, with money coming from auto-title transfer fees. The clerk operates title offices to collect these fees. Under Ohio law, this money need not be transferred to the general fund, although typically money not needed for operating the title operations is. In 2017, for example, the clerk's office transferred $1.7 million from this restricted fund to the general fund, therefore boosting the clerk’s overall general-fund balance and helping pay for other county needs. This year was going to be different, and that’s why it looked like the clerk’s general fund was going into the red. Pureval wanted to use more of the auto title fund in the short term to ""drive more revenue"" for the long term by boosting auto titling and other business, especially for customers outside of the downtown area, Cheatham said. A number of auto dealers have showrooms in exurban areas bordering other counties, and if those dealerships find it more convenient to transfer titles in those other counties, Hamilton County doesn’t get the fee, Cheatham said. So for 2018, the clerk’s office planned to transfer only $700,000 from this restricted fund to the general fund, and to spend more of the restricted fund on such things as expanded hours, Saturday operations and passport processing. The office has been talking about adding new locations. In the long run, the thinking was, the expansion would more than pay for itself. That’s a big reason the clerk’s general fund showed a gap. This was confirmed in county budget documents. The documents for 2018 said the clerk’s auto title fund was ""anticipating an increase in total balance by year end."" This would mean, the county documents said, ""a decrease in the General Fund transfer by $1 million."" Those plans changed, however. Instead of planning to transfer $700,000 from the restricted fund to the general fund this year, Pureval’s office this summer decided to transfer an additional $700,000, for a total of $1.4 million. The expansion of hours, new services and title offices is ongoing, Cheatham said, but it is occuring in a way that allows for a bigger transfer to the county this year. Doing so makes strategic sense, he said. But it also changed projections for the general fund, removing what Chabot called a ""deficit."" This decision was discussed internally in July and formally made in August.  It is true that in earlier Hamilton County budget updates, issued in April and July, the clerk's general fund still showed a projected gap. And Chabot’s campaign noticed that a public announcement and memo from Pureval's office -- an announcement with updated general fund figures and the statement that there is no deficit -- was only issued on Sept. 6, right as Chabot was making his campaign claim. Pureval’s timing was suspicious, Chabot’s campaign said. ""He’s just fiddling with numbers to protect against a political attack,"" said Rizzuto. Rizzuto called it ""absolute corruption"" for a county official running for Congress to make a decision involving county funds when attacked, considering ""he could have done this six months ago."" Furthermore, Rizzuto said, the county commissioners will have to approve any such transfer at the end of the year, and there’s no guarantee they will. But there's something Chabot's campaign apparently missed: The decision to make the transfer from the auto title fund, as well as the necesessary legal approval from Hamiton County commissioners, all had been made earlier. PolitiFact had to do some digging and request internal records in order to confirm this, but those records show that the clerk's office sent a transmittal form to the county auditor's office in order to initiate the transfer on Aug. 2. The county commissioners, a board on which Chabot once served, then approved the transfer at their public meeting on Aug. 29. Jacqueline Panioto, the clerk for the board of county commissioners, confirmed this and pointed us to the board meeting's minutes where it was recorded. Each of these actions -- the discussions to make the transfer and the approval for the transfer -- occurred before Chabot made his claim. Steve Chabot says Aftab Pureval’s is ""lying"" about his office’s ""$400,000 projected deficit."" If you’ve read this far, you no doubt understand this is a tricky claim. Some budget documents showed the Hamilton County clerk of courts office with a projected shortfall of actually more than $500,000, but the county’s budget director said the deficit was really only on paper. It was also a temporary projection. As explained above, Pureval's office -- in agreement with other offices including the county commissioners' -- had wiped out the projected general fund gap well before Chabot made his ad. It’s complex stuff. But Chabot is a congressman and a former Hamilton County commissioner. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2018/sep/13/steve-chabot/despite-steve-chabots-claim-aftab-pureval-didnt-ha/

Puerto Rico's power grid was weak, not dead, before hurricanes
","As Hurricane Florence approached, President Donald Trump relied on his track record to assure the public his administration is ready. ""I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,"" Trump told reporters on Sept. 11. Puerto Rico recovered full power in August, 11 months after Hurricane Maria. Trump attributed the struggle to the territory’s floundering power system. ""Puerto Rico got hit not with one hurricane but with two (hurricanes),"" Trump said. ""And the problem with Puerto Rico is their electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely — you know, it was largely closed."" ""And when the storm hit, they had no electricity — essentially before the storm,"" Trump said. ""And when the storm hit, that took it out entirely."" Was the power system dead on arrival? Trump is exaggerating. The White House pointed to the power grid’s state of disrepair. First, there’s a difference between the electric grid and generating plants. Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it. Jorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified two reasons. One is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico’s recently created Energy Commission. One of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt. Trump was right in saying it was in very bad shape. But it wasn’t dead or closed. Before the hurricanes hit, all customers were being serviced, according to James Gallagher, executive director of New York State Smart Grid Consortium, which is working to stabilize Puerto Rico’s grid. About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma. But coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in a three-day blackout. The consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics estimated that on average, customers face a power outage every three months. ""PREPA was in bankruptcy,"" Carmacho said. ""That’s true. But were they pushing electrons to people so they could turn on the lights? Yes. Was it reliable? No. it hasn’t been reliable in 20 years. We might have an outage every three days. That has been the norm."" The bulk of Puerto Rico’s generating plants are located in the southern part of the island, while consumption is mostly in the north. The complex system that transfers energy from one side to the other forms its Achilles heel during climate disasters like this one, according to Marla Perez Lugo, a sociologist at the University of Puerto Rico focusing on energy policy. Unlike in the United States, where an outage in Ohio can be fixed by connecting to the grid in Illinois, an island electric system relies on reserves, on which Puerto Rico falls short, according to Carmacho. Trump said ""Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed."" Some electric generating plants, not the majority, were inoperative before the storm hit due to maintenance work. The grid was servicing all customers but had important vulnerabilities. Trump's statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.   Correction Sept. 13, 2018: PREPA, the Puerto Rico government utilities program, has debts totaling $9 billion. An earlier version of this story included a different number.",/factchecks/2018/sep/13/donald-trump/puerto-ricos-power-grid-was-weak-not-dead-hurrican/

Yes, $10 million were transferred from FEMA to ICE
","As a major hurricane heads toward the Carolinas, Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley berated the Trump administration for diverting nearly $10 million from emergency funding to immigration enforcement. ""As #HurricaneFlorence bears down, I discovered today that the Trump Administration is taking money away from @FEMA so that they can pay to put more asylum seekers in detention centers. This is a scandal,"" Merkley of Oregon tweeted on Sept. 11. (FEMA is an acronym for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.) Merkley appeared on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show on Sept. 11 and said he obtained documents about the transfer due to his work in ""trying to stop the child separations."" Merkley has been a vocal opponent of the government’s ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy that led to the separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents as they entered the United States illegally or at ports of entries. Many of them came seeking asylum. Parents separated from their children were sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers, and their children were sent to the care of another federal agency. ""Just as hurricane season is starting, it generally starts June 1st, the administration is working hard to find funds for additional detention camps. … In fact, $10 million comes out of FEMA,"" Merkley told Maddow. Is Merkley right that the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE? The transfer did happen. But the administration contends that appropriations limitations prevented the money from being used for hurricane response. One budget watchdog described the administration’s argument as ""disingenuous at best."" Merkley’s claim stems from a fiscal year 2018 ""transfer and reprogramming notifications"" document from the the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. That department oversees both FEMA and ICE. The document shows that more than $200 million went to ICE from other DHS agencies, and that the money would be used to pay for detention beds and for flights for deported immigrants. ICE got $9.8 million from FEMA’s Operations and Support account. (The transfer was less than 1 percent of that account’s budget). Some of the funds transferred had been labeled for ""Response and Recovery - Recovery""; ""Mitigation""; ""Response and Recovery - Response""; and ""Preparedness and Protection."" Due to the transfer, FEMA would curtail training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and investments related to a program to streamline grants’ management, the DHS document said. DHS press secretary Tyler Q. Houlton pushed back on Merkley’s assessment that the administration was using emergency money for immigration purposes. ""Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster,"" Houlton tweeted on Sept. 11. Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster. The transferred money ""is not coming out of the disaster relief fund, it has no impact on our efforts to be prepared for Hurricane Florence,"" FEMA’s administrator Brock Long told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on Sept. 12. Merkley did not say in his tweet or MSNBC interview that the funds came from the disaster relief fund, he broadly said FEMA. Under law, a series of steps typically take place before the federal government taps into FEMA’s disaster relief fund. (Check out our story on how the United States funds disaster recovery.) The administration’s claim that the funds ""couldn’t be used for disaster-related activities is disingenuous at best,"" said Steve Ellis, executive vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense. Ellis pointed to FEMA’s budget request for fiscal year 2019. That request described FEMA’s Mitigation program (some of its 2018 funds were transferred to ICE) as one whose efforts ""help create safer communities, enable people to recover more rapidly from disasters while relieving financial impacts."" Under the Response and Recovery program (funds from here were also transferred to ICE), the mission of the Response unit is to ""conduct emergency operations to save lives and property by: positioning emergency equipment, personnel and supplies; evacuating survivors; providing food, water, shelter, and medical care to those in need; and restoring critical public services,"" the budget request said. Some transferred funds also came from ""Mission Support"" — which funds FEMA headquarters activities. Merkley said the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE. DHS, which oversees FEMA and ICE, did transfer nearly $10 million from FEMA to ICE. The immigration agency got the funds to pay for detention beds and for the transportation of immigrants ordered deported. A transfer document shows that some of the FEMA money had been marked for response and recovery, mitigation, preparedness and protection. Officials argued that the money didn’t come from the disaster relief fund, but Merkley didn’t say it did, he only said it came from FEMA.
