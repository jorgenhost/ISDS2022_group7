Bynum-Coleman mostly right about racial disparity in drug arrests and imprisonment
","Democrat Sheila Bynum-Coleman faces a daunting task this fall running against Speaker Kirk Cox in the newly-drawn 66th House District containing a portion of Chesterfield County. Criminal justice reform ranks high among her priorities.  ""People of every race use illegal drugs at similar rates, yet African Americans are far more likely to be imprisoned than whites,"" she says on her campaign website. ""African Americans are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes and nine times more likely to be imprisoned."" We wondered whether her statistics are correct. Bynum-Coleman told us on July 26 that they were posted by a campaign worker and she didn’t know their sources. She said she’d call us back with more information, but we didn’t hear from her. We reached her again on Aug. 2 and she said she’d call us back. That call hasn’t come as of this writing. So, we took off on our own. Drug use and arrests Bynum-Coleman may have been referring to data in a 2014 National Research Council report on ""Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences."" Pages 60 and 61 focus on drug crimes. The study has not been updated. The report says, ""The prevalence of drug use is only slightly higher among blacks than whites for some illicit drugs and slightly lower for others; the difference is not substantial. There is also little evidence, when all drug types are considered, that blacks sell drugs more often than whites."" That agrees with data from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. It found 11.8 percent of whites and 13.7 percent of blacks 18 or older said they had used illicit drugs during the past month. The National Research Council report says, ""In recent years, drug-related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites. In the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites.""   Imprisonment Bynum-Coleman also cited statistics about the racial rates of imprisonment for drug crimes. Those numbers are harder to find. On similar fact checks, PolitiFact has turned to Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst for The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group in Washington. She’s pointed to racial breakdowns by the Bureau of Justice Statistics on the number of people in prisons for drug offenses. Those numbers aren't perfect for our comparison. For example, the state prison data only lists inmates based on their most serious offense, so someone also convicted of a drug crime may not be listed in that category if that person was given a longer sentence for assault. We compared the bureau’s newest data to estimated racial populations by the U.S. Census Bureau and found the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses near the end of 2016 was 6.45 times higher than the rate of whites. That’s close to an assertion on the NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet that ""the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost six times that of whites."" The statistic is undated and unsourced. In Virginia, blacks were imprisoned for drug offenses at about 6.1 times the rate of whites at the start of 2019. That’s according to a racial breakdown of prisoners whose most serious crime was drug-related, sent to us by the state Department of Corrections, compared to census population estimates. Our ruling Bynum-Coleman says, ""African Americans are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and nine times more likely to be imprisoned."" She hasn’t provided sources for the statement. She’s on the mark in saying blacks are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug offenses.That matches findings in a 2014 study by the National Research Council that hasn’t been updated. Clearly, there’s a huge imbalance in black and white imprisonment rates for drug offenses, but not as big the nine times greater for blacks claimed by Bynum-Coleman. Our research shows it was 6.45 times greater in 2016 - the latest year necessary statistics are available. In Virginia, it was 6.1 times higher for blacks at the start of 2019. Overall, we rate her claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2019/aug/06/sheila-bynum-coleman/bynum-coleman-mostly-right-about-racial-disparity-/

After mass shootings, Donald Trump says prosecutions for firearm offenses hit record in 2018
","After weekend mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton left more than 31 people dead, President Donald Trump gave a speech at the White House blaming mental illness and hatred for the attacks. Trump offered few specifics related to potential gun legislation he would support, although he left open the door when he said he was ""ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference."" Trump briefly spoke about what the federal government has already done to crack down on guns. ""Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses, but there is so much more that we have to do,"" he said Aug 5. Is that true? Let’s find out.  Trump was citing data from the U.S. Department of Justice, which tracks federal prosecutions of firearm offenses. In October 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it had ""smashed records"" by charging more than 15,300 defendants with federal firearms offenses, 17 percent more than the previous record. The press release from the Justice Department didn’t cite the year or number for the previous record, and we were unable to reach a Justice spokesperson by deadline.  However, annual statistics from the Justice Department show criminal cases in which defendants were charged under a couple of key firearm statutes. That data shows there were 13,062 defendants charged in fiscal year 2005, the record since 2000. The Justice Department’s figure of 15,300 for 2018 represents a 17 percent increase compared to 2005.  Another source of data that is commonly cited is from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University, which compiles data through records requests from the federal government. One way Syracuse crunches the numbers is by isolating on the primary charge, versus a secondary charge. Looking at it that way, researchers at Syracuse show that prosecutions were slightly higher in 2003-05 than in 2018. The analysis also shows that federal firearm prosecutions started to rise in 2014 when Barack Obama was in office. They have continued to climb during Trump’s tenure. Trump cited prosecutions, but it’s important to distinguish between charges and convictions.  Although most federal cases end in guilty pleas, not all of the defendants charged with federal firearm offenses end up convicted of firearm offenses because some ultimately plead guilty to another type of charge. That means if we look at the number of defendants found guilty of a firearm offense, it would be lower than the number of those initially charged with a firearm offense. Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote a memo in March 2017 to federal prosecutors calling on them to step up prosecutions of firearm charges. A few months later, the Justice Department attributed an increase in federal prosecutions to Sessions’ memo. A couple of other things to note: First, the vast majority of gun crimes are handled by state courts, not federal courts, said Jeffrey A. Butts, director of the Research & Evaluation Center at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. So Trump is talking about a small piece of the issue. ""Over the last 20 years, gun cases in federal courts fluctuated between 7,000 and 12,000 annually,"" Butts told PolitiFact. ""Meanwhile, in 2017 about 175,000 people nationwide were arrested for gun charges (possession, use in a criminal act, etc.)."" Second, part of the increase in federal gun crimes is likely due to the federalization of some crime types, Butts said. That means an increase may be related to a shift in the workload of state and federal courts more than some type of crackdown on gun crimes. Third, the federal statistics alone don’t tell us about the seriousness of each type of case.  The New York Times reported in May 2018 that federal prosecutors have increasingly targeted low-level gun offenders, raising questions about whether the tactic is the best use of resources. ""It’s a good idea to enforce the existing gun laws,"" Avery Gardiner, co-president of The Brady Campaign, which works to combat gun violence, told the New York Times. ""That’s something prosecutors should do. But going only after the people who are purchasing the guns illegally is only part of the story."" Trump said, ""Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses."" Trump appeared to be referring to the number of defendants charged with federal firearm offenses in 2018, which the Justice Department announced was more than 15,300. The government said that was 17 percent more than the previous record. It’s important to note, however, that the vast majority of gun crimes are handled at the state level, and that the data doesn’t speak to the seriousness of the charge.  Trump’s statement is accurate but needs additional information.

Fact-checking Beto O'Rourke on murders in El Paso after mass shooting
","Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke spoke with reporters outside of the University Medical Center in El Paso on Saturday, after visiting with people who were injured in a mass shooting at a Walmart in the city. Twenty-two people were killed and more than two dozen were injured after a gunman opened fire at the store earlier that day. Twenty people were reported dead on the day of the shooting and two people died later at the hospital, according to the El Paso Police Department. O’Rourke, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters that the people he met with at the hospital ""are asking us to do something about this.""  ""Yes, it’s the gun laws. Yes, it’s the universal background checks. Yes, we should stop selling weapons of war into our communities,"" said O’Rourke, who was born and raised in El Paso. ""But I think we also have to confront this hatred that I have never seen in my lifetime, and we certainly have not seen in El Paso. Some years, in a city of almost 700,000, we had five murders the entire year. Our average over the last 10 years is 18 (murders per year). We exceeded that average just on one day. This is not normal, it is not acceptable. We cannot just move on from this and the folks I just met with do not want us to move on from this.""  Are O’Rourke’s figures about his hometown accurate? Taking a look at the numbers O’Rourke spokesman Chris Evans said his figures came from a January news release from the city of El Paso that looked at the annual number of murders per year in El Paso over the past 59 years — from 1960 to 2018.  During that time period, the year with the most murders was 1993, when 56 murders were recorded in the city. The next closest year was 1980, when there were 54 murders. In 1964 and 2010, there were just five murders in the city. In 1965, there were nine murders, the only other year over this period when the total number of murders was in the single digits. Over the entire 59-year period included, the city averaged 23 murders per year. Over the past 10 years, from 2008 to 2018, El Paso averaged 18.1 murders per year. O’Rourke frequently touts crime figures from El Paso to say that the city is among the safest in the country.  The FBI cautions against using its uniform crime statistics to rank localities and researchers warn against ranking communities by relative safety.  Without ranking localities, FBI data shows that El Paso’s violent crime rate has been significantly lower than the average for all localities of a similar size (those with a population between 500,000 and 999,999 people) every year from 1985 until 2017, the latest available year from the FBI. Our ruling O’Rourke said some years in El Paso, ""in a city of almost 700,000, we had five murders the entire year. Our average over the last 10 years is 18 (murders per year). We exceeded that average just on one day"" after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in the city. Let’s take this statement piece by piece.  El Paso’s population was approximately 682,669 in 2018, according to U.S. Census estimates. In 1964 and 2010, five murders were recorded over the year in the city. The average number of murders per year in the city was 18.1 over the past 10 years.  On Saturday, 20 people were killed and more than two dozen were injured after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso. Two people died later at the hospital. We rate this claim True.

No, the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings were not ‘false flag’ operations
","As of the morning of Aug. 5, weekend mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, had taken the lives of at least 30 people. But some social media users claim — without evidence — that the tragedies were planned and coordinated by leftists. Known as ""false flag"" conspiracies, the rumors started making the rounds on Facebook the morning of Aug. 4 following the Dayton shooting. Several Facebook posts claim that the shootings were staged by Democrats to push an anti-gun agenda ahead of the 2020 presidential election. ""TWO mass-shootings over the weekend. Both are a 'paid for' effort by the former deep-state leftist regime,"" one post claims. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) False flag conspiracies have become a recurring theme in the misinformation that follows mass shootings in the U.S.  After a gunman shot and killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018, social media users and Russian bots shared the false claim that the tragedy was orchestrated by the so-called ""deep state,"" a purported faction within the government working against President Donald Trump. Similar hoaxes circulated after the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October 2017. While they’re about different shootings, the false flag conspiracies about the attacks in El Paso and Dayton are cut from the same conspiratorial cloth. One Facebook user published a photo of the Dayton suspect alongside the alleged gunman in a shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, Calif., last weekend, which left three dead. We found similar side-by-side comparisons on Reddit. ""DEEP STATE RECYCLES SHOOTERS,"" the user claimed in the post. (Screenshot from Facebook) The photo on the left comes from a story in The Daily Mail about Santino William Legan, 19, whom authorities have named as the gunman responsible for the Gilroy shooting. The photo on the right comes from a story by KTVT in Dallas about Patrick Crusius, 21, the suspect linked to the El Paso shooting. The shooting suspects may look similar, but that doesn’t mean they’re the same person. Authorities in both El Paso and Gilroy have identified two different suspects. Plus, Gilroy authorities said the gunman died at the scene of the shooting. Another post points to an article from Natural News, a known purveyor of health misinformation, that purports to show that ""the official news narrative about the El Paso Walmart mass shooting is largely fabricated."" PolitiFact hasn’t rated each of the five points the site brought up, but the article relies on conjecture and speculation to claim that the El Paso and Dayton shootings were false flag operations. Further, there’s no evidence to suggest that either attack was coordinated or otherwise planned by a left-leaning faction of the U.S. government. Authorities are investigating a manifesto published online by the alleged El Paso gunman shortly before the attack, which expressed hatred for Hispanic people and laid out an attack on them in the United States. Police still haven’t disclosed a potential motive for the Dayton shooter, who was killed on the scene, but media reports suggest that Connor Betts, 24, had talked about violent fantasies in the past.

Donald Trump’s flawed comparison of homicide rates in Baltimore, Central America
","Days after President Donald Trump disparaged Baltimore as ""a rat and rodent infested mess,"" he claimed the city’s homicide problem is worse than some of the world’s most dangerous countries.  During an unscripted moment at a rally in Cincinnati, the president asked the crowd to name another location with a reputation for violence.  ""The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. I believe it’s higher than — give me a place that you think is pretty bad,"" Trump said Aug. 1. Trump listened to the crowd. Then he said, ""The guy says ‘Afghanistan.’ I believe it’s higher than Afghanistan."" The line got a reaction from the crowd, and in a most literal sense, Trump has a point. But experts who study crime say comparing a city to a country is a misleading political talking point. Baltimore, a city of just over 600,000, saw 309 homicides last year. That translates to a rate of more than 51 homicides for 100,000 residents. That puts Baltimore’s homicide rate higher than El Salvador (50), Honduras (41), Guatemala (22) and Afghanistan (7), based on the most recent available annual data. (The data isn’t perfect, as we’ll note later.) Note: The United Nations said deaths from armed conflict are typically excluded from data on intentional killings, but also notes there are ""challenges of determining the nature of conflict versus non-conflict deaths in Afghanistan.""   So that’s the approach Trump took to make his claim. But it’s a flawed one, experts told us. To better understand, consider the difference in crime rates of urban and rural areas.  Typically, cities experience more crime, including homicides, than rural areas.  Based on population density, the city of Baltimore is considered an urban area. By contrast, the Northern Triangle countries, as well as Afghanistan, are a mix of both urban and rural. For that reason, measuring Baltimore’s homicide rate against those of entire countries is foolhardy. ""Baltimore is 100% urban, but a substantial percent of each nation's population live in rural areas,"" said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. ""It is a comparison between apples and oranges.""  The State Department, as part of its annual survey of crime and safety abroad, took note of the urban-rural crime gap in El Salvador. Last year, five municipalities that account for only 22% of El Salvador’s population saw 40% of the country’s homicides, according to the State Department’s Overseas Security Advisory Council. A fairer measure would be to compare the homicide rates of Baltimore with a place like San Salvador, El Salvador’s capital and its most populous city. According to a ranking of the world’s most dangerous cities by the Mexican nongovernmental group Citizens' Council for Public Security, in 2017 San Salvador’s homicide rate was 59 per 100,000 residents — higher than Baltimore’s 2018 homicide rate. Philip Cook, a sociologist at Duke University, noted that rates fluctuate depending on a number of factors, and rates in Central America can be especially volatile.  The homicide rate in El Salvador in 2015 was 103 — more than double its 2018 number. Cook added that some Central American data also tend to undercount the true number of homicides, another complicating factor when comparing it to an American city. ""Given the likelihood of a substantial undercount,"" Cook said, ""I would not bet the ranch that El Salvador was safer than Baltimore in 2018."" Another way to look at homicide rates would be to compare Maryland, which includes Baltimore, to the countries Trump mentioned. In that case, however, the comparison falls apart. Maryland (with a population a little over 6 million) had a homicide rate of 9 per 100,000 people, compared to El Salvador (50), Honduras (41), Guatemala (22) and Afghanistan (7). Trump said Baltimore has a higher homicide rate than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Afghanistan. The comparison is flawed, because it uses the homicide rates of entire countries — which are a blend of relatively higher-crime urban areas and lower-crime rural areas — as a measuring stick to gauge the level of violence in a city.   We rate this Half True.",/factchecks/2019/aug/02/donald-trump/donald-trumps-flawed-comparison-homicide-rates-bal/

Trump’s false charge that Democrats want virtual immunity for violent illegal immigrants
","President Donald Trump continued his effort to paint Democrats as so soft on immigration that they put American lives at risk. At his rally in Cincinnati, Trump said ""Democrats have forgotten who it is that they're supposed to represent,"" and gave examples of illegal immigrants who committed murder and rape after being released from cities with sanctuary policies. ""After ... New Jersey released an alien charged with domestic violence, he was arrested in Missouri for the murders of three people,"" Trump said Aug. 1. ""They want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have committed horrible crimes and murder."" Democrats want immunity for illegal immigrants who commit violent crimes? Democratic legislation and the words of Democratic presidential candidates tell the opposite story. They specifically exclude violent offenders from measures that create a path to citizenship or offer alternatives to widespread deportation. The American Dream and Promise Act, passed by the Democratic-held U.S. House in June, lifts the threat of deportation from people who illegally came to the United States when they were children — popularly known as ""Dreamers."" The bill defines who is not eligible, including those convicted of ""any felony offense,"" three or more misdemeanor offenses or domestic violence. ""The vast majority of relevant policies make exceptions for those individuals involved, arrested, or convicted of serious felonies,"" University of California Irvine criminology professor Charis Kubrin said. Democrats vying for the White House oppose many of Trump’s immigration policies, but their plans do target violent offenders. Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke says on his website that he would undo Trump’s ""executive orders that seek to maximize detention and deportation."" But he would require detention for ""those with criminal backgrounds representing a danger to our communities."" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker uses similar language. Booker would roll back Trump’s detention rules, but not for those whom the Homeland Security department can show present a danger to the community. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee takes the same view, saying he would target criminal behavior. Going further back, President Barack Obama aimed to deport anyone convicted of a felony. The Trump campaign pointed to Democratic criticism of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and said that decriminalizing illegal entry would increase the odds that violent offenders would make their way into the country. The Trump team noted that last year, among the people detained by Border Patrol agents were three convicted murderers and 524 who had prior convictions for assault, battery or domestic violence. (For people with multiple convictions, double counting is possible. There were a total of 16 convicted murderers since 2016.) They argued that the Democrats leave it unclear what a deportable offence would be. If authorities can’t deport someone immediately, they said, that is de facto immunity. But decriminalization means illegal border crossing would be handled as a civil matter, not a criminal one. The approach says nothing about barring a search for past criminal convictions and Democratic legislation lists the felonies that leave a person open to deportation.    Jessica Vaughan with the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration levels, cited California Sen. Kamala Harris’ 2012 policy that limited cooperation with federal immigration officials when she was that state’s attorney general. Vaughan said Harris was among those who ""don’t want immigration laws enforced even against criminals."" But that 2012 policy statement gave local and state jurisdictions the flexibility to take past crimes into account. ""After analyzing the public-safety risks presented by the individual, including a review of his or her arrest offense and criminal history, as well as the resources of the agency, an agency may decide for itself whether to devote resources to holding suspected unlawfully present immigrants,"" the policy said. Vaughan also targeted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s rules on working with immigration officers. De Blasio said the city police department and other agencies would share ""information about individuals in the city’s criminal custody who have been convicted of one of approximately 170 qualifying violent or serious felonies."" By relying on convictions, Vaughan said, ""Democratic policies are giving illegal aliens at least one opportunity to commit a serious crime before they are subject to removal."" Still, this policy doesn’t amount to giving immunity to people who have already committed crimes, as Trump specified. Trump said Democrats ""want virtual immunity for illegal aliens who have created horrible crimes and murder.""  Democratic policies at the federal, state and local level uniformly deny any protections to immigrants in the country illegally who have committed violent crimes or lesser offenses such as burglary.  The Trump campaign and critics of Democratic policies say they increase the chances that undocumented immigrants will be in the country and commit violence. That is speculative, and is not the same as granting ""virtual immunity"" to offenders.

Fact-checking the Joe Biden, Kirsten Gillibrand spat over 1980s child care tax credit vote
","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., accused former Vice President Joe Biden of espousing views against working mothers in an op-ed nearly four decades ago, when he was a U.S. senator. ""When the Senate was debating middle-class affordability for child care, he wrote an op-ed,"" she said during the July 31 debate in Detroit. ""He voted against it, the only vote, but what he wrote (in) an op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, quote, ‘create the deterioration of family.’ He also said that women who were working outside the home were, quote, ‘avoiding responsibility.’"" Biden pushed back against Gillibrand’s attack, saying that at the time he didn’t want to give tax breaks for child care for wealthy people. Our review found that Gillibrand cherry-picked Biden’s words from 1981. Biden did not literally say that working women would create the deterioration of the family or that they were avoiding responsibility.  The op-ed shows him criticizing the concept of both parents working if it wasn’t a financial necessity. Gillibrand argues is that his words came at a time when mothers overwhelmingly had most of the child care responsibilities and were far less likely than their husbands to work outside the home. So if he was making a case that one parent should stay home if the couple could afford it, statistics from the time indicate that role would have most likely to the mother. ""Give me a break! Who in 1981 was going to be staying home to watch the children? It's obvious. It's typically, in most families, women,"" Gillibrand said on CNN the morning after the debate. ""Women are still primary caregivers."" During the debate, a Gillibrand campaign spokeswoman tweeted the 1981 op-ed by Biden, which was printed in The Daily Times of Salisbury, Md. At the time, Biden was the only senator to vote against expanding the child care tax credit. He wasn’t against the tax credit in general, but he didn’t want it for upper income couples. He had voted for a child care tax credit a few years earlier. Biden wrote the op-ed to explain his opposition, and he starts it by lamenting how people of his generation and others avoid personal responsibility for themselves and their families. ""That is a shame,"" he wrote. ""But a recent act of Congress puts the federal government in the position, through the tax codes, of subsidizing the deterioration of the family. That is tragic.""  He did not say that working women were to blame for this deterioration. His overall point was that low-income families should not have to subsidize higher income families’ day care expenses. He wrote that it was ""ridiculous"" that there were families earning $1 million or more who took the child care tax credit. ""But what I do not accept as legitimate is social policy that encourages a couple making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 or more a year to evade full responsibility for their children by granting them a tax credit for day-care expenses,"" he wrote. (In 1981, $30,000 was the equivalent of about $84,500 today; $50,000 would be almost $141,000.) Biden also made an argument that parents should take personal responsibility for caring for their children. The Senate, he said, should not ""make it easier for people who have neither the financial necessity nor personal need to forsake their responsibility to care for their own children."" A few weeks before the op-ed was published, Biden spoke about the child care tax credit on the Senate floor. He offered an amendment, unsuccessfully, that would have limited the tax credit to families that earned less than $30,000. Biden said he didn’t oppose women working outside the home, praising his wife, Jill, a teacher, as an example.  ""She is a career woman. She is very devoted to her career, and very concerned about it, and she has good reason to be, and I am proud of the fact that she has such a career,"" Biden said  July 28, 1981, on the floor. ""But it is outrageous to make my father, who makes less than $20,000 a year, to pay a tax to see to it that I can put my child in a day care center. I think that is preposterous."" Biden also said, ""I have no objection to the fact that if a mother and a father want to get together and say, ‘Hey, by the way, Joe, you take care of the child and I am going to pursue my career,’ that is fine. That is a personal decision, and I am all for it.""  He also framed day care as something that should be used by working couples only if they financially needed it. Biden’s past statements about the tax credit gained new life days before the debate. The Huffington Post published comments by Biden that were reported in the Indianapolis News around the same time.  It included the following quote (bold type is ours): ""I think it is a sad commentary on this society when we say, as a matter of social policy, that we should make it easier for people who have neither the financial necessity nor the personal need to forget their responsibility to take care of a child all day from the time the child is an infant until the time he or she gets in school. I do not care whether in a modern marriage you want the man or the woman to take that responsibility. That has to be resolved by each couple individually."" Biden supported child care tax credits at other times, including years before his 1981 vote. While Biden didn’t single out working mothers for the deterioration of families, his comments about couples using day care and averting responsibility to care for their children could be interpreted as a criticism of women who went to work, said University of Maryland sociologist Philip Cohen, who researches family structure. In 1981, slightly more than 50% of women with dependent children were in the labor force compared to around 90% percent for comparable men. Of stay-at-home parents, 94% were women, Cohen said. Back in the 1980s, and still today, it is rare for moms to be the sole breadwinner in a couple.  Gillibrand said that when Biden alone opposed a childcare tax credit, he wrote an op-ed in which he said ""he believed that women working outside the home would, quote, ‘Create the deterioration of family’ and they were ‘avoiding responsibility.’"" That’s not directly what Biden said in an op-ed in 1981 when he opposed expanding the child care tax credit. Biden did not want wealthier families to get the tax credit.  Biden criticized dual-income parents who didn’t need both of those paychecks putting their children in daycare. While he said such families were avoiding the responsibility to care for their children, he didn’t expressly blame women.

At debate, Joe Biden said to Google ‘1,000 prisoners freed Kamala Harris.’ Time for a fact-check
","Viewers of the Detroit Democratic debates got an encore showdown between former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris when the topic of busing reemerged.  This time, Biden tried to turn the tables on Harris for her attacks on his busing record, accusing her of failing to desegregate schools in Los Angeles and San Francisco during her two-term stint as attorney general of California.  Biden also recalled a scandal that occurred on Harris’s watch while she was district attorney of San Francisco. Biden said: ""Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that, in fact, was abusing people's rights. ""And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people, her own staff, that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me that you, in fact, have been — the police officer did something that did not give you information that would exculpate your client.  ""She didn't do that. She never did it. And so, what happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough, and he freed 1,000 of these people. If you doubt me, Google ‘1,000 prisoners freed Kamala Harris.’"" ""That is simply not true,"" Harris responded. So, who’s right? We followed Biden’s suggestion and Googled away. We found that Biden’s version of events captures the gist of what happened but misses the mark on a few details. A June report from the Wall Street Journal said that in 2005, when Harris was district attorney, her staff encouraged her to adopt a ""Brady policy"" requiring her office’s prosecutors to inform defendants of past misconduct by police and other law enforcement in accordance with Supreme Court precedent.  Brady policies are named after a 1963 Supreme Court ruling that said prosecutors must turn over all evidence that could potentially exonerate the defendant. Harris did not institute such a policy, and in 2010, a crime lab technician in San Francisco was caught stealing drug evidence from the lab for personal use. That meant some lab results had been jeopardized, and more than 1,000 drug cases were dismissed or dropped, according to the Associated Press. The San Francisco Police Department was in charge of running the lab, but a Superior Court judge rebuked Harris and her office for violating defendants’ rights, writing in a scathing decision that Harris ""failed to disclose information that clearly should have been disclosed.""  The judge also wrote that ""individuals at the highest levels of the district attorney’s office"" knew that the technician, who had a criminal record, ""was not a dependable witness at trial."" As the scandal unfolded, Harris instituted a Brady policy. Biden’s account was largely in line with what’s been reported, but he botched a few key details that are worth setting straight. For starters, the scandal resulted in the district attorney’s office dismissing or dropping about 1,000 cases, not ""1,000 prisoners freed,"" as Biden said.  Second, Harris eventually implemented a policy mandating the handover of exculpatory evidence, meaning Biden’s claim that ""she never did it"" was not right. Biden also mistook the gender and title of the judge who stepped in to reprimand Harris. The judge, Anne-Christine Massullo, presides in the Superior Court of San Francisco County. Defending Harris, her campaign told us, ""Harris was not in charge of the crime lab and did not personally see the memo raising issues about the lab technician. Once the issue was brought to her attention, the senator notified defense attorneys and took the extraordinary step of dismissing an estimated 1,000 drug-related cases — including those of whom had already been convicted and/or sentenced."" That argument is countered by the Wall Street Journal, which claims to have reviewed several memos about the issue that Harris’s staff members sent her in 2005, as well as a memo ""from the desk of Kamala D. Harris"" that went to top staff members and ""indicated that she had seen the recommendations."" (PolitiFact could not obtain copies of the memos.) Harris also seemed to own up to what happened in a March interview with the Washington Post. ""I take full responsibility,"" she said. ""The buck stops with me."" Biden said Harris oversaw a police department that was ""abusing people’s rights"" and did not ""disclose to defense attorneys"" when there was exculpatory evidence: ""She didn't do that. She never did it. And so, what happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough, and he freed 1,000 of these people."" According to the Wall Street Journal, Harris rejected staff recommendations urging her to adopt a ""Brady policy"" in 2005, and that lack of action backfired in 2010 when a scandal broke out and roughly 1,000 drug cases had to be dropped or dismissed. Harris later added such a policy. Overall, Biden’s statement is largely accurate but needs a few clarifications, including that there were 1,000 cases dismissed or dropped, not 1,000 prisoners freed.  We rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/aug/02/joe-biden/debate-biden-said-google-1000-prisoners-freed-kama/
"['Corrections and Updates', 'Texas', 'Guns', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
Are there more gun deaths in the United States than any other country?
","Texan Beto O’Rourke joined nine other Democrats on stage in Detroit on Tuesday for the second round of debates in the Democratic presidential primary contest. All of the candidates made questionable statements — take a look at some fact-checking from the night — including O’Rourke, who was asked to respond to a comment about gun violence from Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.   Bullock said that Washington, D.C., ""is captured by dark money"" and political influence from the likes of the NRA and Koch Industries, making it hard for lawmakers to tackle issues like gun safety. ""That's the way we're actually going to make a change on this, Don, is by changing that system,"" Bullock said, addressing moderator Don Lemon of CNN. ""And most of the things that folks are talking about on this stage we're not going to address until we kick dark money and the post-Citizens United corporate spending out of these elections."" Lemon asked O’Rourke to respond to Bullock’s point. ""How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to, that we know what all the solutions are, and yet nothing has changed?"" O’Rourke said. ""It is because, in this country, money buys influence, access and, increasingly, outcomes."" We assumed O'Rourke was talking about the number of gun deaths in the United States in the past year, a figure supported by federal data. But is O’Rourke right that no other country comes close to the number of deaths by gun violence in the United States? We took a look. CDC data shows 40,000 deaths O’Rourke’s spokesman Chris Evans pointed to two studies of gun-related deaths around the world and a handful of media articles discussing the findings to support the Democrat’s claim. ""As we've visited communities across the country, we have consistently heard about the fact that gun violence is a major concern in the U.S. as no other developed country comes close to the number of gun deaths,"" Evans said.  In 2017, there were 39,773 firearm injury deaths in the United States (12.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 total population), according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited by Evans. Of those deaths, 60% were recorded as suicides and 36.6% were homicides, according to the CDC. The other 3.4% were marked as unintentional, undetermined or the result of ""legal intervention/war.""  But how do those figures compare to other countries?  Limiting by economic standing changes outcome Evans pointed to a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Medicine that measured violent death rates in the United States compared with other high-income countries, using mortality data from 2010. Researchers compared figures from the United States to the 26 other countries classified as ""high-income"" by the World Bank that were also members of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development in 2010 — excluding Iceland and Luxembourg for ""having very small populations."" The study focused on violent death in general, but it also looked at firearm deaths and found that ""Americans are 10 times more likely to die as a result of a firearm compared with residents of these other high-income countries."" The same researchers conducted an updated study using data from 2015 and came to a similar conclusion and stated that, when it comes to firearm deaths, ""not one of the other high-income countries compares to the US."" Erin Grinshteyn, a professor at the University of San Francisco who co-authored both studies, said they compared the United States to other high-income countries to make an ""apples to apples"" comparison. ""Countries that are less developed are not similar to the US in many ways and would not typically be used as a comparison on other health indicators,"" she said. ""What O'Rourke said is accurate for high-income countries. We are a complete outlier compared to our peer countries."" But O’Rourke’s statement at the debate was not limited to other high-income countries. He said that ""no other country comes even close to"" the number of deaths from gun violence in the United States. The second study cited by Evans offers a broader look at global trends. The study, conducted by researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, looked at firearm mortality around the world from 1990 to 2016. In 2016, the most current year in the study, there were an estimated 251,000 firearm injury deaths worldwide. The study found that more than half of those deaths were recorded in six countries: the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Guatemala.  Take a look at the number of firearm injury deaths in each of these countries in 2016, according to the study, in order of the total number of deaths:  The study revealed that in Brazil, most firearm deaths in 2016 were homicides. In the United States, slightly less than 40% of these deaths were homicides; the majority were suicides. ""Beto doesn't think the United States of America should take any solace in being second behind Brazil in that one study when it comes to the number of gun deaths each year,"" Evans said, when asked about the findings in the study. ""We should not be seeing more gun deaths in our country each year than significantly less developed countries."" He said the same study showed there were more gun deaths in the United States than in places like Columbia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Syria. But the raw number of deaths is only part of the equation. There were 19 countries and U.S. territories with more firearm deaths per capita than the United States in 2016, or the same amount, according to an analysis of the study conducted by PBS Newshour. Evans pointed to news coverage of the study, including an article from NPR that said ""The level of gun violence in the United States is completely outsized compared to what's seen in other wealthy countries.""  But the same article noted that gun violence is a bigger issue elsewhere.  ""To be sure, there are quite a few countries where gun violence is a substantially larger problem than in the United States — particularly in Central America and the Caribbean,"" it reads.  A Vox article cited by Evans said that the United States ""has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far higher levels of gun ownership than any other country in the world."" But it also states that: ""While the rate of U.S. gun deaths is lower than that of many less developed countries, America is still an outlier when compared to nations in similar socioeconomic circumstances."" Evans also pointed to a write-up from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence that stated: ""No other developed nation experiences mass shootings with the same terrifying frequency as the United States.""   The problem is that all of these findings are different than the statement O’Rourke made during the debate. O’Rourke did not limit his claim to high-income countries or those of ""similar socioeconomic circumstances."" Our ruling O’Rourke said ""we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to."" Studies show that the United States experiences more firearm injury deaths than other countries of similar socioeconomic standing, but that’s not what O’Rourke said at the debate. Brazil experienced more firearm injury deaths in 2016 than the United States and more than a dozen countries had more firearm deaths per capita than the United States that same year. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Clarification: An earlier version of this story referred to the Koch brothers. That has been changed to Koch Industries. David Koch retired from the company last year. Also, a typo in a graphic in the piece was corrected to display the accurate rate of crime in the United States. These changes do not affect the ruling.",/factchecks/2019/aug/02/beto-orourke/are-there-more-gun-deaths-united-states-any-other-/

Tulsi Gabbard cites US arms sales to Saudi Arabia in falsely claiming Donald Trump supports al-Qaida
","At the second Democratic presidential debate in Detroit, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a major in the Army National Guard who was deployed to Iraq, accused President Donald Trump of helping al-Qaida.  ""The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us. We were supposed to be going after al-Qaida,"" Gabbard said about Trump and the organization that was responsible for the terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.  ""But over (the) years now, not only have we not gone after al-Qaida, who is stronger today than they were in 9/11,"" she said, ""our president is supporting al-Qaida."" In this fact-check, we focused on whether Trump has not gone after al-Qaida and whether he is supporting it. We found Gabbard is wrong on both counts. (There are indications that al-Qaida is stronger today than it was on 9/11.) Asked after the debate to explain her attack, Gabbard told Fox News that Trump’s ""support and alliance with Saudi Arabia"" is ""both providing direct and indirect support"" to al-Qaida, and that Saudi Arabia is ""providing arms and support to al-Qaida in Yemen."" When we asked the Gabbard campaign to back up her statement, a spokesman referred not to Yemen, but Syria.  The spokesman said Trump ""is protecting al-Qaida in Idlib, Syria, and through his arm deals with Saudi Arabia,"" is arming al-Qaida in Syria. Terrorism experts told us that the United States has repeatedly fought against al-Qaida and that, even if a case can be made that some of the arms sold by the United States to Saudi Arabia end up with groups aligned with al-Qaida, Gabbard’s attack goes too far in saying Trump is supporting the terrorist group. The first part of Gabbard’s claim was undercut on the day of the debate when news reports said that Hamza bin Laden, the son of al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden, was killed. The operation at least had support from the United States, according to the New York Times. And although it is not clear when he was killed, it was during the Trump administration, officials said. ABC News, in checking Gabbard’s debate statement, said the United States is supporting Somali forces against an al-Qaida affiliate and that the United States has also conducted drone strikes against al-Qaida in Yemen. Trump’s campaign also cited to us similar instances that have been reported in the news, including two U.S. air strikes. One in June 2019 was on an al-Qaida leadership and training facility in northern Syria where militants were ""plotting external attacks"" against American citizens; and one in December 2018 killed the al-Qaida terrorist who was behind the USS Cole bombing. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, chief executive officer of the Valens Global consulting firm and an associate fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, made the point to us that the United States has, in effect, supported al-Qaida — but indirectly, and not intentionally.  During the Obama administration, he said, there was a revolution in Syria, and the United States gave arms to the rebels, but the rebels came to be dominated by jihadists, including al-Qaida. Some rebels with whom the United States worked turned around and provided arms that the United States gave to them to al-Qaida-aligned groups, he said.  But rebel support was discontinued under the Trump administration, so Gartenstein-Ross disagreed with Gabbard's suggestion that al-Qaida began benefiting from U.S. policy toward Syria under Trump. As for U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia under the Trump administration, it is possible that some of the arms ended up with the rebels, Gartenstein-Ross said. But that would not be the same as the Trump administration sending arms to al-Qaida, he said. GlobalSecurity.org director John Pike made a similar point about how some arms might end up with al-Qaida groups. ""There has been some such four degrees-of-separation transfers, but it is contrary to U.S. and Saudi policy,"" he said. ""That part of the world is awash with this stuff, and it would be impossible to keep track of everything."" While the United States is selling arms to countries who are thought to supply Islamist rebels in Syria, Gabbard’s claim about Trump ""is extremely exaggerated,"" said Princeton University politics and international affairs professor Jacob Shapiro. Carnegie Mellon University politics and strategy professor Colin Clarke went further, telling us that any claim that Trump is deliberately helping al-Qaida ""is patently false."" Gabbard said that under Trump, ""not only have we not gone after al-Qaida ... our president is supporting al-Qaida."" There have been numerous U.S. military actions against al-Qaida during the Trump administration. While some arms sold by the United States to Saudi Arabia might ultimately end up with rebels groups in Syria that have ties to al-Qaida, the United States has been supporting those rebels since before Trump took office and the arm sales are not supporting al-Qaida.

"['China', 'Trade', 'Wisconsin', 'Donald Trump']","
No, China is not paying U.S. farmers $16B through tariffs
","With farmers across the nation whipsawed by falling commodity prices and rising tariffs, the industry needed some good news. President Donald Trump’s administration announced in May that help was on the way for some in the form of a $16 billion farm aid package. Farmers in particular have suffered from retaliatory tariffs amid an ongoing trade war with China. Trump imposed additional import taxes on Chinese goods in 2018, then raised many tariffs again — from 10% to 25% — in May 2019 after trade talks broke down. He unexpectedly announced another round of tariffs Aug. 1, 2019.  Along the way, China has responded by raising tariffs as well.  But it was the President’s repeated description of funding for that bailout that caught our eye. ""We are doing great with farmers now in a lot of ways. One way is we’re giving $16 billion out of all the tariffs we’re collecting,"" Trump told WTMJ-TV’s Charles Benson in a July 12, 2019, interview in Wisconsin. ""Sixteen billion dollars all comes out of the tariffs that we’ve gotten from China."" Trump also referenced tariff payments ""from China"" when he announced the farm aid plan in May and many times since, including a July 30, 2019, news conference where he referred to ""taking in billions and billions of dollars from China in the form of tariffs."" Is that really how tariffs work? The short answer is no. Here’s a description from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. A tariff is a tax on imported goods. Despite what the President says, it is almost always paid directly by the importer (usually a domestic firm), and never by the exporting country. Thus, if the US imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to the US Customs and Border Protection Service at the border by a US broker representing a US importer, say, Costco. The Chinese government pays nothing, just as the US government pays no tax to Canada for that nation’s tariffs on imported dairy products. Rather, an importer or supplier for a Canadian supermarket pays the duty on Wisconsin cheese that lands in the grocer’s dairy counter. That explanation, written in September 2018, noted that Trump has a ""troubling lack of understanding about how the levies work."" The International Monetary Fund reported in May that this is indeed what happened, saying tariffs imposed on China have ""been borne almost entirely by U.S. importers."" Those businesses, of course, often pass costs on to consumers. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated in May that the round of tariffs imposed then on U.S. imports from China would cost the typical household $831 per year. So China is not paying the tariffs. Then who’s paying for the farm aid? The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced details of the bailout July 25, 2019, saying the first of three payments will likely be made by August. The money is doled out for each county at a per-acre rate based on ""the impact of unjustified trade retaliation in that county,"" ranging from $15 to $150 per acre. Aid is available to farmers who planted any of 27 non-specialty crops (including soybeans, corn, alfalfa hay, barley and wheat), as well as dairy and hog farmers and producers of certain fruit- and nut-bearing plants. Aid per farmer is capped at $500,000. In addition to China, farmers can receive funding if they were harmed by U.S. trade conflicts with the European Union and Turkey. This program is modeled after one implemented last year that distributed about $12 billion in aid to farmers. The Associated Press reported the latest aid package includes $14.5 billion in direct aid in the aforementioned categories, and $1.4 billion to purchase surplus food from farmers and distribute them to schools and food banks. That $16 billion is paid out through the Commodity Credit Corporation, a government institution supervised by USDA that can borrow up to $30 billion annually from the U.S. Treasury and distribute it to farmers without specific Congressional approval. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue told the AP that China is ""indirectly"" paying for the aid, but he acknowledged tariffs are sent to the Treasury Department without being earmarked for any specific purpose. Trump said $16 billion in farm aid is being funded ""out of the tariffs that we’ve gotten from China."" Tariffs are paid into the U.S. Treasury, and the Treasury funds the farm aid. But there is no specific earmark or conduit connecting the two. More significantly, Trump’s claim simply does not reflect how tariffs work. The tariffs imposed by Trump have been paid almost entirely by U.S. importers, who pass much of that on to consumers through price increases. We rate Trump’s claim False.",/factchecks/2019/aug/02/donald-trump/no-china-not-paying-us-farmers-16b-through-tariffs/

In Baltimore talk, Ben Carson highlights extremely low homelessness rates in Tokyo
","President Donald Trump’s housing czar Ben Carson visited Baltimore in the wake of a weekend Twitter fusillade that saw the president disparage the city as ""a rat and rodent infested mess."" Speaking before a block of dilapidated row houses, Carson sought to strike a balance between affirming Trump’s critique of Baltimore’s blight — albeit in more diplomatic tones — while sounding a note of optimism about Charm City’s future.    Carson, who completed his neurosurgery residency at Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins Hospital and practiced there for years, said that with the right mix of smart policy and grit, American urban centers can be revitalized, citing an example from the Eastern Hemisphere. ""You look at the homelessness situation,"" Carson, the Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary, told reporters July 31. ""Take a city like Tokyo, which has more people than New York City. There's no homelessness there."" Really? That’s an exaggeration, of course. But if you crunch the numbers about Tokyo and its homeless population, you’ll see Carson isn’t that far off. Japan’s government estimates Tokyo’s homeless population is around 1,200 people, according to 2018 data. That’s 0.0092 percent of the city’s population or just under one homeless person for every 10,000 residents.  By contrast, New York City’s homeless population is around 79,000 of its 8.6 million residents, a rate of nearly 92 homeless people for every 10,000 people, which, like Tokyo, is also less than 1 percent. This chart illustrates the disparity.  Of Baltimore’s roughly 600,000 residents, some 2,500 are homeless, which is less than 1 percent of the overall population and translates to a rate of around 42 homeless people per 10,000 residents. Nationwide, the Japanese government said that just under 5,000 are homeless in the entire country of 126 million.  That’s just 0.0039 percent of the overall population. A HUD spokesman said Carson ""was talking about homelessness in Japan being functionally at zero."" When Japan released its data last year, the government’s welfare ministry said the tally represents a 15-year low. The ministry credited government programs, including counseling, for the reduction, according to The Japan Times.  Experts say Japan's outreach to its homeless population is among a combination of factors that explain the large disparity in homelessness rates of Japan and the United States.  ""The Tokyo government has made a concerted push to reduce numbers and provide shelter to more than before,"" said Jeffrey Kingston of Temple University’s Japan campus. ""More counseling and outreach — as in going to places homeless people congregate and offering support and counseling — have helped reduce numbers a great deal. Efforts to win trust and provide care have helped."" Kingston said some Japanese homeless people, who might prefer to live on the street and are reluctant to accept aid, increasingly lean on government support as they age and health problems accumulate. ""They have had to stop ‘living rough’ even though many prefer this,"" said Kingston, invoking a common euphemism for Japan’s homeless population. Tokyo has acknowledged its official tally of the homeless population may be an undercount. The government reached its figure by surveying the number of people dwelling in public spaces like riverbeds and parks. The methodology has received some criticism because it likely overlooks less visible segments of the homeless population, including those engaged in the well-documented practice of taking shelter in internet cafes or saunas. (For the record: Advocates in the United States say we also likely undercount the homeless population.) Carson said there is no homelessness in Tokyo. Carson would have been better saying virtually no homeless. But his overall point is correct. Tokyo’s government puts the homeless population at roughly 1,200. In a city of roughly 13.5 million, that’s around 0.0092 percent of the population.  We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/aug/01/ben-carson/baltimore-talk-ben-carson-highlights-extremely-low/

Matt McCall: Lamar Smith dodged primary debates
","Over a 28-year congressional career, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith has waded into hot topics seemingly without reservation, lately touching off an uproar for seeking internal emails from climate scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But last month, the San Antonio Republican drew criticism for failing to appear at political candidate debates in the 21st Congressional District, which runs from San Antonio north into Austin. On Feb. 11, 2016, Matt McCall, a Boerne, Texas challenger to Smith in the March 2016 Republican primary, issued a press release headlined: ""McCall Says Smith Dodging Debates."" McCall’s release said: ""During three and a half years of campaigning, Smith has never once appeared at a moderated debate to defend his positions on the issues."" McCall also unsuccessfully challenged Smith in the GOP primary in 2014. Smith went on in 2016 to whomp McCall (along with two other hopefuls, John Murphy and Todd Phelps) by a wide margin in the March 2016 Republican primary. Smith picked up 60 percent of the vote, McCall got 28.9 percent and other challengers received less than 6 percent. Regardless, we wondered if McCall was right about Smith not debating campaign opponents for three-plus years, which would take in the 2014 elections, as well. To our inquiry, Smith campaign consultant Jordan Berry said by phone that McCall and Smith had appeared together. But it looks like that was no debate. Berry directed us by email to a photo on McCall’s website showing McCall evidently speaking  in 2013 with Smith among people looking on. We asked McCall campaign spokesman Andrew Lewis for more information on the photo. By email, Lewis replied that the photo wasn’t taken at anything like a debate. Instead, Lewis said, the photo was taken at a lunch meeting of the Central Texas Republican Assembly where Smith was the guest speaker. Lewis said McCall was allowed to speak at the event because the group allows its members seeking elected office to speak at meetings; McCall is a member, Lewis said. To our inquiry, T.J. Scott, CTRA president, confirmed that explanation, saying by phone that his group had invited Smith to appear at a number of their regular meetings, which occur the third Thursday of every month, but scheduling conflicts prevented Smith from attending. ""His office said, ‘We’d love to sit down for lunch with you,’ so I said, ‘Well, how about you have lunch with not just me, but the group?’ and we called a special lunch meeting with our members,"" Scott said. He also agreed McCall was able to speak because the group gives a speaking opportunity of ""two to 10 minutes"" to members seeking office. Meanwhile, McCall campaign spokesman Andrew Lewis told us by email that in a ""not all-inclusive list from this election cycle, Smith did not attend debates and candidate forums in Real County, Boerne, Comal County and Fredericksburg, as well as forums at the Alamo Pachyderm Club and at Bexar County GOP Headquarters; he sent surrogates to the Real, Comal and Boerne events. Republican Party chairs in Real, Kendall, Comal and Gillespie counties, the president of the Fredericksburg Tea Party, and the coordinator of the Bexar County GOP candidates forum each separately said Smith did not attend the events Lewis listed. Smith also did not appear at a January 2016 forum in Bandera, according to a recap in the Bandera County Courier. We could not find any record of a candidate forum or debate attended by Smith in his district for the 2014 election cycle, either. McCall has been tweeting pleas for a debate with Smith since November 2013. A possible reason for some of the absences: The House was in session on the days of the Boerne, Comal and Fredericksburg events, according to the House majority leader’s calendar. The amount of notice given to candidates in advance of the debates and forums varied widely from event to event, ranging from two weeks to three months, according to emails from event organizers. Berry, Smith’s consultant, otherwise didn’t engage with us about candidate debates Smith has joined or any reasons for not going to them. It’s likely that more debates will be coming up. On the November ballot, Smith faces Democrat Tom Wakely of San Antonio and Green Party nominee. There are also two third party candidates in the congressional race: Green Party hopeful Antonio Diaz, and Mark Loewe, a Libertarian. So, best we can tell, Smith did miss formal candidate forums over the past few years. Smith did speak at forums open to audience questions, including a bipartisan student forum at the University of Texas, San Antonio on April 22, 2014. He spoke at a public forum in Bandera on July 18, 2015, and one in Kerrville on Oct. 3, 2014. He hosted one in San Antonio on October 19, 2015. And as McCall’s camp admits, a surrogate for Lamar Smith was present at at least three debates or candidate forums in 2016. Our ruling McCall said that in the years he’s been challenging Smith, the incumbent ""has never once appeared at a moderated debate to defend his positions on the issues."" Our search for signs of Smith joining a candidate debate came up empty. Also, given opportunities, Smith didn’t alert us to any such moment; a photo noted by Smith’s consultant wasn’t from a debate. So, we rate McCall’s claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['Public Safety', 'Pennsylvania', 'Stephen Zappala']","
The ‘messy’ case at the center of a western PA Attorney General candidate’s ad
","A candidate for attorney general from western Pennsylvania has spent a quarter of a million dollars running ads in the Philadelphia area branding himself as a former prosecutor who’s tough on cops. In a new TV advertisement for Stephen Zappala, a Democrat and the district attorney of Allegheny County, a narrator says Zappala is ""the only DA in our state to convict an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide."" The idea that only one police officer in Pennsylvania had been convicted of criminal homicide was surprising. So we decided to check the claim. The ad refers to the 1995 shooting death of Jerry Jackson, an unarmed black man stopped by police for driving the wrong way on a one-way street in Pittsburgh. Investigators said John Charmo, a white former police officer with the Pittsburgh Housing Authority, shot Jackson 13 times with his service weapon in a tunnel following a high-speed chase. Charmo wasn’t immediately charged under the previous district attorney. But the case was re-opened by Zappala in 1999 after Jackson’s family discovered video evidence of the shooting via a civil case. The officer was subsequently charged with homicide. In 2001, a jury deadlocked and Zappala feared another jury would acquit, so he worked out a plea deal with Charmo. The officer pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 11 1/2 to 23 months behind bars -- a fraction of the amount of time he would have been sentenced to had he been convicted on a murder charge. Zappala’s campaign for attorney general contends that under Pennsylvania law, a guilty plea of involuntary manslaughter is legally a conviction of criminal homicide. In this case, it resulted in what his campaign manager called ""substantial"" prison time that kept Charmo off the police force. ""This case happened more than a decade before Ferguson or any of the other high profile incidents that sparked the Black Lives Matter movement,"" Zappala’s campaign manager Marty Marks said. ""Which is the point of the ad’s message."" Zappala’s campaign made the $250,000 ad buy and commercials began running this week in the Philadelphia area. His primary opponent Josh Shapiro, a Montgomery County commissioner, also began airing TV ads this week. Northampton District Attorney John Morganelli is also seeking the Democratic nomination while Joe Peters, a former prosecutor, and John Rafferty, a state senator, are running on the Republican side. Zappala’s campaign claims the guilty plea on the Charmo case sets their candidate apart, but the Pittsburgh Citizen Police Review Board that analyzes complaints against police officers says the claim is ""a stretch."" ""[The Charmo case] was so very, very messy,"" said Beth Pittinger, executive director of the Review Board. ""To compress that accurately into a political ad would be very difficult."" Marks pointed to a Washington Post analysis of 5,000 police-involved shootings since 2005 that found 54 officers nationwide were criminally charged and, of those, 11 were convicted. None of those convictions were in Pennsylvania. At least two other officers in Pennsylvania besides Charmo have pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter on charges related to actions they took on duty that resulted in the death of another person. In both of those cases -- one in Coopersburg and one in Williamsport -- the officers were guilty of hitting and killing a person while drive at a high rate of speed in their police cruisers. Marks said it’s a ""false equivalency"" to compare officers who got into a car accident that resulted in a loss of life with the case of Charmo who shot Jackson 13 times. Additionally, Easton police officer Scott Cameron pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter after he shot and killed John E. Rapp in 1998. But that case was prosecuted by the state attorney general, not a district attorney. Our ruling Zappala’s campaign made the claim that he is ""the only DA in our state to convict an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide."" That claim was referring to the case of Officer Charmo, who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in 2001 and ultimately spent less than a year in prison. Two other police officers in different counties have also pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, but both were after an officer hit someone with their vehicle. Zappala’s campaign left out context that Charmo pleaded guilty and that two other officers also were guilty of the same charge as Charmo. But he does appear to be the only DA in Pennsylvania who won a conviction of an on-duty police officer in a shooting incident. We rule the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/28/stephen-zappala/messy-case-center-western-pa-attorney-general-cand/
"['Immigration', 'California', 'Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee']","
Mostly False Attack Distorts Congressman Jeff Denham’s Immigration Stance
"," In an effort to tie Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) to Donald Trump’s extremist views on immigration, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently claimed: Denham ""has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested and deported."" The statement by the DCCC, the political campaign arm of House Democrats, caught our attention because Denham is considered a moderate on immigration reform within the GOP. He’s rejected hard-line views and even co-sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform package introduced by Democrats. House Democrats have long coveted Denham’s seat, a potential swing district in California’s diverse Central Valley, and they’re targeting him once again this year. We decided to check whether Denham, a three-term incumbent, truly has agreed with this hard-line immigration stance — either recently or somewhere in his past. We also wondered whether the DCCC distorted Denham’s stance, in an effort to weaken his re-election chances. Our research The DCCC made its claim in a March 17 press release titled ""The Denham and The Donald Line Up Again Against Immigrant Families."" It includes a photo of the two Republicans standing next to each other. The DCCC has labeled Denham ""vulnerable"" to a Democratic challenger. The committee is backing Democrat Michael Eggman, a Central Valley beekeeper. Denham and Eggman will face each other in the June primary election and likely again in November. They squared off in 2014, with Denham defeating Eggman and retaining his heavily Latino district that includes Manteca, Modesto and Turlock. We asked the DCCC for evidence proving Denham has agreed unauthorized immigrants should be rounded up. A spokeswoman pointed to audio from a 2010 Republican primary debate between Denham and other candidates for Congress. She did not provide any more recent evidence.  In the audio above from the 2010 debate, the immigration question is asked at the 11:55 minute mark. Denham's response is at the 16:15 minute mark. Denham’s campaign spokesman did not respond to interview requests. During the 2010 debate, the candidates are asked: ""Do you believe that anyone who is here (in the United States) right now as an illegal immigrant should be detained, arrested and deported?"" Denham, who was serving in the California Legislature at the time, responded: ""The simple answer is: Yes, we’ve got to uphold the laws of our state, the laws of our nation. But as a state senator, one of the calls that I get frequently are those families that came here legally, that are working here legally and somehow lost their immigration status to no fault of their own."" From that both-sides-of-the-fence response, it’s a stretch to call Denham an extremist on immigration, said UC San Diego Political Science Professor Gary Jacobson. ""It’s not clear what (Denham’s) opinion is from that, really,"" added Jacobson, who studies Congress. He surmised the DCCC ""may have cherry picked"" the statement.  ‘As far as rounding people up’ A response from Denham to a question later in that same 2010 debate adds some clarity. He’s asked how the nation should pay for increased immigration enforcement. His answer stops well short of agreeing that ""all illegal immigrants"" should be deported, as the DCCC attributes to him. ""First, absolutely, we’ve got to make sure we’ve got a secure border. But as far as rounding people up, again, you’ve got to look at how they came here in the first place,"" Denham said. ""Did they come here illegally? Or did they come here legally and just have their citizenship expire?"" Jack Pitney, an expert on Republicans in Congress, said the DCCC claim doesn’t sound like something Denham has or would agree with.  ""Nobody’s ever going to mistake Jeff Denham for Donald Trump,"" added Pitney, who teaches at Claremont McKenna College. Our ruling  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claimed GOP Rep. Jeff Denham ""has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested and deported.""  It pointed to a response by Denham in a 2010 Republican primary debate, in which the congressman said: ""The simple answer is: Yes, we’ve got to uphold the laws of our state, the laws of our nation.""  In this response, Denham makes no effort to explicitly disagree with the moderator’s statement. But it’s a far stretch to say his answer shows Denham wanted to detain, arrest and deport all unauthorized immigrants. A later response from Denham in the same debate shows the congressman believed immigration enforcement should be judicious. He stopped well short of the idea of rounding up all unauthorized immigrants, saying some may be undocumented to no fault of their own.  The claim by the DCCC — which is backing Denham’s opponent in the June primary — contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Coalition To Save  Memorial Hospital Birthing Center']","
Memorial not alone in ‘mother-friendly’ births
","When Care New England announced its plan to eliminate some of Memorial Hospital’s services, including the obstetrics unit, it ignited an emotional debate about birthing in Rhode Island. The Health Department heard hours of testimony from mothers and nurses rallying around Memorial Hospital. But few voices have been stronger than those from the Coalition To Save Memorial Hospital Birthing Center. At the first hearing, held at Goff Junior High School in Pawtucket on March 13, Coalition leader  Alana Bibeau, a sociology professor at the University of Rhode Island, praised the Memorial unit  for its dedication to care for mothers.    ""This unit is the only one in the state that strives to implement the principles of Mother-Friendly care as outlined by the national Coalition for Improving Maternity Services Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative,"" Bibeau said in her remarks.   We had never heard of the ""Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative,"" but the title sounded official. Maybe it was the capital letters? We called Bibeau, and asked her for more information. What does it mean to be ""Mother-Friendly?"" Bibeau pointed us to the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services’ website. Here we found a list of 10 steps that hospitals, birth centers or home birth services can take to be more ""mother-friendly."" On this list are general recommendations such as allowing the mother to choose her own birth companions, and allowing her to walk around, eat and drink during labor. There are also more specific items regarding the use of IVs, membranes, and the use of analgesic or anesthetic drugs. ""Birth is a normal physiological process, not a medical emergency,"" Bibeau said in a telephone interview. ""Most hospitals view each woman as a potential candidate for surgery."" All of the steps, she said, lead to the ultimate goal of natural birth, with little to no intervention by doctors. A woman should be able to identify a birth plan with her doctor and stick to it, she said. (Bibeau did acknowledge that birth can take some ""very unexpected"" turns, and there may be medical need to deviate from the steps). That all makes sense, but could Memorial Hospital really be the only one in the state striving toward these principles? We asked Victoria Macioce-Stumpf — a doula from Michigan who also serves as a chair of  the coalition that supposedly provides this designation — if she could provide a list of all ""Mother-Friendly"" certified hospitals.    She could not, she said, because no such list exists. The Coalition for Improving Maternity Services does not have a formal certification process for hospitals. Rather, she said facilities are only ""highly encouraged"" to take the steps outlined on its website. ""There is a great deal of rigorous work as well as money""  that must be spent  to create a [certification] program of this type, she wrote in an email. ""Something we have not as yet had the means or manpower to initiate."" Rhode Island does not certify hospitals as ""Mother-Friendly,"" either. Nor does the state endorse these principles for their birthing units. But ""this is not to say, of course, that we don’t believe that there is merit to some of their commitments,"" said Joseph Wendelken, public information officer for the Rhode Island Department of Health. The Rhode Island Department of Health has licensed six hospitals for childbirth: Kent, Landmark, Newport, South County, Women & Infants and Memorial  (for now).  All of these facilities, Wendelken said, are ""held to extremely high standards"" set at the national level by The Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that accredits hospitals. About 90 percent of Rhode Island babies are born at Care New England facilities, according to Angelleen Peters-Lewis, a chief nurse for the group. Women & Infants delivers on average 8,400 babies a year, Kent 1,200 babies, and Memorial less than 500, Peters-Lewis said. We also asked officials at Newport Hospital, South County Hospital, and Landmark Medical Center. Many had not heard of the ""Mother-Friendly"" standards, but they all agreed that the principles are practiced in their facilities. Jackie Toole, a staff RN at South County Hospital, said she follows these steps every day. Danika Wynn, the director of Landmark’s midwifery program, said the hospital ""strives to build a maternity-care culture that mirrors Memorial’s,"" and in doing so, meets many of the The Coalition for Improving Maternity Services standards. Same goes for Denise Sullivan, the director of women’s health and newborn services at Newport Hospital. ""We try to keep the patient in the middle of our circle,"" Sullivan said. ""So we are trying to let the mother work with the health care team to get the kind of birth that she wants."" Sullivan also pointed out that her hospital is ""Baby-Friendly"" certified, a UNICEF and World Health Organization distinction for taking steps to encourage breast feeding. Women & Infants is also ""Baby-Friendly."" Memorial Hospital has not attained that certification. We asked Bibeau about this, and she referred us to Kaeli Sutton, another leader of the coalition to save memorial hospital. ""While other maternity institutions verbally state their philosophical commitment to the MFCI, the Coalition sees no credible evidence that they have committed the necessary time, financial resources, policy development and staff training necessary to claim true alignment with the Initiative,"" she wrote in an email. OUR RULING:  Bibeau said Memorial Hospital’s birthing center is the only Rhode Island center that strives to accomplish the goals set out by the ""Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative"" from the national Coalition for Improving Maternity Services Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative.    Bibeau said Memorial Hospital’s birthing center is the only Rhode Island center that strives to accomplish the goals set out by the ""Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative"" from the national Coalition for Improving Maternity Services Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative.  Not only does the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services not review and certify facilities, but all of the other birthing centers in the state say these principles are standard practice at their hospitals.  
 The Coalition to Save Memorial Hospital Birthing Center got back to us Friday. A spokeswoman said: ""the Coalition sees no credible evidence that [other hospitals in Rhode Island] have committed the necessary time, financial resources, policy development and staff training necessary to claim true alignment with the Initiative."" At the end of the week, the coalition changed its position from a statement of fact to an opinion about the other hospitals' ""true alignment."" We rate the original claim False.  ",/factchecks/2016/mar/27/coalition-save-memorial-hospital-birthing-center-p/memorial-not-alone-mother-friendly-births/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Missouri', 'Vicky Hartzler']","
Rep. Hartzler ignores critical facts about workforce statistics
","Following the State of the Union and President Barack Obama’s claims of job creation, one member of Missouri’s congressional delegation said things aren’t so promising. U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Columbia, said, ""We have less Americans working now than back in the ‘70s, so we do need to still address that and get our economy going."" We reached out to Hartzler’s office to get a better idea of what she meant. Communications Director Kyle Buckles said the congresswoman was referring to the employment-population ratio from 1978 and 1979. We looked into these numbers, as well as some other measures to gauge the portion of the population that is working. Employment-Population Ratio The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines the employment-population ratio as the proportion of civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 16 years and over that is employed. This chart shows the ratio throughout the 1970s.  The data show that in only one year, 1979, the employment-population ratio was higher than it was in 2015. In one year, 1978, it was the same as in 2015. In every other year, the ratio was lower. Labor Force Participation Another frequently cited indicator used to compare employment numbers is the labor force participation rate. This is a little different from the employment-population ratio because it compares how many people are in the labor market — whether they have a job or not — to the total number of people who could be working. One tricky issue with these numbers is how the aging population has affected the labor force between the 1970s and 2015. During testimony before a Congressional committee, Elisabeth Jacobs, a senior director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, said the clearest cause for a declining labor force participation rate is the aging population. ""The Baby Boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is a large cohort of workers whose retirement age coincides with decline in labor force participation that began in 2000. As these workers retired, they left the labor force and in turn pushed down the total labor force participation rate.""  If we use the two years Hartzler’s staff said she was referencing, 1978 and 1979, we find the labor force participation rates were 63.2 percent and 63.7 percent respectively. Both of those numbers are greater than 2015’s rate of 62.88 percent. However, we again had to wonder about the first eight years of the decade. The rate in 1970 was 60.4 percent and it grew steadily to 62.3 percent in 1977, but it didn’t rise above 2015’s rate in that time. Number of Workers According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population grew from 202 million in 1970 to 308 million in 2010. While the population grew, did the number of Americans working fall to 1970 levels? Bureau of Labor Statistics reports show that by the end of the 1970s, there were nearly 105 million people in the workforce. In 2015, that number had reached more than 155 million. These data show a nearly 50 percent increase in the absolute number of Americans working in 2015 compared to the late 1970s.  Our Ruling Hartzler said, ""We have less Americans working now than in the ‘70s."" The statistics Hartzler’s staff said she cited show the employment-population ratio and labor force participation rate was indeed higher in 1979 than in 2015. However, Hartzler was talking about the entire decade of the ‘70s. When we look at all the years, the claim doesn’t stack up. The first eight years of the decade, 1970 through 1977, have a lower employment-population ratio and a lower labor force participation rate than 2015. Hartzler’s claim does contain an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts and statistics that would give it a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/mar/26/vicky-hartzler/rep-hartzler-ignores-critical-facts-about-workforc/
"['Terrorism', 'Texas', 'Sid Miller']","
Sid Miller posts fake photo of Obama holding Che Guevara T-shirt
","During President Barack Obama’s historic trip to Cuba, he took in a baseball game, met with leader Raul Castro and attended a wreath ceremony for a Cuban journalist and poet. In the background of the ceremony was a mural of Marxist revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara several stories high on the side of a building. Guevara, who met exiled brothers Fidel and Raul Castro in Mexico in 1955, and was a key figure in the Cuban Revolution that overthrew the dictator Fulgencio Batista. Obama’s photo in front of the mural drew criticism, but according to one Republican politician, it wasn’t the only such picture. Back in Texas, Sid Miller, the state’s agriculture commissioner, posted a photo to his Facebook fan page that provided a rare, if unseen, glimpse into Obama’s Havana trip from 1,000 miles away. In a March 22, 2016 post on his Facebook fan page, Miller shared a photo of the president holding a blue T-shirt adorned with the face of Guevara, with the caption: ""President Obama refuses to return to the United States in order to meet with European leaders to discuss a response to today's terror attacks in Brussels -- attacks that severely injured a number of Americans. Instead, he remains in Cuba holding a shirt depicting the image of Che Guevara--one of the most reviled terrorists of the modern age -- a murdering thug who was responsible for thousands of innocent deaths. President Obama is laughing at us. He understands the symbolism of this picture and yet he doesn't care. I believe his actions are disgraceful. Do you agree?"" First, a little background. As Texas' agriculture commissioner, Miller is charged with running the national school breakfast and lunch programs, protecting crops from pests and disease and regulating all fuel pumps in the state, among other duties. He also has a flair for newsworthy behavior. In his first act as commissioner, he granted amnesty to cupcakes as an approved dessert and got national attention for lifting a ban to allow deep fat fryers back in public schools. His Facebook presence shares headline-grabbing material. In one example, a photo on his Facebook page showed a detonated atom bomb with a caption that read, ""Japan has been at peace with the US since August 9, 1945. It’s time we made peace with the Muslim world."" The photo was taken down less than 24 hours later.  Miller’s team said a staffer posted the photo, not him. Recently, he’s drawn attention for taking a taxpayer-funded trip to Oklahoma to get a supposed cure-all injection known as the ""Jesus Shot."" Back to the images. It’s clear a photo captured Obama in front of a Guevara mural. But Miller claimed he went further and picked up a shirt on his oft-criticized Cuba trip. Standing in front of an image that’s permanently there and voluntarily holding up that same image are different things. We had to know if the leader of the free world knowingly posed with an image of the revolutionary, as Miller claimed. We called Miller’s office and emailed the White House; neither immediately replied. But we quickly came across several news articles declaring the photo a fake -- including a Houston Chronicle story that found an image believed to be the original from a 2009 presidential visit to a lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the original photo, Obama is holding a T-shirt emblazoned with lengthy equations, which an online thread describes as the ""Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the conservation-of-mass equation."" Next, we did a reverse Google image search to determine if similar images exist. The Chronicle article read through comments on Miller’s Facebook post alleging the photo was fake, and found a Reddit thread from 2009 that explained the science on the original T-shirt in question. Our results brought up ""visually similar images"" of Obama holding up a blue T-shirt with a series of equations on them, as well as links to pages that included matching images. Most links were from Getty Images, showing Obama in 2009 also wearing the same pink dotted tie. Another link went to a San Antonio Current article debunking the photo. The photo caption: ""US President Barack Obama holds a T-shirt given to him as he toured a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), an institution that has been developing cutting-edge clean energy technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 23, 2009."" Even in the background of the Miller Facebook photo, behind Obama’s head, there is a poster labeled ""Center for Excitonics."" In the Getty image picture, the poster is in the same position. An online search for the center landed us on the center’s MIT web page. So, we wondered, did Obama drop in at some time and did he smile while holding a blue T shirt? We called and emailed the lab to ask if the supposed original Getty image was taken there, and if Obama visited in 2009. Kimberly Allen, MIT’s media relations director, replied to our email and confirmed the Getty image link we included in the email was in fact taken in their lab, and the president visited in October 2009. Allen said MIT did not own the original photo of Obama holding up the T-shirt, but she provided a web link to a photo of the president dressed in the same suit exploring a lab with a poster in the background reading ""Center for Excitonics."" Also, in the reverse Google image search, some of the ""visually similar images"" showed Obama holding the T-shirt in the lab with a man with a beard in a colorful printed shirt. In the link Allen sent over, the header image showed Obama watching the same man, Professor Alex Slocum, do a demonstration. As of March 25, the post and photo remained on Miller's Facebook page despite several comments below it linking to news articles such as the Chronicle’s claiming the picture is fake. Our ruling Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller posted a picture on Facebook showing President Obama holding a T-shirt with Marxist revolutionary figure Che Guevara’s face on it. The photo accompanies a mini-rant from Miller complaining that the president was rubbing elbows with Cuba’s communist leaders instead of flying back to Washington in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels. The pic is a doctored version of a photo from Obama’s 2009 visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Excitonics Lab. The T-shirt in the original photo read ""And Moses said "" followed by equations that govern the flow of fluids, concluding ""and the waters parted."" Get it? (A lot of nerds weren’t impressed either, questioning why Moses saying the equations out loud would cause the Red Sea to part, a scene more reminiscent of witchcraft than the invisible hand of God.) Any suggestion the president picked up an inappropriate souvenir on his Cuban trip was based on Photoshop, not fact. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Testing Rebecca Bradley claim that lawyers 'on a regular basis' do what she did in family law case
","Critics of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley say her decision to represent a former boyfriend in a contested family law case raises questions about her judgment. Bradley counters by noting that the judge in the case determined Bradley’s representation didn’t violate any ethical rules. And she contends that what she did is done by lawyers on a regular basis -- which is something we want to check. Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardin asked Bradley, who is being challenged by state Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg in the April 5, 2016 Supreme Court election, about the case. ""I was helping out a friend,"" Bradley responded in the March 21, 2016 interview. ""This is something that lawyers do on a regular basis, to help out friends or family members who need assistance in these types of cases."" We know it’s common for a lawyer to represent a friend or family member in more mundane cases, such as a speeding ticket or a real estate transaction. But in this instance we’re talking about a business lawyer, as Bradley was, representing a former boyfriend in a family law case in which a couple was fighting over child placement. The case About a week and half before the interview, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the family law case involving J. Andrew Bednall. Case records show Bednall’s ex-wife had objected to Bradley representing Bednall. The court-appointed attorney for their son also expressed concerns. Ethics rules prevent lawyers from having sexual relationships with clients. However, they do not prevent lawyers from representing clients if a romantic relationship existed prior to the attorney-client relationship. Bradley responded in court papers filed in 2005. She said she and Bednall previously had a romantic relationship that ""we both believed might result in marriage."" She wrote that that part of the relationship ended in November 2002, but that they continued to date ""on a nonexclusive basis"" at the time of the custody case. The judge on the case declined to remove Bradley from the case on ethical grounds, according to the public filings. Bradley’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests to back the statement we’re checking. Family law experts We talked with five lawyers, four from the Milwaukee area and one from Madison, who have more than 100 years of combined experience in family law cases. Retired Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Lee Wells, who headed the family law division for eight years and still handles family cases as a reserve judge and mediator, said he has seen non-family law attorneys handle family cases and has seen lawyers in family cases represent someone they had or were having a relationship with. But he said he couldn’t characterize how common it is, partly because there likely were instances where lawyers didn’t disclose their lack of family law experience, or didn’t disclose that they were representing someone they had been involved with romantically. The other four lawyers, however, said that in their decades of experience, they could not recall even one case like Bradley’s, in which a lawyer represents a former boyfriend in a contested family law case. Our rating Bradley says her representation of an ex-boyfriend ""who was then my friend"" in a family law case is ""something that lawyers do on a regular basis."" But we found no evidence of that. Four of five longtime family law lawyers told us such representation is not done regularly -- they had never seen a lawyer represent a former boyfriend in a contested family law case. The other expert said he could recall cases similar to Bradley’s, but couldn’t say whether they occurred on a regular basis.

Clinton: U.S. Congress hasn't 'allocated one penny' to fight Zika
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stepped into the Zika funding debate and chastised Congress for failing to step up to the plate. ""Congress should meet President (Barack) Obama’s request for $1.8 billion in emergency appropriations to fight Zika,"" Clinton said March 18, 2016 on Medium. ""The president asked for this funding over a month ago, but on Saturday, Congress will begin a two-week break without having allocated one penny."" Clinton went on to note that ""Congressional Republicans said the administration should use funds left over from fighting Ebola — even though that money is still being used. Why would we lower our defenses against one public health threat in order to meet another one? That’s senseless and dangerous. Congress needs to provide the funds to fight Zika now."" We were curious whether Congress recessed without ""allocating a single penny"" to deal with the Zika virus. The Zika virus has spread rapidly in South America and is making inroads in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico, but in many mainland states as well. The mosquito-borne disease has been linked to birth defects and neurological disorders. On Feb. 8, Obama asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to expand mosquito control programs in the states, accelerate vaccine research and take a number of other steps to rein in the disease. By the budget rules in Washington, emergency funding is not controlled by the deficit reduction spending caps that apply to most programs. At first, Republicans sounded receptive. A few days after the administration’s request, House Speaker Paul Ryan said ""we do anticipate some kind of bipartisan action on this, because this is something we want to get ahead of."" On Feb. 18, the GOP chair of the House Appropriations Committee, joined by two Republican subcommittee chairs, told the White House Office of Management and Budget that before it asked for new money, it should use dollars left over from the emergency response provided to fight Ebola. ""If the aim of the request is to mount as rapid a response as possible, it is clear to us that the most expeditious way to identify the needed funding is to maximize the use of unobligated funds previously provided for Ebola response, prevention, and preparedness."" The House Republicans said they estimated that $2.7 billion remained unused out of the original $5.4 billion emergency appropriation. They noted that under the rules of the emergency appropriation, about $400 million of those funds need to be spent by the end of September. We’ll dig a little deeper into that Ebola money in a moment, but to settle one piece of this fact-check, in terms of committing new dollars explicitly to combat the Zika virus, Congress has not done that. The remaining Ebola money Jennifer Kates, director of the Kaiser Family Foundation’s program on global health and HIV policy, tracks Washington spending in this area about as closely as anyone. Kates told us that the Republican number might be a bit high, but by her latest count, about $2.4 billion of Ebola funding remains. So in theory, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department’s Agency for International Development (USAID) could redirect some of that money to fight Zika. But there are some issues to unpack. First, Congress appropriated many of those dollars to be spent over a period of five years. For example, the funding bill gave the CDC over $1.7 billion with the broad instruction to ""prevent, prepare for, and respond to Ebola domestically and internationally."" ""Initially, they recognized that part of the job involved building the health care systems over time,"" Kates said. ""They wanted the tools to be in place so we could be on top of things when another outbreak took place. And we know there will be other outbreaks, of Ebola or something else."" There are plenty of examples of lawmakers, both Republican and Democratic, talking about the Ebola money as a longer term investment. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a high-ranking subcommittee chair on the appropriations committee, held a hearing in April 2015 to review the impact of the emergency funding. Cole opened the hearing saying he wanted to discuss ""the lessons learned from this outbreak and how the funding Congress provided will support longer term public health capacity."" At another appropriations subcommittee hearing in February 2015, Dirk Dijkerman, USAID’s coordinator for its Ebola Task Force described how his agency was using the money as the immediate Ebola threat eased. ""We are focusing on building more resilient health and prepared systems in West Africa, in other hot spots in Africa,"" Dijkerman said. ""Our goal is to detect, prevent and respond to future outbreaks before they become global security threats."" So while one could make the case that the emergency Ebola money was intended to be used for a future outbreak, much of the discussion was not about putting out fires, but about building health care infrastructure. CDC director Thomas Frieden told the House Appropriations Committee on March 23, 2016, that while his agency was working hard to tackle the Zika virus, ""we will not be able to do so without the resources requested in the administration's FY 2016 emergency supplemental request."" ""If you look at the definition of emergency -- unanticipated, potentially catastrophic, permanent damage -- I can't imagine a situation that meets this more than Zika,"" Frieden said. ""There has never before been a mosquito borne illness that can cause a birth defect; we've never seen that before."" Frieden said all of the dollars Congress had allocated before were for specific activities. While he could move dollars around, he warned that there would be trade-offs. Kates said a long-running debate in Washington lies behind this current tug-of-war. ""We have an episodic response to these things,"" Kates said. ""There's an interest in having a steady stream of funding to build up the systems we'd need to respond to new outbreaks, but that doesn't seem to be the way things are done."" Our ruling Clinton said that Congress had not ""allocated one penny"" to fight Zika. In terms of targeting new dollars to deal with the Zika virus, that is correct. House Republicans say that they did provide money through the emergency Ebola appropriation. To the extent that those funds could be redirected, that holds up. But it is also true that when that money was approved there was a bipartisan agreement that it would be used for longer term efforts to build overall health care system capacity. There is a policy disagreement on the best way to deploy federal funds -- and we're not weighing in on that here. But regardless, there is no new money to confront Zika. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/25/hillary-clinton/clinton-congress-hasnt-allocated-one-penny-fight-z/

McAuliffe is right that Virginia tops states in agricultural exports to Cuba
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe sees Cuba as a land of opportunity. Amid President Barack Obama’s historic trip to Cuba this past week, McAuliffe said in an interview that Virginia already has made impressive headway in tapping the island nation’s export market. ""Virginia now is the number one exporter of ag (agricultural) products to Cuba,"" McAuliffe said during a March 21 MSNBC interview. ""We have now jumped to number one."" In January, the governor returned from a trip to Cuba aimed at bolstering the commonwealth’s commercial ties with the nation. The U.S. still has a decades-long embargo on most trade with Cuba. But a 2000 law allows limited exports of agricultural products and medical equipment. In 2014, Obama re-established formal diplomatic relations with Cuba. McAuliffe supports ending the trade embargo. Brian Coy, the governor’s spokesman, pointed us to a Feb. 12 news release where McAuliffe announced that last year Virginia exported $41.6 million in agricultural goods to Cuba, all of it soybeans and soybean meal. In past years, Virginia also has shipped apples, poultry and beef. McAuliffe said the 2015 export tally was the most that any state had sent to Cuba that year. We tracked down the same trade figures through an online database provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It shows that in 2015, Virginia’s $41.6 million indeed was the most of any state, followed by Georgia, which had $30.9 million in agricultural exports to Cuba; and Florida, which had $29.9 million in exports. Rounding out the top five agricultural exporters to Cuba were Alabama and Louisiana. Altogether, the U.S. exported nearly $150 million in agricultural goods to Cuba last year. A 2015 article from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond noted Virginia’s farm exports accounted for 28 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports last year, compared with the 21 percent share for Georgia and 20 percent share for Florida. Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Louisiana generally have dominated the share of U.S. exports to Cuba since 2011. McAuliffe is correct that the 2015 figures are a turnabout of sorts for Virginia. In 2012, the state had $65.6 million in agricultural exports to Cuba, and that fell to $24.9 million in 2014, ranking it fifth behind those other four Southern states. Last year was the first time Virginia reached the goal of becoming the top agricultural exporter to Cuba, said Todd Haymore, the state’s secretary of agriculture and forestry. Haymore told us Virginia and other Southern states’ proximity to Cuba provides an advantage in tapping the Cuban market. Other factors helped, he said. For example, Georgia has focused on expanding an agricultural export facility in Savannah, Haymore said. Florida, meanwhile, has extensive port operations, the secretary said. Haymore said a ""significant"" share of Virginia’s agricultural exports to Cuba were produced in the commonwealth, although he added that Virginia’s ports also ship products that originate from other states, including Maryland and North Carolina. This year, it looks like Virginia has some serious competition if it wants to retain its billing as the top agricultural exporter to Cuba. Figures from January, the only month for which export figures are available so far this year, show that Louisiana sent $17.9 million in agricultural exports to Cuba that month, and Alabama sent $2.1 million. Virginia’s $1.7 million ranked third. While Virginia has seen its exports to Cuba go up and down and then back up in recent years, it’s been a different story for U.S. trade to the island nation. The total value of all U.S. exports to Cuba actually has been waning, even amid White House overtures to open trade. U.S. exports to Cuba dropped from $464.5 million in 2012 to $180.3 million last year, according to figures from the U.S. Commerce Department. Our ruling McAuliffe said Virginia is the top exporter of agricultural products to Cuba. The numbers from the latest year available back his claim.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders was the roll call amendment king from 1995 to 2007
","Bernie Sanders is often criticized for ""pie-in-the-sky"" proposals and impractical ideals, but his campaign argues the Vermont senator actually gets things done. ""Bernie Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member,"" according to a TV ad paid for by the Sanders campaign.   A version of this ad appears on Sanders’ YouTube channel, and Sanders has made this claim on Twitter and Facebook as well so we wondered if it was true. The Sanders campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found that this carefully worded statement is accurate for his earlier years in Congress. The ‘amendment king’ Sanders served in the House of Representatives from 1991 to 2006 and has been in the Senate since then. Republicans were in control of the House from 1995 to 2007 and of the Senate from 2015 to present. In 2005, Rolling Stone named Sanders the ""amendment king"" of the House. At the time, the title held true with a specific qualification: amendments agreed to by record votes. (Amendments can also be passed with voice votes, in which the volume of yeas and nays dictates passage, or by unanimous consent, in which no one raises an objection.) Out of 419 amendments Sanders sponsored over his 25 years in Congress, 90 passed, 21 of them by roll call votes. Here’s a breakdown (bold indicates Republican Congresses): Total amendments passed Passed by roll call vote 2015 to present 4 1 2007 to 2015 37 3 1995 to 2007 49 17 1991 to 1995 0 0 Total 90 21 From 1995 to 2007, Sanders passed 17 amendments by a recorded roll call vote — more than any other member in the House. Ohio Democrat James Traficant came in second with 16 roll call amendments, but he served five less years than Sanders after being indicted on several corruption charges in 2002 and then expelled from Congress. If we look at all amendments, not just those passed by roll call votes, Traficant passed 72 more than Sanders. New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, who served in the same time period as Sanders, finished third with 14 roll call amendments (and 32 overall amendments). Craig Volden, an expert on the legislative process at the University of Virginia, told PolitiFact that records like these are rather unusual in the House. ""There are so few members with large numbers of substantive and successful amendments,"" he said. ""Sanders and Traficant were exceptions to that rule."" In comparison, Hillary Clinton passed zero roll call amendments during her tenure as a senator from New York from 2001-09. Overall effectiveness In the current Congress, Sanders ranks fourth when it comes to the number of career roll call amendments passed, according GovTrack founder, Josh Tauberer. The three lawmakers who top him are Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., with 27 in 15 years in Congress; Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., with 24 in 33 years; and Rep Steve King, R-Iowa, with 22 in 13 years. Roll call amendments aside, Sanders isn’t shattering any legislative records, though he’s not doing poorly either. Tauberer’s research places Sanders at No. 14 in Congress with 90 amendments. The other senator from Vermont, Democrat Patrick Leahy, on the other hand, has passed 226. Of course, amendments are just one of the ways lawmakers press their agendas. Sanders has had much less luck with passing bills. During his 25 years in Congress, Sanders introduced 324 bills, three of which became law. This includes a bill in a Republican Congress naming a post office in Vermont and two more while Democrats had control (one naming another Vermont post office and another increasing veterans’ disability compensation). Clinton, for the record, also passed three bills in eight years. But the sparse number of bills isn’t surprising. Volden and Vanderbilt University’s Alan Wiseman assess the legislative effectiveness of House members by comparing their records to a benchmark. According to this analysis, Sanders has either met or exceeded expectations during his tenure in the House (bold indicates Republican Congresses): Congress Grade Benchmark score Effectiveness score 1991-1992 Meets expectations 0.422 0.335 1993-1994 Meets expectations 0.411 0.219 1995-1996 Exceeds expectations 0.199 0.463 1997-1998 Exceeds expectations 0.258 0.347 1999-2000 Meets expectations 0.397 0.231 2001-2002 Meets expectations 0.439 0.343 2003-2004 Meets expectations 0.493 0.266 2005-2006 Meets expectations 0.514 0.379 Lawmakers who belong to the party in control are five times more likely to have their bills go anywhere than minority party members, according to Volden. So Sanders’ legislative approach may seem like fixating on small potatoes, but for an independent who caucuses with the minority party, it’s a smart strategy. ""He could have either resigned himself to that fate, changed the nature of his legislation and coalition-building strategy, or offered amendments on the floor,"" Volden said. ""He chose the third of these paths, making him more influential in shaping policy than if he had taken the first path. Why he did not take the second path is an open question — likely linked to his ideological views."" Our ruling A campaign ad for Sander said, ""Bernie Sanders passed more roll call amendments in a Republican Congress than any other member."" That’s a very specific way of slicing and dicing Sanders’ effectiveness as a lawmaker, but it’s accurate. From 1995 to 2007, when Republicans controlled Congress, Sanders passed the most roll call amendments (17) out of anyone in the House of Representatives.

Bernie Sanders' ad says Trans-Pacific Partnership could cost 448,000 jobs
","Bernie Sanders’ campaign is flooding Ohio airwaves with a TV ad that attacks the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a job killer. ""The Trans-Pacific trade deal could cost America 448,000 more jobs,"" says the narrator of the ad, which has run 200 times in Cincinnati and Cleveland, according to the Political TV Ad Archive. Railing against foreign trade deals is a running theme in Sanders’ campaign. He’s been quoted saying that he opposed every trade deal that has called for his vote, and that NAFTA, CAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China are ""a disaster for the American worker.""  (Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, even though she used to promote it as secretary of state.) The ad says the deal among 12 Pacific Rim countries could cost America 448,000 jobs. Since Sanders is using such a specific figure, we wanted to know where that number is coming from, and how other experts view that estimate. Is it possible for anyone to know how many jobs the deal could cost the United States? The TPP’s table of contents is exhausting to look at. There are 30 chapters, with titles like ""Textiles and Apparel"" and ""Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures."" Jeronim Capaldo, research fellow with the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University, is the chief author of the study that came up with 448,000 jobs lost as a result of the TPP. He explained the elements behind that projection. Other economists use models that assume a baseline of either 100-percent employment, or a static annual employment rate, and calculate from there, Capaldo said. Those models look at trade as though it’s in a vacuum, without consideration of what workers in the world economy might experience. He believes that his study is more realistic. ""The first step is to understand the effect that this trade deal would have on growth, which in economics is GDP,"" Capaldo said, ""and the second is the effect that a change in GDP would have on employment, based on the analysis of 50 years of data that we have for every country in the world."" In the United States, total income has decreased constantly since the mid 1970s, Capaldo said. ""That is pretty defining in people’s lives, and if it’s constant, it’s a significant element of the story."" The Tufts model projected employers’ short-term costs going up as a result of the TPP, Capaldo said. In reaction, bosses cut pay, which negatively impacts workers’ ability to buy stuff. A loss in consumption goes hand-in-hand with a loss in investment, and those two factors result in further job loss. And the types of jobs that would be lost are an important part of the story. ""Take the case of Oregon,"" he said. ""People who lose jobs on ranches and factories in eastern Oregon aren’t going to turn around and immediately find a high-tech job in Portland. It doesn’t happen that way."" We found another economist who agrees that the TPP will cost jobs, but not quite to the prediction Capaldo’s study makes. Dean Baker, the co-director at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the 448,000-jobs figure ""wouldn’t be my best guess, but it’s not an obviously ridiculous number."" Baker said the gains and losses go both ways. Trade deals ""open up our markets, but we import much more than we export,"" Baker said. That means we are operating at a trade deficit, and when there is less demand in our economy, that leads to higher unemployment. ""Implicitly, if we had a smaller trade deficit, we’d be closer to full employment,"" he said. The Tufts researchers were too pessimistic in their predictions, Baker said. ""Assuming nothing will offset the job losses is an overly strong assumption,"" Baker said. ""The Tufts study fails to acknowledge countervailing effects. Factors outside the trade deal will counteract job loss caused by the trade deal. So the actual number is likely to be less."" For example, he explained, increased unemployment in manufacturing due to the TPP and increased imports might lead to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates often encourage construction and development, and investments in those sectors, which would create jobs in construction and development. But the manufacturing sector would still take a hit. We got a very contrary opinion from Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which favors free trade. He told us he regards the 448,000 figure as  ""somewhere between junk and rubbish."" Hufbauer analyzed the NAFTA trade deal in a paper, ""NAFTA at 20,"" which went over similar ground with regard to trade deals and employment. ""We found zero association between freer trade agreements and larger employment deficits,"" he said, adding, ""The model the Tufts researchers use is not available. They don’t publish it, so it’s hard to check it."" Capaldo, who co-authored the Tufts study, laughed a little when we asked him about access to his model. He told us that models are made up of two things: the description of the methodology used, and the code that computes the data to achieve the predicted outcome. ""There is not a single organization that makes their computer code public,"" Capaldo said. ""I compare it to a restaurant. You look at the menu and see the ingredients and you can ask the waiter how a dish is made. They’ll give you everything that’s in there, but they won’t give you the recipe. They’ll give you all you need to understand how it’s done, but they won’t give you the code. The computer code is the chef-work."" Other publicly available economic models, he said, are merely templates. Our ruling Sanders’ ad says that the Trans-Pacific Partnership ""could cost America 448,000 more jobs."" We’ve asked economists to sort out the good and bad of trade deals before, and found that their opinions on outcomes can be wildly contradictory. So when it comes to predicting such outcomes, it really depends on whose Magic 8 Ball you use. It’s important for people to understand that this number is an estimate, and it’s the biggest estimate we found. Critics of the Tufts study say it goes the furthest to predict doomsday figures, without acknowledging offsetting effects. The author of the Tufts study says that other research glosses over the real-world elements that change the lives of workers in a global economy. A one-liner can’t possibly capture the possible outcome of a War and Peace-sized trade proposal.

Bill Clinton claims Americans haven’t gotten raises since economic downturn
","While lobbying for his wife in Phoenix March 20, former President Bill Clinton said the country’s political gridlock is not the only source of frustration for people. ""People in both parties are upset by the fact that 80 percent of the American people haven’t gotten a pay raise since the crash,"" Clinton said. The December 2007 recession destroyed Arizona’s housing market, also drying up construction jobs. Hillary Clinton made a similar statement in a campaign advertisement in February, noting that Americans haven’t had a ""raise in 15 years."" PolitiFact found an increase in weekly earnings between January 2000 and January 2015, but median household income dropped between January 1999 and January 2014. Household income is a more complete measure of income growth, since it may include Social Security or income from investments. PolitiFact rated this claim Mostly True. But what about wages from the recession to now? We decided to look into Bill Clinton’s claim. Same salary Bill Clinton’s spokesman, Angel Urena, provided us with multiple studies done by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute on the issue. We reached out to the D.C. think tank directly, which analyzes the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau. ""The statement is largely correct. Real, inflation-adjusted wages were stagnant for the bottom 80 percent of the wage distribution between 2007 and 2014,"" said Economic Policy Institute spokesman Dan Crawford. Real wages did increase 1.7 percent in 2015, but Crawford noted that was because of a one-time dip in inflation. Wage inequality still increased across the board in 2015. Other experts generally agreed with Bill Clinton’s claim. Bill Lester, an economic development professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed the Economic Policy Institute’s income data from 1973 to 2012. From 2008 to 2012, wages for the bottom 80 percent either declined or did not change at all. Our ruling Bill Clinton said, ""80 percent of the American people haven’t gotten a pay raise since the crash."" The former president is accurate. While there were modest increases in real wages and median weekly earnings in 2015, they come with asterisks. Inflation’s one-time decline in 2015 is an outlier. And, weekly wages leaves out other sources of income. Some households rely on sources outside of wages and salaries as part of their income.

Paul Ryan says Cuba is a 'safe harbor' for fugitives and terrorists
","As President Barack Obama works to restore relations with Cuba, opponents of the policy shift cite Cuban practices that they see as contradictory to U.S. interests. ""To this day, this is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., in a March 17 news conference. We were curious about Ryan’s claim, particularly because last year the Obama administration removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba first made the list in 1982, when the country was actively supporting communist revolutions in the thick of the Cold War. There are some U.S. fugitives and a handful of terrorists living in Cuba, but experts told us these are more remnants of the Cold War rather than a staple of modern Cuban policy. Ryan’s statement is ""accurate but outdated,"" said Ted Piccone, senior fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Project on International Order and Strategy and Latin America Initiative. Fugitives We weren’t able to pin down a more recent number, but the State Department said in a 2008 report that more than 70 U.S. fugitives lived in Cuba, some receiving protection and resources from the Cuban government. The list includes individuals accused of murder, hijacking and even insurance fraud. Piccone said it’s fair to say these fugitives are under ""safe harbor"" in Cuba. Joanne Chesimard might be the most high-profile U.S. fugitive living in Cuba. Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army, was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1973. She escaped prison and fled to Cuba in 1984. There’s also William ""Guillermo"" Morales, a member of Puerto Rican militant group Armed Forces of National Liberation, who was convicted on weapons charges in New York in 1979. A State Department report published in 2015 said Cuba has been more cooperative with the United States on this front in recent years, and the two countries have engaged in talks about returning some of these fugitives. While Cuba has been returning wanted criminals to the United States on a case-by-case basis, the Cuban government generally has declined to return fugitives they perceive as political, according to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The Cuban government also believes the United States harbors Cuban fugitives, like Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile convicted of bombing a Cuban airliner in 1976, who now lives in Miami. And if fugitive exchange talks are to move forward between the two countries, Cuba will want its fugitives to be on the table, Piccone said. Terrorists Who are the ""terrorists"" who live in Cuba? About two dozen members of Spanish separatist group Basque Fatherland and Liberty, designated by the State Department as a foreign terrorist group, live in Cuba with permission from the Cuban government. There’s no evidence to show that Cuba has allowed these individuals to conduct terrorist activity while in Cuba, according to the State Department. In his statement, Ryan was referring to this group, a spokesperson said. Cuba has significantly ratcheted back its support for U.S.-designated terrorist groups since the early 1990s, said Frank Mora, a professor at Florida International University and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Western Hemisphere under Obama. During the Cold War, when Cuba sided with the Soviet Union, Cuba supported what it perceived as liberation movements around the world. But the United States viewed many of those communist groups as terrorist organizations, like the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. When the Cold War ended in 1991, however, Cuba recalculated, Mora said. Cuba pulled out of these movements in order to focus on internal economic problems and, in part, to not give the United States any reason to amp up its anti-Cuba policies. ""In recent years, Cuba has taken a number of steps to fully distance itself from international terrorism and has taken steps to strengthen its counterterrorism laws,"" the State Department found. For example, Cuba has enacted policies to criminalize terrorist financing. And Cuba has shared counterterrorism intelligence with the Obama administration and condemned various recent terrorist attacks, according to the CRS report. ""Cuba has not been identified for several years for supporting international terrorism,"" Piccone said. While Ryan’s statement is technically correct — as there are U.S. fugitives and some members of a U.S.-designated terrorist group living on Cuban soil — his phrasing doesn’t capture the positive change in this arena that has happened in Cuba over the past quarter century, Mora said. ""He’s implicitly suggesting there’s a flow of fugitives and terrorists coming to Cuba, and that’s not true,"" Mora said. Our ruling Ryan said, ""To this day, (the Cuban government) is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives."" There are some U.S. fugitives and members of a Spanish separatist group living in Cuba with the Cuban government’s permission. But Ryan’s statement misses an important nuance: In the past couple decades, Cuba has been more cooperative with the United States in terms of returning fugitives, and the country has cut ties with foreign organizations designated by the United States as terrorist groups. Significantly, the United States recently removed Cuba’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. Ryan’s statement is accurate but could use that additional clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/24/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-cuba-safe-harbor-fugitives-and-terr/

No, Donald Trump, winning 66 of 67 Florida counties is not 'unprecedented'

""Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before,"" Trump said March 21. It is true that he won 66 counties (Sen. Marco Rubio won his birthplace of Miami-Dade before dropping out of the race), but Trump’s nearly unanimous win is hardly unprecedented. We looked at county-by-county election results from the state’s Division of Elections website. Big wins aren’t altogether unusual in Florida, if you go back just a few years. Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich split the state in the 2012 Republican primary, and both the GOP and Democrats split their primaries three ways in 2008. But in 2004, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry won all 67 counties for the Democrats. That feat was repeated by both parties in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore won all 67 for the Democrats and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won all 67 for Republicans. In 1996, Bob Dole took 66 of 67 counties for the GOP primary — but really, the 67th was a tie at 190 votes each for Dole and Pat Buchanan in Washington County. Bill Clinton took 63 counties in 1992’s Democratic primary. Paul Tsongas won Alachua, Martin, Seminole and Palm Beach counties. Pat Buchanan mounted a primary challenge to incumbent president George H.W. Bush that year and won Hardee County. Bush nabbed the other 66. In 1988, George H.W. Bush won 64 counties, losing three to Pat Robertson in the GOP race. Counties were split over their Democratic candidate, but Michael Dukakis won the state. Walter Mondale and Gary Hart divided the state for Democrats in 1984, with Jesse Jackson winning one county and John Glenn two.   The state’s online data only goes back to 1978, but there were enough examples to prove Trump wrong in this case. In 1980, Jimmy Carter won 100 percent of Florida counties for the Democrats. But Trump can lay claim to beating the primary record of Republican hero Ronald Reagan. The actor defeated his eventual vice presidential running mate George H.W. Bush by 64 counties to 3. In addition to Alachua County, Bush took Dixie and Union counties by a single vote. Our ruling Trump said, ""Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before.""

We decided to look into that particular sign of progress. The USAID press office told us the numbers came from the World Bank. The measure the agency used was Gross Domestic Product per person. The World Bank makes the numbers for each region comparable by correcting for the purchasing power of consumers in each country, and putting everything in constant 2011 dollars. ""Between 2014 (the last year for which data are available) and 1990, per capita income, in real terms and adjusting for purchasing power, has increased by more than one-third in every region, ranging from 34 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa to 192 percent in East Asia and the Pacific,"" press staff told us. Smith’s numbers hold up. The development agency gave regional figures that included both developing and higher-income nations. The World Bank offers a version that looks strictly at developing countries. World Bank staff said in some regions, the change is more dramatic than the numbers cited by USAID, and in some, it is less so. This table, using World Bank data, compares the change for regions solely in developing countries to the USAID approach that combines both developing and higher-income countries. Percent change: GDP per capita, PPP, 2011 dollars Region Developing only Combined East Asia & Pacific 418% 192% Europe & Central Asia 49% 37% Latin America & Caribbean 46% 50% Middle East & North Africa 47% 56% Sub-Saharan Africa 33% 34%   The difference is most significant for the East Asia and Pacific region, which includes China, where GDP per capita rose four-fold in the period. The differences in some other regions might be less pronounced, but they don’t change the overall thrust of Smith’s summary. Technically, the rise in Sub-Saharan Africa was 33 percent, while Smith said more than one-third. And for the record, we don’t have exactly the same kind of data for the South Asia region, which includes India. The World Bank doesn’t distinguish between developing and higher-income countries there. Overall, the gain in that region was 172 percent. Measuring per capita GDP growth is not the only yardstick to gauge economic well being. The World Bank also looks at per capita Gross National Income. We ran those numbers and the trends remain the same. We also checked how the trend lines have changed over the decades. While the largest gains took place between about 1995 and 2008, followed by some backsliding during the Great Recession, most regions have recovered since then. Still, the pace of growth is considerably slower than in the past.   A caveat It is important to note that a growing economy at the national level doesn’t tell us how well those gains are spread across all members of society. While the World Bank does calculate the gap between the rich and the poor for most countries, it doesn’t aggregate the data at the regional level. We have explored the distribution of wealth in another fact-check. It’s possible to take Smith’s words to mean that incomes rose for every individual by at least a third. In that sense, the available data don’t support her statement, but GDP per capita is a common measure of economic well-being, and many analysts argue that growth is a necessary, if insufficient, quantity to lift fortunes at the lower end of the income ladder. Our ruling Smith said that since 1990, individual incomes have grown by more than a third in every region of the developing world. Using the yardstick of GDP per capita, the World Bank data back that up. It is a hair off to say ""more than a third"" when the change in Sub-Saharan Africa is a bit less than a third, but the numerical difference is small. It is also important to remember that the benefits of a rising economy are rarely spread equally throughout the population. Typically, the wealthy gain more than the rest. So Smith’s statement isn’t as accurate on an individual to individual basis. With that caveat in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/24/gayle-smith/usaid-head-highlights-worldwide-income-gains/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Nuclear', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump says Iran military will have nuclear weapons as soon as enrichment limits expire
","Donald Trump tried to demonstrate his proficiency in foreign policy March 21 during a speech at the 2016 American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington. One focus of his talk involved condemning the Iran nuclear deal, saying it was a pact that gives ""the world’s leading state sponsor of terror"" $150 billion while the United States gets ""absolutely nothing in return."" ""I’ve studied this issue in great detail — I would say actually greater by far than anybody else,"" Trump said. When the audience voiced skepticism he said, ""Believe me. Oh, believe me."" ""The deal doesn’t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability,"" he said. ""Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, especially Israel."" Iran had not built a nuclear weapon at the time the deal was struck, so we wondered if Trump was correct in saying, ""when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go."" We emailed the Trump campaign looking for details, but didn't hear back. So we contacted other people who have also looked at the deal. It is correct that after 15 years, the limitations that prohibit Iran from enriching enough uranium to create a bomb will expire. We'll get into that in a moment. But to say that, at the 15-year mark, Iran will have a ready-to-go military nuclear capacity ignores the reality of creating that capability and ""simply ignores the other limitations and monitoring provisions that will extend well beyond the 15-year mark of the agreement,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nonpartisan Arms Control Association, which supports the deal. Various parts of the agreement expire at different times, as the following chart from the association shows.  Yet some portions don't expire at all, such as the provision prohibiting Iran from conducting activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive. As long as it follows that part of the pact, it will never have nuclear weapons. But critics are focusing on elements of the deal that do expire. For example, the limit on the number of high-tech centrifuges needed to concentrate enough uranium to make a bomb goes away in 10 years. The requirements that uranium-235 be at a concentration no greater than 3.67 percent and that Iran have no more than 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium expire after 15 years. The concern is that, at that point, Iran would restart its nuclear weapons program. However, there would be nothing ""ready to go"" about their bomb or the delivery system needed to use it. At the time of the deal, the worst-case scenario was that Iran was two or three months from developing any type of nuclear bomb. Installing more and more sophisticated centrifuges ""would take at least several months,"" according to Matthew Kroenig of Georgetown University and a foreign policy adviser to the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign. He said it's true that once the enrichment limit is gone, that could set the stage for a nuclear weapon. ""It is hard to know how long this would take because Iran never came clean on its past weaponization work, and we don't know how much progress they might be able to make covertly over the next 15 years. But again, several months is a reasonable assumption,"" he said. ""Next, it would need to marry the warhead to its ballistic missiles, but given its experience in mounting conventional warheads on its already sizable ballistic missile stockpile, this should be a relatively routine matter, said Kroenig. ""So, in sum, after the limits expire, it would likely still take Iran between several months and a year or so to have an actual deliverable nuclear weapon. But, the expansion of the enrichment program to ‘industrial size’ would be allowed at that point."" ""To build an arsenal of nuclear weapons, it would take several years,"" Kroenig said. ""Iran will not have an industrial-sized nuclear capability, military or otherwise, when the deal ends at 10 to 15 years,"" said Richard Nephew of Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. The country had about 18,000 IR-1 centrifuges, most of which are dismantled and stored as part of the deal. As existing machines wear out, the stored ones can be brought out of mothballs to replace them. Iran would need about 50,000 to make fuel just for its nuclear power plant. ""They won't go from 18,000 stored/operating centrifuges at year 10 to 15 to 50,000 over a weekend,"" he said. Kroenig said that if the intent is there, ""Iran can build as large and sophisticated an enrichment program as it would like, consistent with the terms of the deal. At that point there is very little other states could do to stop it from building nuclear weapons if it decides to do so."" But other experts we consulted said that's unlikely for a host of reasons. ""U.S. intelligence concluded in 2007 that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003-04,"" and there is no indication the program was restarted, Nephew said. Then there are the permanent inspection requirements. ""While Iran will be allowed to gradually expand its peaceful, civilian, non-military nuclear program after year 10, it must remain exactly that — a peaceful, civilian, non-military nuclear program,"" State Department spokesman Sem Werberg said in an email. ""If at any point in time — before 10 years, after 10 years, or at any point in the future — there is any evidence that Iran is 'militarizing' its nuclear program in any way, then it would be in violation of the deal AND its international commitments."" However, what the world would or could do about it at that point is a matter for debate. ""Assuming that the Iranians are not cheating, then they couldn't have a 'military nuclear capability' ready to go ever,"" Nephew contended. ""In fact, provisions of the deal would preclude such a capability forever."" If Iran does decide to change course, supporters of the deal suspect that inspection and surveillance provisions of the deal will give other countries plenty of warning. ""We will continue to have exquisite knowledge of how much uranium they have for 25 years because inspection of their mines and mills, will continue for 25 years. We will also know for 20 years how many centrifuge machines they will be producing where,"" said Kimball. ""To say there will be a military nuclear capability ready to go simply ignores the other limitations and monitoring provisions that will extend well beyond the 15-year mark of the agreement."" ""If Mr. Trump had studied the deal more than anyone else,"" Kimball continued, ""these facts would be apparent to him."" Our ruling Trump said, ""When those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go."" Key restrictions in the deal never expire, including the pledge to not conduct activities that would contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive. And even if Iran were to go all-out for a nuclear program once the 15-year limit on uranium enrichment goes away, it would take months, if not years, for the country to develop a bomb and delivery system so its military could go to war with nuclear weaponry. We rate the claim as False.",/factchecks/2016/mar/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-iran-military-will-have-nuclear/
"['Elections', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Greg Abbott touts record Texas primary turnout, but he's overlooking some years (such as 2008)
","After President Barack Obama criticized Republican-set voting laws in connection with Texas voter turnout, Gov. Greg Abbott suggested the Democratic president slipped a gear. Obama, kicking off the South by Southwest Interactive conference March 11, 2016, said the U.S. is the world’s only advanced democracy that ""makes it harder for people to vote."" Perhaps he was referring to voter registration hurdles or the mandate in more than a dozen states, including Texas, that voters present a photo ID before casting a ballot. Obama otherwise called it important to study ways of redesigning ""our systems"" to step up turnout. Then he said that ""the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren’t interested in having more people participate."" Abbott, a Republican, bridled at Obama’s pokes, telling reporters a few days later: ""To the contrary of the president’s comment, the… fact is, despite our voter registration laws, we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment."" Really? We wondered because last year, we found Texas not doing well in voter turnout compared to other states. Specifically, U.S. Census research indicated that in November 2014, some 59 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens were registered to vote, placing Texas 45th among the states in a virtual tie with New York and Nevada. Also in 2014, nearly 35 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens cast ballots, placing Texas 46th among the states. Nationally, 42 percent of voting-eligible citizens turned out. Abbott didn’t respond when we sought the basis of his ""record"" claim. We found that his turnout tout holds up if you look at the raw count of voters in both 2016 primaries or even solely at the share of registered voters who participated in the Republican primary. However, no record was set in overall percentage turnout, arguably the best metric for population-adjusted comparisons over time. Record count of voters A post-primary Austin American-Statesman news story walked through the record number of voters: ""More than 2.83 million Texans cast ballots in the GOP primary’s presidential contest, roughly double the number who voted in each of the past three state primaries,"" a result celebrated by Tom Mechler, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, in a party press release. According to the Texas secretary of state, nearly 1.4 million Texans voted in the 2008 GOP presidential primary and 1,449,477 voted four years later. The 2,832,271 voters who cast ballots in the dominant party’s 2016 primary was nearly a doubling from four years before. But Texas wasn’t alone in high voter counts. The Statesman story said: ""A similar dynamic has played out in other states, with record or near-record Republican turnout for Super Tuesday contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Virginia — coming after marked gains in numbers of GOP voters in earlier contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina."" Record Republican turnout, but... We asked the secretary of state’s office if any records in percentage turnout were set in the 2016 Texas primaries. By email, spokeswoman Alicia Pierce said 19.89 percent of the state’s registered voters participated in the Republican primary. By a wide margin, that amounted to a record for Texas Republican primaries, according to agency records covering turnout in statewide elections since 1972. The next-highest turnout in the party’s presidential primary occurred in 2012 and 1996. In each of those years, 11 percent of the state’s registered voters voted GOP. But the approximately 30 percent turnout across both primaries was not record-setting. Pierce noted the 33 percent turnout of registered voters in March 2008; that year, Democrats had a showdown between Obama and Hillary Clinton. ""To get  a percentage number higher than 2008 based on the number of registered voters,"" Pierce wrote, ""you have to go back to 1980"" when some 36 percent of registered voters joined the primaries. She said 1992 ""came close with 29 percent of voters."" Similarly, the records show, combined Texas primaries turnout in 1988 (36 percent) and some 1970s primaries exceeded 30 percent. In 1972, remarkably, 60 percent of registered voters participated in the primaries, all but 3 percent of them on the Democratic side -- again, no 2016 record there. Notably too, a March 16, 2016, Texas Tribune news story suggested the 2016 Texas turnout lagged turnout in nearly all of the states to have already held presidential primaries. That is, the more than 4.2 million Texas voters in 2016 represented nearly 25 percent of voting-eligible citizens 18 and older and that placed the state second to last among the 19 states that had already primaried for president, the story said. Our ruling Abbott said Texas ""had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the"" 2016 ""primary."" We don’t know if Abbott was tunnel-visioning raw counts of primary voters or if he was fixed on the 19 percent share of registered voters participating in the Republican primary. By both of these metrics, the 2016 turnout set Texas records. However, percentage turnout across both primaries was previously higher in several years including 2008, 1988 and 1972. This gubernatorial statement also failed to acknowledge that Texas remains among the nation’s lowest-turnout states. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
