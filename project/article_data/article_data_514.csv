Sen. Tammy Baldwin says before Obamacare, 17 million kids with health conditions were ""uninsurable""
","In what was called her first major speech since becoming a U.S. senator, Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin praised President Barack Obama’s health care reform law and made a conspicuous claim about the law’s impact on children.

The setting was a Jan. 31, 2013, conference in Washington, D.C., sponsored by Families USA, a liberal group that pushed for what Obama himself has come to call ""Obamacare.""

Hailing the 2010 law as a victory ""70 years in the making,"" Baldwin recounted the story about how she had no health insurance coverage as a child because she was raised by her grandparents and had a pre-existing condition.

""I got better,"" Baldwin said, referring to her illness, which she said is similar to spinal meningitis, ""and my grandparents looked for an insurance policy that would cover me in the future. But they discovered that, because of my illness, they couldn’t find such a policy. Not from any insurer. Not at any price.

""Never mind that I had fully recovered from my illness. I had been branded with the words ‘pre-existing condition.’ My story, of course, isn’t significant because it was unique.  In fact, it’s significant because it wasn’t unique. When the Affordable Care Act was signed, 17 million American children wore that same brand.  ‘Pre-existing condition.’ Uninsurable.""

When Obamacare became law, 17 million children were impossible to insure because they had a pre-existing health condition?

Baldwin’s evidence

Baldwin’s staff cited two pieces of evidence to back her claim.

One is a White House fact sheet that says that as a result of the Affordable Care Act, ""more than 17.6 million children with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage.""

But that’s essentially a restatement of part of Baldwin’s claim -- without any evidence that the figure is correct or that so many children were uninsurable.

Baldwin also cited a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services analysis, the same one Obama cited in March 2012 when he said that because of the reform law, ""17 million kids can no longer be denied because of a pre-existing condition.""

PolitiFact National rated his statement Mostly False.

The analysis Obama and Baldwin cited focuses on people who could potentially be helped by the law if they found themselves uninsured in the future -- not on those who actually were uninsured and were blocked from getting coverage by pre-existing conditions today.

The federal analysis estimated that between 4 million and 17 million children have some type of pre-existing condition -- which means that like Obama, Baldwin cherry picked by citing the high end of that range. The higher figure also includes cases in which the child isn’t actually denied insurance, but in which the family simply has to pay higher premiums.

PolitiFact National estimated, based on the analysis, that 160,000 to 1.1 million of the children with a pre-existing condition were uninsured because of the condition.

While those are significant numbers, they are far below 17 million.

FactCheck.org also faulted Obama’s statement, finding that the 17 million part of the claim was on the high end. The claim also implied ""that these children were previously being denied coverage. But that’s not the case,"" FactCheck.org said.

Baldwin went further than Obama, not implying but declaring that 17 million children could not be insured.

Our rating

Baldwin said: ""When the Affordable Care Act was signed, 17 million American children"" had a pre-existing condition and were ""uninsurable.""

It’s possible that as many as 17 million children have a pre-existing health condition, but the figure could be as low as 4 million. And only a fraction of children with a pre-existing condition didn’t have insurance because of that condition.

Sen. Sherrod Brown says three-quarters of low-income workers don’t have paid sick days
","
Typhoid Mary was a cook. Working at that job made her single-handedly responsible for multiple outbreaks of typhoid fever, in and around New York City, about a century ago.

PolitiFact Ohio couldn't help recalling that bit of history recently after reading advice for the flu season from the Centers for Disease Control, which urged sick people to stay home from work and school to avoid the spread of illness.

The history was freshened by last week's news that a college cafeteria worker in Indiana had been diagnosed with typhoid fever, and it came to mind when we saw a release from Sen. Sherrod Brown saying that he is co-sponsoring the Healthy Families Act, which is being reintroduced in Congress.

Also called the earned sick time initiative, the legislation would allow workers at businesses with 15 or more employees to earn paid sick days. Workers could earn up to one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, up to a total of seven days.

""For far too many Americans, a day home from work means a day without pay,"" Brown said. ""Some 40 percent of private-sector workers in the U.S. don’t have any paid sick days at all. It’s worse for low-income workers — three in four don’t have any paid sick days available.""

We wondered about the numbers. Brown's staff said the source was last year's National Compensation Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Its chart for paid leave benefits shows that 61 percent of all workers in the private sector have paid sick days -- meaning about 40 percent don't have them.

Among the lowest-paid 25 percent of workers, the chart shows that 29 percent have paid sick days, meaning more than 70 percent don't have them.

Among the lowest-paid 10 percent of workers, 18 percent have sick days, so 82 percent do not. (Three in four, the figure used by Brown, is 75 percent.)

We found other figures as well:. More than three in four food service and hotel workers (78 percent) don’t have any paid sick days, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Workers without sick days are more likely to go to work with a contagious illness, according to a 2010 survey by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center. And a 2011 study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that a lack of sick leave helped spread 5 million cases of flu-like illness during the outbreak of 2009.

Critics of the sick leave initiative, including the National Association of Independent Businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, say paid sick days add costs to low-margin businesses, are burdensome to business and result in lost jobs.

In a recent survey of businesses by the Employment Policies Institute, ""Roughly 70 percent of respondents said that Connecticut’s sick leave law was not good for business,"" the group said.

PolitiFact Ohio is not rating the legislation, however -- only Brown’s statement on the numbers of workers who don’t have access to paid sick days. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB856140>],/factchecks/2013/feb/11/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-three-quarters-low-income-w/
"['States', 'Transportation', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Richard Saslaw']","
Dick Saslaw says all states, except Virginia, ""keep raising their gas tax""
","
Sen. Minority Leader Richard Saslaw has spearheaded the opposition this winter to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s plan to raise transportation revenues by abolishing the state gas tax and replacing it with a sales tax increase.

Saslaw, D-Fairfax, says the only way to raise ample money for roads is to increase both the sales and the gas tax. He introduced an unsuccessful bill that would have raised Virginia’s 5 percent sales tax to 6 percent. It also would have increased the state’s 17.5-cent a gallon gas excise tax by 5 cents a gallon during each of the next two years and set the levy to automatically rise at the inflation rate of construction costs.

McDonnell says that the gas tax is outdated and will produce declining revenues in the future as cars become more fuel efficient. Saslaw says the problems with Virginia’s flat gas tax are that it’s not indexed to inflation and has not been increased since 1987. That’s a far cry from other states, he claims.

""There’s a reason the other 49 states keep raising their gas tax,"" Saslaw during a Jan. 15 news conference called by the Senate Democratic Caucus to lay out its positions on key issues, including transportation.

He repeated the statement at the end of the news conference. ""Everybody, all the other states, raise their gas tax except Virginia,"" Saslaw said. ""Naturally, your gas tax isn’t going to grow.""

When we contacted Saslaw, he said he may have misspoken. The senator said he was trying to make a point that, with few exceptions, other states have raised their gasoline excise tax since Virginia’s rate went into effect 26 years ago.

""I don’t know of a state that hasn’t raised their gas tax since 1986,"" Saslaw told us. ""Some of them, they’ve gone up quite a few times.""

Saslaw, who's been in the General Assembly since 1976, acknowledged he could have worded his original statement better, saying perhaps he shouldn’t have said all the other states ""keep"" raising their gas taxes.

Most states do not routinely raise their gas taxes, we learned after consulting a September 2012 report by the Federal Highway Administration and a December 2011 study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

Excise gas taxes regularly increase in 14 states. That’s because they have variables in their tax rates that periodically rise with inflation or the price of gas.

Of the remaining 36 states with flat rates, 25 have not increased their excise tax in 10 years of more. And 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have not raised the levy in 20 years or more.

Virginia’s gas tax rate, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1987, is the second oldest in the nation. It bows only to Alaska, which implemented its 8-cent gas tax in 1970, although it was suspended for a year in 2008.

Virginia’s 26-year-old tax has a peer group, however. South Carolina’s 16-cent per gallon tax went into effect in July 1987. Oklahoma’s 17 cent rate was established in May 1987. New Jersey’s 10.5-cent tax went into effect in July 1988 while Tennessee’s 20-cent levy went into effect in July 1989.

Our ruling 
Saslaw said the 49 other states keep raising their gas tax.

Twenty-five states have not raised their gas tax in a decade or more, and 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have gone at least two decades without an increase.

Saslaw offers no proof for his claim and acknowledges he may have misspoken. His statement is wrong, without basis and we give it our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBECD800>],/factchecks/2013/feb/11/richard-saslaw/dick-saslaw-say-except-virginia-all-states-keep-ra/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Markel Hutchins']","
Are there more places to buy a gun than a Big Mac?
","
So what’s easier to find? The golden arches or a gun shop.

The Rev. Markel Hutchins, an Atlanta-based civil rights activist, had an answer during a recent discussion about federal gun legislation on ""The Ryan Cameron Show,"" which airs weekday mornings on V-103 FM in Atlanta.

""There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s,"" Hutchins said.

McDonald’s eateries are just about everywhere in America. PolitiFact Georgia was listening while stuck in traffic and wanted to find out whether Hutchins’ claim is true that there are more places to buy a gun than to grab a Happy Meal.

Hutchins wants laws to restrict the availability of handguns across the country, particularly in urban areas such as Atlanta. He led a rally last week outside the headquarters of gun manufacturer Glock, located in Smyrna, a northern suburb of Atlanta. Hutchins says gun rights advocates are distorting the intent of the Second Amendment, saying it was written to allow Americans to arm themselves to protect the nation.

There had been a spate of high-profile shootings in Atlanta a week before Hutchins’ interview. A 14-year-old boy was shot, allegedly by a 15-year-old boy, on the campus of an Atlanta middle school. The student who was wounded was not seriously injured. A day after that shooting, a Morehouse College student was shot inside a gym on the campus. The student was reportedly in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.

Hutchins said he was indeed claiming that there are more gun shops nationwide than McDonald’s restaurants. Hutchins sent us an ABC News article published in mid-December to back up his claim and said he did some additional research because he didn’t believe it was true.

""My God, it was right there,"" he said.

The McDonald’s website contains a number of facts and figures, including how many restaurants there are in the country. The latest tally, as of 2011, was 14,098 in the United States. There were 33,510 worldwide, the website shows.

The number on the restaurant’s website matched what ABC reported. The news outlet reported there are 51,438 retail gun stores in America. Programs, such as American Public Media’s ""Marketplace,"" have reported the total is about 58,000. Some online research we did found others making similar claims that there are twice as many gun stores as McDonald’s in America.

Those numbers, however, are more complicated than they first appear.

What Hutchins and some news outlets have referred to as ""guns stores"" are actually federal permits issued to sell guns. Those could represent retail establishments that primarily sell guns, larger retail vendors (such as Wal-Mart) that sell guns as part of a much larger retail venue or pawnshops that carry guns as part of their inventory. The numbers also refer to people who sell guns at gun shows several times a year and have no bricks-and-mortar store.

We attempted to make an oranges-to-oranges comparison here -- to compare McDonald’s locations to free-standing stores that primarily sell guns.

It’s hard to find detailed data on actual gun stores online. The U.S. Census Bureau does not keep data on gun stores. Neither does the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms keeps a monthly log on its website of how many people and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in the country and its territories. In January, the total was 58,725. About 51,000 of them were gun dealers. The rest were pawnbrokers. In Georgia, the total in January was 1,746.

In 2011, to be consistent with the most recent information we have about the number of McDonald’s restaurants nationwide, there were 56,059 federally licensed firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in the country. That’s quadruple the number of places to buy Chicken McNuggets.

The ATF does not track how many licensed dealers own a business that they sell guns from as opposed to those who may sell guns at a show. The ATF database has lists of every person licensed to sell guns. In Georgia, most people on the January list say they own a business. There were about 175 people on the list with a license who did not include the name of a business. About 100 of them are retail stores such as Wal-Mart, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Academy Sports & Outdoors.

In some cases, the list contains the name of the person licensed to sell guns and the business
itself.

The leader of an organization of firearms retailers had a lower estimate of how many gun shops there are nationally. Andrew Molchan, president of Professional Gun Retailers Association, believes there are probably 9,000 ""real"" gun stores in America. His definition of a gun store is a place that regularly sells the weapons year-round. His estimate did not include businesses such as Wal-Mart because some of those stores do not sell any guns.

Molchan said it’s tough to come up with a firm number of how many gun stores there are for several reasons. For example, he said some pawnshops sell only a handful of guns year-round.

""It’s not hard and crisp,"" Molchan said of coming up with an actual estimate of how many gun shops there are in the U.S.

When told about Hutchins’ claim, Molchan replied, ""That’s not necessarily wrong.""

Some people, he said, may have a license to sell guns, but they don’t sell any at all. He believes there are probably as many as 25,000 businesses that sell guns.

To sum up, Hutchins said there were twice as many gun shops than McDonald’s restaurants in the United States. There are numbers we found that support his argument.

But this claim, like many we’ve tackled, is not as simple as it seems. His overall point seems accurate -- there are a lot of places to buy guns in the United States.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Texas has third-highest high school graduation rates, a ""significant turnaround""
","
Gov. Rick Perry said state leaders have worked hard to improve Texas public schools over the past decade, with more students faring well.

Perry told lawmakers in his Jan. 29, 2013, State-of-the-State address: ""According to the U.S. Department of Education, our graduation rates are at an all-time high—the third-highest in the nation—which represents a significant turnaround from just a few short years ago.""

His claim rang a bell.

In a Nov. 27, 2012, press release, the Texas Education Agency said that according to preliminary data from its federal counterpart, Texas tied for the nation’s third-highest high school graduation rate in the 2010-11 school year, based on tracking individual students through high school.

The agency said Texas was tied with Tennessee, New Hampshire, Indiana, Nebraska and North Dakota, all with 86 percent rates. Iowa, Vermont and Wisconsin had higher graduation rates by one to two percentage points, the agency said.

News accounts diverged at the time on whether Texas placed third or should be considered tied for fourth, considering three states had better graduation rates. A Nov. 27, 2012, Dallas Morning News story said Texas was ""tied with five other states for the fourth-highest graduation rate in the country."" The San Antonio Business Journal published a similar summary. In contrast, the Nov. 28, 2013, Associated Press news story said Texas and five other states had tied for ""America’s third-best high school graduation.""

The education agency said Texas ranked No. 1 in graduation rates for Asian and white students and tied for No. 1 with Montana for graduation rates for African American students, and No. 2 for Hispanic students, behind Maine.

Perry spokeswoman Josh Havens told us the governor based his claim on that data released in November. That 2011 graduation rate was 5 percentage points better than the 2009 rate, he said, and there were more than 26,000 additional graduates. There were 11,100 more seniors in 2011, a 4 percent difference, according to a July 2012 report by the Texas Education Agency.

Two ways of counting

From past fact checks, we recognize another method often used to gauge graduation successes. In this vein, we rated as True a 2010 claim by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White that Texas then ranked 43rd nationally for its 61.3 percent graduation rate in 2008-09.

That conclusion was based on comparing the year’s number of graduates to the number of ninth graders four years earlier, an indicator often called ""attrition."" The intent is to get a snapshot of how many students graduate in four years.

Applying the same kind of approach, just a week before Perry’s speech, a federal report placed Texas’ 2009-10 graduation rate in the middle of the states. An Associated Press news story said the cited rate of 78.9 percent was just above the national average of 78.2 percent, in itself the highest since 1976.

The AP story also noted the difference between the sets of graduation data. The state education agency said the reason for the difference was that the January 2013 report, from the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the federal Department of Education, estimated high school attrition rates among ninth-graders over four years, while the state tracks actual cases that can be adjusted for things like students moving away before finishing high school.

""We're basically counting noses, and they're doing an estimate,"" Debbie Ratcliffe, a Texas Education Agency spokeswoman, told the AP. ""The good news is the trend lines for graduates are the same. There're a million different ways to count graduation rates"" and ""as long as they're showing similar trend lines, that's positive.""

By phone, Ratcliffe told us that at the direction of lawmakers, the state started calculating its graduation rates by the method behind its third-place ranking, starting in the 2008-09 school year, when the rate was 80.6 percent. She said the comparable Texas rate for 2009-10 was 84.3 percent.

""It’s slow, steady growth,"" she said.

An outside view

For another take, we consulted Grover J. ""Russ"" Whitehurst, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former director of the Institute of Education Sciences in the U.S. Department of Education.

Whitehurst testified on behalf of the state in the court battle launched by school districts challenging the Texas school funding system. A Travis County state district judge, John Dietz, ruled in the districts’ favor, though appeals are expected.

In the trial, a lawyer questioned Whitehurst about his interpretation of the declared 86 percent Texas graduation rate. According to a Dec. 6, 2012, pool report by Will Weissert of the Associated Press, Whitehurst testified that there likely were flaws in the new system used to create the federal data. He said, for instance, that it was possible for high schools to game the system and tamp down their dropout rates. He said what commonly happens is a student drops out but is instead listed as having moved or transferred when his classmates and even school administrators know the truth.

Whitehurst said, ""We know schools can cheat"" and the new federal data-reporting system was too new to fully control for such cheating.

More recently, Whitehurst told us by telephone that Texas appeared to be among several states to enjoy big jumps in graduation rates. But he said it would be an error to compare graduation rates using the new methodology, known as Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates, to estimated graduation rates in earlier years as gauged by the national center’s methodology for Averaged Freshman Graduation Rates (or attrition).

""The two numbers are not comparable,"" he said.

Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates come from data submitted by high schools and school districts, taking into account individual students who had transferred in or out of each district as well as student deaths. In contrast, he said, Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate estimates graduation rates by taking the number of diplomas granted each year and dividing that by the average number of eighth-, ninth- and 10th-graders five years before.

The National Center for Education Statistics’ methodology for Averaged Freshman Graduation Rates is spelled out in its Jan. 22, 2013, report on the 2009-10 results.

By this measure, Texas has improved, the report indicates, though the measure does not suggest that Texas ranked among the best in the nation in 2009-10. Looking at this measure over time, we see that the Texas rate was 75.5 percent in 2002-03, dipped to 72 percent in 2006-07 and rose to 78.9 percent in 2009-10. Among the states, the Texas rate for 2009-10 was 25th highest. The Texas rate for 2002-03 tied with Indiana’s rate for 29th highest, according to the report.

The center’s report says, too, that these rates are not the best way to pin how many students are graduating, but the methodology has been applied since the 1960s to give a sense of how schools were doing before most states collected data on the progress of  individual students over time.

Whitehurst said to us: ""I don’t necessarily believe Texas is now third-ranked,"" though ""I am not saying it’s untrue. It’s too soon to know exactly what these numbers mean.""

Federal distinctions

Separately, we asked the U.S. Department of Education about Perry’s statement.

Spokesman Daren Briscoe pointed us to the agency’s Nov. 26, 2012, press release announcing the state-by-state 2010-11 graduation rates. The release says: ""The new, uniform rate calculation is not comparable in absolute terms to previously reported rates. Therefore, while 26 states reported lower graduation rates and 24 states reported unchanged or increased rates under the new metric, these changes should not be viewed as measures of progress but rather as a more accurate snapshot.""

We asked Havens of Perry’s office about the governor’s reference to a significant turnaround. Havens’ email reply singled out the three years of rates measured by the new method--stressing the five percentage point difference between the results in 2009 and 2011. 
Our ruling

Perry said Texas has the nation’s third-highest high school graduation rate, which he called a significant turnaround from a few years ago.

Texas tied with five states for the third-highest rate in 2011, of 86 percent. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked.

Other nicks in Perry’s statement: These results are preliminary and might prove unreliable. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate.

Finally, since it's not accurate to compare these rates devised in different ways, Perry’s reference to a ""significant turnaround"" depends on just the three years of rates measured in the newest way. But in this time window, there is no indication the rate was either stuck or plummeting before 2011, so the latest results do not indicate a turnaround.

All told, Texas graduation rates are improving and the state looks strong compared to most others. We rate this statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACAD1C0>],/factchecks/2013/feb/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-third-highest-high-schoo/
"['Elections', 'Pundits', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Matthews']","
Chris Matthews says Sen. Ron Johnson was elected in ‘very low turnout’ contest
","For anyone still keeping score on pundit reaction to the clash between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin over the attack on U.S. diplomats in Libya:

Don’t count Chris Matthews in the Johnson camp.

To say the least.

The host of the MSNBC-TV talk show ""Hardball"" lambasted the questions and remarks that Johnson, a Republican, addressed to Clinton when she appeared before a Senate committee on Jan. 23, 2013.

Matthews and two guests that night heaped praise on Clinton, while ripping Johnson’s queries about the way the attacks were initially portrayed to the public.

Matthews went on to question, at least implicitly, the legitimacy of Johnson’s 2010 win over Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. That  mid-term election saw Republicans regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives and pick up seats in the Senate, including this one.

""That was kind of a pissant performance by that guy from Wisconsin,"" Matthews said of Johnson’s questioning of Clinton. ""I don't know how these guys get over the wall into American politics. I think they won in a very low turnout elections (sic) in Wisconsin.""

Matthews was just getting warmed up.

He added: ""I think everybody should run now in national elections, forced to go into elections where there's a lot of voters, so you don't get this weird, warped sense of people coming who supposedly represent the American electorate. That guy doesn't represent anybody.""

Wisconsin, in our memory, typically has high turnout elections.

But is Matthews right that Johnson was elected in a ""very low turnout"" one?

Depends on the point of comparison.

Compared with the 2008 and 2012 presidential years, the 2010 election in Wisconsin drew about 800,000-900,000 fewer voters, with the Senate race and a gubernatorial contest leading the ballot, state turnout data shows. That gap is a well-known feature of American politics.

In those two presidential years, about 72 percent of voting-eligible Wisconsinites turned out, and it was even higher -- almost 75 percent -- in 2004, according to calculations and analysis by the United States Election Project at George Mason University.

By contrast, Wisconsin turnout in the 2010 midterm election featuring Johnson-Feingold was about 52 percent of eligible voters.

So from that perspective, the turnout was lower.

MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski told us that Matthews meant just such a comparison in his remarks.

She explained further that Matthews’ reference to multiple candidates -- ""they won in very low turnout elections in Wisconsin"" -- likely referred to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who also won in that 2010 election.

On his show, Matthews also longed for a system where everybody runs in the higher-turnout presidential years. That’s his opinion, of course, so we can’t fact check it. But we can note that such a change would require a constitutional amendment, because Article One fixes those terms at six years for senators and two for House members.

Case closed? Hardly.

We wondered: How did the 2010 midterm here stack up to midterms past -- and to similar contests in other states?

At 52 percent, turnout in 2010 was slightly lower than the 2006 turnout of 53 percent and significantly higher than the 45 percent in 2002, according to data from the George Mason project’s website.

If you go back to 1998 -- when Feingold nipped Republican challenger Mark Neumann in a midterm -- the turnout was considerably lower than in the 2010 race that Matthews termed ""very low turnout.""

In fact, in 1998, Feingold’s vote total was 230,000 lower than his future challenger Johnson received in 2010.

So there’s also fodder for saying that 2010 was a typical turnout year, or even high compared to a couple other relatively recent midterms.

But Matthews’ statement put things in a national perspective -- ""I don't know how these guys get over the wall into American politics."" So, how did turnout in Wisconsin stack up?

In 2010, the turnout in Wisconsin ran 11 percentage points above the U.S. average. Only six states had higher turnout on the day Johnson defeated Feingold: Minnesota, Maine, Washington, South Dakota, Oregon and Alaska.

It’s not hard to find examples of Democratic Party senators who won in November 2010 in states with lower turnout than Wisconsin. Among them: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Barbara Boxer of California and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

We found that Wisconsin’s turnout is typically around the top 5 no matter the year, based on six elections we reviewed.

There were even five states that had lower turnout in the 2012 presidential contest than Wisconsin did in the midterm year of 2010, according to the George Mason data. They were: Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Hawaii.

Michael McDonald, the George Mason professor behind the elections project, said the Republican Party generally -- but not always -- gets an advantage in lower turnout midterm elections. Younger voters, the poor and minority voters come out in smaller numbers than in presidential election years, cutting into the modern Democratic Party’s base, he noted.

It can cut the other way, too. Democrat Tammy Baldwin won Wisconsin’s other Senate seat in 2012 amid the higher turnout in the presidential year.

The 2012 electorate included a higher percentage of liberals, city-dwellers and young voters, and a lower percentage of Republicans, than the 2010 electorate, our Journal Sentinel colleague Craig Gilbert reported in a ""Wisconsin Voter"" story in November 2012.

University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist and pollster Charles Franklin said it was ""crazy talk"" by Matthews if the MSNBC host was arguing that the only way a conservative such as Ron Johnson could win was in a midterm election.

National ""wave"" elections favoring one party or the other can factor in, and the particulars of each campaign factor in as well.

Franklin noted that Jim Doyle, the Democrat who served two terms as Wisconsin governor, unseated a Republican incumbent in a 2002 midterm election. And Doyle won re-election in 2006.

Our rating

Matthews said Johnson won in a ""very low turnout"" election when he knocked off Feingold in 2010.

"['New Jersey', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Cory Booker']","
Cory Booker says U.S. military spending is greater than the next 10-12 countries combined
","
The United States must have a prepared military, but it’s not unpatriotic to say the country is spending too much money on its defense, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker.

How much money? It’s more than the military spending of up to the next 12 countries combined, the Democratic mayor said.

Booker made that point on the Feb. 1 episode of HBO’s ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" during a panel discussion about the recent Senate hearing on Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be U.S. Defense Secretary.

""The reality is we have to make sure that we have a military that’s prepared, but right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined, and we’ve got to start realizing that we can secure and protect ourselves, but also be responsible in the way that we do that,"" Booker said.

""And it’s not unpatriotic to say that we’re spending too much money,"" the mayor added. ""In fact, to me, that’s the patriotic thing to say.""

Booker’s claim is on target: The United States spent more on defense in 2011 than the combined total of other high-spending nations, according to data from two organizations considered to be leading authorities on worldwide military spending.

The first set of figures comes from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. The institute maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for 172 countries.

In 2011 -- the most recent year available -- the United States led the world in military spending at $711 billion, marking 41 percent of the world total, according to the institute. The next top 12 spending nations accounted for a combined total of $670.9 billion, according to the institute.

U.S. expenditures were nearly five times higher than China, the second-highest nation with an estimated $143 billion in military spending. Russia was in third place with estimated spending of $71.9 billion.

We found similar results when we reviewed the data released by The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank which tracks military spending in 170 countries for its annual ""Military Balance"" report.

According to IISS figures released last year, the United States’ defense budget in 2011 was $739.3 billion, making it the largest in the world. The combined total of the next top 9 nations was $486.7 billion, according to IISS figures.

Referring to U.S. military spending, Michael O’Hanlon, a defense expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, explained in an e-mail: ""It is large because we have overseas interests all over the world, and we put a high premium on responsiveness and qualitative superiority.""

But the United States is poised to restrain its defense expenditures in the coming years.

In addition to reduced costs from winding down the war in Afghanistan, the Budget Control Act of 2011 contains provisions that limit spending increases in defense and other areas over the next decade.

It’s worth noting that calculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging, in part because there is no single definition of what constitutes military spending.

As the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute points out on its website, ""the lack of sufficiently detailed data makes it difficult to apply a common definition of military expenditure on a worldwide basis.""

Our ruling

In a panel discussion on HBO’s ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Booker claimed that ""right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined.""

The mayor’s statement is accurate, according to data from two leading authorities on worldwide military spending. One set of figures shows that, in 2011, military spending by the United States exceeded the combined total of the next 12 highest nations by roughly $40 billion.

We rate the statement True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Guns', 'David Cicilline']","
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says 40 percent of gun sales are made without background checks
","
In the aftermath of the mass killings at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school, U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, spoke at a Jan. 23 Rhode Island State House rally against gun violence about legislative efforts, including a bill he’s introduced to regulate gun sales.

TheFire Sale Loophole Closing Act would prevent gun dealers whose licenses have been revoked from declaring their inventory a ""personal collection,"" which allows them to make private sales without background checks.

At the rally, the Rhode Island Democrat said more than 40 percent of sales nationally are made without background checks, according to a story in The Providence Journal.

That 40-percent figure is mentioned often. Just two days before the Providence rally, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand cited it in an interview on MSNBC. President Obama also mentioned it when he outlined his gun-control proposals last month.

Several PolitiFact affiliates have examined variations of the claim over the past year. PolitiFact National first checked a similar statement in July 2012 from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

PolitiFact National initially rated the claim Mostly True but re-examined it after the Newtown shootings and, based on additional reporting, changed the ruling to Half True.

For this item, we will summarize research done by PolitiFact affiliates, supplemented by our own reporting.

First, a little background.

Since 1994, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime, declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons.  
 
But the law doesn’t apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets, or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. In those sales, there is no requirement for a  background check, and no one needs to file any paperwork.

So do those private sales account for 40 percent of all gun transactions? The source of that figure is a 1997 National Institute of Justice study, done by professors Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, who examined data from a 1994 telephone survey about gun ownership.

The survey, which sampled 2,568 homes, asked owners an array of questions, including how many guns were in the house, what they were used for, how they were stored and how they were obtained.

Of the 2,568 households surveyed, 251 people answered the question about the origin of their guns. Cook and Ludwig found that 35.7 percent of that group reported obtaining their guns from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. (That has been rounded up to 40 percent.)

In addition to the relatively small sample, there were other issues with the survey. Some respondents weren’t entirely sure whether the seller was a licensed dealer. In some cases, when the respondent skipped the question, the researchers made a judgment call.

The study, conducted by respected researchers, may have been the most reliable information in its time. What’s less clear is how reliable its findings are today.
The National Rifle Association, which opposes tighter gun controls, does not dispute the method or findings of the study but says the 40 percent claim is a misinterpretation by gun control advocates.

In January 2013, Politifact National asked Cook, one of the study’s authors, what he thought about the 40 percent figure being referenced so frequently in the current gun-control debate.

""I’ve been amazed at how much interest there’s been in it. It’s been lying there dormant for 20 years,"" he said.

So is it still a reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales?

""The answer is I have no idea,"" Cook said. ""This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number.""

Other scholars had similar views.

""I don’t see how anyone could know that number,"" James Jacobs of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law, told PolitiFact National.

One expert, David Kopel at the University of Denver law school, said he doesn’t think the figure was ever accurate because of what the survey actually asked.

On the other hand, three gun experts contacted by PolitiFact affiliates had different views.

""The 40 percent seems about right,"" said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

University of Central Florida Prof. Jay Corzine, who has attended and studied gun shows in Florida, says that,  based on his observation, no more than 15 to 20 percent of sales at gun shows occur without a background check. But when you add in other private sales, the 40 percent figure is ""probably accurate"" and ""a very good figure to use.""

Gary Kleck, a Florida State University professor whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, said conditions in the gun market haven’t changed much since the 1997 study was done.

Kleck says the 40 percent estimate is ""probably still reasonably valid today."" But he further argues that this fact shouldn’t guide new policy, because the problem is not how legal, background-checked purchasers are obtaining guns, but how criminals are.

We e-mailed links of the previous PolitiFact rulings to Cicilline’s office and asked whether the congressman had any new information to budge the Truth-O-Meter.

Richard Luchette, Cicilline’s communications director, responded in an e-mail noting that the figure came from the National Institute of Justice.

""As I'm sure you know, this is the most commonly cited statistic and most current report used by gun violence prevention advocates because there are a number of restrictions currently written into law that have prevented additional research from being performed on this issue,"" he said.

""We can go back and forth parsing this figure and looking at what other organizations have to say about it but I think you're missing the larger point,"" Luchette said. ""Our country has a serious problem with gun violence, especially with mass shootings.""

He said, ""Cicilline will remain focused on doing everything he can to address this problem.""

Our ruling

U.S. Rep. Cicilline said that more than 40 percent of gun sales nationally are made without background check.

Cicilline accurately quoted a figure that comes from a 15-year-old study, based on data that’s almost 20 years old.

Clearly, many gun sales are made without background checks. There’s no current, reliable data to estimate what percentage of sales are made that way and experts disagree on whether the 40-percent figure is still valid.

We rate Cicilline’s statement Half True.

"['Transportation', 'Texas', 'Lee Leffingwell']","
Lee Leffingwell says Austin trains are “full” at rush hour and “packed” for special events
","
Mayor Lee Leffingwell said he’s newly determined to place urban rail before Austin voters by the time his term ends in fall 2014.

""We all know that people will ride rail,"" Leffingwell said in his State of the City speech Feb. 5, 2013. ""Capital Metro’s Red Line trains are full not only during morning and evening rush hours but packed for big events like F1 and South By"" (Southwest).

The mayor and other Austin leaders support a transportation plan that includes an electric-powered urban rail project with an estimated price tag of $1.3 billion for the first 16 miles or so. Leffingwell campaigned in 2009 calling for a rail election in 2010 but pushed the vote to 2011, then 2012, before pulling his support for a November 2012 vote.

Diesel-powered commuter trains operated by Capital Metro, the city’s transit agency, have run since 2010 on the Red Line that Leffingwell cited, which covers a 32-mile route between Leander and downtown Austin, with several stops along the way.

And how full or packed are the trains these days?

Overall, ridership has tripled since 2010, according to Austin American-Statesman coverage, particularly after the March 2012 addition of Friday night and Saturday trains. A Feb. 3, 2013, Statesman transportation column said that in its early months, the service had 800 to 900 boardings per day, which rose to 2,500 per day in October and November 2012.

Usage spiked, the story said, during the music portion of the South by Southwest music, film and interactive conferences in March 2011 and 2012 and Austin’s first Formula 1 auto race, Nov. 17, 2012.

Capital Metro spokeswoman Erica Macioge told us the mayor’s statement was correct and emailed us ridership data and charts for weekdays, SXSW and F1, plus a month-by-month overview illustrating ridership growth that showed sharp spikes for SXSW 2011 and 2012: 


Each train, Macioge said, has 108 seats; standing room brings capacity to 200. Capital Metro considers a train full if all seats are taken, she said.

On March 17, 2012 -- the Saturday that fell during the music portion of SXSW -- Capital Metro provided 48 train runs, for a total seated capacity of 5,184. There were 7,316 boardings that day, Macioge said, giving an average of 152 people on each train trip.

For Nov. 17, 2012 -- the day of the F1 race -- Capital Metro made 47 train runs, providing a total 5,076 seats. Boardings that day added up to 6,210, meaning each train carried on average 132 passengers.

How about rush hour? And what is rush hour, anyway? The Texas Department of Transportation doesn’t have an official definition, spokeswoman Kelli Reyna told us by phone, but when planning and timing roadwork, it uses 7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. as average guidelines for Austin.

Monday through Friday, Macioge said, Capital Metro runs six trips south to downtown Austin in the morning and six trips north to Leander in the evening. The agency’s statistician, she said, suggested looking at October 2012 for a ""typical"" month, and supplied that data.

Five of the six morning trips averaged more than 108 passengers; the last run averaged only 91. All but the first trip also either arrived or departed during rush hour; the earliest began and ended before 7 a.m.

The five morning rush-hour trips averaged 155 passengers in October 2012 -- above the seating capacity of 108, edging toward the standing-room capacity of 200.

Weekday evenings, five of Capital Metro’s six northbound train trips depart or arrive between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. The first averaged 88 riders in October 2012, but the rest were all above the seating capacity. Average number of passengers: 155, just like the morning rush. (In a world filled with mismatched statistics, we were relieved to see Capital Metro evidently takes the same number of commuters home as the number that shipped out in the morning.)

Our ruling

Leffingwell said Capital Metro’s trains are ""full"" during rush hour and ""packed"" for events such as SXSW and the F1 race.

Capital Metro considers a train full if all 108 seats are occupied, but would a typical commuter agree? After the seats are full, 92 additional passengers can ride standing up (and pay the same fares to do so). If you’re a rider who needs to get to work, there’s a big difference between a train you can board and a train that’s so packed you have to wait for the next one.

At the peak of the special events Leffingwell named in 2012, about 48 more people could have ridden the average SXSW Saturday train and another 68 could have boarded an average F1 train. It’s a tighter squeeze at rush hour: With average ridership at 155, the trains tend to have all seats full and so many standing riders that only about 45 more can squish aboard.

Seats might all be occupied, but there’s almost always still room on the trains for more passengers. We rate the mayor’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA18B80>],/factchecks/2013/feb/09/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-austin-trains-are-full-rush-h/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Zoe Lofgren']","
Rep. Zoe Lofgren says U.S. laws have rarely barred access to citizenship
","
Rep. Zoe Lofgren says the United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants.

During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Feb. 5, 2013, Lofgren, D-Calif., turned to the history books for perspective on the question of what status to grant newcomers to the United States.

""What makes America special is that people come here, assimilate and become American with all of the rights and responsibilities citizenship bestows,"" Lofgren said. ""With the exception of slavery and the Chinese Exclusion Act, our laws have never barred persons from becoming citizens, and we should not start now.""

Lofgren is an immigration lawyer and law professor, which made us that much more interested in checking out her claim that only twice in history has the U.S. ""barred persons from becoming citizens.""

Lofgren’s examples

As the debate over immigration reform cranks up, a key point of contention is citizenship vs. legal residence. On one side are those who favor an arduous checklist that, once completed, grants immigrants all the rights of natural-born Americans. Opponents call that amnesty and argue that immigrants should be limited to a status such as permanent legal residence.

In the hearing, Lofgren warned that anything less than full citizenship could create a ""permanent underclass,"" then mentioned slaves and Chinese immigrants. It’s clear from the context of the discussion that Lofgren was talking about ethnic groups in history who were subject to sweeping bans. But we would point out that even current law prohibits some groups of people from becoming U.S. citizens, namely those convicted of crimes. The law says applicants must be of ""good moral character"" who adhere to ""the principles of the Constitution of the United States.""

""The ‘attached to constitutional principles’ (provision) is rarely invoked,"" said Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis. ""It previously was used to bar communists, anarchists and sympathizers from naturalization. It also was invoked previously to bar Jehovah's Witnesses who rejected mandatory military service. Criminal convictions are the most likely modern exclusion for naturalization.""

Criminals aside, we are focusing in this fact-check on Lofgren’s claim regarding ethnic groups in history. 
Starting with slavery, it might seem self-evident that slaves were not considered citizens, but here’s a bit of background.

Delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 clashed over how to count slaves for purposes of representation in Congress and distributing taxes. Southern slave owners wanted them counted, while Northern delegates argued to count only free people. They ultimately reached a compromise that three-fifths of the slave population would be considered for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. Even though their owners argued for slaves’ ""personhood"" in this conflict, in all other ways slaves were considered property, not people.

Nearly 100 years later, the U.S. Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sanford provided some of the most explicit direction on the subject. Scott was a former slave who had moved to a free state and petitioned the court to grant him his freedom.

Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote the opinion that slaves ""were not intended to be included under the word ‘citizens’ in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States.""

The decision was overturned in 1868 by the adoption of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which proclaimed citizenship for ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States,"" regardless of race.

Now, about the Chinese. About 20 years after the 14th Amendment was adopted, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 in reaction to the flood of Chinese immigrants drawn by the California gold rush. The act suspended immigration of Chinese laborers and required any who were already here to obtain certification to re-enter if they left the country. It also explicitly prevented state and federal courts from granting citizenship to Chinese resident aliens.

What else?

We asked several immigration historians if Lofgren’s statement was accurate and learned that it needs some clarification and additional information.

Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota, pointed to the 1790 Naturalization Act as the first U.S. law to limit the rights of naturalized citizenship to ""free, white men."" We think that falls under the heading of slavery, as Lofgren mentioned, but it’s interesting to note that that law remained in effect until 1952.

What’s more, Chinese immigrants were not the only group besides slaves to be blocked from citizenship. Bill Ong Hing, a law professor at the University of San Francisco and author of the book Making and Remaking Asian America Through Immigration Policy, 1850-1990, said the naturalization laws of 1870 were intended and later interpreted by the Supreme Court to bar all Asian immigrants from becoming U.S. citizens, not just the Chinese.

""The law restricted naturalization to ‘white persons’ and people of ‘African descent,’"" said Carl Bon Tempo, a history professor at the University of Albany. ""This had the effect of barring certain persons from naturalizing as citizens – most importantly Asians. The Supreme Court, in fact, upheld this racialized naturalization process in the 1920s. In Ozawa v. U.S., the court ruled against the application for citizenship of a Japanese immigrant on the grounds of his race.""

Chinese were finally allowed to naturalize in 1943, Hing said, when the Exclusion Act was repealed; Filipinos and Asian Indians in 1946, and other Asians including Japanese in 1952.

Our ruling

Lofgren said that, ""with the exception of slavery and the Chinese Exclusion Act, our laws have never barred persons from becoming citizens.""

Immigration experts told us that history is more complicated than Lofgren described, with the most important point being that other Asian groups were also targeted by federal immigration laws.

Sacramento Bee editorial says Texas is last in mental health care spending
","
Disparaging Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch for California businesses to check out opportunities in his state, the Sacramento Bee editorial board said Texas ranks poorly in several ways.

We’ve been sorting through the Feb. 6, 2013, editorial’s factual claims. Click here to read our collected checks.

Among the claims: ""Come check out a state that is last in mental health expenditures...""

That’s familiar. We recently looked into the same characterization by state Sen. Wendy Davis, rating it Mostly True. Another state lagged Texas in the latest national ranking of states.

Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, pointed us to the same source that Davis cited, a Dec. 18, 2012, news story posted by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, that was headlined ""Texas ranks last in mental health funding.""

That story said Texas ranked last in the country in per-person mental health spending based on dollar amounts it attributed to the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities. When we inquired, a center official told us they gave WFAA information about spending in fiscal 2009 as written up in an August 2012 report by the Texas-based Hogg Foundation for Mental Health. The Hogg Foundation, in turn, said its source was a listing of per-person mental health care spending data in 50 states by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser foundation charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. Its per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56.

California was 14th among the states, at $152.60 in such spending per person.

Our ruling

The editorial says Texas is last in mental health spending.

In 2010, the latest year analyzed, Texas spent more in raw dollars on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after ranking last to all other states for several years.

"['Education', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says U.S. education is ""slipping"" behind other nations
","
For the good of the state and the good of the nation, Gov. Bob McDonnell has asked the General Assembly to approve a package of education reforms this winter.

""The brutal fact is, when it comes to educating our young people, America is slipping,""  McDonnell said in his State of the Commonwealth address on Jan. 9.

""While Virginia's schools rate well nationally, according to the Program for International Student Assessment, the United States now ranks 14th in reading, 17th in science, and 25th in mathematics."" he added. ""This is unacceptable. Those are not grades that we want to put on the national refrigerator.""

We checked whether the U.S. really is slipping in world education rankings.

McDonnell made the claim while urging lawmakers to approve his education agenda that would grade all public schools and empower the state to take over schools that receive failing marks.

The international assessment test McDonnell cited is a two-hour exam given to a representative sample of 15-year-olds in an increasing number of nations.  The testing started in 2000 and has been given every three years to measure literacy in reading, math and science. The results show the average scores, weighted for demographics, in each country.

Most of the 34 member nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- an industrialized group of mostly Western European and North American countries -- participate each testing cycle. A smattering of other countries, such as Russia, Indonesia and Brazil, and regional educational systems in China also take part.  

In 2000, 32 countries participated. That grew to 65 nations in 2009, the most recent test year with published results.  

Let’s look at the United States’ rankings, as reported by the National Center for Educational Statistics:

Reading
*In 2000, the U.S. was 15th among 28 OECD countries and 15th of 32 total nations.
*In 2003, 15th among 30 OECD countries and 18th among 41 overall.
*In 2006, U.S. scores were not tabulated because of a printing error in the test books.
*In 2009, tied for 12th among 34 OECD countries and was 15th among 65 total nations.

Science
*In 2000, the U.S. was 14th among the 28 OECD countries and 14th of 32 total nations.
*In 2003, 19th among 30 OECD countries and 22nd among 41 overall.
*In 2006, 21st among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 57 overall.
*In 2009, 17th among 34 OECD countries and 23rd among 65 overall.

Math
*In 2000, the U.S was 18th among 28 OECD countries and 19th of 32 total nations.
*In 2003, 24th among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 41 overall.
*In 2006, 25th among 30 OECD countries and 35th among 57 overall.
*In 2009, 25th among 34 OECD countries and 31st among 65 overall.

Now, let’s take a look at the actual test scores over the last decade, which were calculated on a scale from 0 to 1,000. We can compare the average score of U.S. students to those of all students from OECD nations. The National Center for Educational Statistics does not compute a worldwide average that includes every single nation that participates in the test.

In reading, the U.S. average was 504 in 2000, 495 in 2003 and 500 in 2009. Results, as we noted, were not tabulated in 2006. The OECD average was 500 in 2000, 494 in 2003 and 493 in 2009.

In science, the U.S. average was 499 in 2000, 491 in 2003, 489 in 2006 and 502 in 2009. The OECD average was each year was either 500 or 501.

In math, U.S. students scored 493 in 2000, 483 in 2003, 474 in 2006 and 487 in 2009. The OECD average was 500 for the first two tests, followed by 498 and 496.

What conclusions should be drawn from this data? Experts said the results do not show a decline in America’s education standing, but a solid, middle-of-the pack position.

""The pattern of scores over the years shows that we’ve held fairly steady,"" said Robert Pianta, dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia.

Tom Loveless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies international testing, said scores bounce around routinely, but the long-term trend is positive in American education. The U.S. participates in several international tests and typically scores in the the middle or just above the middle of the pack.

""All these tests measure different things, but they all confirm that education is improving, it could be improving faster and there is more room for improvement, but we’re definitely not in decline,"" he said. ""The idea that any of these tests are saying that American education is in decline is false.""

McDonnell is hardly the first politician to claim the U.S. education system is slipping in status. Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president last year, cited the same statistics and said the country has ""fallen way behind."" And in 2009, President Barack Obama said that ""we have let our grades slip"" and ""other nations outpace us.""

Loveless says it’s simply not the case.

""The first international test was given in 1960 to 12 countries and the U.S. came in 11th out of 12,"" he said. ""We’ve never done well on these tests.""

Loveless said the U.S. -- unlike some of the nations with top test rankings -- tends to prize well-rounded students by teaching many subjects, encouraging extracurricular activities and social interaction at school.

We asked McDonnell’s office if it had any further explanation of the governor’s statement.

""In the past decade, the United States has not ranked among the top 10 countries in reading literacy, science literacy or mathematics literacy,"" Paul Logan, deputy director of communications, said in an email. ""The governor believes that every year we lag behind other countries in education is a year in which we are slipping in our ability to compete for the jobs of the 21st century.""

Our ruling

McDonnell said that ""when it comes to educating our young people, America is slipping"" in worldwide rankings. The international test results he referred to have been administered every three years since 2000.

There’s a tiny element of truth to McDonnell’s claim: America’s math standing dipped last decade when compared with other nations in the OECD. But even that overlooks the fact that U.S. math scores, after a mid-decade drop, rebounded in 2009, when the last test results were published. And when all countries that took the exam in 2009 are considered, the U.S. ranked in the top half in math for the first time.

McDonnell ignored critical facts that paint a different picture of America’s performance. During the last decade, the U.S. edged up in the rankings on reading and remained at the 50th percentile in science among OECD nations.   

""Slipping"" implies lower scores and rankings. That’s not the case. The U.S. has never ranked near the top in education test scores and, with a possible exception for math, has not lost ground to other countries. We rate McDonnell’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAC2380>],/factchecks/2013/feb/08/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-us-education-slipping-behind-other-/

Sacramento Bee editorial says Texas ranks first in executions
","In an editorial poking at Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch for California businesses to consider moving to Texas, the Sacramento Bee's editorial board said Texas ranks poorly in several ways.

""Come check out a state that ranks first in the number of executions, first in the number of uninsured, first in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and first in the amount of toxic chemicals released into water,"" the Feb. 6, 2013, editorial says.

We’ll take up the reference to executions in this fact check. Click here to read the rest.

Texas has executed more convicts than any other state since the legality of the death penalty was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse that has written reports critical of the death penalty.

From 1977 through early February 2012, Texas executed 492 prisoners, the center says. No other state came close. Virginia ranked a distant second, with 110 executions, Oklahoma fell third with 102.

California, incidentally, ranked first among the states in Death Row inmates, with 724 of 3,146 nationally as of Oct. 1, 2012. Florida was next, at 411, and Texas was third, with 304.

The center’s executive director, Richard Dieter, said by email that in 2012, Texas was third in the number of new death sentences (9), behind Florida (22) and California (13). The same year, according to the center, Texas executed 15 inmates, tops among the states, while Oklahoma, Mississippi and Arizona each put six individuals to death.

Dieter also said Oklahoma has bested Texas in executions compared to the state’s population. A center chart indicates that through Aug. 2, 2011, Oklahoma had a rate of 0.26 executions per 10,000 residents. The Texas rate was nearly 0.19, which was higher than rates for any of the other states.

Our ruling

The editorial said Texas ranks first in the number of executions.

That’s correct both over the decades and for the latest full year. We rate this claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDCDEC0>],/factchecks/2013/feb/08/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-ranks-first-ex/

Barney Frank says U.S. share of global defense spending higher than during the Cold War
","
UPDATE: We first published this item on Aug. 4, 2010, and rated Frank's claim False. We heard from many readers who said we made the wrong call and urged us to take a second look. We did so, and have concluded that we put too much emphasis on percentage of GDP in reaching our original conclusion. We are now rating the claim Half True.   
Seeking to build a case that the United States should cut its defense budget, Rep. Barney Frank, D.-Mass., said the U.S. now accounts for a larger share of worldwide military spending than it did during the Cold War.

On MSNBC’s Morning Joe, on July 7, 2010, Frank said, ""During the Cold War... [the United States accounted for] 26 percent of worldwide military spending. . . We're now 41 percent of worldwide military spending.""

His comments followed a Huffington Post article he co-authored with an unlikely political ally: Rep. Ron Paul, a Republican from Texas. It said Congress should substantially cut defense spending to reduce the deficit.

First we started by checking Frank's percentages. Although he was imprecise in his wording referring to spending during the Cold War, his office told us he was comparing 1986 with 2006, so the percentage Frank used for Cold War spending was a snapshot of a conflict that stretched from roughly 1947 to 1991.

Frank’s choice of 1986 might seem arbitrary, but few countries recorded or gathered data on their military resources before the 1960s -- halfway through the conflict. And reports indicate reliable comparisons are only available for the 1980s -- the last decade of the Cold War. We reviewed records of U.S. defense spending, and spending in 1986 was at one of its highest points of the Cold War years, so if Frank is cherry picking, he's at least being fair by picking a year on the high end (picking a year of low spending might have presented an even wider disparity with regard to the growing share of worldwide defense spending shouldered by the United States).

The source of Frank's figures was a report by the Project on Defense Alternatives, a group that advocates for the gradual demilitarization of international relations. And the report shows his 1986 number was off slightly, which his office acknowledged when we called. U.S. military expenditures were 28 percent of worldwide military spending in 1986, not 26 percent. His figure for 2006 was accurate.

We spoke to the report's author, Carl Conetta, co-director of the Project on defense Alternatives, who said the data was primarily obtained from the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's ""World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers"" reports, as well as from the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Conetta said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan obviously inflated the U.S.'s 2006 defense spending figures. If that war spending was backed out of the equation, he said, the U.S. accounted for about 37 percent of worldwide defense spending in 2006. But he added that in more recent years -- even with war spending taken out of the picture --the number is closer to the 41 percent cited by Frank.

When we looked, we found that worldwide military spending dropped precipitously after the Cold War ended in 1991, falling by 40 percent between 1987 -- when it had peaked -- and 1995. Even though worldwide spending has risen consistently since 1995, adjusted for inflation, it’s still significantly below its Cold War highs. In other words, whatever percent of global expenditures the U.S. accounts for today, it’s a piece of a substantially smaller pie.

While other countries were cutting their defense spending, the United States increased its spending some over the same period (in dollars adjusted for inflation).

There's another way to measure defense spending that we feel is worth noting. A comparison can be drawn between a country’s military expenditures as a percent of gross domestic product, since that figure is not contingent on other countries’ expenditures.

We looked at the years Frank cited using that measure. While federal outlays for national defense in the U.S. accounted for 6.2 percent of the GDP in 1986, according to a Historical Tables report by the Office of Budget Management, they accounted for only 4.0 percent of the GDP in 2006. During that period, the GDP in the United States rose by a whopping 45 percent, so military spending would have had to increase significantly to keep pace.

Some may assume Frank's statistic means that U.S. spending on military has increased so dramatically that the U.S. share of military spending now comprises a significantly larger percentage of the world's military spending. But as the numbers show, that's not necessarily the case. Rather, other countries essentially cut their military spending while the United States slightly increased its spending. As a result, the United States now comprises a larger share of a smaller worldwide pie.

There are lots of ways to evaluate defense spending.

It's appropriate to look at spending as a percentage of GDP, said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. But it's also perfectly appropriate to consider what the United States spends compared to the rest of the world. There are differences in those comparisons, but both are valid statistics to consider, he said.

""It's a legitimate to ask, 'Why we are spending so much on defense if we are the world's only super power?'"" Ellis said.

Frank's statistic is not only accurate, said William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation, ""I think it makes sense for the point (Frank) was trying to make. The others are going down and we're going up. We're at the highest levels since World War II.""

We were wary of Frank singling out 1986 to speak sweepingly for several decades of the Cold War. Conetta, the author of the report Frank based his comments on, said 1986 was used because it was near the peak of Cold War spending by the United States. U.S. spending as a percentage of worldwide defense spending would certainly change if you were to select different Cold War years, Conetta said, but probably only by a few percentage points (not counting years of armed conflict, like during the Korean War).

And yet, there is clearly room for legitimate debate about which types of statistics one chooses to evaluate defense spending and how they should be presented. Frank cited a growing U.S. share of worldwide defense spending without also noting that U.S. defense spending -- as a percentage of GDP -- has actually decreased significantly since the Cold War, or that the growing disparity is largely driven by the fact that many other countries (primarily Russia) decreased their defense spending after the Cold War. 
Frank accurately (or very nearly so) cites those figures for 1986 and 2006, but they take on a different meaning in the broader context. So we rate Frank's comment Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAAFEC0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/13/barney-frank/barney-frank-says-us-share-global-defense-spending/

Dennigan says U.S. is amassing its military strength to fight fewer than 100 al Qaeda in Afghanistan
","
As Washington debates the effectiveness of President Obama's counterinsurgency plan in Afghanistan, one congressional hopeful here has blasted the strategy.

Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Dennigan, one of several candidates challenging U.S. Rep. James Langevin for his District 2 seat, criticizes the move to add troops in Afghanistan and questions Langevin's judgment in recently voting in favor of $33 billion in supplemental funding.

Her take: ""Our massive, expensive presence in Afghanistan undermines our efforts to eliminate safe havens for al Qaeda in Pakistan and to fight these determined terrorists globally.""

That's her opinion and she's entitled to that. But then she cited a fact that got our attention: ""We are amassing most of our military strength in a country where fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda remain,"" she wrote.

The latest numbers from the Department of Defense indicate there are about 100,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan, up from about 87,000 earlier this year. As of last week, there were 62,000 troops in Iraq, down sharply from recent months. But that's just the tally of those serving in the two major offensives.

In total, the Pentagon reports that there are approximately 1.4 million active-duty U.S. military personnel.

The 100,000 troops serving in Afghanistan represent less than 10 percent of total military forces -- hardly ""most of our military strength.""

But as of March when the most recent calculation was done, the total U.S. deployment overseas numbered roughly 300,000. Given the changes in troop levels, that number is now closer to 200,000, including those in combat and non-combat situations. A very rough calculation would therefore suggest that the troops deployed to Afghanistan do account for around  half of those. So Dennigan is slightly off the mark when she uses the phrase ""most.""

The more interesting statistic in her statement is that there are fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda left in Afghanistan.

The question of al Qaeda's strength has been debated for years in political circles, until earlier this summer when CIA Director Leon Panetta, in an appearance on ABC's ""This Week,"" settled some of the mystery by offering his best estimate of al Qaeda's presence.

The number, he said, is ""relatively small.""

""At most, we're looking at maybe 50 to 100, maybe less,"" Panetta said. ""It's in that vicinity. There's no question that the main location of al Qaeda is in tribal areas of Pakistan.""

The CIA director's assessment was so unusual that it quickly made the rounds on the Internet, generating millions of hits and political buzz aplenty. That's how the Dennigan campaign said they found the statistic, and why they felt comfortable repeating it.

 ""He's the CIA director. He's the guy who would have the most information,"" said Dennigan spokesman Tim McLaughlin.

Is there a way to know for sure whether Panetta's numbers are correct? No. At least not without a higher security clearance than we'll ever get.  

But for now it is the most up to date and official pronouncement we can locate. So unless and until we find a more accurate figure, we’ll rely on Panetta’s estimate and assume that Dennigan is right on that point. We rate this as Mostly True.

Nancy Pelosi says state-local aid bill is fully paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes
","
On Aug. 10, 2010, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., released a victory-lap press release after her chamber passed a bill to provide $26 billion in aid to states and localities. Pelosi and fellow Democrats touted the bill as a way to save the jobs of 319,000 state and local employees, including teachers and health care workers. Republicans blasted it as more unaffordable stimulus spending and a giveaway to unionized government workers. Ultimately, the bill passed on a near-party-line vote, 247-161, and was quickly signed into law by President Barack Obama.

In the news release, Pelosi emphasized that the bill was fiscally responsible. In a series of bullet points, the release said that the bill ""is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas."" It added that the bill ""reduces the deficit by $1.4 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.""

We wondered about Pelosi's statement that the bill is ""is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas.""

So we turned to the official arbiter of the costs of congressional legislation, the Congressional Budget Office. In its cost estimate, CBO backs up the assertion that the bill is ""fully paid-for.""

Specifically, between 2010 and 2019, the bill is estimated to actually reduce the deficit by $3 million. When you add in an additional year -- making the budget window 2010 to 2020 -- the bill would reduce the deficit by $1.371 billion or, rounded up, the $1.4 billion that the Speaker's release refers to.

Case closed? Not quite.

The release said the bill ""is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas."" That's not the case.

According to CBO's analysis, the corporate tax changes in the bill that Pelosi is referring to will amount to $9.8 billion between 2010 and 2020. These are a mix of tax policies that only a CPA could understand, from ""rules to prevent splitting foreign tax credits from the income to which they relate"" (worth almost $4.3 billion in newly captured revenue) to ""denial of foreign tax credit with respect to foreign income not subject to United States taxation by reason of covered asset acquisitions"" (worth more than $3.6 billion), to ""limitation on the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to section 956 inclusions"" (worth $704 million).

But that $9.8 billion in corporate tax cuts won't cover the full $26 billion cost of the bill. The bulk of the money comes from something Pelosi's office chose not to mention in the press release -- almost $12 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (more commonly known as the food stamp program) beginning in 2014. Another $1.1 billion would come from cuts to advanced refundability of the earned income tax credit starting in 2011. The earned income credit is a tax credit that benefits the working poor. Several billion dollars more would come from a variety of spending cuts known as rescissions.

Some of Pelosi's fellow Democrats complained about the cuts on the day of the vote, even though they ultimately chose to support the bill anyway.

""I am outraged by a reduction in Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that is used to pay for this measure,"" said Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. ""Those who receive the meager SNAP benefits are the most poor and the most vulnerable in our society.""

Said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. ""Although this legislation is critically needed, I am greatly disappointed that the Senate included as a 'pay-for,' a provision reducing (stimulus)-enacted increases in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps, beginning in 2014. SNAP provides vital, short-term support to individuals during their greatest time of need, ensuring that there is food on the table for themselves and their children.""

In the meantime, because few lawmakers like to vote for cuts to programs that serve poor families, some suggest that the food stamp cuts will be rescinded before they take effect. Indeed, Pelosi, in a fact sheet about the bill, said that ""House Democrats will work to restore this funding before the cuts are implemented in 2014."" The fact sheet did not indicate how that will be paid for.

""Of course, no one believes these cuts will be allowed to take place,"" said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""This is fantasy land.""

So Pelosi's news release is highly misleading because it leaves out the fact that almost half the money paying for the bill comes from cuts to a program very popular with Democrats.

It's worth noting that Pelosi has taken reporters' questions about the food stamp cuts, and in a floor speech before the vote, Pelosi said in part, ""While I don’t support all of the provisions, I am not happy about the taking money from our energy sector or from food stamps, but I hope that we can, Mr. Chairman, make that up in another way."" In addition, the fact sheet sent to reporters by Pelosi's office cited the food stamp cuts.

So while Pelosi's release was correct in saying the bill was ""fully paid-for,"" it was incorrect to simply say that came from ""costly corporate tax loopholes"" (though it wouldn't have had much Democratic appeal if she'd added ""and cuts to food stamps."") In reality, not even a majority of the money is from corporate tax provisions. If Pelosi had said this during a fast-paced television interview, we'd be willing to cut her some slack, but this description came from a press release written by her office, so they had ample time and space to explain all of the bill's provisions, as they had in fact done in other contexts. So we rate the statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7698C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-state-local-aid-bill-fully-paid-/

Todd Staples' consultant says Democrat Hank Gilbert has theft and unsafe driving convictions, multiple liens and fines, was accused of taking bribe and lied on questionnaire
","
On behalf of Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, a campaign consultant recently ripped Staples’ Democratic challenger, Hank Gilbert. 
Consultant Bryan Eppstein’s July 15 e-mail to PolitiFact Texas says: ""The (D)emocrat candidate for Texas commissioner of agriculture has a criminal conviction for theft, has multiple years of unpaid taxes, has multiple tax liens and fines, unsafe driving convictions, has recently been accused of taking a bribe and is on record lying to the press this year about his criminal record."" 
Bombshells? 
Hardly. Several news articles have been written on Gilbert’s legal history, and the Staples campaign has aired them on its ""Guilty Guilty Gilbert"" website. 
Generally, the campaigns have sniped so much that the Houston Chronicle has called the race a ""snarling, gouging, roll-in-the-dirt rhetorical grudge match,"" a reference to their 2006 faceoff when Staples beat Gilbert to win his office. 
Novel or not, the Staples campaign (through a surrogate) lobs six (count ‘em) charges. Do they stick? 
Let’s start with the criminal conviction. In January 2001, according to a Smith County court document, Gilbert, who lives near the East Texas burg of Whitehouse, pleaded guilty to a Class C misdemeanor theft charge, paying a $100 fine plus court costs. 
Earlier this year, the American-Statesman quoted as Gilbert saying the arrest originated in miscommunication between accountants for a cleaning service he and his wife own. That miscommunication, Gilbert said, led to three months’ worth of payroll taxes going unpaid. The snafu, Gilbert said, also resulted in a $100 check that he thinks was written to Lowe’s, the home improvement store, initially going unpaid. The check touched off the theft charge, according to Gilbert. 
Vince Leibowitz, Gilbert’s campaign manager, objected to calling the misdemeanor conviction ""theft,"" saying it was ""theft by check."" He shared a copy of what he said was Gilbert’s plea agreement; it says he was charged with ""theft by check,"" a Class B misdemeanor. A judgment signed by a county court-at-law judge says Gilbert pleaded guilty to the ""lesser included offense of Theft C."" 
We contacted the Smith County district attorney’s office where Leslie McLean, an assistant district attorney, confirmed that Gilbert was originally charged with Class B ""theft by check."" 
On a related front, McLean said Gilbert’s case stemmed from a $149.39 check paid to a local resident — information a bit different from what Gilbert said earlier this year. 
As to unpaid taxes, the Statesman quoted Gilbert as saying he and his wife had 18 months remaining on an IRS repayment plan. According to the newspaper’s report, Gilbert had to pay back not only missed tax payments, but also two years’ worth of penalties and interest to cover for the period he did not know their business had missed his payments. 
""Small businesses go through this kind of thing every day,"" Gilbert told the Statesman. ""Unfortunately a lot of them choose the easy way out and stiff whoever they owe and never pay them. That’s not the kind of people we are."" 
Smith County records posted by Staples’ campaign indicate that Gilbert faced tax liens for unpaid taxes in 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2002. All told, the records indicate, he accumulated $77,126 in taxes and penalties. Leibowitz told us Gilbert is repaying everything. 
And Gilbert’s driving record? A Smith County document posted by Staples’ campaign indicates Gilbert got a ticket for driving with an expired driver’s license in April 2008 for which he paid a $134.50 fine plus court costs in January 2010. That month, his campaign told the Dallas Morning News that Gilbert dealt with the ticket after aides noticed he was driving with the expired license. The newspaper said he’d gotten the ticket for the expired license when he got a speeding ticket in 2008. 
Another Smith County document says Gilbert was ticketed in March 2005 for driving without a seat belt, later paying a $53 fine plus court costs. ""I never wear one,"" Gilbert was quoted in the Morning News this January. ""I just plug them in to keep them from dinging."" 
Linda Culp, chief clerk of the county’s Precinct 3 Justice of the Peace court, checked county records and found that in addition to what the Staples campaign highlighted, Gilbert paid fines for tickets he got in 1997-98 for speeding, not wearing a seat belt and not having auto insurance. 
In Gilbert’s defense, Leibowitz said: ""When you look at driving without a seat belt, that is not necessarily unsafe to other passengers on the road. That is unsafe to you."" The campaign manager said Gilbert does use his seat belt, contrary to what the candidate told the Dallas newspaper. 
Let’s pull over and assess the first four charges in Eppstein’s statement. 
Criminal conviction for theft? Actually, Gilbert was charged with the Class B misdemeanor of ""theft by check"" and pleaded guilty to a lesser, Class C charge, according to the court documents provided by his campaign. 
Multiple years of unpaid taxes? Yes (though Gilbert’s said he’s paying them back). 
Multiple tax liens and fines? Yes, yet note the repayment declaration. 
Unsafe driving convictions? Gilbert acknowledges tickets he’s paid, including for speeding and not wearing his seat belt. Smith County says he previously paid for tickets on other violations. 
Next, let’s tackle the rest of Eppstein’s sally — that Gilbert has recently been accused of taking a bribe and is on record lying to the press about his criminal record. 
Kinky Friedman, Gilbert’s opponent for the Democratic nomination for agriculture commissioner, raised his eyebrows in January at the revelation in campaign contribution and expenditure reports that Gilbert fielded $150,000 in donations from Farouk Shami, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, in late 2009 after Gilbert left the governor’s race to run for ag commissioner. 
Friedman called the donations a bribe. Gilbert’s campaign replied there was no payoff. Shami said likewise. And that’s where everyone left it, far as we can tell. 
Eppstein’s last punch — that Gilbert is on record lying to the press this year about his criminal record — refers to Gilbert’s responses on a questionnaire from the Dallas Morning News. Staples’ website says the question was: ""Have you ever been arrested?"" 
Gilbert answered that he was arrested for an ""unpaid traffic ticket,"" according to an excerpt from the questionnaire posted by Staples’ campaign. Eppstein, objecting, said Gilbert omitted his 2001 conviction. However, Leibowitz told us, the Democrat was never arrested on that charge, a point confirmed by Laurita Vodak, court coordinator for Smith County Court-at-Law No. 3. 
How do the last two claims by Eppstein rate? Well, Gilbert was accused of taking a bribe, but that charge came from a political opponent, hardly an impartial force. 
Staples’ last claim — that Gilbert lied by not including his theft conviction in answering the question about arrests — is flawed. Gilbert wasn’t arrested on the charge, though he certainly faced justice and could have mentioned the conviction on the questionnaire. 
All in all, we rate the Staples campaign’s statement Half True. 
Footnote: We’d be happy not to sort multi-part charges again. That OK with everyone?",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8B4F80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/13/todd-staples/todd-staples-consultant-says-democrat-hank-gilbert/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Pundits', 'Stimulus', 'Taxes', 'Rachel Maddow']","
Maddow claims spending is more stimulative than tax cuts
","Tax cuts are popular with Republicans, but they don't boost the economy as much as other types of government spending, Rachel Maddow, the liberal MSNBC talk show host, said on her show Aug. 6, 2010.

Talking to Ezra Klein, a Washington Post columnist and an MSNBC contributor, about the economy and the upcoming November elections, Maddow took a stab at one of the cornerstones of the GOP platform.

""Is there anything that would make a real impact on job numbers that Republicans are willing to support? Obviously, we know they‘re willing to support tax cuts. We know that tax cuts are remarkably un-stimulative when you compare them with different kinds of government spending, different allocations of resources. Is there anything? They keep saying jobs are their priority. Have they shown a willingness to embrace anything that would make a dent on jobs?""

Maddow's use of the phrase ""we know"" got us thinking -- do economists really agree that cutting taxes is less effective than increasing government spending? We decided to look into it.

First, however, a crash course on ""Keynesian economics."" The name comes from John Maynard Keynes, a 20th century British economist. (For a musical lesson of the economic debate, check out the Hayek vs. Keynes Rap Anthem.) As Greg Mankiw, a Harvard economics professor, explains in a summer 2010 edition of National Affairs magazine, Keynes believed that ""extreme and sustained unemployment during a recession"" is fundamentally the result of ""a decline in overall (or aggregate) demand in the economy."" The government can ""help restore normalcy"" by increasing demand through spending, writes Mankiw. ""And because the influx of government spending drives businesses to hire and consumers to spend, its impact is multiplied.""

According to classic Keynesian theory, government spending increases have a higher ""multiplier"" than tax cuts, because individuals might choose to save the money from tax cuts, rather than spend it.

Is there data to back up Keynes' -- and, by extension, Rachel Maddow's -- argument?

Yes, but there's also data that certain types of tax cuts can have a similar impact.

To start out, we turned to testimony by Mark Zandi before the Senate Finance Committee on April 14, 2010. Zandi is the chief economist for Moody's Economy.com and a former adviser to Republican Sen. John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign. Page 5 of the testimony contains a table that summarizes Zandi's calculated ""bang for the buck"" for various fiscal stimulus programs. Spending $1 on unemployment insurance benefits, for example, increases the GDP -- the value of goods and services that the economy produces -- by $1.61 a year later, according to Zandi. (We found some counter-arguments in a previous Truth-O-Meter item checking New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's use of Zandi's data.) A temporary increase in food stamps has the biggest stimulative effect. For each dollar spent, GDP grows by $1.74 one year later. For spending increases as a whole, the ""bang for the buck"" ranges from $1.13 for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to $1.74 for food stamps.

The former economist for the GOP presidential candidate also looked at the stimulative effect of tax cuts. Making the Bush income tax cuts permanent has a multiplier of 0.32, which means that for every dollar the government cuts in taxes, GDP grows by $0.32. Cutting the corporate tax rate also has a multiplier of $0.32. According to the chart, the most stimulative tax cut initiative would be a job tax credit, which has a multiplier of $1.30.

So based on Zandi's research, Maddow is on solid ground. All but one of the spending programs that Zandi analyzed have a multiplier significantly higher than one. The highest multiplier for tax cuts is $1.30.

Christina Romer, who heads President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers until she steps down Sept. 3, 2010, also addressed the question of fiscal multipliers in a speech at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business on Feb. 27, 2009. She began by acknowledging that ""estimating these multipliers is difficult and that there is surely substantial uncertainty around any estimate."" She then went on to argue, however, that based on her analysis with Jared Bernstein (an economic advisor to Vice President Joe Biden) of the stimulus package that President Obama signed in February 2009, ""a tax cut has a multiplier of roughly 1.0 after about a year and a half, and spending has a multiplier of about 1.6."" In other words, government spending is more effective than cutting taxes.

Likewise, in 2009, Matthew Shapiro and Joel Slemrod, economics professors at the University of Michigan, found the 2008 federal tax rebates did not provide a big boost for consumer spending. ""Because of the low spending propensity, the rebates in 2008 provided low 'bang for the buck' as economic stimulus. Putting cash into the hands of the consumers who use it to save or pay off debt boosts their well-being, but it does not necessarily make them spend. In particular, low-income individuals were particularly likely to use the rebate to pay off debt.""

Still, it is a long-running joke that if you ask 10 economists a question, you get 10 different answers, and the size of fiscal multipliers is no exception. There are plenty of economists who have found that tax cuts -- particularly cuts that encourage investment -- can have a strong stimulative effect.

We spoke with Valerie Ramey, an economics professor at the University of California-San Diego, who has done much research on estimating fiscal multipliers. She told us that ""income tax rebates are not very stimulative"" but that ""other types of tax cuts appear to have much bigger effects."" Ramey specifically cited the positive effects of investment tax credits, which she said are not captured by the ""simple textbook Keynesian model.""

""Thus, based on the research, I would argue that the most stimulative types of policies are tax cuts that directly affect the incentives to invest and hire workers,"" she wrote us in an e-mail.

We also looked at a paper that Christina Romer co-authored in June 2010 with her husband, David Romer. Using narrative evidence to control for other factors that influenced output during the post World War II period, the two economists found that a tax cut of $1 raises the GDP by roughly $3 over the following three years. Romer did not attempt to quantify spending effects in the paper, but Mankiw wrote in his National Affairs essay that her results suggest that the maximum potential impact of cutting taxes may actually be up to three times bigger than Obama's advisors assumed it was during their policy simulations.

Then there is Ramey's own research. Using news sources to identify expected changes in government spending that are due to military events from 1939 to 2008, Ramey found that the government spending multiplier is anywhere from $0.60 to $1.20, ""depending on the time period and how the multipliers are calculated."" We asked Ramey to help us understand how her findings compare with Romers' 2010 results. She told us that the spending increases she looked at lasted on average for 4 years. In contrast, ""it is unclear what the average duration of Romers'  tax changes are,"" she said. Still, based on her review of Romers' data, she told us that ""I don't think that one can argue that my spending multipliers are bigger than the Romers' tax multipliers.""

Finally, economic researchers Andrew Mountford from the University of London and Harald Uhlig from the University of Chicago wrote in a July 2005 paper that ""the best fiscal policy to stimulate the economy is a deficit-financed tax cut.""

There are more papers than we have time or space for here, but we think you get the picture. Economists have been arguing for decades about various approaches to economic stimulus and there is plenty of research and literature for both sides.

Going back to the original claim: Maddow said that ""we know that tax cuts are remarkably un-stimulative when you compare them with different kinds of government spending."" During the course of our research, we found several papers and studies that support her argument. But we also found evidence to the contrary. When it comes to macroeconomics, just about everything is still a matter for debate. We rate her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC757DC0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/12/rachel-maddow/maddow-claims-spending-more-stimulative-tax-cuts/

Rachel Maddow says illegal immigration is declining
","After criticizing conservative blogs and Republican lawmakers for perpetuating false facts, Rachel Maddow made an interesting claim on her show on Monday, August 2, 2010.

Maddow said that Republicans consistently distort immigration issues to stir up their base during an election cycle.

""Illegal immigration always has to be refashioned into a crisis for every electoral cycle that Republicans want to use it,"" said Maddow. ""The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse."" Maddow then showed a graph of apprehension rates of illegal immigrants from 1978 to 2008 that showed that the rate in 2008 was the lowest in years. We were curious to see if Maddow was right in saying that illegal immigration is not getting worse.

The graph that Maddow displayed on the show was from a fact sheet published by the Department of Homeland Security. The graph displays border apprehensions by year. There is no way to know exactly how many people illegally cross the U.S. border every year, but ""apprehensions seem to be an indicator of inflows of undocumented Mexicans"" crossing the border illegally, according to Jeff Passel, a senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center.

According to the DHS fact sheet, ""the number of apprehensions made by the Border Patrol declined for the third year in a row to 724,000 in 2008 after reaching a mid-decade peak of 1,189,000 in 2005.""

However, some immigration experts do not consider apprehension rates to be particularly useful. Although the apprehension rate is usually a good indicator of trends, it is not exact, according to Bryan Griffith, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in favor of increased border enforcement. ""Just because the apprehension rate is down, doesn't mean less people are trying to come. It could mean they're getting better"" at not getting caught. Maddow decided to use apprehension statistics to make her point about illegal immigration. However, illegal immigration is about more than illegal border crossings. ""Focusing on the number of people crossing the border alone is just inaccurate,"" said Jim Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Apprehension rates are useful, ""but don't tell you the whole story."" For instance, it is estimated that as many as 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. entered legally, but overstayed their visas.

The whole story is better reflected in the total estimated population of illegal immigrants in the United States. Using monthly Census data, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that ""the illegal population declined 13.7 percent (1.7 million) from a peak of 12.5 million in the summer of 2007 to 10.8 million in the first quarter of 2009."" This is similar to DHS estimates, which also saw a downward trend from a peak of 11.8 million in 2007 to 10.8 million in 2009.

Even though Maddow didn't use those statistics, they back up her claim. Illegal immigration is not increasing, and by at least two measurements, illegal immigration has actually gotten somewhat better. But don't herald the defeat of illegal immigration just yet.

It's important to note that the decline in the number of undocumented workers sneaking across the border may have less to do with a more secure border and more to do with a less secure economy in the U.S. The DHS report speculates that the decrease in inflow may be due to ""declining U.S. economic growth and enhanced border enforcement efforts.""

Passel thinks it has more to do with the former than the latter. ""It's not that we're discouraging people,"" said Passel, ""It's because they know they can't get jobs because of the economic downturn."" Passel said that his data shows that ""from 1992 through about 2004 the U.S. employment rate and the volume of the numbers of Mexicans coming to the U.S. are almost perfectly correlated."" This seems to indicate that illegal immigration inflows are primarily related to economic considerations.

""It's both economic and enforcement,"" said Griffith.""The more difficult you make the trip, the less people are going to attempt to make that trip.""

However, if the unemployment rate drops and more jobs are available, it's likely that more people will risk crossing the border, because the benefits are worth the risk, according Carafano. The test is whether the illegal immigrant population will continue to decline after the economy picks up.

By two key measurements, the numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the border are not increasing. At least for the time being, the numbers in both counts are going down. But when the economy picks up again, it is possible that illegal immigration will once again increase.  Nevertheless, looking at the numbers, we rate Maddow's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8A4880>],/factchecks/2010/aug/12/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-illegal-immigration-declining/

Kasich silence casts doubt on whether he would seek income tax repeal
","
John Kasich stormed the stage in a park in his hometown of Westerville, Ohio, last year to emphatically declare his candidacy to become the Republican nominee for governor. He offered big-picture ideas, the staples of conservative politics — shrinking government spending and lowering taxes.

One specific tax goal he reaffirmed that June 1 was to eliminate Ohio’s state income tax.

It’s a goal Kasich had mentioned in earlier speeches in the run-up to that formal announcement. And he left no doubt where he stood that day.

""We’ll march over time to destroy that income tax that has sucked the vitality out of this state,"" Kasich roared.

But as time has marched on, a funny thing happened. Kasich has stopped calling for an elimination of Ohio’s income tax. 

It is absent from his campaign website, where he argues spending cuts are needed so taxes can be lowered. And at a speaking event Aug. 4, Kasich talked nearly an hour without mentioning the income tax repeal once.

We decided to run his remarks through the Flip-O-Meter to see if he’s done a full gainer on the issue.

When he launched his campaign, Kasich’s call to eliminate the state income tax  was emphatic. But he has never detailed how he would  eliminate a major tax that provides much of the state’s operating money. 

He repeatedly has dodged reporter’s questions for details about his plan. Full of disdain, he often would brush aside questions, sometimes snapping that he would discuss specifics when he was good and ready. Each week Kasich delivers campaign speeches across Ohio and it’s common now for him to not mention his cornerstone policy issue. 

Perhaps growing weary of the questions, Kasich lately has softened his retorts and taken pains to be less bombastic and more assuring that he has not abandoned his idea.

""Nothing’s changed on that. I’m for reducing taxes,"" Kasich said to reporters Aug. 4 after his speech in Columbus.  ""Nothing has changed. But this idea of reducing these taxes, as I told you from the beginning, takes time.

""There’s no obfuscation there at all. . . Nothing’s changed about any of my programs or my plans.""

Kasich was essentially forced to distance himself from his own idea when Republican state Rep. John Adams, of Sidney, near Dayton, last winter introduced a bill that would phase out the state’s income tax. Democrats, who control the House, happily linked Adams’ bill to Kasich’s idea and gave the bill a series of hotly promoted committee hearings.

In January, the Legislative Service Commission, an independent state agency, released an analysis of Adams’ bill and predicted the plan would cost Ohio more than $800 million next year and as much as $12 billion by 2020. In all, eliminating the state’s income tax could blow a 40 percent hole in the general revenue fund, which could in turn impact police, fire and local government appropriations.

Those details make Kasich’s plan all the more intriguing. He insists it can be done, even as he refuses to offer up details or talk about it on the campaign trail. Sure Kasich says he’s standing by his plan to eliminate the state’s income tax but his silence on the campaign trail about an issue he once was so boastful about speaks volumes.

His unwillingness to answer questions or provide details about how he would eliminate the tax makes it appear as if he wishes he never promised its demise so prominently. 

He hasn’t publicly gone that far, yet, so we rate his position a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB42A40>],/factchecks/2010/aug/12/john-kasich/kasich-silence-casts-doubt-whether-he-would-seek-i/

Johnson bailed on cops, teachers, firefighters, vets and troops with 'no' vote, opponent says
","
How could he?

That's the question Liz Carter asked last week about U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat. Carter, a Republican running to unseat Johnson, sent out a news release criticizing his vote against a resolution on July 27 that approved billions of dollars for the military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and other initiatives.

""Who in their right mind would vote no on this critical piece of legislation?"" Carter said. ""Congressman Johnson's refusal to support this bi-partisan legislation only serves to show how out of touch he is with the 4th district. His No vote shows he does not support [police officers, firefighters,] teachers, vets and troops.""

Carter said the legislation provided $24 billion ""to help keep teachers, police and firefighters employed during the recession."" She also complained about Johnson's vote on her Facebook page. The 4th Congressional District consists largely of DeKalb County, with portions of Gwinnett and Rockdale counties. Democrats typically dominate congressional elections in that district.

Johnson spokesman Andy Phelan told AJC PolitiFact during a telephone interview that Carter didn't have her facts right about the resolution or the congressman's position.

We decided to check this one out.

The legislation was called House Resolution 4899. The original legislation, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in March, provided $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and $600 million for a summer jobs program, according to Congressional Quarterly, a news organization that closely tracks legislation in Washington. In May, the U.S. Senate passed an expanded version of the bill that included $37.1 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and $13.4 billion for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, CQ reported.

On July 1, the House added an amendment to include $10 billion to assist in the hiring and retention of teachers, $5 billion for Pell grants for college students and $701 million for border security, CQ reported.

Republicans opposed the additional domestic spending, and there was not enough Senate support to pass the House-amended version, according to CQ. On July 22, the Senate rejected those House measures and returned the resolution to the House. The House voted July 27 on the version of the bill without the funds for teachers, Pell grants and border security, CQ reported.

Johnson voted against the resolution because the Senate version of the bill did not have funding for teachers and other domestic priorities he felt were important, Phelan said in an e-mail.

Carter e-mailed PolitiFact Georgia a statement saying she ""fell prey to relying on a final summary of the H.R. 4899 legislation after having read a prior version of the legislation."" She posted a similar message on her blog titled ""Oops, I made a mistake, but he still doesn't get it."" Carter still said Johnson must answer why he voted against legislation that would help veterans and troops overseas.

We're sure Carter and Johnson will debate that as the Nov. 2 election nears. As for her statement, the version of the resolution that Johnson voted against did not include funding for domestic first responders or teachers. It did include money for military veterans and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We rate Carter's attack against Johnson as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8DC980>],/factchecks/2010/aug/12/liz-carter/johnson-bailed-cops-teachers-firefighters-vets-and/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
Bill White says state budget up over 80 percent under Rick Perry
","
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White stopped in Midland on Monday, saying he'll be fiscally wiser as governor than the Republican incumbent.

""I know how to squeeze value out of taxpayers' dollars,"" White told Midland's KWES-TV, Channel 9. ""The state budget has gone up over 80 percent under Rick Perry. That's just too much. We're not getting the value out of those dollars that we need to get out.""

Over 80 percent?

That percentage sounded familiar. In a February Truth-O-Meter article, we reported that budgeted non-dedicated state spending increased 80 percent from the 2000-01 budget, adopted the year before Perry became governor, to the current budget. We found shaky Perry's statement that on his watch, ""we cut state spending.""

After asking White's campaign for backup on his ""over 80 percent"" statement, we revisited the budget numbers -- and realized an error of our own.

We were correct in February that budgeted non-dedicated spending has increased about $25 billion during Perry's decade-plus as governor. Indeed, such spending increased from $55.7 billion in 2000-01 to nearly $80.6 billion in 2010-11, according to the ""Fiscal Size-up"" for 2010-11 published by the Legislative Budget Board. However, we miscalculated the percentage increase, which was 45 percent -- not the 80 percent we reported.

And how did White reach his proclaimed increase of over 80 percent? The entire budget, counting all funding sources including federal and local aid, increased from nearly $101.8 billion in 2000-01 to almost $182.2 billion in 2010-11-- a boost of 79 percent. (Please free free to check our math; we thank you.)

We ran the 79 percent bump by Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. He suggested any comparison of the 2000-01 budget and the 2010-11 budget take into account two factors in the latest budget that weren't at play in 2000-01.

First, Perry and state lawmakers agreed several years ago to cover reductions in school property taxes with state revenue; that's costing $14 billion in the 2010-11 budget. Craymer said that commitment doesn't translate to an increase in government spending; it's a shift in which level of government is doing the spending. Second, the latest budget includes about $12 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid. Take the combined $26 billion out of the comparison and the state budget increase since 2000-01 falls to 53 percent.

The budget board offers another way of weighing changes in spending by adjusting raw budget numbers for changes in population and inflation. At our request, the board created a chart enabling us to compare the adjusted numbers for the 2000-01 budget against the 2010-11 version. Counting all funding sources, during Perry's gubernatorial years the state budget adjusted for changes in population and inflation has increased 18 percent.

So, where does this leave White's statement?

White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in a Tuesday e-mail that White should have said ""about 80 percent"" in the Midland interview instead of ""over 80 percent.""

Bacon's e-mail also notes expectations the 2011 Legislature will confront an $18 billion revenue shortfall, which Bacon calls a deficit. Given that, her e-mail says, ""Bill will have to make cuts. He is very good at this and has often discussed his approach to making cuts and finding efficiencies. He has said he needs to 'get under the hood' and also work with legislators on specific cuts.""

Upshot: Budgeted spending increased nearly 79 percent on Perry's watch, not the ""over 80 percent"" White said. Also, there are ways to analyze the increase that reduce the growth percentage. Still, it's defensible to lean on raw budget amounts. 
We rate White's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAB5940>],/factchecks/2010/aug/12/bill-white/bill-white-says-state-budget-80-percent-under-rick/

Jeff Kottkamp took on the federal government in court, and won, he says
","
Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican running for attorney general, is trying to push back against criticisms that he's a politician first and lawyer second by highlighting his success in the courtroom.

At a July 31, 2010, debate with GOP rivals Holly Benson and Pam Bondi, Kottkamp said that he'd put his legal experience up against anyone running.

Then he offered his proof. ""I've taken on the federal government,"" Kottkamp said. ""And won.""

We wanted to see if Kottkamp is accurately describing his legal career.

According to the Florida Constitution, the state attorney general must have been a member of the bar of Florida for the preceding five years. That's a standard Kottkamp must, and does, meet.

Kottkamp attended the University of Florida College of Law and received his Juris Doctor degree in 1987. He clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Joe Eaton and U.S. District Court Judge Sidney Aronovitz. From 1991-2005, he was a shareholder in the Fort Myers firm of Henderson, Franklin, Starnes & Holt, and before becoming lieutenant governor, he spent a brief time as a partner at Morgan & Morgan. Kottkamp remains a member in good standing with the Florida Bar.

Kottkamp's campaign pointed us to case from the 1990s to back up his claim.

What follows is an account cobbled together from court documents of the case, Robert B. Reich vs. John C. Davis, P.A. 
In that case Kottkamp represented John C. Davis, a Fort Myers Beach accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for firing two employees. Darlene Smiley and Cynthia Fellows claimed that they were terminated for speaking up about not getting paid overtime.

Davis paid overtime during tax season -- roughly January to April -- but offered only compensation time the rest of the year, Smiley and Fellows said. When Smiley asked Davis to pay her the money she was entitled in the fall of 1986, Davis refused.

So Smiley complained to the Department of Labor.

Investigators interviewed both Smiley and Fellows and determined Davis needed to pay. He did, and then promptly fired both Smiley and Fellows.

In court, the Labor Department claimed that Davis violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and argued that the two women should be offered their jobs back.

Davis, through his attorney Kottkamp, said that while the overtime controversy was one of the reasons Smiley and Fellows were fired, they would have been fired anyway, because of poor work habits and poor work product.

In a 1993 ruling, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida sided with Davis, saying that Smiley and Fellows were not fired because they complained about the overtime. The district court's ruling actually was vacated on appeal in 1995 because the appellate court determined that the complaints were a reason the women were fired. But the appellate court said that as long the complaints were not the only reason, Davis acted lawfully.

The case returned to district court and quickly was dismissed, giving Kottkamp the victory he claims over the feds.

Kottkamp said during a televised debate that he has taken on the federal government as a lawyer and won.

In the 1990s, Kottkamp represented an accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act. Kottkamp successfully argued that the man fired two employees legally.

For that, we rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA01380>],/factchecks/2010/aug/11/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-took-federal-government-court-and-won-he-/

John McCain said he would add 3,000 troops to the border while Obama would add only 524
","
Sen. John McCain of Arizona is up for re-election and facing a challenge in the Republican primary from J.D. Hayworth. His latest television ad ignores his primary opponent, instead going after President Barack Obama and emphasizing that McCain is committed to border security.

""The border security plan of Sens. McCain and Kyl called for 3,000 additional troops to keep us safe. President Obama says he'll send 524,"" the narrator says. ""This is no political game, Mr. President. It's about Arizona lives. It's a fight we must win. And with John McCain on our side, we will.""

We wanted to check whether it was true that McCain called for 3,000 troops while Obama said he would send 524.

First, we checked out the plan outlined by McCain Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz.. The 10-point proposal was released in April and includes the following point:

""Immediately deploy 3,000 National Guard Troops along the Arizona/Mexico border, along with appropriate surveillance platforms, which shall remain in place until the Governor of Arizona certifies, after consulting with state, local and tribal law enforcement, that the Federal Government has achieved operational control of the border. Permanently add 3,000 Custom and Border Protection Agents to the Arizona/Mexico border by 2015.""

McCain and Kyl introduced a bill to carry out the plan in May, but there has been no significant action on the proposed legislation.

But McCain did add an amendment to a pending appropriations bill that authorizes defense spending; the amendment would send 6,000 troops to the border area, double the number McCain mentioned in his ad. The bill has not yet come up for a vote in the full Senate.

Now, for Obama's plan. Obama announced in May that he was sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the southwest border to help with border security. The troops were sent to different states: 524 to Arizona, 250 to Texas, 224 to California, and 72 to New Mexico. Other troops were to serve in command and control or support positions in various states, according to the U.S. Army.

But Obama has also asked Congress to pass emergency legislation to add 1,000 new border patrol agents. That legislation is pending, and the number has been increased to 1,500 agents. It does not specify how many agents would be assigned to which states. McCain said he supports the bill and that it should be passed as quickly as possible.

So McCain supports 3,000 to 6,000 additional troops. On Obama's side, you could count the 1,200 National Guard troops he sent in May, plus 1,500 agents to be funded by legislation Obama is expected to sign upon passage. That totals 2,700, or 2,200, if you only count Obama's original request to Congress.

In his ad, McCain gives a fair description of his own proposal calling for 3,000 more troops. But he downplays the number of personnel Obama has called for. The number 524 represents only National Guard troops being sent to Arizona as part an initiative announced in May. It does not include the 1,000 to 1,500 additional border patrol agents in proposed legislation that Obama supports, some of whom would be assigned to Arizona. Still, McCain does appear to want more new agents and troops sent to the border than Obama does. So we rate McCain's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6A6D40>],/factchecks/2010/aug/11/john-mccain/john-mccain-said-he-would-add-3000-troops-border-w/

Hayworth claims McCain opposed the border fence
","
As the U.S. Senate race in Arizona heats up, the TV ads are getting more and more brutal. In its latest ad, J.D. Hayworth's campaign attacks Sen. John McCain for alleged opposition to constructing a fence on the U.S.-Mexico border.

The ad begins with a narrator announcing that ""McCain lies...again."" Then, over the course of several slides, it says that ""McCain wrote the Amnesty Bill ... opposed the border fence,"" and supported ""Social Security and Medicare benefits for illegals.""

In this item, we'll be checking the claim that McCain opposed the border fence.

The ad cites McCain's vote on an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007. Introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, it would have provided an additional $1.8 billion to ""construct double-layered fencing and vehicle barriers along the southwest border."" It also called for offsetting increased funding for the fence ""by reducing all other discretionary amounts on a prorata basis.""

We checked Senate voting records and found that McCain voted against the amendment. He was joined by several other Republican lawmakers, and the amendment was rejected.

Still, it is a gross exaggeration to make the leap that voting ""nay"" on a single amendment translates into opposing the construction of a fence on the border. McCain voted for the final version of the bill signed into law by President George W. Bush on Oct. 4, 2006. ""The bill I sign helps us address one of the central issues facing all states, but particularly a state like Arizona, and that's illegal immigration. I understand full well that illegal immigration puts pressure on the public schools and hospitals. It strains state and local budgets. In some communities, it increases crime. The administration and Congress have been taking decisive steps to address this issue,"" Bush said before signing the bill.

According to the president's remarks, the legislation appropriated $1.2 billion for strengthening the border. More specifically, it provided funding for more border fencing, vehicle barriers, and ""cutting-edge technology"" such as ground-based radar, infrared cameras and advanced sensors.

Even more telling, however, is what happened three weeks later. On Oct. 26, 2006, President Bush signed The Secure Fence Act of of 2006. This separate legislation, which had solid Republican support, authorized the construction of a 700-mile, double-layered fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. McCain not only voted for the bill, but the New York Times referred to him as one of the ""Republican architects"" of the legislation. That's hard to square with the anti-border enforcement candidate that Hayworth's ad describes. (We first learned about the New York Times article, along with a few other sources which we double-checked, from our friends over at FactCheck.org)

Why did so many Republicans, including McCain, vote against an amendment to increase funding for the fence construction? According to Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who also voted ""nay"" on the amendment, the extra funding would have been offset with cuts elsewhere in the bill, which would have meant not being able to hire 750 new border-patrol agents.

Hayworth's ad claims that McCain opposed the border fence. As ""proof,"" Hayworth cited McCain's vote on an amendment that would have provided increased funding for the construction of a double-layered fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. What the ad conveniently left out, however, is that McCain voted for the final bill, which provided $1.2 billion for strengthening the border. It also ignored McCain's key role in securing the passage of The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized construction of a 700-mile fence on the border. Finally, it neglected to mention that the defeated amendment would have been paid for with cuts from other parts of the 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. Republican leaders -- who voted with McCain -- say that adopting the amendment would have resulted in cutbacks in hiring new border patrol agents. The ad is technically right that McCain voted against additional funding at one point. Still, we found that the claim is a gross exaggeration, so we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6A6A80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/11/jd-hayworth/hayworth-claims-mccain-opposed-border-fence/

AG candidate Pam Bondi says she's shut down pill mills
","
In the race for the Republican nomination for attorney general, former Hillsborough County prosecutor Pam Bondi continues to contrast her courtroom experience with the political experience of opponents Jeff Kottkamp and Holly Benson.

One of the distinctions Bondi makes is that while Kottkamp, the lieutenant governor, and Benson, the former secretary for the Agency for Health Care Administration, can talk about taking on criminals, she's actually done it.

Take pill mills for examples. Doctors illegally writing prescriptions for painkillers is a big issue in Florida and has been a focus of current Attorney General Bill McCollum. The issue also has been a centerpiece of Kottkamp's campaign.

Though Kottkamp oversees the Governor's Office of Drug Control, Bondi notes that she has been on the front lines as a prosecutor.

""You've heard General McCollum talk about pill mills,"" Bondi said to a group of Republicans on April 28, 2010, in Clay County. ""(I) prosecuted them. Dealt with them. Shut them down.""

She's made the claim, or a claim close to it, several times during the campaign. We heard something similar when Bondi came to speak June 3 to the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club in St. Petersburg. We wanted to see if Bondi, in her nearly two decades as a prosecutor, has shut down pill mills.

Bondi worked as an assistant state attorney for Hillsborough County from 1992 to 2009 where she says she prosecuted thousands of cases, including murder, rape and drug cases.

Her campaign office said she participated in the prosecution of multiple drug trafficking cases involving prescription medications. ""At the time, they weren't called 'pill mills,' but she investigated and charged pain clinic doctors for trafficking and controlled substances,"" said Bondi spokeswoman Kim Kirtley. Kirtley said Bondi had trouble remembering the names of the specific cases.

But the spokeswoman did point PolitiFact Florida to a 2008 case to make Bondi's point that she has shut down pill mills.

The case involves Dr. John Mubang, who was arrested in Hillsborough County on July 16, 2008, and charged with trafficking in prescription drugs while he worked as an internal medicine doctor at a Tampa medical facility he owned and operated. 
According to law enforcement officials, Mubang prescribed controlled substances to patients without a valid medical reason. Medical records show that Mubang prescribed drugs to at least five people who subsequently died from accidental overdoses.

The investigation and arrest was coordinated among the state attorney's office, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. We found no reason to doubt Bondi's involvement in the case. Her name, for instance, is included on the FDLE press release announcing the arrest. We should note, however, that Bondi did not represent the state attorney's office at pre-trial hearings. 
Mubang is currently free on bond awaiting trial. 
And, here's the rub, he's back to prescribing drugs. 
Bondi's response: 'Unreal"" 
Bondi called PolitiFact Florida in the middle of filming a television commercial when she heard Mubang was back publicly soliciting clients. 
""He was shut down. He reopened in a different way,"" Bondi said. ""This helps illustrate the tremendous problems we have with pill mills. The guy is on an ankle bracelet! Can you believe that? It's unreal the problem we have in our state with pill mills."" 
In a front-page story published in June 2010, the St. Petersburg Times updated Mubang's story. 
""As Mubang awaits ... trial on felony charges of trafficking in illegal drugs and prescribing controlled substances without medical necessity, he is free to keep seeing patients and dispensing drugs,"" the Times reported. ""His state Health Department license record consumers can see online shows not one single blemish -- no complaints, no discipline."" 
The article noted that Mubang was advertising his services in news publications, including the Times' free daily tabloid, tbt*, and has been touting his willingness to see patients without an appointment. 
""The audacity of a doctor who's currently being prosecuted to go back and do it again is outrageous,"" Bondi said. 
The Mubang story illustrates just how hard it can be to permanently shut down pain clinics. Bruce Grant, director of the Governor's Office of Drug Control, describes pill mill doctors as nothing more than drug dealers in white lab coats. 
The clinics themselves are often run by someone else, who simply finds a down-on-their-luck doctor to write out the prescriptions. Catch one bad doctor, and another can step in. It's difficult, Grant says, to pin a case on the people with the money behind the clinics. 
And clients are unlikely to testify against a doctor prescribing drugs. In fact, most say the doctor is under-prescribing, Grant says. That means investigations center almost always on undercover work. 
""These are not easy things to stop,"" Grant said. ""Our laws are set up to allow things to happen, not to stop them."" 
Grant's office and law enforcement officials have started to work closely with the Department of Health to temporarily suspend the licenses of doctors who are believed to be prescribing drugs illegally. 
Eulinda Smith, a spokeswoman with the Department of Health, provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of the current doctors and health care providers whose licenses have been suspended by emergency action. Mubang is not included. 
Our ruling 
Bondi said that as a Hillsborough prosecutor she's shut down pill mills and offered the case of Dr. John Mubang as an example. But Mubang's story highlights how difficult it is to stop pill mills, and in fact, is an excellent example of the problem the next attorney general will face. 
Mubang was shut down briefly following his arrest, but he's back in business pending trial. 
To be sure, PolitiFact Florida searched Hillsborough County court records to find other specific cases Bondi may have been involved with. So did Bondi, who maintains that she has prosecuted other cases involving doctors who prescribed medicine illegally. But she couldn't find another specific case for us to analyze. We couldn't either. That leaves us to judge her claim based on the evidence she's provided. 
As such, we rate Bondi's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8F2140>],/factchecks/2010/aug/11/pam-bondi/ag-candidate-pam-bondi-says-shes-shut-down-pill-mi/

Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce twice cut his own pay
","
Elected officials’ pay can be a sensitive topic with taxpayers, especially in today’s economic climate. So it’s no surprise Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce, who is running in November to keep his job, is bragging about cutting his salary.

Boyce talked about his six-figure earnings in a YouTube video released by his office. Presented as a preview of the office’s forthcoming annual financial report, the production feels more like a tribute to Boyce’s performance as treasurer aimed directly at voters.

""I’ve even cut my salary -- twice,"" said Boyce, a Democrat and former Columbus city councilman.

Boyce was appointed Treasurer in late 2008. Richard Cordray left a vacancy when he took the state attorney general’s job in the wake of Marc Dann’s resignation.

Annual salaries for the state’s elected officials are set in state law, which lawmakers can amend to increase or decrease pay. The treasurer’s salary has been set at $109,986 since 2008.

In June 2009, Boyce sent a memo to the state Department of Administrative Services saying he was taking a pay cut that would reduce his gross salary that year to $107,874. The pay cut, effective July 1, 2009, was the equivalent of taking five unpaid furlough days, a cost-saving measure that has been forced upon many state employees.

In the same memo, Boyce authorized an extension of the reduction for all of 2010. This year’s pay cut is the equivalent of 10 unpaid furlough days, according to the administrative services department.

Boyce’s gross salary this year will be $105,757.

Boyce lumped both cuts -- each about 2 percent -- in the same memo, but he effectively trimmed his salary twice. Had he not extended the cut into 2010, his pay would’ve jumped back up to $109,986, a spokeswoman for the administrative services department said.

We find Boyce’s statement True.

Congressman jumps in fur flap; says cat and dog fur sometimes used on coats
","
Hank Johnson has a reputation for making eyebrow-raising statements, first as a DeKalb County commissioner and now as a U.S. congressman.

Remember the one a few months ago where Johnson said he was worried about the island of Guam becoming so overpopulated that it would tip over and capsize?

It was a metaphor, he said, as the mockery mounted.

""I wasn't really suggesting that the island of Guam would literally tip over,"" Johnson wrote in a statement in April.

Tongues started wagging again in recent weeks after Johnson fired off another head-scratcher. Johnson, a Democrat, had offered his support for legislation to end a federal loophole that does not require manufacturers to label fur and fake fur garments that cost less than $150.

""Exporters use this loophole to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur as though they were made from faux fur or the fur of other animals,"" Johnson wrote in comments submitted for the Congressional Record.

The congressman added that it is illegal to import, export, sell or advertise domestic dog fur in this country. Johnson is running for re-election against Republican Liz Carter in Georgia's 4th Congressional District, which includes most of DeKalb and portions of Gwinnett and Rockdale counties.

So is the use of cats and dogs for fur really a problem, or is Johnson barking up the wrong tree?

It is indeed a problem, one high-ranking animal rights leader told AJC PolitiFact Georgia.

Michael Markarian, chief operating officer of the Humane Society of the United States, said some dog and cat fur still comes undetected into the U.S., particularly from China. About one in eight fur garments falls below the labeling standard, said U.S. Rep Jim Moran (D-Va.). The Humane Society recently tested 38 fur-trimmed jackets. Three had fur from domestic dogs, Markarian said. Some were from raccoon dogs, a canine species specific to Asia, the Humane Society official said. Those canines, Markarian said, are often skinned alive.

""We really feel that this is still a problem and consumers need to have more confidence in what they're buying,"" Markarian said.

Markarian said legislation is needed because more fur-rimmed jackets are being sold here and advertised as faux fur. It's not, he said.

The Humane Society reached out-of-court settlements in March with Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue to stop advertising garments as faux fur that are trimmed with coyote or dog pelts. The settlements came after a District of Columbia judge in February fined Neiman Marcus $25,000 for advertising items as faux that were actually trimmed with raccoon dog, the St. Petersburg Times reported.

Investigators for an animal rights group, meanwhile, recorded footage of what is said to be a raccoon dog being skinned alive in China as part of the fur trade.

Chinese officials have vowed to stop the trade of cat and dog fur, calling it ""illegal and barbaric,"" according to news reports. The Chinese State Forestry Administration pledged in 2005 to strengthen animal welfare regulations on animals farmed for fur.

Congress passed legislation in 2000 that prohibits importing or exporting dog and cat fur. But animal rights activists say some manufacturers are still finding ways around the law.

Moran, the congressman from Virginia, is the lead sponsor of legislation that would remove the loophole, which was created in 1951.

The resolution unanimously passed the House of Representatives on July 28. Johnson was one of 170 sponsors. It has not gone before the U.S. Senate.

Johnson's comments caught us off-guard, but the issue of cats and dogs being used as fur and their inhumane treatment is a problem. We rate his statement on the issue as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC690DC0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/11/hank-johnson/congressman-jumps-fur-flap/
"['Message Machine 2010', 'Voting Record', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Adding up Bill McCollum's 42 votes to raise taxes and fees
","
Without a record of votes to haunt him, Republican gubernatorial frontrunner Rick Scott has been free to attack primary opponent Bill McCollum for his 20 years in Congress.

Scott's latest charge is a whopper -- that  McCollum voted 42 times to raise taxes and fees.

The accusation came up during the candidates' second and final debate on Aug. 5, 2010, and plays off a new Scott television ad called ""Omelette.""

The ad starts with an egg breaking on the ground with a narrator saying that ""Once, could be a mistake."" Then a few more eggs fall to the ground. ""Two or three times? Bad luck,"" the narrator says.

Then the eggs really start pouring. ""But 42 times?

""Bill McCollum voted for higher taxes and fees 42 times while he was in Congress,"" the narrator says in the 30-second ad, which is airing statewide. ""Yet now McCollum claims he won't increase taxes as governor. If you believe McCollum won't raise your taxes, the yolk's on you.""

The ad is no doubt effective, particularly in a Republican primary. But is it an accurate depiction of McCollum's two decades spent representing an Orlando-area community in Washington?

PolitiFact Florida wanted to find out.

Scott's evidence

Scott's campaign referred PolitiFact Florida to a campaign-created website, www.factsforflorida.com, to review McCollum's Congressional record. The supporting evidence is difficult to digest, mainly because it's a simply a string of bill numbers, roll call votes and Internet links. 
Think we're lying? Here's one paragraph:
  
The Scott campaign provided us a better summary of the votes to help us sort through the madness. The campaign says McCollum voted at least 27 times between 1981 and 2001 for legislation that included higher taxes, and at least 15 times for legislation that included higher fees.

We then took the bill numbers and checked Thomas, a website through the Library of Congress. That site provides summaries of the legislation and also records how members voted. We also relied on descriptions of the legislation provided by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. 
Scott is right that McCollum voted for legislation that increased taxes.

Most notably, McCollum voted for the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which undid some tax cuts passed a year earlier. The bill increased excise taxes, airport and airway trust fund taxes, cigarette excise taxes, and a telephone excise tax. The bill also increased employment taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. The bill passed the House 226-207, with Republicans supporting the tax increases 103-89 and Democrats voting 123-118 in favor.

Florida's four Republicans in the U.S. House (McCollum, C.W. Bill Young, Louis Bafalis and Clay Shaw) all supported the tax increases. McCollum, in the debate, called it a vote he regrets. ""The only time that I voted for a  tax increase when I was in Congress was Ronald Reagan's economic plan,"" McCollum said. ""And I voted for that, and that's the one vote I regret that I ever took. I always said that after I did it.""

McCollum's support of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 is a notable example of a tax increase McCollum supported, but it also highlights a problem with Scott's accounting methods. The vote on the one bill constitutes three of the 42 votes Scott is referencing in his ad because the bill included increases in employment (1), aviation (2) and tobacco (3) taxes.

Double and triple counting is common in Scott's list of votes.

According to the Scott campaign, four of McCollum's 42 votes to increase taxes and fees come in 1997 with the passage of a bill that's called -- ironically -- the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. In two separate roll call votes, McCollum voted in favor of raising the cigarette tax. And in two other votes, McCollum voted to support an aviation tax.

Scott accurately accounts for those tax increases, though double-counting them is somewhat disingenuous.

But more alarming is what he fails to mention:

Namely that the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 actually cut taxes by $240 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The legislation introduced a $500 per child per year tax credit, created an education tax credit, reduced the rates for the capital gains and estate taxes, and repealed the alternative minimum tax for small businesses.

The bill passed the U.S. House, 389-43, with only one Republican voting ""No.""

PolitiFact Florida noted at least four other instances where a vote was counted more than once to reach Scott's 42-vote claim. Scott also counts tax extensions as tax increases -- the 1997 tax cut package included an extension of air transportation excise taxes. And a 1991 vote that Scott said was for a tax increase actually extended ""taxes on heavy trucks and trailers sold at retail.""  
That's not the same thing as voting 42 times for higher taxes and fees, which is what Scott says in his ad.

What Scott leaves out

Scott's ad also neglects McCollum's record of supporting tax cuts in Congress.

McCollum voted for Ronald Reagan's first tax cut package, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. The legislation reduced marginal tax rates 23 percent over three years, reduced the maximum rate to 50 percent and reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20 percent.

In 1986, he also supported tax reform legislation to simplify the U.S. tax code. The bill was designed to be revenue neutral but actually provided overall tax relief, according to the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office. (By the way, this is listed as a tax increase vote by Scott's campaign).

Bruce Bartlett, a columnist for Forbes.com and the one-time executive director of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, published a good macro look at tax policy during Reagan's presidency. Using Office of Management and Budget data, Bartlett found that between 1981 and 1988 Congress approved $275 billion in tax cuts and about $133 billion in tax increases.

The tax cuts are almost entirely contained in the 1981 and 1986 legislation McCollum supported. Even if McCollum supported every tax increase, he was still a net tax-cutter.

McCollum also supported the major tax cut package in the 1990s, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.

Our ruling

We should note that we didn't track back every single vote Scott cites. We asked the McCollum campaign if there were any votes they thought were misrepresented or that Scott had gotten wrong and did not hear back.

PolitiFact Florida's review suggests Scott has been able to locate 42 taxes or fees that were either raised, or had their shelf-life extended, because of votes McCollum took while in Congress.

But that only tells part of the story.

Several of the votes are double counted, meaning that while 42 taxes may have been extended or raised, McCollum didn't vote 42 times for increases.

Moreover, the Scott ad overlooks McCollum's votes to cut taxes, and specifically tries to label a $240 billion tax cut McCollum supported as a tax increase -- four different times. 
At best, Scott is cherry picking the votes to help make his case that ""Bill McCollum voted for higher taxes and fees 42 times."" But he's also brazenly trying to label a tax cut as a tax increase, and double and triple counting some votes. We rate the statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAE9B80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/10/rick-scott/adding-bill-mccollums-42-votes-raise-taxes-and-fee/
