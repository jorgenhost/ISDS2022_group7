Ohio Democratic Party says Rob Portman shares ""radical idological views"" toward women
","
We mean no blasphemy. But what do you call a male, Methodist,  Republican lawmaker who supports a measure -- backed by many Catholics -- to allow employers and schools to opt out health-care law mandates on moral or religious grounds?

Is he a supporter of religious rights? Or is he a politician with radical, ideological views toward women?

The issue here, as may be obvious, is whether employers should be able to omit contraception  coverage in their health insurance plans because they believe the use of certain birth control methods or medications is a sin, or they have other moral objections.

The issue arose after President Barack Obama’s administration ruled that contraception should be covered, with no co-payment, as an essential health and prevention benefit under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The requirement takes effect in August. Churches were exempted from the requirement but in February, after fierce debate with groups supporting reproductive or religious rights, the administration also exempted religion-affiliated schools and charities.  Women whose church-employers opt out can still get contraception coverage but must do so through the insurer, without paying another premium, rather than through the workplace.

Critics of the health law, including U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said the exemption was too narrow.  

Portman supported an amendment by Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, to let any employer opt out of coverage if they objected on religious or moral grounds. The amendment, attached to a highway bill, had broad Republican support.

Democrats said the amendment was just another attempt to weaken the Affordable Care Act and would open the act to all manner of other carve-outs.

On March 1, the Senate voted 51-48 to table the Blunt amendment.

With that vote, this episode seemed to be over. But now that Portman is said to be on Mitt Romney’s short list for vice presidential candidate, the Ohio Democratic Party is using it to question Portman’s intent or sincerity. According to a news release the Ohio Democrats issued on June 3 (with multiple claims, one of which we have addressed already), Portman’s vote on the Blunt  amendment showed that he ""shares Romney’s and Mandel’s radical, ideological view toward women.""

That would be Josh Mandel, the Republican Ohio treasurer running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown.

PolitiFact Ohio is not about to go over every statement made by Romney or Mandel to determine whether either holds radical, ideological views toward women. That’s a political, and arguably presumptuous, judgment.

But the Ohio Democrats make it easy to explore the basis of their claim when it comes to Portman because they listed two points of evidence.

First, they cited comments that Portman made March 5 to host Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s ""Hardball"" program. Specifically, the Democrats noted, Portman said, ""The issue was about religious freedom, as you know. And it`s a legitimate issue.""

Portman was discussing the Blunt amendment when he made the cited remark. PolitiFact Ohio listened to the rest of Portman’s comments about the amendment to see if they supported the claim that he holds ""radical, ideological views"" toward women.
Here’s the rest of what he said: ""I’m up here in Cleveland tonight and there are a lot of folks who are concerned about it. Twenty-five percent of the people up here get their health care through religious organizations and so that religious freedom issue is very important to them.""

Next, the Ohio Democratic Party noted Portman’s vote. ""Rob Portman was the lone Ohio senator to support the Blunt amendment,"" the Democrats said.

Well yes, he was. But each state only has two senators (Ohio currently has Brown and Portman). So if one voted no, the other would be the ""lone"" yes. It’s not as ominous when you have that bit of context, is it?

Who else voted for the Blunt amendment? Before answering, it’s important to know that while some critics considered the Blunt amendment to be an assault on women’s reproductive rights, this issue was important to a number of Catholics. According to the National Catholic Register, the U.S. Senate has 24 Catholic members, and 11 of them supported the Blunt amendment, as did the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Thirteen Catholics in the Senate voted to table the measure.

But here’s the number that matters most: 48. That’s the number of senators who supported the Blunt measure, and it was just shy of half the chamber. That number included three Democrats: Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Ben Nelson of Nebraska.

Could every one of those 48 senators hold ""radical, ideological views toward women?""

We do not doubt the sincerity of either side on this issue. But for the Ohio Democratic Party to accuse Portman of holding radical, ideological views on the basis of comments in an interview that were anything but inflammatory and a vote that clearly split the Senate  is itself an extreme characterization.

And to criticize him as the ""sole"" Ohio senator voting no, when this nation has exactly two U.S. senators representing every single state, is laughable. Civics lessons, anyone?

The flimsy evidence simply does not support the Ohio Democratic Party’s claim about ""radical, ideological views. The statement is not accurate.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/14/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-rob-portman-shares-radi/

Is Oregon one of three states to allow commercial gillnetting?
","
CORRECTION appended: This following has been revised to clarify that rules for keeping native fish, and the number of native fish that can be killed, vary according to run. The details given are for spring chinook. 
  
PolitiFact Oregon enjoys tasty Columbia River spring chinook as much as the next Oregonian, but honestly, we don’t know much about catching them. We suspect many readers don’t either, and yet, this November, we probably will vote on a ballot measure to ban the use of commercial gillnets in the Columbia. An alternative method would be allowed.

Gillnets vary in mesh size and length but generally work by capturing fish by the gills and smothering them. The people opposed to gillnets say it’s outdated, indiscriminate and harms native salmon and steelhead.

And they say Oregon is in the minority when it comes to gillnets. ""Currently, Oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters"" reads a May 30 press release by the Stop Gillnetting Now campaign.

Is Oregon truly that rare? And if so, why? Or were we being snookered by campaign politicking? An administrator with Oregon’s Salmon For All, a group that represents commercial gillnetters, said the number of states that allow commercial gillnetting is much higher, which means Oregon is not so out-of-sync. Who’s right?

We turned to Eric Stachon, spokesman with the stop gillnetting campaign. He acknowledged the number was incorrect but maintained that Oregon remains in the minority. ""Oregon,"" the revised statement reads, ""is one of only a few states left that allows the use of commercial gillnets on rivers and streams.""

We wanted to know where non-tribal commercial gillnetting is allowed. Neither side had a definitive figure. Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife didn’t have one either.

So PolitiFact Oregon started calling around the country. We had delightful chats with state officials. And we found at least 11 states besides Oregon that allow commercial gillnetting.

Like Oregon, the states of Washington, Alaska, North Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana allow commercial gillnets in inland waters, including rivers. California, Virginia and Maryland allow their use in bays. Alabama allows them in the Gulf of Mexico and Michigan in the Great Lakes.  

Certainly, gillnet use has become more restricted as concerns grow about inadvertently trapping other wildlife. California, as we noted, allows gillnetting in the San Francisco Bay, but campaign proponents point out that in 1990 voters approved a ban on the use of gillnets in coastal waters. And while North Carolina allows gillnets in river, ocean and sound waters, the state moved last month to restrict the use in certain areas.

""The quick answer is yes, we do allow them,"" said David Taylor of North Carolina’s Division of Marine Fisheries, ""and the more complicated answer is, with many restrictions.""

The states of Oregon and Washington issue about 500 permits a year for non-tribal fisheries to use on the Columbia River. Of that, maybe 300 are active. The state agencies decide when and where to allow fishing -- if at all -- for runs of spring chinook, fall chinook, coho, etc. They also determine the types of gillnets allowed. For spring chinook, native fish must be returned to the water, dead, lethargic or alive. Non-tribal fishers are allowed to kill roughly 2 percent native spring chinook among them. (The rules vary for each fish run.)

We’re not going to elaborate on the arguments of the two sides, other than to say that recreational fishers and conservationists insist they don’t want to kill off the commercial fishing industry and the gillnetters insist the recreational industry just wants a greater share of the Columbia River fish action.

Both sides agree that the river is unique. ""You don’t see this kind of large-scale use of gillnets, particularly when you have such a large number of endangered species,"" Stachon said in arguing for the strangeness of gillnets in the Columbia.

Jim Markee, a Salmon For All lobbyist, disagrees with the ""large-scale"" tag, but acknowledges fishing in the river is special, for the people who eat the salmon as well as those who catch the coveted fish for people to eat. 
Our limited research found that states have different management needs. There are some states that don’t depend on commercial fishing so gillnets are not an issue. While not comprehensive, we found that the use of non-tribal commercial gillnets is more widespread than originally cited by the campaign.

Oregon is among at least seven states that allow the use in inland rivers. Other states allow the use in bay, gulf and ocean water.  We rule the statement False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/14/stop-gillnetting-now/oregon-one-three-states-allow-commercial-gillnetti/

Obama regulatory adviser Cass Sunstein wants to ban hunting, NRA claims in mailer
","
We have to admit: We don’t know a whole lot about Cass Sunstein, Barack Obama’s regulatory adviser, other than he’s become kind of a whipping boy for conservative causes.

The latest example comes from the National Rifle Association. The NRA is singling out the Obama aide in a flier explaining why the president is bad for the Second Amendment.

We’re checking several claims from the NRA’s mailer, titled ""Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad News for the Second Amendment."" You can see all our fact-checks by clicking back here throughout the week.

The attack leveled against Sunstein -- administrator of the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs --  is that he ""wants to ban hunting and says animals should be represented in court.""

We’ve heard part of this claim before, from NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, who used Sunstein to paint the Obama administration as out of touch back in 2009.

""Sunstein is a radical animal rights extremist who makes PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) look like cheerleaders with pooper-scoopers,"" LaPierre said.

How extreme? LaPierre said Sunstein is ""a man who wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat.""

That’s basically the second half of the claim in the mailer -- though the mailer’s tone is tamped down a bit.

The evidence comes from Sunstein's 2004 book Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions. Chapter 11 is titled ""Can Animals Sue?""

""My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law,"" Sunstein writes. ""I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law.""

Sunstein argues that abused animals should be able to be represented in courts by humans. That’s a little more nuanced than the NRA mailer lets on, but the mailer basically gets the point correct.

As for the other part of the NRA mailer -- than Sunstein wants to ban hunting -- that comes from remarks Sunstein delivered at Harvard University in 2007. In his speech, Sunstein repeats the idea that human beings ought to be able to act on the behalf of abused animals in the court system.

He then discusses ways to close gaps in current anti-animal cruelty laws and notes that hunters are almost always excluded from animal cruelty laws (here’s unedited video of Sunstein’s remarks; he begins speaking about 40 minutes in).

""We ought to ban hunting, I suggest, if there isn't a purpose other than sport or fun. That should be against the law. It’s time now,"" Sunstein says.

We listened to huge portions of the video around Sunstein’s ""ban hunting"" remarks. It’s clear Sunstein is attempting to be provocative, and he notes that some of proposals could be hard to accept. Still, that's what he said.

Republican senators were concerned enough by Sunstein’s statements on both the rights of animals in court and banning hunting to initially put a hold on his 2009 nomination.

That forced Sunstein to address his statements, first privately in a meeting with Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and then in a July 14, 2009, letter.

On hunting, Sunstein wrote: ""I strongly believe that the Second Amendment creates an individual right to possess and use guns for purposes of both hunting and self-defense … If confirmed, I would respect the Second Amendment and the individual right that it recognizes.""

On the ability of animals to be represented in court: ""Let me be very clear: If confirmed, I would not take any steps to promote litigation on behalf of animals. In particular, federal law does not create an individual right to bring lawsuits, on behalf of animals, against agriculture. I do not favor and would not promote such a right.""

Sunstein was confirmed by the Senate 57-40 on Sept. 10, 2009. 
We reached out to the NRA but did not hear back.

Our ruling

For the most part, the NRA accurately summarizes Sunstein’s position in his 2004 book and his 2007 speech at Harvard. But the group ignores the most recent statements Sunstein made on both issues as part of his 2009 confirmation.

Sunstein said he would respect people’s right to hunt -- though that doesn’t mean he still doesn’t want to ban the practice. His about-face was more evident when it comes to the right of an individual to sue on behalf of animal. Contradicting his earlier statements, he said he does not favor changing federal law.

Those details are missing from the NRA’s latest attack. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/13/national-rifle-association/obama-regulatory-cass-sunstein-wants-ban-hunt/

Barack Obama supports plan to ban deer-hunting ammunition, NRA claims in mailer
","
Never mind that President Barack Obama has done little on gun issues -- so little, in fact, that gun control advocates are unhappy. The National Rifle Association continues to portray him as a relentless threat to the Second Amendment who wants to take your guns away.

The NRA has a website called ""Gun Ban Obama"" that warns he ""would be the most anti-gun president in American history.""  One article is headlined ""Hillary was right: You can't trust Obama with your guns.""

In the mail comes a flier that offers ""10 reasons why Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment.""

This week, we plan to focus on several of those top 10 reasons as part of an effort to triangulate Obama’s positions on guns and whether the NRA attacks are accurate.

Here we’ll examine what the NRA listed as reason No. 2 -- ""Obama supported Ted Kennedy’s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition.""

It's an oldie, but a goodie. The NRA used the same general attack against John Kerry in 2004 and against Obama in 2008.

The attack against Obama is rooted in a vote he took while serving in the U.S. Senate. It has to do with what the federal government considers armor-piercing ammunition (not, as the statement says, ammo for deer hunting).

The sale, manufacture or import of armor-piercing ammunition in handguns was banned by Congress and President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The measure, which applied only to civilians and did not outlaw the use or possession of armor-piercing rounds, passed the House 400-21 and the Senate 97-1.

As part of the 1986 law, Congress defined armor-piercing ammunition as:
  
(i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or 
(ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile. 

In 2005 -- as he had in years past --  former Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy offered an amendment to a gun bill that would have broadened the definition of armor-piercing ammunition -- moving away from specific metals and weights to include ammunition capable of penetrating body armor.

Specifically, Kennedy proposed to add:
  
(iii) a projectile that may be used in a handgun and that the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be capable of penetrating body armor; or 
(iv) a projectile for a center-fire rifle, designed or marketed as having armor piercing capability, that the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be more likely to penetrate body armor than standard ammunition of the same caliber.''. 

Kennedy’s amendment was defeated 64-31. Obama voted in favor of the amendment.

To be clear, Kennedy wasn’t proposing to outlaw deer-hunting ammunition (and so it’s even a bigger stretch to say Obama supported it). Kennedy’s amendment changed the definition of what is considered armor-piercing ammunition. It had nothing to do with deer hunting.

It’s the NRA that interpreted the deer-hunting connection. The gun rights group did not respond to us for this fact-check, but the group previously explained its thinking to FactCheck.org during the 2008 campaign. Specifically, the NRA said it was worried about Kennedy’s (iii) definition of armor piercing, because:

1.) There are a few (uncommon) models of handguns that can shoot rifle rounds, and;
2.) Most rifle rounds are considered armor piercing.

Therefore, the NRA concluded, the government can ban the rifle rounds used to hunt deer.

That reasoning ignores the latitude the amendment gives to the attorney general and Kennedy’s own words when asked about the intent of the change. ""This is not about hunting. We know duck and geese and deer do not wear armor vests; police officers do,"" Kennedy said during debate about the amendment.

Still, David B. Kopel, research director of the Independence Institute, a libertarian-leaning group that generally opposes government regulation, says Kennedy’s bill language is broad enough to allow for the banning of almost any ammunition and that his intent may be irrelevant. (Kopel’s writings have appeared on the NRA website.)

""Sen. Kennedy, the sponsor of the bill, said that he did not want to ban hunting ammunition,"" Kopel said. ""Nevertheless, the plain language of the bill, and not Sen. Kennedy’s floor statements, were what would be enacted into law. If there were ever a judicial challenge to ban particular rifle ammunition, a court might well find that the language of the statute, along with judicial deference to agency interpretation of the statute, meant there was no need to look to legislative history.""

William Vizzard, a criminal justice professor at California State University-Sacramento and a former Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms agent, sees this differently.

While it’s true that almost all rifle ammunition will penetrate body armor worn by police, ""it is absolutely ludicrous to believe that a Democratic administration would have risked the political fallout of trying to use this section to prohibit rifle ammunition.

""The Democrats have avoided all gun control controversies assiduously,"" Vizzard said, adding that the attempts to ban armor piercing ammunition is ""as phoney as the typical NRA issue.""

""This is an example of both sides pushing symbolism over substance,"" he said.

There are other problems with the NRA claim.

In its 2008 attack, the NRA -- using the same evidence -- claimed Obama wanted to  ""ban virtually all deer hunting ammunition,"" arguing that ""many"" bullets designed and intended for use in rifles (including hunting rifles) have, over the years, been used in special-purpose hunting and target handguns, thus they ‘may be used in a handgun.’""

The 2012 version of the attack drops the qualifier ""virtually"" but ignores that the NRA’s own research found that ""many"" -- not all -- bullets designed for rifles can be used in special-purpose handguns.

Moreover, the proposed changes would not have outlawed any ammunition completely. Federal law does not prohibit the use or possession of armor-piercing rounds, and Kennedy’s amendment wouldn’t have changed that. Point being, you could keep the ammo you have. You can do a quick Google search and find plenty of people in chat rooms discussing the ""AP"" rounds they acquired or own.

The NRA’s claim was found to be misleading in 2008 by fact-checkers working for the Washington Post, CNN and Factcheck.org.

Said Factcheck.org in 2008: ""We grant that it is a theoretical possibility that some future administration could interpret Kennedy’s language as banning common hunting ammunition, despite Kennedy’s clear statement of intent to the contrary. But we judge the likelihood of that to be vanishingly small, given the outcry that would surely follow.""

Our ruling

In its best light, the NRA claim is cherry-picking an extreme, worst-case interpretation of an amendment proposed by Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy. But even if you accept the NRA’s rationale -- which we do not -- the group fails to prove that Obama supports a ban on ""all deer-hunting ammunition.""

It’s entirely possible Obama voted for Kennedy’s amendment and still would have opposed a ban on deer-hunting ammunition. (For the record, there’s no evidence of Obama acting on a deer-hunting ammunition ban during his first term as president.)

Moreover, it’s worth noting that the use and possession of armor-piercing ammunition for handguns is not a federal crime. That would not have changed if Kennedy’s amendment passed.

The NRA says Barack Obama ""supported Ted Kennedy’s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition."" We rate that claim False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/13/national-rifle-association/barack-obama-supports-plan-ban-deer-hunting-ammuni/

Julián Castro says that under Mitt Romney, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation
","
Praising President Barack Obama at the expense of his likely Republican opponent, San Antonio’s mayor told fellow Democrats that Mitt Romney is not the best solution to the nation’s unemployment.

""As governor, his state ranked 47th in the nation in job creation -- almost dead last,"" Julián Castro
said in his speech June 8, 2012, on the main floor of the Texas Democratic Party State Convention.

This claim is one PolitiFact has tackled before in similar forms: Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod hung the jobless ranking on Romney on June 19, 2011, and on June 3, 2012.

Both times, PolitiFact rated the statement Half True, saying that Massachusetts’ 47th-place ranking was correct but that it was inaccurate to say Romney was responsible.

In our first fact-check on this number, PolitiFact traced the claim back to the Democratic National Committee, which cited a 2010 Wall Street Journal news story. PolitiFact also ran the numbers itself, using Bureau of Labor Relations data, and asked the taxpayer-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which does nonpartisan analysis of the state's financial and economic statistics, to do the same.

Every way PolitiFact sliced the jobs numbers, Massachusetts was 47th.

But in that item and many others, economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy.

Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, warned us not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly.

Castro’s political consultant, Christian Archer, sent us a June 5, 2012, New York Times news story supporting the statistic, and also said that as a co-chair of Obama for America, the mayor has received material from the president citing the same ranking.

Archer said Castro was offering the ranking as evidence Romney would not be as strong on job creation as Obama.

Our ruling

The job-creation ranking for Massachusetts is right; the implication that Romney is solely to blame for the state’s low standing does not hold up. We give Castro, like Axelrod before him, a Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/13/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-under-mitt-romney-massachusetts/
"['State Budget', 'Weather', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott said Citizens has $500 billion in risk exposure but less than $10 billion in cash
","
It’s become Gov. Rick Scott’s favorite talking point in the escalating debate over raising rates at Citizens Property Insurance: The state-run insurer has a whopping $500 billion in risk exposure, and a paltry $6 billion in surplus, or cash-on-hand.

In interviews, at Cabinet meetings and even in a pop-quiz-styled survey to the Florida Council of 100, Scott repeatedly uses these two numbers to illustrate the financial health of Citizens.

""I’m not sure how much smaller Citizens can get. But here’s the position Citizens is in now,"" Scott said during a May trip to the Florida Keys. ""They have over $500 billion worth of risk, with less than $10 billion worth of surplus. So that’s a lot of risk, and I think one of the most important things homeowners want is if there ever is a disaster that their insurance company is going to be able to pay the bill.""

In a survey given to the Florida Council of 100 last month, Scott got more specific, stating that the state-run insurer had $504.8 billion in total risk exposure and only $6.1 billion in cash surplus.

It’s a jarring numerical juxtaposition used to show that Citizens is severely undercapitalized and, if a major hurricane hits, would spur untold financial calamity for the state.
 
Fearing so-called ""hurricane taxes,"" Scott asked the Citizens board of governors to find ways to drastically reduce the company’s size and exposure late last year. (Citizens currently has issued about 1.4 million policies.) The board came up with more than 30 proposals, most of which would lead to increased rates or reduced coverage for policyholders. To justify those painful rate hikes, proponents point to the weak financial position of Citizens, often comparing its cash on hand to its maximum exposure.

A growing chorus of critics say Scott and insurance industry insiders are using exaggerated, apocalyptic language to incite fear and justify large increases on insurance premiums.

The numbers are extreme, to say the least. After six years without a single hurricane hitting Florida, could Citizens’ finances really be that frightful?

We did a little digging and found that Scott’s statements about Citizens’ financial assets and liabilities, while technically true, omit major components of the financial structure of Citizens.

First, on the side of Citizens’ ""surplus."" The state-run insurer does, indeed, have nearly $6 billion in cash reserves, money it has been able to build up during the last six hurricane-free years. But that cash— the most Citizens has ever had--is only part of the pot the insurer uses to pay hurricane claims.

Few, if any, property insurers rely solely on cash surplus to pay claims in the wake of catastrophe. Citizens, like every other licensed property insurer in Florida, has backup insurance from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. It also has private reinsurance worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Finally, Citizens has the ability to sell bonds to pay the cover claims that exceed its surplus and reinsurance coverage.

Altogether, Citizens has about $19.5 billion in claims-paying ability, more than three times the amount cited by the governor. Most of that could be paid out before any assessments, or ""hurricane taxes"" would be required from non-Citizens policyholders.

The other half of Scott’s statement mentions that Citizens has $500 billion in total exposure to risk.

This is also true, but it has little to do with whether Citizens ""is going to be able to pay the bill"" after a storm.

What would it take for Florida to actually have to pay out $500 billion in claims? A superstorm 25 times as ferocious as Hurricane Andrew would have to hit South Florida, and zigzag its way through Florida’s peninsula, hitting all 67 counties and damaging or destroying every home and business with a Citizens policy. A series of back-to-back, Andrew-sized storms up and down the state could also do the trick.

In the absence of such an apocalyptic occurrence, a more realistic estimate of maximum losses would be the 1-in-100-year storm, the so-called ""Big One,"" that would cause more damage than Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

Estimates indicate that kind of storm -- which only has a 1-percent chance of occurring in a given year -- would cost Citizens a maximum of $21 billion.

This number, while large and financially troublesome for Citizens, is nowhere near the $500 billion often repeated by the governor.

Scott spokesman Lane Wright said regardless of which numbers are presented, the fact that Citizens remains in a precarious financial position is central. 

""No matter how you slice it, in the worst case storm, the one-in-100-year storm, Citizens still falls short of being able to pay its claims,"" Wright said, adding that Florida could also get hit with several back-to-back storms. ""That’s a fact.""

That’s true -- but those aren’t the words Scott has been using. He’s opted for the gasp-inducing $6-billion-versus-$500-billion language.

Our ruling 
Scott has said repeatedly that Citizens has more than $500 billion worth of risk, but about $6 billion in cash surplus. But the $500-billion number vastly overstates what Citizens might have to pay in even the most vicious storm season imaginable. And the $6-billion figure undercounts Citizens’ ability to pay claims.

So those numbers are not the appropriate figures to use when determining whether the insurer ""is going to be able to pay the bill"" after a storm. More appropriate numbers would compare Citizens’ total claims-paying ability (about $19.5 billion) to the damage caused by a once-in-a-century kind of hurricane (about $21 billion).  
Scott’s statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/13/rick-scott/rick-scott-said-citizens-has-500-billion-risk-expo/
"['Legal Issues', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
John Cornyn says investigator of government leaks donated to and helped Obama's 2008 campaign
","
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas called June 12, 2012, for Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation, saying Holder is stonewalling about a botched investigation that involved moving guns across the U.S.-Mexico border. 
Holder disputed Cornyn's characterization of his responsiveness about Operation Fast and Furious, also pointing out he ended the gun-walking program. 
Yet Cornyn also aired another criticism, both at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and in a commentary placed the same day on the Fox News website. In the commentary, Cornyn said Ronald Machen, one of two U.S. attorneys just named by Holder to lead the government’s investigation of information leaks, ""has donated thousands of dollars to President Obama’s political campaigns; he vetted vice presidential candidates for the Obama team in 2008; and he got his first job as a federal prosecutor from, you guessed it, Eric Holder. In short, Mr. Machen’s inquiry will not seem truly independent. It is insulting for the attorney general to pretend otherwise.""

We wondered if Machen, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, is indeed a former Obama campaign donor who vetted vice presidential hopefuls. 
Who leaked information has been a hot topic in Washington since the New York Times published lengthy news articles on May 29, 2012 and June 1, 2012 detailing Obama’s oversight of secret terrorist kill lists and his hand in planning cyber-attacks on Iran.

Republicans including Cornyn have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to track down leakers.

Obama has condemned any leaks as well, while Holder on June 8, 2012, announced he was appointing Machen and Rod J. Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, to lead criminal investigations into possible recent instances of unauthorized disclosures of classified information.

Machen, a former assistant U.S. attorney, won Senate confirmation in his post in February 2010. Rosenstein, initially appointed to his job by President George W. Bush, was retained by Obama.

Holder said: ""These two highly respected and experienced prosecutors will be directing separate investigations currently being conducted by the FBI. I have every confidence in their abilities to doggedly follow the facts and the evidence in the pursuit of justice wherever it leads.""

At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cornyn challenged Machen’s independence.

After Holder confirmed that he had earlier hired Machen as an assistant U.S. attorney, Cornyn asked him: ""Would it surprise you to know that he is a political contributor to President Obama’s campaign and indeed served as a volunteer in Obama for America and assisted in the vetting of potential vice presidential candidates?""

Holder replied: ""I am confident that he has the ability, the capacity to investigate this case in a nonpartisan, independent, thorough and aggressive way.""

Asked for backup information, Cornyn spokeswoman Megan Mitchell later pointed us to research by the Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign donations, indicating that Machen, identified on the center’s site as a resident of Silver Spring, Md., and an attorney in the WilmerHale firm, donated a total of $4,100, in four chunks, to Obama’s presidential campaign from Feb. 8, 2008, through Sept. 30, 2008.

In February 2010, the firm, whose full name is Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr, issued a press release  identifying Machen as a partner. Machen joined the firm in 1993, then worked as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1997 to 2001 before returning to the firm, according to the release.

Mitchell also pointed us to a Jan. 19, 2010, news blog post in Legal Times, which covers legal news in Washington and nationally. The post says Machen revealed on a Senate questionnaire he filled out fo as he faced confirmation that he had volunteered for Obama’s campaign and vetted vice presidential prospects for Obama’s campaign. The blog post says vetting work ""generally consists of standard background checks of personal information, public speeches, and writings.""

We emailed Obama’s campaign about Cornyn's claim. Spokeswoman Kara Carscaden declined to comment except to stress Holder’s response to Cornyn about Machen’s ability to perform his newly assigned task.

Our ruling

We are not judging here whether Machen's donations to Obama's 2008 campaign and his self-declared vetting of vice presidential prospects disqualify him from fully investigating any leaks. That said, Cornyn’s statement rates True.",/factchecks/2012/jun/13/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-obama-appointed-campaign-donor-wh/

Gov. Scott Walker says he got ""overwhelming"" bipartisan support on jobs bills in 2011
","
Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s optimistic talk of attaining bipartisan cooperation in the wake of the June 5, 2012 recall election got a skeptical reaction from a conservative radio talk show host the day after Walker’s big win.

WTMJ’s Charlie Sykes asked Walker if he really expected Democrats who have been ""protesting, litigating and recalling"" for 16 months to join with him on new  legislative efforts.

Walker said his ""gut instinct"" is that lawmakers and the public are ""ready to move on"" and agree on the need to focus on job creation.

What’s more, he said there was precedent: Just check the record from legislative action in 2011.

""In January and February last year, we had overwhelming Democrat and Republican votes for our special session on jobs and we had them again in the fall,"" Walker said.

Was there really a time during Walker’s tumultuous tenure when the two parties got along?

Republicans held strong majorities in both the Senate and Assembly in the early session (19-14 Senate and 59-39-1 Assembly), but their Senate margin was pared to a single vote during the fall session after a series of  recall elections. Walker’s office referred us to a list of votes taken during the special sessions in 2011. 
We checked the Legislature’s official voting records and found a decidedly mixed record of bipartisan votes. We found a decidedly mixed record of bipartisan votes.

A total of 29 bills identified as part of the two special ""jobs sessions"" came to a vote in at least one full chamber of the Legislature in 2011:

-- Of those, 12 split almost exactly along party lines, with Republicans united and able to easily push through bills despite united opposition. Democratic support was typically a smattering of one, two or three votes. On one, a tort reform measure, not a single Democrat joined the majority.

-- Of the 29, the same number -- 12 -- had strong bipartisan backing.

There were 5 other votes that didn’t fall neatly into either category, typically getting bipartisan support in one chamber but little or none in the other.

So, at best only 12 of the 29 bills could be said to have had ""overwhelming"" bipartisan support.

The strongest show of inter-party cooperation came on bills that were tied to helping small businesses.

Those included measures on new tax credits for businesses relocating to Wisconsin (32 of the 53 Democrats from either the Senate or Assembly joined the majority), and an expansion of economic development tax credits (all but 20 Democrats joined in).

Another measure that drew significant support from both sides was a major rewrite of the state’s outdated telecommunications law to reflect the realities of the cellular phone era. Some Democrats raised concerns it could hurt rural residents, but only 21 voted no.

No Democrat opposed a bill that aimed to let small film projects to benefit from the state’s film tax credit program.

On the flip side, accord was almost non-existent on Walker’s move to side-step environmental reviews to allow commercial development of wetlands near Lambeau Field (only one Democrat joined the majority).

The same was true on a hotly contested bill that boosted protection from lawsuits for businesses. (This was a straight party-line vote).

Of course, the ultimate partisan split came on the budget-repair bill Walker introduced in the January special session. It included the major limits on collective bargaining for most public employees and required that state employees pay more towards their pension and health benefits.

When Republicans made plans to approve the bill in less than a week, 14 Democratic members from the state Senate left the state to block a vote, with massive protests engulfing the Capitol for weeks.

Ultimately, the bill was split into two parts. No Democrats voted for the part that included the union limits, and only four joined the majority on the other portion, which delayed state debt payments to pay for rising costs of prisons and health care.

Our rating

Walker said bipartisanship was on display in ""overwhelming Democrat and Republican votes"" in 2011 for legislation passed in two special legislative sessions on jobs.

If a couple Democrats join all the Republicans on a vote, is that really ""bipartisan?"" In a highly technical sense, maybe, but in common usage it means both parties are supportive. And that was far from the case.

What’s more, Walker claimed the special-session bills had ""overwhelming"" support from both parties. About 40 percent had strong bipartisan backing. And the special-session vote that consumed the state for months was a bitter partisan battle for the ages.

There’s an element of truth here, in that some votes were truly bipartisan, but it was far from ""overwhelming.""

John Kasich downplays impact of auto bailouts on Ohio's economy
","
President Barack Obama and Ohio Gov. John Kasich share a common desire: they both think they can lay claim to Ohio’s gradually improving economic condition. But on this issue Kasich isn’t much in the sharing mood.

Obama, a Democrat, is seeking re-election and likely will need to win Ohio in November to return to the White House. Kasich, a Republican, is backing GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

Obama’s surrogates credit  the president’s orchestrating of the automobile industry bailout in 2009 with helping to retain tens-of-thousands of Ohio jobs. But Kasich recently downplayed the role the $24.9 billion government boost for General Motors and Chrysler has played in Ohio to this point.

During an appearance on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Kasich was asked why he wasn’t giving Obama’s bailout of the industry more credit for the job growth in Ohio.

""Giving the facts: 73,000 jobs created ... since '11,"" he responded to host David Gregory. ""Do you know how many direct jobs in the auto industry?  1,800.""

Kasich praised the resurgent strength of the auto industry in Ohio, but his intent was clear: diminish the role that job sector has had in Ohio under his administration by declaring that less than 2.5 percent of all jobs created here in the last 17 months were jobs in automobile manufacturing.

He followed up by noting that the biggest areas of job growth are in business and financial services and medical fields. ""See, what we have done in Ohio is we've diversified the economy so that we have multiple ways to grow jobs,"" he said.

The auto industry is important to Ohio. The Center for Automotive Research ranks the state No. 2 for auto industry workers. So PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the governor’s claim.

To PolitiFact Ohio, words matter. And the governor chose his words for this claim very carefully. Two key words in his statement are ""created"" (as opposed to ""created or retained""), and ""direct"" as in jobs directly tied to making vehicles. That second distinction would exclude indirect jobs, such as those at  restaurants and other businesses that benefit because of nearby automobile plants.

This is an important distinction because Democrats regularly cite figures from a Center for Automotive Research report that claims in 2010 Ohio had just over 848,000 jobs tied to the automobile industry, of which about 150,000 are characterized as direct jobs. Many of those were jobs that were retained thanks to the automobile bailout even though Ohio, like other auto industry states, lost thousand of jobs in 2008 and 2009 which precipitated the bailout.

Democrats have hailed the president for saving the industry and framed the conversation in terms of jobs saved and gradually returning. But Kasich was more restrictive in his phrasing, speaking only of direct jobs created. (That’s a departure from his the phrase ""created and retained"" that he often uses when talking about jobs in Ohio.)

PolitiFact Ohio checked with Kasich’s staff about his claim.  They cited figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS counts motor vehicle manufacturing, motor vehicle parts manufacturing, and motor vehicle body and trailer manufacturing as direct jobs, according to BLS economist Parker Harvey.

The BLS data shows Kasich’s stat was high. Between January 2011 and April 2012, Ohio had a net increase of 900 vehicle manufacturing jobs and net decrease of 200 parts manufacturing jobs for a total of 700 direct jobs. Also, through the third-quarter of 2011, the most recent figures available, Ohio was up about 400 body and trailer manufacturing jobs, according to BLS statistics. Add those together and you are still below 1,800.

But the timeframe Kasich used is an issue in itself. In talking about Ohio jobs created by the auto bailout the governor only used job figures that covered his time in office. Kasich took office in January 2011. But the first federal aid to the automakers was made in 2008 while Republican President George W. Bush was still in office. It continued in early 2009 under Obama.

Take any monthly snapshot you want in 2009 and compare it to when Kasich took office and you will see a significant net gain in vehicle manufacturing jobs. For example, in June 2009 Ohio had dropped to just 14,200 vehicle manufacturing jobs, down from 23,800 jobs just one year earlier. By the time Kasich took office that number had climbed back up to 19,200. That 5,000-job increase occurred after the auto bailouts, but isn’t reflected in the governor’s tally.

And keep in mind, more jobs are coming to Ohio as the Chrysler and General Motors continued to rebound with the help of the bailout money. Chrysler is expected to add 1,100 more jobs by late summer or early fall to a plant in Toledo and GM recently announced that 100 temporary jobs at its plant in Lordstown will soon become permanent, full-time positions.

Kasich’s claim is accurate. We’ll overlook that his 1,800 jobs figure is high since the BLS tally ultimately supports his point -- that job creation in Ohio’s economy is more diverse than just auto industry.

But there’s additional information needed for clarification. By limiting the job creation numbers to just the time he has been in office, Kasich’s claim undersells the overall job growth that has occurred since the federal government rescued the auto industry.

And his claim limited his figures to ""direct"" jobs that were ""created."" That does not reflect benefits to other businesses as a result of resurgence of auto employment or consider jobs that may have been retained.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s claim rates Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2012/jun/13/john-kasich/john-kasich-downplays-role-auto-bailouts-ohios-eco/

Rep. Christopher Blazejewski says most Dunkin' Donuts tips don't go to employees
","
On June 5, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill, H7566, intended to prevent employers from taking a cut of the tips that customers give to food service and other employees.

When one state representative asked during a hearing on the bill what effect it would have on the tips she gave at her local Dunkin' Donuts or Honey Dew Donuts, the chief sponsor, Rep. Christopher Blazejewski, a Providence Democrat, said that wasn't an issue because most such stores prohibit tips for workers.

""You wouldn't know this, but they don't get that money,"" Blazejewski said. ""That money actually, as a policy at Dunkin’ Donuts, generally speaking most of the stores prohibit tipping. And those that prohibit tipping and (if) the person receives the money . . . it is given to charity. So you'll notice that little box out front when you pay for your coffee, it will be some sort of 503(c) charity. Any money given in excess of your purchase price will be donated to that charity.""

The bill, which had been amended at the last minute to exempt ""quick service restaurants"" such as Dunkin' Donuts, then passed overwhelmingly. It is now before the Senate Labor Committee.

Blazejewski's statement caught us by surprise, especially when, a few days later, we stopped by a Warwick store and noticed that the big tip jar on the counter clearly stated that the money was for employees.

It made us wonder about our visits to Dunkin' Donuts: Is it worth the tip? Was Rep. Blazejewski correct and did the company really prohibit tipping?

We called the headquarters. The company sent us a statement from Jessica Gioglio, public relations and social media manager, saying that there is no overarching policy.

""Dunkin' Donuts restaurants are independently owned and operated by franchisees who are responsible for making the business decisions, including hours of operation, employee wages and tipping policy,"" the statement said. ""Many franchisees allow their employees to accept tips. Other franchisees prefer to offer customers the opportunity to donate their change to charitable causes.""

Spokeswoman Kate Barba added, ""We don't have a way to determine the number of stores that allow tipping.""

When we called Blazejewski, he said he got his information from Chris Hunter of the lobbying/public relations firm Advocacy Solutions, located in Providence.

Hunter, in turn, told us Blazejewski ""might have misspoken in saying they don't accept tips.""

He sent us a statement from Chris Prazeres, chairman of the Dunkin' Donuts Independent Franchise Owners of Rhode Island Roundtable, saying roughly 70 percent of the approximately 160 stores in Rhode Island accept tips.

Some Dunkin' Donuts owners had been concerned about the legislation, said Hunter, because they didn't want it to interfere with their ability to collect money for charity.

Blazejewski subsequently sent a letter on June 12, 2012, to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor, which received his bill after it passed the House, asking him to remove the amendment that exempted Dunkin' Donuts and similar stores. That was the last day of the 2012 session and the bill never made it out of committee.

""We were provided with inaccurate and misleading information by Dunkin' Donuts' affiliates and are deeply troubled by it,"" he said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""I have asked the Senate to remove the floor amendment language and pass the prior version of the bill, which was always intended to prevent consumer fraud as well as protect wait staff and service employees who rely on tips to survive in an extremely difficult economy.""

Time to make our ruling

Rep. Christopher Blazejewski told the House that most Dunkin' Donuts workers don't receive tips because the company, as a policy, generally prohibits tipping.

Dunkin' Donuts told us the company has no such policy, and the decision about whether to let workers keep their tips, or give that money to charity, is up to each store owner.

A spokesman for Rhode Island franchise owners said Blazejewski misspoke and that about 70 percent of the stores allow workers to get tips.

Blazejewski said ""inaccurate and misleading information"" from Rhode Island store owners led him to support the amendment that exempted such stores.

Blazejewski may have gotten inaccurate information, but we base our ruling on the accuracy of the statement, not its source.

We rate his statement False.

Democratic SuperPAC ad blasts Romney record on funding law enforcement
","
A pro-Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, released a Web ad critical of Mitt Romney that attacks his record on public safety as governor of Massachusetts.

The ad, unveiled June 7, 2012, features a cartoon image of Romney driving a police car, an image that plays off a recent report that alleges Romney played numerous pranks as a young man, including impersonating a police officer. ""Romney might think his pranks are funny, but his record on police issues is no joke,"" the ad says.

The ad offers several specifics on Romney’s tenure, one of which is: ""As Governor: Romney did not keep public safety funding in line with inflation.""

When we contacted American Bridge 21st Century, spokesman Chris Harris said the group used figures from the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, an affiliate of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which offers a user-friendly budget-tracking tool at its website.

The group looked at the category ""law and public safety,"" which shows a decrease for the period 2002 to 2007 when using figures adjusted for inflation for government purchases. The decrease was small -- less than 1 percent cumulatively over the five-year period.

But this is only one of the ways to look at the question. In fact, analyzing Massachusetts budget questions is a particularly thorny task.

First, determining the proper time frame for judging Romney’s tenure is tricky, since the governor’s term doesn’t line up precisely with the state’s fiscal year. Romney would have had no influence on the 2002 budget, but he would have had responsibility (along with the Legislature) for the second half of the 2003 budget, as well as authority (again, with the Legislature) for 2004, 2005 and 2006, and, finally, for the first half of the 2007 budget.

We asked budget experts which time frame would be most appropriate, but there was no consensus. We’ll look at two time spans below.

Second, the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center offers two methods for adjusting by inflation -- one for prices of items typically purchased by governments (the one used by American Bridge) and one adjusted for consumer prices overall. We’ll look at both.

And third, the category American Bridge used --  ""law and public safety"" -- isn’t the only one available.

Beneath that heading on the budget tool are sub-categories more narrowly targeted toward public safety, including, ""law enforcement,"" ""prisons, probation and parole,"" and ""prosecutors."" Combining these three categories into one measurement avoids lumping in court operations, many of which stem from civil actions rather than criminal cases.

Meanwhile, another line item that sheds some light is ""local aid,"" since many public safety activities in Massachusetts are paid for by localities, partly using revenues handed down from the state.

Now let’s look at various combinations of these calculations:

Combination of ""law enforcement,"" ""prisons, probation and parole,"" and ""prosecutors,"" adjusted by government-purchase inflation measurement:
Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 5 percent increase
Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 8 percent increase

Combination of ""law enforcement,"" ""prisons, probation and parole,"" and ""prosecutors,"" adjusted by overall inflation:
Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 15 percent increase
Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 17 percent increase

So, using these figures, Romney’s record actually shows an increase beyond inflation, not a decrease.

Local aid, adjusted by government-purchase inflation measurement:
Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 17 percent decrease
Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 3 percent decrease

Local aid, adjusted by overall inflation:
Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 9 percent decrease
Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 6 percent increase

Romney did cut local aid below the rate of inflation in three out of the four calculations we did. However, local aid is a less precise measurement, since it is allocated in a variety of ways, not just for public safety. Also, because local officials would have a say in how much to fund their own law-enforcement departments, Romney wouldn’t be solely to blame for local law-enforcement cuts made during his tenure.

Finally, we should note that a Democrat, Deval Patrick, followed Romney as governor, and his record has been one of contracting spending compared to inflation. Between 2007 and 2012, the combination of ""law enforcement,"" ""prisons, probation and parole,"" and ""prosecutors,"" adjusted for government inflation, plunged by a whopping 17 percent.

Our ruling

There are ways to fiddle with the numbers so that spending on ""public safety"" declined compared to inflation while Romney was governor. But there are more ways, and we think more credible ways, to calculate it that show spending increases on Romney’s watch. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jun/12/american-bridge-21st-century/democratic-superpac-ad-blasts-romney-record-fundin/

Chris Matthews discusses 48-hour rule, Florida voting law with Florida GOP chairman Lenny Curry
","Count MSNBC’s Chris Matthews among those who think a new voting law passed in Florida in 2011 is bad public policy.

On his show Hardball, Matthews discussed the law -- in particular, a requirement that voter registration groups return signed applications within 48 hours or face fines -- with Republican Party of Florida Chairman Lenny Curry and Judith Browne-Dianis, co-director of a civil rights group called the Advancement Project.

Matthews and his guests were discussing federal Judge Robert Hinkle’s May 31, 2012, decision to deem the 48-hour rule unconstitutional. In his ruling, Hinkle said the Legislature’s restrictions have made it ""risky business"" for third-party groups to register new voters.

""He said -- quote -- ‘If the goal is to discourage voter registration drives, and thus also to make it harder for new voters to register, this may work. Otherwise, there is little reason for such a requirement’,"" Matthews said, quoting Hinkle.

From there, Matthews dressed down Curry, saying the law makes it impossible in some cases for voter registration groups to meet that deadline.

Here’s a transcript:

Matthews: ""Lenny Curry, you’re the chair of the Republican Party down there. Was the intention to suppress the vote down there, as Judith says, or it had some other purpose? Why would you set a requirement you got to get your petitions in, in 48 hours? Why did you set such a requirement and a law?""

Curry: ""No, there was no intention to suppress the vote.""

Matthews: ""Well, why would you make such a deadline, a two-day deadline to get the petitions in?""

Curry: ""In my view, the deadline seemed reasonable. The judge struck that part of the law down. A majority of the law stands, which will create ...""

Matthews: ""Well, wait a minute. I’m going to call you there because everybody watching can figure this one out. If I’m working in front of a Safeway somewhere and I’m collecting registrations -- I’m registering people who aren’t registered -- and it’s Friday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., I can’t even technically turn those in until Monday. That means it’s already elapsed, the 48 hours.

""So, under the law, nothing I get done late Friday afternoon is of any value and probably some of the stuff early Saturday morning. The 48-hour rule basically makes it impossible to meet the deadline if you’re working right to the end of the week, right, Lenny?""

Curry: ""The law was written to ensure that we have controls and processes in place to ensure the integrity of the vote. Most of the law stood. I’m no lawyer. The judge ruled on the 48-hour piece of the law. And it’s gone. And it is what it is.

""But to suggest that Republicans want to suppress the vote …""

Matthews: ""You don’t have to be a lawyer to own a calendar or know what a weekend is. A weekend is 48 hours.""

Matthews was relentless about his point. But he is also incorrect.

We read the bill (HB 1355) that passed the Legislature in 2011 and was signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott.

The 158-page bill does indeed create a 48-hour deadline for voter groups to turn in completed registrations. But there’s a caveat.

According to the law, a completed application ""shall be promptly delivered to the division or the supervisor of elections within 48 hours after the applicant completes it or the next business day if the appropriate office is closed for that 48-hour period."" (The passage is included on page 21 of the bill text. We added the bold for emphasis.)

Put plainly, if someone is registering voters on a Friday evening -- as Matthews said -- they would have until Monday to turn in the completed forms. If Monday was a holiday, the deadline would be extended until Tuesday. If Monday and Tuesday were holidays, or if the elections office was closed for any reason, the deadline would be Wednesday. And so on.

We confirmed our interpretation of the law with Florida Department of State spokesman Chris Cate.

There’s no doubt the deadlines were deterring groups from going out to register voters. After the law’s passage, the League of Women Voters said they wouldn’t conduct their usual voter registration drives because the new requirements were too difficult to meet.  

But Matthews said that Florida’s 2011 voting law made it impossible for third-party groups to register voters on Friday afternoon, because a 48-hour deadline to turn in those applications would expire before the elections office opens Monday morning.

That’s not correct. The law factored in weekends and holidays and gave voter registration groups until the next business day. We rate Matthews’ claim False.

Transportation tax foe says transit-friendly city rarely rides rail

","
Georgia temperatures are beginning to heat up. And so is the rhetoric over the proposed 1 percent sales tax hike to fund metro Atlanta transportation projects.

Transportation tax opponent Steve Brown recently told metro voters that Portland, Ore., is a cautionary tale for fans of public transit.

Yes, Portland. That town whose residents are so in love with its buses and rail that others mock them for it.

An attendee at a forum hosted by the Republican Women of Cherokee County called MARTA a business failure and asked panelists why the 10-year tax would fund a slate of projects that include public transit.

That’s when Brown, a Fayette County commissioner, brought up Portland. He called it ""the most transit-friendly city in the United States of America.""

""And they’ve never gotten over 12 to 15 percent ridership in the past 12 years,"" Brown said.

Portland?

The metro Atlanta tax, which is up for a vote July 31, would raise about $7.2 billion for road and transit projects, or as much as $8.5 billion after inflation. It would fund 157 projects in metro Atlanta, including roads, bridges and rail. No rail is slated for Cherokee County.

Brown opposes the tax for a number of reasons. One is that he thinks it would fund too much mass transit.

First, a word on ""ridership."" Transportation policy wonks use this term to refer to a very specific thing, and it’s not what Brown described.

""Ridership"" is the number of times a passenger boards public transportation. In metro Portland, that number is rising.

Fourth quarter 2002 data show there were about 288,000 boardings on Portland’s TriMet public transit system on an average weekday, according to the American Public Transportation Association. Ten years later, it was 323,000. That’s an increase of about 12 percent.    

(This does not necessarily mean more people are riding TriMet. Ridership can increase if passengers make more transfers.)

We realize, though, that average folks might not care about the technical definition of ""ridership."" Brown spoke in percentage terms, so we think it’s fair to say that the audience got the impression that he was talking about the percentage of Portland-area residents who ride transit.        

Brown backed up his point by sending PolitiFact Georgia data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s yearly American Community Survey. They describe what forms of transportation commuters use to get to their jobs.

They showed that from 1997 through 2008, between 12 percent and 15 percent of Portlanders mainly used public transportation to get to work. The most recent ACS data showed this percentage remained near 12 percent from 2006 through 2010.  

Brown sent us other surveys by the city of Portland that show similar results.

The share of commuters shrinks to about 6 percent when you include metro workers who live outside the city’s boundaries, according to ACS data. This number has also held steady in recent years.

But commutes are only one part of the story. Riders also use it to go to school or events, to run errands, or to take trips to the airport.

We talked to Jarrett Walker, a public transit expert whom Brown suggested we contact. Walker’s website is where Brown got his ACS numbers. We also talked to Alan Pisarski, an expert on road congestion and how people use different forms of transportation.

Pisarski said the ""lion’s share"" of trips on public transit are for work, and the percentage of commuters who use it during the height of rush hour can have the greatest impact on traffic congestion.

But, Pisarski said, the ACS measures commuter behavior only.

Walker thinks it’s a bad idea to predict the effects of an expanded MARTA system based on Portland’s experience. The success of a planned system depends more on how the land around potential stations develops.

""It doesn't matter much how many people use it occasionally or the balance between regular and occasional riders,"" Walker told PolitiFact Georgia.

Nationally, commuting trips make up about 60 percent of transit rides, according to data from a five-year study by the American Public Transportation Association that was released in 2007.

A 2010 survey by TriMet found that 80 percent of adults in the system’s service area ride it. Some 43 percent use the system occasionally, regularly or frequently.

Of TriMet’s frequent and regular riders, 44 percent use it primarily to travel to work while 26 percent use it primarily for school.

These percentages have held steady for the past 10 years, TriMet data showed.

The survey’s sample size of 1,000 adults is small and the research was conducted by an agency with a big stake in the results, but we think TriMet’s findings are reasonable. We compared its results with the ACS and found they square with each other.

Our ruling:

If Brown said that the percentage of Portland adults who use public transit to get to work has stayed between 12 percent and 15 percent, his claim would have been accurate.

But that’s not what he said. Brown said Portland has ""never gotten over 12 to 15 percent ridership"" of its public transit system ""in the past 12 years.""

This gives the impression that only a tiny percentage of adults in TriMet’s service area use the system. But a credible source of data shows that about 40 percent use it a couple of times a month or more. Include infrequent riders and that number climbs to 80 percent.

Furthermore, ""ridership,"" as transit experts understand it, is up.

Brown’s statement would be correct if he were just talking about Portland commuters.

But the actual ""ridership"" (Brown’s word) increases substantially when you include the people who use rail a few times a month. Throw in infrequent riders and the number skyrockets.

Brown’s statement is misleading and needs a lot of context to move any higher on the Truth-O-Meter.

In a new 2-minute TV ad, Barack Obama explains his economic plans and contrasts them with John McCain's. In two other Truth-O-Meter rulings, we examined Obama's claims about his plans for small businesses and the middle class. Here, we'll address his plan for senior citizens.
 
He says in the ad that ""seniors making less than $50,000, who are struggling with the rising costs of food and drugs on fixed incomes, won’t pay income taxes at all.""
 
That is correct. Obama's tax plan specifies that he would ""eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year."" The campaign estimates it will cut taxes an average of $1,400 for 7-million seniors.
 
It's worth noting that Obama's proposal has been criticized on several fronts.
 
Some economists have questioned whether it's a wise policy because seniors already receive favorable tax treatment. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax research group, said Obama's plan would create inequity by eliminating taxes for senior citizens who earn a modest income but continuing to tax younger workers earning the same amount. Also, it would help seniors who are currently paying income taxes but provide no benefit for those too poor to owe any tax.
 
Still, Obama accurately describes his plan in the ad. We rate his statement True.

Fannie, Freddie and John, at odds in 2006
","
Seeking to portray Sen. John McCain as prescient on the financial crisis, McCain's campaign unveiled a

new advertisement

saying he had spotted problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago.
 
""John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie ... but Democrats blocked the reforms,"" McCain's new ad says.
 
As evidence, the ad points to McCain's support of a bill in 2006 to strengthen oversight of Fannie and Freddie, and Democrats' opposition to that bill. Those points merit caveats, but first, some context.
 
Fannie and Freddie, private corporations created and sponsored by Congress to lower the cost of mortgage capital, quintupled in size between 1995 and 2004, as they pioneered the practice of selling bundled mortgages in the form of securities.
 
Federal officials in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations sought greater authority to regulate them, but were largely stymied by Congress. In early September 2008, with home values plummeting, the government seized control of Fannie and Freddie to prevent them from failing, a move that could cost U.S. taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.
 
McCain has taken heat for recent revelations that Freddie Mac paid a lobbying firm co-owned by his campaign manager, Rick Davis, $15,000 a month from 2005 through August 2008. But the campaign has called attention — in advertisements like this one — to McCain's support for tighter oversight of the companies.
 
McCain did indeed co-sponsor the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, a bill that would have enhanced oversight of Freddie and Fannie. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., introduced the bill in January 2005 and immediately garnered co-sponsorship from two other Republican senators.
 
McCain signed on in May 2006 after a damning federal report on accounting practices at Fannie Mae was released. ""If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole,"" he said in

a statement

.
 
The National Association of Home Builders opposed the bill, as did the National Association of Realtors. Senate Democrats said they supported some form of stricter oversight, but would not support a provision of Hagel's bill that would limit the size of the company's portfolios. Negotiations stalled and the bill never made it to the floor.
 
Does McCain's support for that bill amount to fighting to rein in Freddie and Fannie? Sort of. Others had been fighting for Fannie-and-Freddie reform for more than a decade, and McCain signed onto the bill a year-and-a-half after it was introduced. And he

reportedly

didn't do too much for the bill beyond co-sponsoring it and issuing a statement.
 
The McCain campaign has also noted that in 2003 he was one of five Republican senators to co-sponsor a prior bill to tighten oversight of Fannie and Freddie. Still, if he ""fought"" for reform, it wasn't exactly guns-a-blazin'.
 
Did Democrats block the reforms? More or less. They preferred a pared-down bill, and so did not support Hagel's.
 
McCain overstates his role in pushing for Fannie and Freddie reform, and slightly oversimplifies the dynamic at work in the Senate. We give his claim a Half True.

Obama oversimplifies corporate taxes
","


 
In the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008, Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama sparred briefly over corporate tax rates.
 
One of the hallmarks of McCain's tax platform is his plan to reduce the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent.
 
McCain often compares that 35 percent rate to those in other countries to bolster his point that America competes for businesses and jobs internationally, and he did so again in the debate.
 
""Right now, the United States of America’s businesses pay the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent,"" McCain said.
 
""Now, if you’re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it’s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you’re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.
 
""I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in the United States of America and create jobs.""
 
Obama challenged McCain for presenting misleading numbers.
 
""Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he’s absolutely right,"" Obama said. ""Here’s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.""
 
Who’s right?
 
McCain accurately cites the United States’ top corporate tax rate. Combined with state corporate taxes (which vary), the statutory corporate tax rates for the United States are among the highest in the world.
 
Three years ago, the Congressional Budget Office compared U.S. corporate tax rates to other countries to get a sense of where we stand. They found that the United States’ statutory corporate tax rates in 2003 came to 39.3 percent. Only Japan (40.9) and Germany (39.6) were higher. Among the top industrialized countries, the United States ranked third of seven.
 
But the corporate tax picture is more complex than McCain — and that statistic — makes it seem. Note the word ""statutory"" in the last paragraph. It excludes other very important factors such as a country’s depreciation system (how quickly businesses are allowed to write off investment in equipment and buildings); how much companies can write off from debt; and investor-level taxes such as capital gains, dividends and interest.
 
That’s why many economists like to cite ""effective marginal tax rates,"" the percentage of the income from an investment that must be paid as corporate income tax.
 
The United States fares much better in these tables, although it varies by industry and other factors, such as how much a company borrows for equipment or structures (generally, the more debt a company carries, the more it can write off). The United States has fairly generous depreciation rules, but is less generous when it comes to investment in structures.
 
So, for example, the United States ranks second lowest in the world among industrialized nations when it comes to the effective corporate tax rates for debt-financed investments in machinery. For equity-financed investments in machinery, the rates are closer to the upper middle of the pack. And for equity-financed investments in industrial structures (buildings, factories, etc), the effective corporate tax rates were second highest in the world (behind Japan). As an aside, it is precisely this tax system, weighted to favor debt-financed investments, that's part of why the current credit crisis is seen as so dire.
 
The nonpartisan, business-backed Tax Foundation noted in a news release this summer that ""while America has left the major features of its business tax system unchanged over the past 15 years, virtually all developed nations have lowered their corporate tax rates, potentially hurting the competitiveness of the United States."" The statutory rates — nearly the highest in the world — should not be discounted, they argue. And while marginal ""effective"" rates put the United States more around the middle of the pack, they say, America's effective tax rate has largely stayed the same while other countries have lowered theirs.
 
But the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center tends to agree with Obama's acounting.
 
""In any company, these deductions reduce the tax rates well below what the statutory rule is,"" said the center’s Bob Williams. ""It depends on the type of company and the kinds of investments you are making.""
 
While the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center disagree somewhat on how important the statutory tax rate is and where the United States ranks among nations based upon the marginal ""effective"" rates, they do agree that the statutory rate is only part of the story for what U.S. companies pay in taxes.
 
McCain’s repeated citation of statutory corporate tax rates is misleading because it does not take into account various deducations to which businesses are entitled.
 
But we also think Obama’s assertion that these deductions result in the United States having one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world similarly oversimplifies things. It’s true for some business, particularly ones that can write off a lot of debt payments. But it’s not true for others. So we rate Obama’s statement Half True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Are you middle class?
","


 
Middle class. According to a recent study, more than half of Americans say that’s what they are.
 
More than a third of Americans with incomes below $20,000 describe themselves as middle class. So do a third of people with incomes above $150,000.
 
The government doesn't officially define the ""middle class."" But this much is certain: Since most people consider themselves middle class, politicians want their vote.
 
In a recent campaign ad focusing on economic issues, Sen. Barack Obama directly appealed to this important constituency.
 
""Instead of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest — I’ll focus on you,"" Obama said. ""My plan offers three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain’s.""
 
The claim refers to a report from the Tax Policy Center, which analyzed the tax plans of Sens. Obama and John McCain after interviews with their top economic advisers.
 
The analysts concluded that under Obama’s plan, people with incomes in the middle 20 percent would see their federal income tax burden go down by $1,118 in 2009. Under McCain’s plan, those same people would see their federal taxes cut by $325.
 
That’s more than ""three times as much tax relief.""
 
But a couple qualifiers are in order. First, those figures are for just one year of Obama's tax plan, 2009. If you look down the road, say at 2012, those in the middle quintile would see tax cuts of $2,197 under Obama’s plan; $1,441 under McCain’s. Not ""three times as much.""
 
Also consider that the middle 20 percent of incomes translates to people making between $37,595 and $66,354.
 
Suppose you consider yourself middle class, but you make between $66,354 and $111,645 (in the 60 to 80 percent quintile). Then Obama’s plan would translate to a tax cut of $1,264 in 2007, as opposed to a cut of $994 under McCain’s plan. Not ""three times as much.""
 
""Like all of these things, everyone is cherry-picking the facts,"" said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center.
 
Obama’s claim that his tax plan would result in three times as much tax relief for the middle class ""is for one year (2009), not the whole lifespan of the tax plan,"" Williams said. ""There’s so many things happening at different times in the plan.""
 
The nonpartisan, business-backed Tax Foundation points out another caveat. The tables cited by the Obama campaign in the Tax Policy Center analysis don’t include the candidates’ health care plans.
 
The McCain camp has argued that some of his biggest proposed tax cuts for the middle class come through his idea to replace the income tax exclusion of employer-paid health insurance with a refundable income tax credit of $2,500 for individual coverage or $5,000 for family coverage.
 
Obama has a direct pay plan that would provide subsidies to help low- and middle-income families purchase insurance, as well as a mandate for health insurance coverage for children.
 
As both health plans are not part of the tax code, it’s probably not fair to include them in a head-to-head comparison of McCain’s and Obama’s tax plans.
 
But the Tax Policy Center did provide a preliminary report that concluded that under McCain’s health care plan, people with incomes in the middle 20 percent would see after-tax income increase by $1,559 in 2009. Under Obama’s health plan, those folks would see their income rise $269.
 
While it’s not fair to simply add the difference between those figures to the earlier analysis, ""it’s probably safe to say that if you include McCain’s health care tax cuts, you do not get this three times greater figure"" that Obama cited, said Gerald Prante, a senior economist with the Tax Foundation.
 
And then there’s the issue of defining the middle class. Is it the middle 20 percent? The middle 60 percent?
 
It’s certainly fair for Obama to pick the middle 20 percent. But picking, say, the middle 60 percent would yield much different results.
 
This much we can say for sure: A higher fraction of Obama’s tax cuts would go to the middle class than McCain’s. Perhaps the most stark contrast in tax distribution comes for those in the top quintile, people making more than $111,645. Under Obama’s plan, those folks, on average, would be paying $3,017 a year more in federal taxes in 2007, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. Under McCains plan, they would be paying $6,498 less.
 
As for Obama’s claim that his plan offers ""three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain’s,"" it’s true for one year, and under one sensible definition of middle class. But since it’s not true when you look at the fourth year of the plan — and we are talking about electing a president for four years — we rate Obama’s claim Half True.

Deficit grows under Obama's plans
","
At the first presidential debate in Oxford, Miss., John McCain and Barack Obama discussed spending.
 
McCain accused Obama of dramatically increasing spending, and Obama responded.
 
""I don't know where John is getting his figures,"" Obama said. ""Let's just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it.""
 
Obama often discusses how to pay for varying proposals, and he has said he believes ""that if you want to propose a new program, you better cut some old ones."" He says he will pay for his health care plan, for example, by  reducing inefficiencies in the health care system and by rescinding the Bush tax cuts on those making $200,000 or more.
 
But ""pay for every dime""? Not to our way of thinking.
 
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the deficit grows dramatically under both candidates'  proposals. Without any changes, the deficit will stand at $2.3-trillion in 2018. Under Obama's plan, the deficit grows even more, to $5.9-trillion by 2018. And it grows even more than that under John McCain's plan, to $7.4-trillion (in part because McCain will continue the Bush tax cuts for all income levels). That doesn't sound like pay-as-you-go to us, for either candidate.
 
The Tax Policy Center's analysis does not include spending cuts to existing programs, but it's difficult to see how spending cuts would erase deficits of this size. Obama has said he would curtail the war in Iraq to save money, while McCain talks about eliminating pork and earmarks from the budget. Neither of those measures would close the gap.
 
Another watchdog group, the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, used a different method to examine the candidates' proposals. They chose to take a snapshot of a single year — 2013 — and calculate how the candidates' proposal would affect the deficit for that year alone. They found that Obama's plan adds about $286 billion to the deficit for that year, while McCain's adds about $211-billion.
 
A few important caveats here: Calculating the costs for new spending proposals, tax cuts, tax increases and spending cuts for the federal government can be complicated. Nobody knows exactly how much some of the candidates' proposals will cost in the end (health care is a good example), and some of their proposals for reducing spending are vague and impossible to substantiate.
 
As for Obama's claim that he ""pays for every dime"" of his spending plans: If the deficit were to stay the same or grow only modestly as a result of Obama's policies, we would give him a better rating. But independent groups agree that the deficit will grow significantly under an Obama administration, and that's an important yardsitck. We give Obama credit for the level of detail many of his proposals have when it comes to spending and cost. But Obama doesn't pay ""for every dime"" of his proposals. We rate his statement Barely True.

One Obama example is just too old
","
John McCain and Barack Obama debated foreign policy on Sept. 26, 2008, including policies for dealing with Pakistan.
 
""(Obama) said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan,"" McCain said. ""Now, you don't do that. You don't say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. ... I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.""
 
McCain is distorting Obama's position by saying he wants to attack Pakistan,

a statement we checked previously

and found to be a Pants on Fire!
 
This time, Obama responded directly to McCain's criticsm.
 
""Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan,"" Obama replied. ""Here's what I said — and if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know — that if the United States has al-Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.""
 
Then he added, ""And, John, you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But coming from you, who in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know how credible that is.""
 
It's a snappy comeback, but let's check its accuracy.
 
We reviewed McCain's previous comments on North Korea and found the ""extinction"" claim dates back to 1994, when McCain appeared on the interview show

This Week with David Brinkley

to discuss North Korea. At the time, North Korea's leader, Kim Il Sung, was refusing to allow inspections of his nuclear program.
 
Brinkley asked McCain what he would do about that.
 
""Well, I would make sure that China and Japan realize that it is in the United States' and their vital national security interests that North Korea not be a nuclear power and possess nuclear weapons, and that they should go along with and help enforce strong sanctions against Korea,"" McCain said. ""If not, then the United States will have no choice but to militarily disable that nuclear capability.""
 
Reporter Sam Donaldson, who also sat in on the interview, then asked McCain about the prospects of outright war with North Korea if the situation escalated.
 
""


I think history shows us, especially in dealing with dictators, that a strong, resolute policy and position is what usually avoids what you're talking about,"" McCain said.


 


""




You think they're bluffing?"" Donaldson asked.


 


""




I don't know, but I know what they understand and that is the


threat of extinction,"" McCain replied.




 




So, he said it. The threat was implied rather than direct, but there's no mistaking the point McCain was seeking to make. But it was one time in 1994. That was 14 years ago, when McCain was not a candidate for president, and North Korea had a different leader. (Kim Il Sung would die later that year; the leadership would pass to his son, the current leader, Kim Jong Il.)





 




Now, about McCain's singing songs about bombing Iran. The basis for this statement is something McCain said at an April 18, 2007, campaign appearance held at a VFW hall in




Murrells Inlet, S.C.
 


A man in the audience told McCain he thought Iran was causing problems in the Middle East. He then asked, ""How many times do we have to prove that these people are blowing up people now, never mind if they get a nuclear weapon? When do we send an airmail message to Tehran?""


 


The audience clapped and there were a few scattered cheers.



 
""That old Beach Boys song, Bomb Iran,"" McCain said, apparently referencing the Beach Boys' 1965 single ""Barbara Ann."" The audience laughed, then McCain sang softly, ""Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb. Anyway...""
 
Video of the incident is available on YouTube. McCain said later it was a joke.
 
""When veterans are together, veterans joke,"" McCain said. ""And I was with veterans and we were joking. And, if somebody can't understand that, my answer is, please get a life.""
 
The McCain campaign never shied away from the bombing reference and played ""Barbara Ann"" at many of its rallies.
 
Obama's charge is based on things McCain did say. His comments about North Korea sound like an implied threat, even if it wasn't a direct ultimatum. But given that it was one remark from 14 years ago, we question its relevancy to today's campaign. Because Obama omits the context of the remark and North Korea is still in the headlines, voters would likely think McCain said it recently, which was not the case.
 
In the end, Obama is right that McCain said both things. But since the context of the Obama claim was a discussion of what ""a president"" should or shouldn't say publicly, we're not going to give full weight to the 14-year-old tough-talking remarks of a senator who at the time hadn't ever declared himself a candidate for the presidency. We rate Obama's statement Half True.

Yes, wary about Spain -- and maybe confused, too
","
During the first presidential debate, Barack Obama said John McCain has been too reluctant to support high-level diplomacy with other nations. Obama said that was true not just with U.S. enemies such as Iran, but also with a longtime ally like Spain.
 
Obama said that McCain ""even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he — you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us,"" Obama said. ""I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally.""
 
Obama was referring to an interview McCain gave with Radio Caracol in Miami on Sept. 17 in which McCain was asked if he would invite José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister,  to the White House.
 
McCain's tangled and somewhat confused response prompted lots of criticism. Democrats said it illustrated reluctance by the Bush administration — and now McCain — to engage in diplomacy even with longtime allies.
 
Here's the relevant portion of the interview:
 
Q: Senator, finally, let’s talk about Spain. If you’re elected president, would you be willing to invite President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to the White House, to meet with you?
 
A: I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion. And by the way, President Calderón of Mexico is fighting a very, very tough fight against the drug cartels. I’m glad we’re now working in cooperation with the Mexican government on the Merida plan, and I intend to move forward with the relations and invite as many of them as I can of those leaders to the White House.
 
Q: Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government? To the president, itself?
 
A: Uh, I don’t, you know, honestly, I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities, but I can assure you: I will establish closer relations with our friends, and I will stand up  to those who want to do harm to the United States of America. I know how to do both.
 
Q: So, you have to wait and see if he’s willing to, to meet with you, or you be… able to do it? In the White House?
 
A: Well, again… I, I don’t… All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us, and standing up to those who are not, and that’s judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America, and the entire region.
 
Q: OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the President of Spain. Are you willing to meet with him, if you’re elected president?
 
A: I’m willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights, democracy and freedom. And I will stand up to those that do not.
 
McCain's reluctance to meet with Zapatero was odd because Spain is a member of NATO and a longtime U.S. ally. The CIA World Factbook calls it ""a global champion of freedom."" The U.S. State Department says ""Spain and the United States have a long history of official relations and are closely associated in many fields.""
 
But it's worth noting that U.S.-Spain relations have suffered since Zapatero became prime minister in 2004 and withdrew Spanish troops that were helping the U.S. war in Iraq.
 
We listened to the McCain interview several times and got the impression that the senator was confused during the first few questions. The interviewer says Zapatero's name quickly and it seemed to us that McCain did not recognize the name. His answer suggests he is focused on other leaders from Latin America. But the interviewer seems to notice his confusion and reminds him ""OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the president of Spain.""
 
But McCain's reply does not suggest that registered with him and he offers a more general reply about meeting with ""any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are.""
 
We would have accepted a McCain-was-confused explanation for this one, but the McCain campaign sent reporters a statement from foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann that said McCain's answer was intentional.
 
""The questioner asked several times about Senator McCain's willingness to meet Zapatero — and id'd him in the question so there is no doubt Senator McCain knew exactly to whom the question referred. Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview,"" Scheunemann said in an e-mail sent to the

Washington Post

and CNN.
 
Scheunemann said that if elected, McCain ""will meet with a wide range of allies in a wide variety of venues but is not going to spell out scheduling and meeting location specifics in advance.""
 
So where does that leave us?
 
Obama is right that McCain ""said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain."" McCain's words make that clear and are reinforced by Scheunemann's statement.
 
It's less clear if McCain ""wasn't sure whether (Spain is) aligned with us.""
 
To us, McCain seemed confused. But Scheunemann's statement is adamant that McCain knew the subject was Spain. As a result, his comment that ""I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities"" indicates at least some doubt about U.S.-Spanish relations.
 
So we find Obama's claim to be Mostly True.

Kissinger and Obama aren't really on the same page
","
From the start of his campaign, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has said that as president he would personally negotiate with the leaders of rogue states who have long been denied face-to-face meetings with U.S. presidents, such as Iran.


Sen. John McCain raised the issue during the first presidential debate, arguing that Obama's willingness to meet with dictators — without conditions — would provide enemies of the United States, like Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, with a platform to spread propaganda.


Ahmadinejad, McCain pointed out, has called for the destruction of Israel and denied that the Holocaust ever happened. McCain's point, notably, is one on which he agrees with New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who differed with Obama on the same issue during the Democratic primaries.


To parry McCain's criticism at the debate, Obama said that McCain's own foreign policy adviser, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who served under President Richard Nixon, has called for high-level negotiations with Iran, without condition. And Obama's statement suggests that Kissinger was supporting presidential-level negotiations. Here's what Obama said:
 
""So let's talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.
 
""And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.
 
""Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran — guess what — without precondition. This is one of your own advisers.""
 
McCain opposes direct, president-to-president meetings with Ahmadinejad; Obama favors them.


Kissinger may differ with McCain on when negotiations should begin – the Sept. 20, 2008, remarks Kissinger made on CNN, which Obama was referencing, aren't entirely clear – but he did not endorse a meeting between the presidents of Iran and the United States.


Here's what Kissinger said during the CNN forum with other secretaries of state at George Washington University:
 
""Well, I am in favor of negotiating with Iran. And one utility of negotiation is to put before Iran our vision of a Middle East, of a stable Middle East, and our notion on nuclear proliferation at a high enough level so that they have to study it. And, therefore, I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level so that we — we know we're dealing with authentic,"" Kissinger said.
 
""At a very high level right out of the box?"" asked moderator Frank Sesno.


""Initially, yes,"" Kissinger said. ""And I always believed that the best way to begin a negotiation is to tell the other side exactly what you have in mind and what you are — what the outcome is that you're trying to achieve so that they have something that they can react to. Now, the permanent members of the Security Council, plus Japan and Germany, have all said nuclear weapons in Iran are unacceptable. They've never explained what they mean by this. So if we go into a negotiation, we ought to have a clear understanding of what is it we're trying to prevent. What is it going to do if we can't achieve what we're talking about?""


Kissinger then added, ""But I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations. We ought, however, to be very clear about the content of negotiations and work it out with other countries and with our own government.""


That would seem to differ from McCain's position. McCain has made clear he would hold ""no unconditional summits.""


After the debate, the McCain campaign was quick to say that Obama had incorrectly described Kissinger's remarks, issuing a statement from Kissinger that said, ""I would not recommend the next president of the United States engage in talks with Iran at the presidential level.”
 
Obama is right that Kissinger supports meetings without preconditions, but he neglects to mention that Kissinger specified they would be ""at the secretary of state level."" And Obama's comments imply that he was referring to meetings at the presidential level. So we find Obama's statement to be Half True.

Yes, South Koreans taller
","
The first presidential debate focused on the economy and foreign affairs, and Barack Obama and John McCain discussed a broad range of topics that included the economic bailout, the Iraq war and . . . whether South Koreans are taller than North Koreans.
 
McCain called North Korea the ""most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag."" (That statement occurs about 1:00 into the accompanying video.)
 
We've examined a lot of unlikely facts in this campaign, including

the cooking of squirrels

and the

regulation of ham and cheese sandwiches

, but this was a new one to us. So we did some checking and found that McCain is right. South Koreans are, indeed, taller than North Koreans.
 
In his study

Height and weight differences between North and South Korea,

Daniel Schwekendiek, an economist from the University of Tuebingen in Germany, compared 2002 data that showed preschool children in North Korea were up to 5 inches shorter and up to 14 pounds lighter than children who were brought up in South Korea.
 
A 2006 study of 1,075 North Korean defectors aged 20 to 39 put the difference for adults at 4 inches for men and 2.5 inches for women. A 2004 study said the difference was 2.3 inches for young men and 1.6 inches for young women. 
 
The studies blame malnutrition in North Korea for the height difference.
 
So McCain is on solid ground with his claim. The studies vary, but his 3-inch claim is a reasonable approximation of the various studies and his underlying point is correct. We find his claim to the True.

Many will get tax cuts, but not that many
","
At the presidential debate in Oxford, Miss., Barack Obama described his tax plan and said, ""Here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.""
 
We checked a similar claim of Obama's recently, that 95 percent of

working families

would get lower taxes under Obama's plan, and

found it to be True

.
 
But Obama stretched things when he said that 95 percent of ""you"" — everyone — would receive a tax cut.
 
The part of Obama's tax plan that results in widespread tax cuts is a tax credit for workers, intended to offset payroll taxes. Single workers would get $500, and working couples would get $1,000.
 
But not all taxpayers get paychecks from an employer, and those who don't would not get the credit. Additionally, Obama intends to raise taxes on higher brackets ($200,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples) which would offset any tax cuts for those incomes.
 
A detailed analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that if you look at all tax filers, 81 percent of tax filers would see reduced taxes under the Obama plan.
 
So Obama's statement at the debate glosses over a few important details about who would get tax cuts under his plan. If you're talking about everyone, it's 81 percent. If you're talking about working families, it's 95 percent. The difference between 81 percent and 95 percent is not insignificant. We rule his debate statement Half True.

McCain repeats questionable tax claim
","
During the presidential debate, John McCain said Barack Obama voted to raise taxes on the middle class.
 
""He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year,"" McCain said.
 
""That's not true, John. That's not true,"" Obama said, interrupting him.
 
""And that's just a fact. Again, you can look it up,"" McCain said.
 
We looked it up already because

it's not the first time

McCain has made this statement.
 
To support the claim, the McCain campaign has pointed to two votes Obama made on budget resolutions, one in March 2008 and another in June 2008.
 
Problem is, neither of these votes actually raised taxes, nor were they expected to.
 
Instead, the votes approved budget resolutions, which are blueprints for the federal budget. The resolutions set targets for the committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes, expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The tax cuts would have been rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher.
 
The McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted for the measures, which expressed approval for tax increases. But it's inaccurate to suggest votes on nonbinding budget resolutions, which don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending, are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy.
 
The statement also suggests that Obama as president would favor tax increases for incomes of $42,000. He does not. Obama's tax proposals are crafted so that tax increases hit those couples $250,000 or more a year, or $200,000 for singles. He also proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles).
 
McCain here makes his statement on a vote that would not have directly changed the tax code. We find the statement Barely True.

Bear study funding actually undersold
","
A joke meant to highlight a serious issue about wasteful federal spending apparently went over well enough before an audience in Orange County, Calif., last month, that John McCain decided to trot it out before a national audience at the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008. 
 
""You know, we spent $3-million to study the DNA of bears in Montana,"" McCain said at the debate. ""I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3-million of our taxpayers' money. And it has got to be brought under control.""
 
The bear study in Montana has become a go-to line in McCain’s stump speeches, and we fact-checked an almost identical line when McCain said it before an audience of evangelicals at Saddleback Church in Orange County, Calif., on Aug. 16, 2008.
 
The U.S. Geological Survey is indeed conducting a study that involves the DNA of bears in Montana, but the

Northern Divide Grizzly Bear Project

actually has received more earmarked funding than McCain mentions — to the tune of $4.8-million, according to Katherine C. Kendall, the researcher in charge of the study.
 
The study had received $3.1-million in earmarked money by 2003, the year McCain first started taking aim at the project (he mentioned it on the Senate floor as part of a speech criticizing earmarks). But apparently McCain's campaign rhetoric hasn't been updated to reflect the additional $1.69-million the study's gotten since 2003.
 
And, strictly speaking, the point of the project isn't really to analyze the bears' DNA, it's to use their DNA to take a census. The researchers collect hair left when the grizzlies scratch themselves on trees, then use DNA extracted from the hair to identify individual bears. This helps researchers count the number of grizzlies that live in Montana, considered one of the last strongholds of this endangered species.
 
Kendall said it's a much cheaper — and safer — way to count them than traditional methods, which involve capturing grizzly bears and saddling them with satellite collars. It also has resulted in doubling the previous population estimates. The new figures, when paired with the results of another study on population trends, may eventually lead to removing grizzlies from the endangered list.
 
McCain's math is a little dated. And he clearly is suggesting ""the study of bear DNA"" is a frivolous use of federal money, but we won't argue the merits of the project. McCain claims $3-million in federal money has been used to study the DNA of bears, and that's Mostly True.

Better context for a once-questionable tax claim
","
During the presidential debate, John McCain and Barack Obama sparred over taxes.
 
McCain discussed his support for a reduction in corporate tax rates, which he said would help create jobs. A few moments later, he criticized Obama for voting for the 2005 energy bill, which McCain said was full of unnecessary spending.
 
""It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments,"" McCain said. ""It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Sen. Obama voted for it.""
 
""John, you want to give oil companies another $4-billion,"" Obama retorted.
 
We've checked the controversy over

Obama's energy vote previously

. We found the bill, which did become law, included both incentives for clean energy and tax breaks for oil companies. Obama

has said

he felt the good in the bill outweighed the bad.
 
Here, we'll look at Obama's claim that McCain wants to give oil companies $4-billion in tax breaks, a claim he's made several times.
 
The Obama campaign defends this claim because McCain supports cutting corporate taxes, reducing them from a maximum rate of 35 percent to a maximum rate of 25 percent.
 
Based on that tax change, the Obama campaign estimates that oil companies would save $4-billion a year. Specifically, they cite a study from the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund. That group analyzed financial statements from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the five largest oil companies and calculated current and deferred taxes paid in 2007 to the federal government for income earned from U.S. operations. They then calculated how much less those companies would pay if the corporate tax rate were dropped from 35 percent to 25 percent. The total savings to the five oil companies, $3.8-billion; $1.2-billion Exxon Mobil alone.
 
In our previous look at this $4-billion claim, Obama didn't mention McCain's position on cutting corporate taxes for all companies. We concluded that Obama was cherry-picking by singling out oil companies. That led us to rule his statement Barley True.
 
But at the debate, the two candidates had just discussed McCain's position on corporate taxes and were talking about how overarching policy could affect tax breaks for oil companies. The context of the exchange explained McCain's overall policy on corporate taxes. As a result, when Obama made the claim in the debate, it was True.

Several ratings rank Obama lower
","
In the first debate of the 2008 general election, John McCain accused Barack Obama of being too liberal.
 
""Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate,"" McCain said. ""It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.""
 
Republican candidates often brand their Democratic opponents as liberals to portray them as lefties who favor big government and high taxes. Linguists who study political rhetoric say Republicans have been so effective at giving the word a negative connotation that many Democrats won't call themselves liberals. They prefer ""progressives.""
 
Still, many political scientists and journalists use the term to represent the Democratic extreme of the political spectrum, and

National Journal,

a nonpartisan political magazine, uses a liberal-conservative scale for its annual rating of congressional votes.
 
The magazine's editors and reporters choose key votes on major issues and those that they believe exhibit a split between liberals and conservatives and then calculate how often senators and House members vote each way. They calculate the liberal/conservative votes in three areas — economic, social issues and foreign policy — and then average them for a composite score. The annual rankings generate some publicity for the magazine, especially in election years. In 2004, the magazine said the most liberal senator was Sen. John Kerry, who became the Democratic nominee for president.
 
On Jan. 31, 2008, five days before the Super Tuesday primaries,

National Journal

published an article headlined ""Obama: Most Liberal Senator in 2007."" The article said Obama had missed 33 of the 99 votes that were rated but that it was enough for a calculation. The magazine said McCain was not rated because he missed more than half the votes in the economic and foreign-policy categories.
 
Since Obama's rating was announced, McCain and other Republicans have frequently cited it to criticize Obama.
 
Yet other ratings don't show Obama as the Senate's top lefty.
 
He wasn't the top liberal in his two other years in the U.S. Senate according to

National Journal

. He was 10th-most liberal in 2006 and 16th in 2005.
 
The McCain campaign has previously cited a 2006 rating by the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action that gave Obama 95 percent, which the campaign noted was the same as Kerry and Sen. Barbara Boxer.
 
But there's a little sleight of hand in that one. Although the McCain campaign is correct that Obama earned a 95 percent rating that year for voting the way ADA wanted, there were 10 senators who got more liberal scores than Obama, including Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Richard Durbin of Illinois. (In the latest ADA rating, for 2007, Obama missed five of the 20 votes the group scored, so he received a 75 percent rating. But he voted the way ADA wanted on each of the 15 votes he attended.)
 
Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists that plots lawmakers on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting patterns, calculated there were nine senators more liberal than Obama in the current Congress, including Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
 
""Obama is a liberal, but he’s not the most liberal,"" said Keith Poole, a University of California-San Diego professor who runs the site, whom we interviewed

when we first looked into similar statements

in June 2008.
 
Ratings from

Congressional Quarterly

don't measure liberal/conservative votes, but they show Obama is not quite as partisan as other senators.
 
In CQ’s calculation of party unity, which measures how often members vote with their party on bills where Republicans and Democrats split, Obama got a 97 percent rating last year. Ten Democrats had higher scores.
 
On votes where President Bush indicated his position, CQ found Obama supported the Republican president 40 percent of the time in 2007, which put Obama in the middle of the pack for Democrats. He supported Bush 49 percent the previous year.
 
If McCain had made a more general statement about Obama's ideology, he could have been more accurate. But McCain's statement that Obama ""has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate,"" suggests it is a cumulative rating for all of Obama's time in the Senate. But in fact, it is true for only

one

rating for

one

year. Measurements for other years and by other groups show Obama is not the No. 1 liberal — in some cases, far from No. 1. So we find McCain's statement to be Barely True.

McCain right on amount of Obama's pork requests
","
Sen. John McCain has a long reputation as an opponent of pork-barrel spending, those billions of dollars for local projects earmarked quietly every year into massive federal spending bills.
 
In the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008, McCain said Sen. Barack Obama, in his relatively brief senatorial career, has asked for $932-million in pork for his home state of Illinois. Just to be sure everyone heard it, McCain cited the number three times.


 
""He has asked for $932-million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly $1-million dollars for every day that he’s been in the United States Senate,"" McCain said.
 
In response, Obama noted, correctly, that he has eschewed any pork spending for fiscal 2009.
 
Said Obama: ""Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.""
 
McCain shot back that Obama did not suspend his requests for pork-barrel projects until after he was running for president, and then reminded viewers of that number again.
 
""He didn’t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932-million in requests,"" McCain said.
 
And in case you missed it the first two times, McCain cited the number yet again a few minutes later.
 
""And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932-million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.""
 
We should note that PolitiFact has

found

that while McCain has a well-deserved reputation in Washington as a pork-buster, his record is not entirely pristine. For example, McCain in 2006 co-sponsored legislation that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona to honor the late United States chief justice William Rehnquist.
 
But as for his claim in the debate: Is it accurate?
 
Obama, on his Web site, has listed every earmark he’s requested – but not necessarily received – as a U.S. senator. It totals $931.3-million.
 
McCain is also correct that it comes to nearly a million dollars for every day that Obama’s been in the United States Senate, provided you include just working days.
 
The math goes like this: Obama was elected in 2004 and took office January 3, 2005. Since then, there have been about 930 working days, as they are defined by most people, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, which would mean McCain would be completely right if he had specified working days.
 
Technically, Obama's been ""in Congress"" for more than 1,350 days, if you count weekends. So how many points do you take off for McCain not saying ""every

working

day""? Not many. We say this claim is Mostly True.

McCain flubs military history
","
Early in the first presidential debate, Sen. John McCain veered into military history during a discussion of the financial crisis.
 
To make a point about accountability, he relayed an anecdote about Dwight D. Eisenhower. Only McCain got the story wrong in a way that undermined his point.
 
After moderator Jim Lehrer pressed McCain on whether he would support the financial bailout package Congress is crafting, McCain said, ""I hope so, sure.""
 
Then he said: ""But there's also the issue of responsibility. You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and Allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation to the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow, we've lost that accountability.""
 
McCain went on to link Eisenhower and his letter to McCain's repeated calls in recent days that Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox resign for his role in the financial crisis.
 
McCain was almost certainly referring to

this note

, which Eisenhower, then the U.S. Army general commanding the Normandy assault, prepared and stuck in his wallet on June 5, 1944, the day before the invasion in case the mission failed.
 
It says: ""Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.""
 
A noble sentiment — but not a letter of resignation.
 
""That must be what McCain is referencing,"" said David Fitzpatrick, a military historian at the University of Michigan. ""I never heard that Eisenhower had prepared a letter of resignation. That would be incorrect.""
 
The invasion was a success and Eisenhower did not have to use the note.
 
McCain ought not use it either — at least not as an example of prewritten resignation letter. Though Eisenhower did intend to take responsibility for the failure, that's quite different from preparing to resign his generalship. We find this anecdote to be False.

Republicans weren't shut out
","
The public is skeptical of the massive Wall Street bailout plan pending on Capitol Hill. So during the first presidential debate, both candidates were reluctant to say precisely where they stood on the proposal that is likely to cost about $700-billion.


The same is true on Capitol Hill, where House Republicans sank a plan offered by a president from their own party, and offered one of their own that would include less taxpayer money. During the debate, John McCain complained that the House GOP members had been left out.
 
""I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that,"" McCain said. ""And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.""
 
But they were and are. If McCain's point is that Republicans have felt that Democrats – and President Bush – have tried to rush a deal, there's more evidence for that. When Democrats and President Bush claimed a deal was at hand on Sept. 25, 2008, House Minority Leader John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, said there was no deal. ""There may be a deal among some Democrats, but House Republicans are not a part of it,"" he said.


Soon, House Republicans revealed that they were pushing a rival plan that would offer government insurance to failing firms in place of Bush's strategy, which involves the government purchasing bad debts held by U.S. and foreign banks.


Charges and countercharges flew. Republicans said Democrats were trying to rush a deal and prevent McCain – who had suspended his campaign to return to Washington to participate in the negotiations – from helping to forge an agreement. Democrats said Republicans were delaying unnecessarily in order to allow McCain to score political points.


But later that day, as

Congressional Quarterly

reported, Boehner's tone had moderated. ""The speaker and I have worked together to try and craft a bipartisan plan that will pass the House,"" he said.


On its face, McCain's remark clearly is not accurate because Republicans were part of the discussion. But we'll give McCain a few points because it also is clear that Republicans didn't feel fully involved in negotiations because they expressed their frusration by killing the plan proposed by Bush. We'll rate it Barely True.
