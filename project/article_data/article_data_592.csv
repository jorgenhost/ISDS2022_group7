Walker: Tax cuts will exceed $8 billion if budget proposal passes
","While Wisconsin’s budget remains stalled in the Legislature, Gov. Scott Walker is counting on it to increase the total amount of tax cuts generated during his tenure by at least $3.3 billion. In a recent appearance on Jay Weber’s WISN (1130-AM) talk show, Walker claimed that tax cuts approved and those included in his budget proposal ""will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done."" This isn’t the first time the governor has boasted about tax cuts. As part of his 2014 re-election bid, as well as his unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid, Walker pledged to reduce the tax burden on Wisconsinites and Americans. In his January State of the State address, Walker touted that state taxes had been cut by a cumulative $4.7 billion since he took office. In 2015, we fact checked that $4.7 billion tax cut claim and found it to be on the money. Is Walker right about the $8 billion mark? Looking at the numbers In our 2015 item, we noted that the vast majority of the $4.7 billion in tax cuts came from the 2011 manufacturing and industry tax cut and a 2013 income and property tax cut. Walker’s new claim still hinges on those 2011 and 2013 tax cuts and since there is a longer period of time involved, the reduction from them is larger as well.   The new number comes from estimates by the Wisconsin State Budget Office. Walker’s office provided a copy of the spreadsheet he used to make his claim. Experts at the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau and the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance both looked over the numbers and consider them accurate. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said that the governor made a conservative estimate. The budget office’s spreadsheet indicates that tax cuts will amount to $8,826,601,340 through fiscal year 2019, meaning Walker gave himself about $800 million in wiggle room. The total includes proposed tax cuts of $500 million from the pending budget, but the bulk of the total comes from existing, ongoing cuts, specifically those related to manufacturing, agriculture and the income tax. Even if the $500 million in cuts is not passed in the final budget, projections suggest he could still reach the $8 billion figure. Whatever the final budget looks like, and by extension the total of tax cuts generated under Walker, hinge on a couple of caveats. One, the budget is still being negotiated, meaning the amount in additional tax cuts he’s seeking for the next two years could change. Walker originally sought $500 million in tax cuts for the upcoming budget and has said he’s willing to negotiate this amount in light of the impasse. Two, the numbers Walker is using are estimates, not final figures. To be sure, tax cuts make up one part of the budget picture. Walker’s budgets have historically included numerous, controversial cuts to education and other areas. However, the claim at hand strictly relates to tax cuts. Our rating Walker said tax cuts approved and those proposed in his pending state budget ""will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done."" The governor made a similar claim in 2015, which we rated True. His continued claims about the size of tax cuts remain on the money. Regardless of the budget passed, the state is on track to have generated more than $8 billion in tax cuts by the end of fiscal year 2019. We rate his claim True","[('News story, ""Walker promises to lower UW tuition, touts tax cuts"" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jan. 10, 2017', 'http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/10/walker-lay-out-agenda-ahead-potential-re-election-bid/96389408/'), ('News story, ""Gov.

MOSTLY TRUE: California’s taxes are 'among the highest in the nation'
"," In the video announcing his run for California governor, Republican Travis Allen said he wants to reduce the state’s crime rate and its high taxes. We recently fact-checked Allen’s claims on crime in the video. The Orange County state assemblyman earned a Mostly False for his statement that ""crime is on the rise"" in all the state’s major metros. We found he cherry-picked data from an uptick in crime in 2015 and ignored the state’s decades-long decline in crime which continued in early 2016. Given the importance of taxes in California, we also decided to examine Allen's claims on this topic. ""I’ve seen our taxes increase to be among the highest in the nation,"" Allen said in the campaign video on June 22, 2017. ""In California, we must get serious about cutting our taxes. Californians pay among the highest taxes in the entire nation.""  Allen makes his claim at about the 0:15 minute mark of the video above.  Was Allen right? Are California’s taxes really ""among the highest in the nation""? We set out on a fact check. Our research We decided to examine where California ranks in key tax categories, including income, sales and property taxes. Additionally, we looked at how California measures up in a more comprehensive category: Its overall state-local tax burden. We also spoke with several tax experts for some context on these rankings. They all said comparing tax rates is doable but messy, noting that states assess taxes in different ways. Allen’s campaign did not respond to our request for evidence to support his claim. Here’s what we found in each key tax category: Income tax California’s top tier income tax rate is the highest in the nation at 13.3 percent, according to the Tax Foundation and California Taxpayers Association. It’s the rate paid by Californians who earn more than $1 million annually. Maine had the second highest top rate at 10.15 percent, followed by Oregon’s 9.9 percent, as of Jan. 1, 2017. Several states have no income tax, including Nevada, Washington, Texas and Florida. Of course, only a fraction of Californians pay the top income tax rate, noted Annette Nellen, professor and director of the graduate tax program at San Jose State University. A recent Sacramento Bee analysis of state tax data found 61,000 households, or 0.4 percent of the state’s 16 million total, reported income of more than $1 million in 2014. ""This is a very small percentage of the population,"" Nellen said. ""Not everybody is paying that. So, if someone was to say we have really high taxes in California, sometimes that’s interpreted as everybody’s paying a really high tax when in California we also have a fairly high exemption for individuals and children which might cause some lower-income folks to not pay any California income tax at all, at least not directly."" Per capita, Californians pay $1,991 annually in state income taxes, which ranks fourth highest in the country, according to the Tax Foundation. Sales tax  While only a fraction pay the state’s top income tax rate, everyone who lives here or visits pays California’s highest-in-the-nation sales tax rate of 7.25 percent. Four states tie for the second-highest statewide sales tax rate, at 7 percent: Indiana, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Tennessee, according to the Tax Foundation. States with no sales tax include Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire and Delaware. When adding state and local sales taxes, California rank drops to 10th highest. This combined tax rate varies across the state. In some parts of Los Angeles County, for example, it tops 10 percent, said David Kline, a spokesman for the California Taxpayers Association. The association researches tax data and opposes what it calls unnecessary taxes. Property tax  Unlike California’s income and sales tax rates, the state's average effective property tax rate is among the lowest in the nation, at 0.72 percent, or 36th among states, according to the Tax Foundation. That’s due to voter approved Proposition 13, which limited property tax increases to no more than 2 percent per year. New Jersey had the highest property tax rate at more than 2.1 percent, according to a 2016 report by the Tax Foundation. Still, Kline said, property tax in California is compounded by additional taxes, such as parcel taxes and Mello-Roos assessments, or fees charged to property owners in a specific area to pay for public improvements such as streets and parks. ""Those can add hundreds or thousands of dollars every year,"" he added.  Total tax burden  In addition to ranking individual tax categories, the Tax Foundation produces a more comprehensive category it calls the State-Local Tax Burden. It measures the share of income in the state that goes to state and local taxes. California ranked sixth highest on this list at 11 percent. New Yorkers faced the highest burden at 12.7 percent, followed by Connecticut at 12.6 percent. Alaskans paid the smallest share of their income, 6.5 percent, in state and local taxes. We asked Joe Henchman, vice president of the Tax Foundation, about the accuracy of Allen’s claim that California’s taxes ""are among the highest in the nation."" ""I think it’s a fair comment to make,"" Henchman said. ""Unless you’re being really specific about a particular type of tax, California is usually at the high end of the states. It’s almost always in the top half of the states in terms of a tax or its burden or how much people pay. And it’s often in the Top 10."" Exceptions do exist, he said, such as California’s low taxes on wine (44th highest), spirits (40th) and beer (28th), compared with other states. Nellen, the San Jose State University tax professor, agreed California’s taxes are generally high and said Allen’s claim is mostly backed up by the facts. Growth and taxes In recent years, top Democrats in California have deflected criticism about the state’s high taxes by pointing to strong employment and GDP growth. Gov. Jerry Brown, for example, has repeatedly pointed to the more than 2 million jobs California has created since he returned to office in 2011. Allen has criticized Brown’s recent signing of a 12 cent per gallon increase in the state’s gas tax. That move is expected to make California’s gas tax second highest in the nation, behind Pennsylvania’s, once it goes into effect in Nov. 1, 2017. Henchman said, for now, California’s economy has succeeded despite it’s high taxes. ""Nobody moves to California because of taxes,"" he said. ""They move in spite of the taxes, because of other positive benefits. … There’s good weather, there’s Silicon Valley, there’s great universities, there’s Hollywood, etc., etc. ""Those, for a lot of people, make it worth paying the taxes, to a point,"" Henchman added. Our ruling Republican candidate for governor Travis Allen recently claimed California’s taxes are ""among the highest in the nation."" Allen’s statement is broad and needs clarification. But when looking at some of the most important tax categories, including income, sales and gasoline taxes, there’s a lot of truth to his claim. California has the highest top tier income tax and the highest state sales tax in the nation. It’s important to note that the top rate income tax is paid by only a fraction of households in the state, and that the sales tax rate drops to 10th in the nation when local and state sales taxes are examined state-by-state. Notably, it does not have one of the nation’s highest property tax rates, at 36th highest. Allen’s claim is accurate but needs this additional information. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. UPDATE: An earlier version of this fact check described California's property tax rate as 0.72 percent. We have clarified that this is the state's average effective property tax rate.

"['Crime', 'Florida', 'Rick Baker']","
Did crime in Midtown go up 30 percent in the last quarter?
","As Mayor Rick Kriseman boasts about low crime in St. Petersburg, his opponent, former Mayor Rick Baker is firing back with statistics of his own. During an interview with WFLA-Ch. 8, Baker criticized Kriseman’s efforts in Midtown, the area just south of downtown St. Petersburg. A large portion of undecided voters live in Midtown, making it a battleground in the St. Petersburg mayor’s race. The nonpartisan election will be held Aug. 29, 2017. ""Let’s get back to the Midtown area, which you brought up before. You’ve also criticized Kriseman for not doing enough for residents there. He says that crime is down by 6 percent and officers are more engaged in the community,"" WFLA-Ch. 8  anchor Paul Mueller said June 25. ""So, with that being said, what else would you do if elected?"" ""Well the Midtown crime is up by 30 percent the last quarter, so I don't know what statistics he’s looking at,"" Baker responded. His claim about crime going up made us wonder — what statistic is he looking at? As it turns out, Baker’s claim relies on shaky data. PolitiFact Florida reached out to the St. Petersburg Police Department for a quarterly breakdown of crime in Midtown. The department said they stopped validating the location of crimes by neighborhoods when the police department replaced its crime recording application in 2016. The old system was around 20 years old and failing. While the police department does record the location of calls for service, it does not include the specific neighborhood location on the validated data sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, because the FDLE does not record the data by specific address. Still, the department was able to provide a breakdown of crime in Midtown from 2001 to 2015 when it used the old system. The number of crimes in Midtown dropped significantly from 2009 to the end of 2015. But the police department was not able to provide crime data for 2016 and 2017 in Midtown, making it hard to assess the accuracy of Baker’s claim. When we told Baker campaign spokesperson Brigitta Shouppe about this, she provided  PolitiFact Florida with a breakdown of crime data throughout the city by the first quarters of every year. The breakdown included Midtown. It showed that crime in Midtown went up 30 percent in the first quarter of 2017 (January to March) in comparison to the first quarter of 2016 (January to March). The data includes homicides, forcible sex, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and automobile theft. The 30 percent increase means the number of incidents increased from 544 to 706, according to Baker’s data. The police department could not verify the 2016 and 2017 breakdown provided by Baker. It said the data presented was based on a ""working document,"" and was not ready for release due to the unsubstantiated numbers. Baker was vague about where the data came from, saying only that the police department provided it and that it came without disclaimers. We checked in with community advocates to see if they had noticed recent crime spikes. They told us that crime in Midtown is an ongoing issue of concern, but they had noticed no recent changes. There are a few problems with Baker’s numbers. First off, experts agreed that if the police department can’t verify the numbers presented by Baker, the data should be treated with caution. And, regardless of whether the data is accurate, experts said there are better practices to understand trends in crime. ""Generally speaking, most criminologists would agree that to understand what is driving crime, we need to examine long-term trends,"" said Lyndsay Boggess, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida. ""The social and economic conditions that lead to crime are complex and multi-faceted and slow to change."" Crime rates fluctuate so even if the increase is accurate in one three-month period, it’s not necessarily a cause for alarm. For example, in the previous quarterly comparison provided by Baker from 2015 to 2016, the Midtown neighborhood saw a 20 percent decrease in crime. If you go back even further, after a decade or so, every year with a first quarter increase in crime was followed by a decrease during the same months in the following year. ""The fact that the fluctuations across the years is fairly significant makes me wonder about the accuracy of the data,"" said Bill Bales, a professor in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University. So, we can’t say for certain whether Baker’s claim is accurate. The police department makes crime data accessible online that shows crimes counts for the city broken down by months, not just the first quarters of every month. During the New Channel 8 interview, the anchor mentioned that Kriseman said that crime had dropped 6 percent. The Kriseman campaign said that figure was in reference to the overall crime in St. Petersburg, not just Midtown. Kriseman’s figure is accurate if you look at the number of crimes that have occurred from 2013 to 2016. According to Uniform Crime Reporting statistics published by the FBI, there were 15,560 total crimes in 2013 (the last year of former Mayor Bill Foster’s term) and at the end of 2016 there were 14,531 total crimes. That’s a little more than a 6 percent drop. But like experts said, it’s better to look at rates, and the FBI breaks those down by violent crime (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) and property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.) As you can see, for the most part, property crime and violent crime rates trends have been down since the 1990s in St. Petersburg. Our ruling Baker said that crime in Midtown is up 30 percent in the last quarter. Baker says he got the statistics from the police, but he’s leaving out critical context. Most importantly, the St. Petersburg Police Department stopped validating data with neighborhood location at the end of 2015. The quarter-to-quarter comparison provided by Baker’s team relies on uncertain data and looks at a small time frame. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Interviews, Brigitta Shouppe, campaign spokeswoman for Rick Baker, June 30-July 7', 'http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/baybuzz/st-pete-poll-adjusts-numbers-in-mayors-race/2329020'), ('Interview, mayoral candidate Rick Baker, July 8, 2017', 'No link'), (""Email exchange, Benjamin Kirby, mayor's communications director, July 7"", 'http://wfla.com/2017/06/25/former-mayor-rick-baker-talks-about-running-for-his-old-office/'), ('Email exchange, Jacob Smith, mayor’s campaign manager, July 7', 'No link'), ('Interview, St. Petersburg Police Chief Tony Holloway, July 5, 2017', 'https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/RunCrimeJurisbyJurisLarge.cfm'), ('Interview, \xa0St. Petersburg Police Department spokesperson Yolanda Fernandez, July 5, 2017', 'No link'), ('Interviews, St. Petersburg Police Department Records and Evidentiary Services Division Manager Colleen Dunphy, June 29-July 5', 'http://police.stpete.org/community/crime-statistics.html'), ('Interview, James Myles of St. Petersburg is the executive director of Bethel Community Foundation Inc., July 10', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/jul/11/rick-baker/did-crime-go-30-percent-midtown-last-quarter/

Fake news story twists Paul Ryan’s words on poor people’s health care coverage
","A story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news. A June 28, 2017, post on Politicot.com ran under the headline, ""Paul Ryan: ‘22 million Americans choose to be poor, so it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy’."" Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The post started out with real comments Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., made on Fox & Friends on June 27 while discussing the Congressional Budget Office report for the Senate’s health care bill. ""What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won't buy it,"" Ryan said. ""So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want."" (We rated that Mostly False, because many of those people will not voluntarily lose coverage.) Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Fox’s Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. That’s where the story turned to fiction. ""Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it,"" Ryan is quoted. ""So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy."" Ryan didn’t say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryan’s office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes. Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as ""the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web."" The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece. Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here. The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But it isn’t always obvious that’s the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true — especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all. Ryan did discuss how the Senate’s proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor.

Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful! We’ll set aside the question of what ""everybody"" was talking about in Hamburg. A bigger issue is that Trump’s premise about Podesta, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair, gets the facts wrong on several counts. Trump claimed that Podesta denied handing over a DNC server to intelligence agencies, but Podesta never chaired the DNC, nor had any involvement in the DNC’s handling of their email server, according to DNC spokesperson Adrienne Watson. ""I had nothing to do with the Democratic National Committee — I chaired Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign,"" Podesta wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post. ""So there was no DNC server for me to refuse to give, and I was never asked for one."" The op-ed followed a seven-tweet backlash at Trump’s statement, where Podesta denied the claim and told Trump ""the Russians committed a crime when they stole my emails to help get you elected President."" 7/7 Dude, get your head in the game. You’re representing the US at the G20. Podesta was, however, a victim of the same phishing trick as the DNC, led by group of hackers that the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence linked to the Russian government. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,"" the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence wrote in a joint statement released on Oct. 7, 2016. ""The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,"" the statement added. Setting aside Podesta’s role, Trump is returning to an old talking point questioning the DNC’s cooperation with the intelligence community. In March 5, Trump tweeted: ""Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible?"" Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible? He tweeted a similar remark on March 21. ""What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?"" What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look? In his testimony in January on the cyber attacks, then-director of the FBI James Comey said the agency never got access to the machines themselves, but obtained access to the forensics from a review of the system performed by CrowdStrike, a third-party cybersecurity firm. ""We got the forensics from the pros that they hired which -- again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this my folks tell me was an appropriate substitute,"" Comey said. ""The DNC coordinated with the FBI and federal intelligence agencies and provided everything they requested, including copies of DNC servers,"" Watson said. She added that the copy contains the same information as the physical server. The FBI joined CrowdStrike’s efforts to boot Russia from the server, but then-Homeland Security Department secretary Jeh Johnson complained the DNC rebuffed their offer to help. This was because Russia was already out of their system by then. Trump's mentioning the CIA’s involvement came as a surprise to both Podesta and the DNC. ""The CIA has no role in domestic intelligence-gathering — in fact, it’s prohibited,"" Podesta wrote in his op-ed. ""The CIA would never ask anyone at the DNC for a server. Whether the FBI asked the DNC for access to a server, I don’t know, beyond what I’ve read."" According to Watson, the CIA never requested access to the email server. The CIA provided no comment, but notes on its website its mission is focused on overseas, rather than domestic, intelligence-gathering. We asked the White House for comment, but we didn't hear back with an on-the-record response.  Trump tweeted that ""everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA."" Trump’s premise here is wrong. Podesta had nothing to do with the DNC server because he didn’t work at the DNC; he worked for Clinton’s campaign. The DNC claimed they received no direct requests from the CIA, and the CIA did not comment. The DNC says it cooperated with the FBI, providing information on the server through a third-party vendor.The FBI provided no comment, but then-FBI director Comey said it was an appropriate substitute.

Richard Corcoran fails to prove claim that Miami judge Milton Hirsch 'constantly overturned'
","Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran disagreed with a ruling by a Miami judge that Florida’s updated ""stand your ground"" self-defense law is unconstitutional. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Milton Hirsch ruled that state legislators overstepped their authority in modifying the law earlier this year to force prosecutors to disprove a defendant’s self-defense claim at a pre-trial hearing. Any such change should have been crafted by the Florida Supreme Court rather than the state Legislature, he ruled. Hirsch’s July 3 ruling doesn’t apply statewide, but it does start the process that could ultimately lead to Florida Supreme Court review.   Corcoran, a Land O’Lakes Republican and lawyer, laid out his opposition to Hirsch’s ruling in three tweets: ""It is the role of the Legislature to write the laws that govern how Floridians may exercise their statutory and constitutional rights. The Florida House will continue to stand with ordinary citizens who exercise their right to self-defense. There's a reason this judge is constantly overturned. We look forward to this decision being reversed on appeal."" There's a reason this judge is constantly overturned. We look forward to this decision being reversed on appeal 3 https://t.co/emJlUmSt1l Corcoran’s spokesman provided no data about how often Hirsch is overturned. Instead, Fred Piccolo pointed to a handful of cases in which Hirsch had been overturned and one case that remains pending in appeals. ""The speaker used the term ‘constantly overturned’ -- which is not quantifiable,"" Piccolo said. ""But the insinuation is that the judge has been overturned on substantive/controversial issues often."" Hirsch has handled thousands of cases since he was elected in 2010. PolitiFact searched for Hirsch’s individual rulings in the Third District Court of Appeal and found that he was upheld about 160 times. We found that the appeals court overturned Hirsch six times. In six other cases he was upheld in part and reversed in part. (In a couple of other cases, the appeals court was critical of actions by Hirsch. The court disagreed with his ruling as a substitute judge in one case, and in another case the court said he should have granted a prosecutor’s motion to recuse himself.) (Hat tip to Carolina Bolado, a writer for Law 360, who looked at Hirsch’s appeals record first.) We sent a summary of our findings to a spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade courts, Eunice Sigler. She didn’t dispute our overall findings but offered caveats related to a couple of cases, including that in one case the appeals court reversed based upon a Florida Supreme Court decision that occurred after the judge ruled. We interviewed five law professors and all of them rejected the idea that Hirsch is ""constantly overturned."" Stetson law professor Charles Rose described Corcoran’s statement as ""scurrilous."" ""I don’t think there is any credible evidence that the judge is prone to being overturned,"" he said. ""A comment on how often a judge is overturned is an example of what we teach as ‘pivoting.’ When you are losing an argument you are making, you want to pivot and change the conversation."" The fact that a judge has been appealed doesn’t mean the judge is right or wrong, Rose said. There is a valuable purpose in the appeals process. ""If judges weren’t willing to be overturned, the law couldn’t grow and change to reflect society,"" he said. University of Florida professor Darren Lenard Hutchinson said it would be extremely rare for a trial judge's rulings to be ""constantly overturned."" ""Doctrines in federal and state courts often require appeals courts to extend deference to lower courts, particularly regarding findings of fact,"" he said. While judges and lawyers keep an eye on overturned cases, a more interesting question is whether a judge takes a stand on high-profile controversial legal issues, said Nova professor Megan Chaney. ""This just means he has the courage to do his job and force the appellate courts to clarify the law where it is unclear or potentially unconstitutional,"" she said. Piccolo pointed to an article in the Miami Herald that summarized some of Hirsch’s other high-profile rulings including some that had been overturned. Here is a summary: State vs. James Lacroix: In March, Hirsch ruled that Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez’s decision to allow county jails to hold undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation by federal agents was unconstitutional. The county is appealing. State vs. Gaiter: In 2016, Hirsch ruled that a new death-penalty sentencing structure was unconstitutional because it didn’t require a unanimous jury verdict. The Florida Supreme Court ruled the same months later in a separate case. State vs. Bailey: An attorney stole $700,000 from a trust account. Hirsch sentenced him to probation only. The court reversed Hirsch and called for the imposition of a prison term. State vs. Borrego: A prosecutor made a motion for Hirsch to recuse himself based on his comments about fingerprints in another case, but Hirsch suggested that the prosecutor file a motion to disqualify him. The appeals court ruled that Hirsch should have granted the prosecutor’s motion. Hall vs. Ryan: Hirsch, acting as a substitute judge, released a man convicted of child abuse accused of violating probation on his own recognizance on the condition that he stay away from a minor. The appeals court ruled that Hirsch didn’t have jurisdiction to revisit the presiding judge’s decision to hold the defendant in custody without bond. State vs. Washington: When a Tampa federal judge ruled in 2011 that Florida's drug law was unconstitutional, Hirsch was the only local state judge to follow suit, the Herald wrote. He tossed out more than two dozen cases, but Miami's appeals court later reversed Hirsch. Following Hirsch’s ruling in a ""stand your ground"" case, Corcoran tweeted ""There's a reason this judge is constantly overturned."" But Corcoran didn’t point to any data about how often Hirsch has been overturned after ruling in thousands of cases since 2010. Instead, Corcoran pointed to Hirsch’s rulings in six other cases. Corcoran is exaggerating when he suggests this handful of cases constitutes being ""constantly overturned."" We found Hirsch had been upheld about 160 times and overturned six times and then affirmed in part in another six cases. We rate this claim False.","[('Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran, First, second and third tweet about Miami-Dade Judge Milton Hirsch, July 3, 2017', 'https://twitter.com/richardcorcoran/status/881935212296499200'), ('Third District Court of Appeal, Search on website, Accessed July 7, 2017', 'No link'), ('Law 360 writer Carolina Bolado, Twitter, July 3, 2017', 'http://www.3dca.flcourts.org/'), ('Miami Herald, ""Miami judge rules Florida’s new Stand-Your-Ground law is unconstitutional,"" July 3, 2017', 'No link'), ('Miami Herald, ""Miami-Dade absentee ballot law upheld by court,"" Oct. 15, 2014', 'https://twitter.com/CarolinaBolado/status/881951013590224899'), ('Interview, Eunice Sigler, Miami-Dade 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida spokeswoman, July 5, 2017', 'No link'), ('Interview, Fred Piccolo, Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran spokesman, July 7, 2017', 'http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article159394094.html'), (""Interview, Darren Lenard Hutchinson, Stephen C.

"['Health Care', 'Pennsylvania', 'Bob Casey']","
In Trumpcare fight, Casey overstates GOP’s potential Medicaid cuts to PA schools
","U.S. Sen. Bob Casey says the Senate GOP’s healthcare plan could devastate already cash-strapped public schools that receive Medicaid reimbursements for programs benefiting poor children and students with disabilities. Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has been outspoken on social media against the Senate GOP plan, tweeted last week: ""The GOP health care proposal would slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools."" But Casey didn’t specify in the tweet where that number came from, and Republican officials say their bill doesn’t target vulnerable populations like children with disabilities. So what’s the deal? First, a little background on the Medicaid funding that schools receive. Since 1988, schools can register with the federal government as Medicaid providers and receive reimbursements, similar to hospitals. For the last 30 years, Medicaid reimbursements subsidized primary or preventive services at schools — think hearing and vision tests — for children already covered by Medicaid under the School Based ACCESS Program. It’s also been used to fund special education and services to children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. Now, as the Senate GOP is floating its healthcare plan (A.K.A. the Better Care Reconciliation Act), some school administrators and advocacy groups say they’re concerned cuts to Medicaid could impact their ability to provide services to both children living in poverty and children with disabilities. About $4 billion in Medicaid funding goes to schools annually. Under the GOP’s most recent plan, Medicaid spending would be 26 percent lower in 2026 than it would be under the agency’s extended baseline, and the gap would widen to about 35 percent in 2036, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO estimated that overall Medicaid spending would drop by $772 billion between 2017 and 2026 under the BCRA. The vast majority of that reduction, per the CBO, would come from three key provisions: The repeal of the individual mandate, a reduction in the federal matching rate for adults covered by Medicaid after it was expanded under the Affordable Care Act and a per capita cap on Medicaid payments beginning in 2020. This reduction in Medicaid spending is likely to push more financial responsibility onto states and municipalities in the coming decade, should the bill become law as is. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, the School Superintendents Association and dozens of related groups wrote: ""Under the per-capita caps included in the BCRA, health care will be rationed and schools will be forced to compete with other critical health care providers — hospitals, physicians, and clinics — that serve Medicaid-eligible children."" So now we come back to Casey, who claimed in a tweet that the GOP’s healthcare plan would ""slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools."" Casey’s spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoads said the figure came from the Department of Health and Human Services, and provided a spreadsheet that indicated how much each Pennsylvania school district received from Medicaid in the 2014-15 fiscal year. For example, the School District of Philadelphia, which has an annual budget of about $2.5 billion, received about $10.9 million that year in total reimbursement for direct claims and administration. In total in fiscal year 2014-15, Pennsylvania schools received about $134.5 million, according to the figures provided by Casey’s office. That’s the key figure referred to in the tweet. In the same document was a second column titled: ""How much money would be lost from a 30 percent cut."" That column indicates Pennsylvania schools could stand to lose $40.3 million per year, with the School District of Philadelphia losing about $3.3 million, or less than 0.2 percent of its total budget. (The District largely declined to comment, though a spokesman said officials are ""monitoring the proposed legislation and will assess the impact when there is a final version for consideration."") The 30 percent figure cited by Casey's office came from a report published by the School Superintendents Association. Here's their rationale from the report: ""Republicans have expressed a desire to reduce federal Medicaid spending by 25 percent by distributing Medicaid funding through a block-grant or a per-capita cap, which would shift costs to states. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the block grant like the one proposed in the House 2017 budget would cut Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over a decade, which would be the equivalent in 2026 of cutting away one-third of the program’s budget. Other estimates include a proposed cut closer to 30 percent or 35 percent in the long-term since it encompasses a 25 percent cut over 10 years on top of the cuts that would occur with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act."" The report was released in January, several months before the Senate GOP unveiled its healthcare plan. Our ruling In a tweet, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said: ""The GOP health care proposal would slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools."" His office pointed to data that indicated schools in the state received a total of $134.5 million in the 2014-15 fiscal year in Medicaid reimbursements for School Based ACCESS services. First off, $134.5 million is not ""more than"" $135 million. Beyond that, Casey’s tweet implies all $135 million in Medicaid reimbursements to schools would be cut under the GOP healthcare plan. But there is no provision in the GOP healthcare bill that specifically cuts Medicaid funding to schools. Overall, the CBO estimates Medicaid spending would decrease by about 26 percent by 2026, meaning a statewide cut of $35.1 million to schools might have been a more reasonable estimate. But even that cut wouldn’t be guaranteed under this plan and would occur if states chose to reduce Medicaid reimbursements to school districts because of cuts in funding from the federal government. We rate the claim False.","[('Email interview. Jacklin Rhoads, spokeswoman for Sen. Bob Casey.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Chris Murphy']","
Is Donald Trump responsible for rising health insurance premiums, as Chris Murphy said?
","Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., blamed President Donald Trump for insurance rate hikes through the administration’s attempts to weaken the Affordable Care Act. ""It all started when he issued an executive order … that commanded all federal agencies to start undermining the ACA, and his agencies listened,"" Murphy said in the June 26 video. ""The IRS decided to stop enforcing the individual mandate that was the underpinning of the ACA. That has resulted in insurance companies all across the country jacking their rates up, explicitly because they don't believe that healthy people will buy insurance."" Insurance rates have indeed been on the rise, but we wondered whether it could all be traced back to the IRS and a weakened enforcement of the individual mandate. We found that Trump has continued the weak enforcement of the individual mandate in place during the Obama administration, freezing a change that was set to begin with the 2016 tax year. But his party’s rhetoric on repealing the Affordable Care Act, as well as other issues, have been linked to premium rate increases. The IRS is the agency tasked with enforcing the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which requires most individuals to obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty for going without. The mandate was designed to encourage healthy people to enter the risk pool and thus lower insurance costs. When people file their individual income tax returns, they must indicate their health insurance coverage or list a waiver or exemption. Otherwise, they must pay the penalty for lacking coverage. For the 2016 tax year, those who weren’t covered had to pay 2.5 percent of taxable income or $695, whichever was higher. Those tax returns that failed to do any of these three actions were considered ""silent returns,"" and elicited a letter from the IRS alerting the taxpayer of the issue. ""Most of the time the taxpayer didn’t get back, and there was nothing else the IRS could do,"" said Chris Condeluci, a former Republican tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee when the Affordable Care Act was written. President Barack Obama instructed the IRS to stop processing silent returns beginning with 2016 tax filings to punish taxpayers expecting a refund who failed to comply with the law. Trump’s executive order scrapped that change. ""Processing silent returns means that taxpayer returns are not systematically rejected by the IRS at the time of filing, allowing the returns to be processed and minimizing burden on taxpayers, including those expecting a refund,"" the IRS said in a Feb. 15 press release. ""When the IRS has questions about a tax return, taxpayers may receive follow-up questions and correspondence at a future date, after the filing process is completed. This is similar to how we handled this in previous years, and this reflects the normal IRS post-filing compliance procedures that we follow."" Murphy’s team pointed us to that announcement when we asked for evidence for Murphy’s statement. Trump’s order did cause the IRS to change direction internally, but outwardly, the agency is enforcing the same policy. ""They’re adhering to the same enforcement policy as the Obama administration did. At the end of the day it’s merely business as usual when it comes to the IRS,"" Condeluci added. The IRS may have maintained the status quo, but the announcement still made an impact. ""It was noted by the actuaries who calculate rates. But it’s another element in a complex mosaic in factors that lead to rate increases,"" said Dan Mendelson, the president of Avalere, a health care consulting firm. Then there’s Congress. Regardless of the Trump administration’s impact on the IRS, Congress is working to effectively scrap the individual mandate. The House Committee on Appropriations has drafted a bill that would terminate the tax penalty on those who go without insurance, which the House Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government approved on June 29. Insurance rates for the most popular type of exchange plan are an average of 18 percent higher than last year, according to Avalere. A combination of medical inflation and political volatility account for the hike, although it’s hard to apportion the causes of the rate increases. The individual mandate isn’t the only factor, though. ""Although the mandate is a reason for higher premiums for next year, it's probably not the main reason,"" said Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University’s Graduate School of Public Service. ""The main reason is uncertainty about whether Congress will fund the ACA’s cost-sharing reductions."" That's a different animal. Congress is weighing whether to continue funding the $8 billion pool of cost-sharing reduction subsidies under the ACA. In 2010, the House filed a lawsuit arguing the subsidies were illegal, and the Trump administration has not clarified whether it will defend them in court. The bipartisan budget bill passed late June did not include those funds. ""This is one of the larger premium hikes because there's a lot of uncertainty about what’s going to happen to the insurance marketplace,"" said Claire Brindis, the director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Whenever insurance companies feel like there's going to be dramatic changes, they get skittish about profit margins."" Murphy said that insurance companies are jacking up their rates because of the IRS’ weakened enforcement of the individual mandate under Trump. That’s an exaggeration. The Trump administration has continued the same policies as Obama. A mandate to buy insurance is in place, but there’s not much punishment for those who refused to comply. Murphy suggested that the individual mandate itself was key in keeping insurance rates low. In theory, the requirement invites greater diversity to the health insurance risk pool, but the IRS never had sufficient tools at its disposal to enforce it effectively. Blaming rate increases on the IRS is too simplistic, particularly as there is no evidence of a direct link. A number of other factors are at play, including uncertainty around future health care subsidies. Because there has been little outward change in the IRS enforcement policies, we rate this statement Mostly False.","[('Facebook, NowThis Politics, June 26, 2017', 'https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1605783219453162/'), ('Email interview with Chris Harris, communications director for Chris Murphy, July 3, 2017', 'No link'), ('Forbes, ""IRS Softens On Obamacare Reporting Requirements After Trump Executive Order,"" Feb. 16, 2017', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2017/02/16/irs-softens-on-obamacare-reporting-requirements-after-trump-executive-order/#3c179484a3cb'), ('WhiteHouse.gov, ""Executive Order Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal,"" Jan. 20, 2017', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Anthony Burke, public affairs specialist at the IRS, July 3, 2017', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/2/executive-order-minimizing-economic-burden-patient-protection-and'), ('IRS, ""Individual Shared Responsibility Provision,"" Feb. 15, 2017', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Alleigh Marre, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, July 3, 2017', 'https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/individual-shared-responsibility-provision'), ('Phone interview with Chris Condeluci, principal of CC Law & Policy PLLC and former tax and benefits counsel to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, July 5, 2017', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Dan Mendelson, the president of Avalere, a health care consulting firm, July 5, 2017', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/us/politics/congress-moves-to-stop-irs-from-enforcing-health-law-mandate.html?_r=0'), ('Email interview with Craig Palosky, director of communications for the Kaiser Family Foundation, July 5, 2017', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Congress moves to stop IRS from enforcing health law mandate,"" July 3, 2017', 'http://avalere.com/expertise/managed-care/insights/first-look-initial-rate-filings-show-premium-increases-decreased-participat'), ('Avalere, ""Premium Increases and Fewer Insurers Participating Expected in Exchange Market in 2018,"" June 19, 2017', 'No link'), ('Vox.com, ""The Trump administration is making Obamacare more expensive,"" May 8, 2017', 'https://www.vox.com/2017/5/8/15563448/trump-insurance-premiums-2018'), ('Email interview with Sherry Glied, dean of New York University’s Graduate School of Public Service, July 3, 2017', 'No link'), ('Politico, ""Trump still enforcing Obamacare mandate,"" May 3, 2017', 'http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/03/trump-obamacare-mandate-enforcement-237937'), ('Phone interview with Claire Brindis, the director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco, July 6, 2017', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/jul/10/chris-murphy/donald-trump-responsible-rising-health-insurance-p/

Donald Trump says Barack Obama 'did nothing' about Russia prior to Election Day
","President Donald Trump on an overseas trip criticized former President Barack Obama, saying he ""did nothing"" about Russia before the 2016 presidential election. ""Now, the thing I have to mention is that Barack Obama, when he was president, found out about this, in terms of if it were Russia, found out about it in August,"" Trump said during a July 6 press conference in Poland. ""Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it."" People can argue that the Obama administration didn’t do enough to immediately crack down on Russia for meddling in the election. But Trump’s statement that Obama ""did nothing"" in the months leading up to Nov. 8 goes too far. The Obama administration learned in summer 2016 that election-related hacks could be traced back to the Russian government. Soon after, at the September G20 Summit in China, Obama personally confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin and told him to back off. Then-CIA Director John Brennan gave a similar warning to his Russian counterpart, Federal Security Bureau Director Alexander Bortnikov, during an August phone call. On Oct. 7, the Obama administration publicly identified Russia for the first time as being behind election-related hacks, issuing a joint statement from Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence. In the days following that statement, Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Vice President Joe Biden said the administration was considering options for a ""proportional"" response. Also, throughout August and up through the election, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson encouraged state-level election officials, through official statements and phone calls, to protect voting-related systems from cyber intrusions. However, the Obama administration took its most significant actions against Russia after Nov. 8. In late December, Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected intelligence agents to leave the United States, and he also imposed narrow sanctions on some Russian individuals and organizations. ""While I don’t think it’s fair to say that the administration ‘did nothing,’ their actions were fairly minimal prior to Nov 8,"" said Emma Ashford, an international security expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Ashford and a couple other experts in U.S.-Russia relations told us that the Obama administration felt like it had few options prior to the election because of the political climate. The Obama administration likely waited until after the election to take any truly punitive measures because they ""wanted to avoid the appearance of interfering in the election, and because they felt it was probably up to the next administration to deal with this policy problem,"" Ashford said. The White House had to consider the fact that acknowledging Russia’s involvement could actually help Russia get closer to its goal of delegitimizing the election, said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. And there was also the possibility that retaliating could provoke Russia to take more action against the United States in a variety of arenas, including Syria. Herrera added that it’s quite possible the Obama administration and intelligence community took additional action against Russia that the public doesn’t know about because it’s classified. In hindsight, knowing how the Russia storyline has played out over the past few months, ""it might have been better to call out Russia for hacking a bit sooner, but at the time I think the Obama administration tried to be responsible,"" she said. Trump said that Obama found out about Russia ""in August. Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it."" The Obama administration did not sit idle while Russia interfered in the election, as Trump makes it seem. The administration publicly named the Russian government as the culprit, confronted Putin in person, and worked to secure the country’s election infrastructure — all while the intelligence agencies investigated the issue. That said, Obama waited until December, after the election, to take any public, punitive measures against Putin, when he kicked out diplomats and imposed sanctions. Trump’s statement contains a grain of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.","[('CQ, ""President Donald Trump and Poland President Andrzej Duda Hold Joint Question and Answer Session, Warsaw, Poland,"" July 6, 2017', 'https://ge.usembassy.gov/press-conference-president/'), ('US Embassy in Georgia, Obama press conference, Dec. 16, 2016', 'No link'), ('ODNI, joint statement with DHS, Oct. 7, 2016', 'https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2016/item/1635-joint-dhs-and-odni-election-security-statement'), ('FactCheck.org, ""Trump Misleads on Russia Hacking,"" July 7, 2017', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Obama Considers ‘Proportional’ Response to Russian Hacking in U.S. Election,"" Oct. 11, 2017', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/trump-misleads-russia-hacking/'), ('New York Times, ""Obama Strikes Back at Russia for Election Hacking,"" Dec. 29, 2016', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Ex-C.I.A.

Stipends for vice chairs in State Senate is new practice, not old
","A recent uproar in Albany centered on how eight New York state senators, since 2015, have been paid stipends worth thousands of dollars for committee chairmanships they do not hold. Diane Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, called the practice business as usual in the Senate. ""In Albany there seems to be an obsession with something that has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades,"" Savino said in an interview on NY1, Charter's 24-hour news channel in New York City. Is Savino right that this has been going on for decades? How senators are paid Each Senate leadership position includes a stipend on top of a senator’s $79,500 salary. Stipends range from $9,000 for lower leadership posts to the $41,500 stipend collected by Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan. Committee chairs receive stipends. Vice chairs do not. A senator can receive only one stipend. Senate staffers send documents to the New York State Comptroller’s Office each year listing the leadership position for which each senator should be paid his or her stipend. PolitiFact New York obtained the documents through Freedom of Information requests for each year starting in 2006. The Comptroller’s Office keeps the documents for only five years, so it  provided documents from 2012 to this year. The Senate provided documents from 2006 through 2011. The documents show the practice of giving a committee chair’s stipend to a different member of that committee did not start until 2015. The stipends went to the chairs from 2006 through 2014, unless the chair was paid for a different leadership position. The chair’s stipend was not paid to anyone in those cases. Two lawmakers were paid for committee chairmanships they did not hold in 2015 and 2016. Sen. David Valesky was paid the $15,000 stipend of Health Committee Chairman Kemp Hannon. At the time, Hannon collected a $25,000 stipend as assistant majority leader on conference operations. Sen. Andrew Lanza was paid the $18,000 stipend of Codes Committee Chairman Michael Nozzolio, who received $22,000 as the Senate’s majority whip. Valesky and Lanza were listed as vice chairs of the committees. The practice widened in 2017, when six senators were paid for chairmanships they did not hold. Each, except Sen. Patricia Ritchie, was listed as vice chair of the respective committee. Savino received the $18,000 stipend of the Codes Committee chair this year. Lanza, who now chairs the Codes committee, received a $19,500 stipend as assistant senate majority whip. Ritchie, who chairs the Agriculture Committee, was instead paid the Health Committee chair’s stipend this year — a $2,500 increase. Ritchie is listed as deputy vice chair of the Health Committee. Sen. Thomas O’Mara was paid $15,000 as vice chairman of the Transportation Committee. O’Mara otherwise would have received a $12,500 stipend as the Environmental Conservation Committee chairman. Sen. Patrick Gallivan of Elma received $18,000 as vice chairman of the Education Committee, $5,500 more than he would have been be paid for chairing the Crime Victims, Crime, and Correction Committee. Sen. Pam Helming would have received a $12,500 stipend as vice chairwoman of the Crime Victims Committee, the amount Gallivan would have been paid had he not collected the $18,000 from his Education Committee post. Helming decided not to accept the payment. Sen. Jose Peralta, in a twist, took a pay cut. He was paid $12,500 this year as vice chairman of the Energy and Telecommunications Committee. Documents show he was paid $14,500 as the Senate’s minority whip last year, a post he no longer holds. Savino’s view Savino’s spokesperson said the senator was talking about granting stipends to members in general, and not referring specifically to committee vice chairs taking the stipends left available by their committee chairs who took stipends from elsewhere. Stipends have been paid to members for decades. The Legislature started paying stipends to committee chairs in 1976. But Savino’s statement came in reply to an interviewer's question about the stipends going to vice chairs. Viewers who watched the interview could not be expected to understand her comment as her spokesperson said it was intended. Our ruling Savino said the practice of giving a committee chairman’s stipend to the vice chair in the State Senate has been ""a legislative practice for decades."" Records from the state Comptroller’s Office indicate otherwise. The practice did not happen any time in the last decade. It started in 2015. Records do not support Savino’s statement. We rate it False. EDITOR'S NOTE - UPDATE Savino's office issued a statement about our story after publication on July 10. ""It’s amazing that an outlet which calls itself Politifact could take liberties with the truth and distort my words based on their ‘perception’ of an interview. Perception is not fact it is opinion, and the truth is that the fragment they plucked from my full statement is as true today as it was when I said it: The practice of the Senate issuing stipends to senators has been a legislative practice for decades. I never said vice chairs were, though they are certainly entitled to under the legislative law. In fact, every senator in our house is entitled to one allowance including every senator in the minority,"" Savino said in the statement. For context, here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview we fact-checked:  ERROL LOUIS: For over a week now we’ve been telling you about the controversy involving stipends paid to state senators for positions they do not technically hold. Critics have denounced the practice but Republicans and Independent Democratic Conference leaders say it’s much ado about nothing. My first guest tonight is one of those senators. Democrat Diane Savino is a member of the IDC. She represents parts of Staten Island and southern Brooklyn and she got her stipend as role of vice chair of the senate codes committee. Welcome to the program, thanks for coming back down from Albany. SAVINO: Thanks for having me Errol, how are you? ERROL LOUIS: Oh I’m very good thanks. Tell me what a Vice Chair does. What’s the idea? SAVINO: Well first I want to just reflect on how you opened this. For the past week apparently the Albany press corps has been obsessed with this. When you look at what’s happening in the world, it’s almost as if the world is going to hell in a handbasket. The president is on the verge of being accused of possible crimes where they’re talking about impeachment, the stock market is collapsing today, but yet in Albany there seems to be an obsession with something that has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades. And in fact when there was a question brought up about it, legal memos were presented and offered to the press to verify that was has been done has been consistent with legislative law and legislative practice for decades, the comptroller’s office verified that that is in fact in legislative law and has been practiced for decades. So, I am mystified as to what the obsession is. Our ruling does not change.","[('Savino interview: ""NY1 Online: Stipend Saga; Hearing from the IDC"", May 17, 2017, NY1', 'http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/albany-newsmakers/2017/05/17/ny1-online--stipend-saga--hearing-from-the-idc.html'), ('Email conversation with Candice Giove, spokesperson for Savino', 'No link'), ('Senate payroll certifications from the New York state comptroller’s office obtained through a Freedom of Information Request, June 6, 2017', 'http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2015/01/senate-republicans-name-new-committee-chairs-019071'), ('Senate payroll certifications from the New York state senate obtained through a Freedom of Information Request, June 14, 2017', 'No link'), ('2006 - 2014 committee chairs found in the State of New York Legislative Digest from those years, published by the New York state Legislative Bill Drafting Commission, and the New York State Red Book', 'https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-announces-legislative-committee-chairs'), ('2015 Senate Committee Chairs, POLITICO New York, Jan. 22, 2015', 'No link'), ('2016 Senate Committee Chairs, New York Senate, announced Jan. 7, 2016', 'https://www.nysenate.gov/senators-committees'), ('2017 Senate Committee Chairs, New York Senate website', 'No link'), ('Stipend positions and amounts listed under New York state Legislative Law § 5-a', 'http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:'), ('Email interview with Kristin O’Neill, Assistant Director of the Committee on Open Government (Dept. of State)', 'No link'), ('""A Semi-Quiet Game Of Musical Chairmanships,"" June 22, 2015, State of Politics', 'http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2015/06/a-semi-quiet-game-of-musical-chairmanships/'), ('""Stipends for State Senators Are Under Investigation"", May 18, 2017, New York Times', 'No link'), ('""For Group of Breakaway Democrats in New York, It Pays to Be No. 2"", May 9, 2017, New York Times', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/nyregion/state-senate-committee-stipends-investigation.html'), ('""Stipend Scandal Fuels Divide Among New York’s Democratic State Senators"", May 23, 2017, New York Times', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/jul/10/diane-savino/stipends-vice-chairs-state-senate-new-practice-not/

Pat Toomey says ‘radical’ Philly is an ‘extremely dangerous’ sanctuary city; Is it?
","The always controversial topic of sanctuary cities has come up yet again. This time, it was U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania discussing them during an invitation-only, televised ""town hall"" with eight constituents Wednesday. ""Sanctuary cities are extremely dangerous,"" Toomey said. ""Philadelphia is one of the most radical sanctuary cities in the country."" Are they really ""extremely dangerous?"" PolitiFact Pennsylvania has tackled statements about sanctuary cities before from former Philly GOP chief Joe DeFelice, Braddock Mayor John Fetterman and even Toomey. Remember, sanctuary cities are essentially local jurisdictions that to some extent decline to either communicate with federal immigration officials or honor their detainer requests. This one’s a little different from the previous fact-checks but contains similar characteristics. We’ll start with Toomey’s explanation for the statement. His staffers said the senator believes sanctuary cities pose ""real danger"" and gave multiple examples of incidents in which immigrants ICE wanted detained were released and went on to commit violent crimes. These examples included the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco and Marilyn Pharis, a Southern California woman. They said sanctuary policies pose dangers in the same way loaded weapons are dangerous in the hands of a convicted criminal or someone who is mentally ill. Toomey’s staff had two officials affiliated with law enforcement send emails advocating for the Senator’s claim to PolitiFact Pennsylvania. We also reached out to the Center for Immigration Studies, which has been critical of sanctuary policies and has a motto of ""low immigration, pro immigrant."" Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, referred to her report tracking 8,000 people released despite ICE detainer requests and found about 25 percent of them went on to commit future crimes. ""These are crimes that would have been prevented, at least in the United States,"" she said, ""if the sanctuary policy had not interfered with ICE doing its job."" Yet despite the anecdotes and Vaughan’s report, no conclusive study has shown higher crime rates as a result of a sanctuary city policy. In 2016, researchers from the University of California-Riverside and Highline College in Washington matched sanctuary cities versus those without any sanctuary policy and found the policies had no statistically significant effect on crime, meaning they didn’t lead to higher or lower crime rates. ""This is something Trump was doing where they’re citing isolated examples of crimes as the norm for sanctuary cities,"" said Ben Gonzalez-O’Brien, a Highline College professor who worked on the study. ""…Blaming it on the policies themselves isn’t really relevant. Sanctuary city policies don’t lead to more crime."" The left-leaning Center for American Progress released a study showing counties with sanctuary policies had lower crimes rates than those that didn’t and also had stronger economies. In 2016, the first full year Philadelphia was a sanctuary city after Mayor Jim Kenney’s executive order, Philadelphia had its lowest property crime rate since 1971 and its lowest violent crime rate since 1979. ""This notion that sanctuary cities are dangerous is really unfounded and politically motivated,"" said Lena Graber, a staff attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. Our Ruling Pat Toomey said at a televised town hall, ""Sanctuary cities are extremely dangerous."" Despite several examples of crimes being committed by people ICE wanted detained but were released, no evidence has been produced to prove sanctuary cities are dangerous because of the policy. In fact, one study from last year showed sanctuary city policies have no statistically significant effect on crime. Neither Toomey, nor any study has shown sanctuary cities are measurably dangerous. We rule the claim Mostly False.","[('News article, ""Activists cry cowardice as Republican senators shut doors to healthcare town halls,""\xa0Guardian, July 5, 2017.', 'https://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jan/31/joe-defelice/phillys-sanctuary-city-status-putting-residents-da/'), ('News article, ""Is Philly’s sanctuary city status putting residents in danger?""\xa0PolitiFact PA, January 31, 2017.', 'No link'), ('News article, ""Impossible to check: John Fetterman’s claim that sanctuary cities are safer,""\xa0PolitiFact PA, February 29, 2016.', 'https://billypenn.com/2016/02/29/impossible-to-check-john-fettermans-claim-that-sanctuary-cities-are-safer/'), ('News article, ""Kenney blasts Toomey’s fearmongering around sanctuary city policy, but here’s the thing,""\xa0PolitiFact PA, July 8, 2016.', 'No link'), ('Phone interview, Ben Gonzalez-O’Brien, July 7, 2017.', 'https://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jul/08/pat-toomey/kenney-blasts-pat-toomeys-fearmongering-around-san/'), ('Phone interview, Lena Graber, July 7, 2017.', 'No link'), ('Phone interview, Jessica Vaughan, July 7, 2017.', 'https://cis.org/Rejecting-Detainers-Endangering-Communities'), ('Phone interview, Toomey staff, July 7, 2017.', 'No link'), ('Study, ""Rejecting Retainers, Endangering Communities,"" Center for Immigration Studies, July 13, 2015.', 'http://www.collingwoodresearch.com/uploads/8/3/6/0/8360930/shelter_nopols_blind.pdf'), ('Study, ""The Politics of Refuge: Sanctuary Cities, Crime and Undocumented Immigration,"" Collingwood Research, August 16, 2016.', 'No link'), ('Study, ""The Effects of Sanctuary Policies on Crime and the Economy,"" Center for American Progress, January 26, 2017.', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/')]",/factchecks/2017/jul/08/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-radical-philly-extremely-dangerous/

Hassan says Gorsuch should be held to a 60-vote threshold for confirmation
","New Hampshire’s Sen. Maggie Hassan is the latest Senate Democrat to claim that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch should be held to a 60 vote-standard in order to be confirmed. In a letter she wrote on March 28 explaining why she would vote against Gorsuch, Hassan referred to ""the traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees."" So is 60 votes the ""traditional"" magic number that Supreme Court nominees need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate? In reality, Gorsuch, like all other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate. And superficially at least, the idea of a 60-vote threshold would seem to be contradicted by the experiences of Clarence Thomas, nominated in 1991 and confirmed on a 52-48 vote, and Samuel Alito, nominated in 2006 and confirmed on a 58-42 vote. However, Senate procedure is complicated, leading to misunderstandings. So let’s walk through the process. How confirmation works First, a nominee must testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Gorsuch did last week. Once the committee passes the nomination -- and the Republican-led committee is expected to easily clear Gorsuch -- it goes to the full Senate. The process requires the Senate majority leader to take the chamber into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. There, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee, or in the case of an objection, would need to invoke cloture, the process to end debate and force a vote. Under a cloture vote, the Senate agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. If Senate Democrats filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination, McConnell would need to invoke cloture. Today, there are 52 Republican senators, so under current rules, the Republicans would need eight Democrats to join them to reach the cloture threshold. That’s a difficult challenge in today’s polarized Congress. If there aren’t enough votes for cloture, McConnell could choose to ""go nuclear"" - that is, suspend the rules about how many votes Gorsuch would need to end the filibuster, changing it to a simple majority. (Here’s a more detailed discussion of the ""nuclear option."") The 60-vote talking point Given the partisan combat over Gorsuch’s nomination, the ""60-vote threshold"" has become a widely repeated Democratic talking point. When we asked Hassan’s staff to clarify her statement about the ""traditional 60-vote threshold,"" they referred PolitiFact New Hampshire to a list of prior Supreme Court nominees, saying that every one confirmed to the Supreme Court since the Eisenhower administration except for two (Alito and Thomas) either received ""unanimous support or has met the sixty vote threshold."" ""This is the traditional 60 vote threshold that Senator Hassan believes should be maintained,"" said Hassan’s spokeswoman Meira Bernstein. The problem for Democrats who make this argument is that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee and taking a cloture vote is far from ""traditional"" in Supreme Court nominations. In fact, it’s only happened four times in modern history, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker. The chamber voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006, and it did the same in 1968, 1971 and 1986. PolitiFact and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked skeptically on claims about the 60-vote standard, including comments by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Bernie Sanders I-Vt., referring to a requirement or a standard of 60 votes. Both of President Barack Obama’s nominees won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-31, and confirmed Elena Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010. However, while the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Hassan’s argument that confirmations require 60 votes, it’s not that simple. Those nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. Even though the margins were greater, the final confirmations required only 51 votes. Our ruling Hassan said that there is a ""traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees."" Most Supreme Court nominees have indeed reached 60 votes. But not all have, and the official standard remains 50 percent plus one, not 60. And while a 60-vote supermajority for cloture is often required these days for much of the Senate’s business, filing for cloture is actually the exception, not the rule, where recent Supreme Court nominations are concerned. Cloture votes have been required in only four of the 23 confirmations since the Eisenhower Administration. This calls into question Hassan’s use of the term ""traditional."" We rate the statement Mostly False.","[('PolitiFact Illinois, Durbin oversimplifies Supreme Court voting process, February 9th, 2017', 'https://www.politifact.com/illinois/statements/2017/feb/09/richard-durbin/durbin-oversimplifies-supreme-court-voting-process/'), ('Washington Post Fact Checker, Sanders’s convoluted claim that Democrats are not trying to filibuster Gorsuch, March 29, 2017', 'No link'), ('Washington Post Fact Checker, Senate Democrats’ misleading language on a 60-vote ‘standard’ for Supreme Court nominees, February 2, 2017', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/02/02/senate-democrats-misleading-language-on-a-60-vote-standard-for-supremer-court-nominees/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.ff7418b0876f'), ('TIME, Democrats Say Supreme Court Nominees Need 60 Votes.

But Wagner, a state senator from York in the midst of a run for governor, seemed this week to cite a more celestial reason why things are getting a little warmer while he was laying out policy proposals related to natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania. In a talk with natural gas advocates in Harrisburg, Wagner said climate change is probably happening, but the government should nevertheless pare down restrictive regulations on the natural gas drilling industry. ""I haven’t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth,"" Wagner said, according to State Impact, an NPR affiliate. ""We’re moving closer to the sun."" He added, ""We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can."" The Pennsylvania Democratic party publicly chastised Wagner for the suggestion and the senator was slammed in comments sections for the statement. So we decided to check his claim: Is the Earth really moving closer to the sun? And has body heat contributed to global climate change? Let’s start with the, er, ""manmade"" option first: Despite Wagner’s question, there is no evidence to suggest human body heat is causing global climate change. As PolitiFact has pointed out time and time again, the overwhelming majority of experts agree that climate change is happening and humans are causing it largely through producing carbon dioxide that exacerbates the Earth’s greenhouse effect. Dave Goldberg, an associate department head for undergraduate studies and a professor in Drexel University’s Department of Physics, said the idea that human body heat is changing the temperature is ""absurd."" He said the regular energy collected from the sun is about a million times larger than the energy humans emit through body heat, so Wagner was ""off by literally a factor of a million."" Wagner did say with more confidence though that the Earth ""moves closer to the sun every year,"" but that claim -- and the way he used it -- also has little root in scientific evidence. Donald Schneider, a distinguished professor and head of Penn State’s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said ""on average, we aren’t changing our distance and the Earth is not spiraling into the sun continuously."" Technically, the Earth does move closer to the sun every year -- and then it moves back, in that same year. That’s because the Earth doesn’t orbit around the sun in a circular motion. Instead, Schneider explained, it maintains an elliptical orbit, so for half the year, the Earth is moving toward the sun and for the other half it’s moving away. Then the process, which Schneider said wouldn’t have an impact on climate change ""on human time scales,"" repeats every year. Schneider also noted that Wagner cited ""the rotation of the Earth"" when he said the Earth is moving closer to the sun, but he likely meant ""the revolution"" or the orbit of the Earth. The Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, not every year. ""The Earth moves closer to the sun every year, that can be technically true in a narrow definition,"" Schneider said. ""Half the time it is. In the context of the Earth moving closer to the sun causing the temperature to go up, I don’t think is correct."" Goldberg agreed, saying he’s ""kind of disappointed in [Wagner’s] high school science teacher."" ""This idea that something that happens on a one-year time scale has anything to do with what we’re seeing in terms of global warming is a ridiculous argument,"" Goldberg said, adding that it’s ""insulting"" Wagner would insinuate scientists hadn’t considered the impact of the Earth’s proximity to the sun. PolitiFact Pennsylvania reached out to Wagner’s office in search of evidence of his claim. His office released a statement from Wagner instead, in which he said: ""I believe that the climate is changing every day, and some of that change is certainly manmade. I think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards, and I support efforts to do that."" ""However, the real question isn't is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it,"" he said in the statement. ""I believe we have to prioritize action in a measured way so that we do not hurt our economy."" Our Ruling Pennsylvania Sen. Scott Wagner said during a discussion about climate change that ""the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth. We’re moving closer to the sun."" The Earth technically does move closer to the sun every year as part of its revolution around the sun, but it then moves back. That revolution is not related to the rotation of the Earth, and as experts point out, the Earth isn’t on average moving closer to the sun. That movement closer to the sun, scientists say, wouldn’t have an impact on climate change, and one scientist even called the claim ""ridiculous."" Also, there’s no evidence to suggest human body heat is at all related to global climate change. We rate the claim False.","[('Email interview. Marsicano, Erin. Legislative director for Sen.

State school superintendent misses on claim that 5 percent of teachers want to work in rural schools
","At a campaign stop in northern Wisconsin, State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers addressed a hot topic: the declining supply of new teachers. The trend ""concerns me from the Northwoods point of view,"" Evers said, according to a WXPR public radio story that aired March 13, 2017. He added that a University of Wisconsin-Madison study had found that among teachers looking for work, ""less than 5% wanted to work in rural Wisconsin."" That’s bleak news for rural school districts -- if true. Is it? Behind the number The Evers campaign told us the statistic came from research conducted by Peter Goff, a UW-Madison professor who is leading a team studying teacher supply and demand in Wisconsin. Goff shared with us a draft version of the study, which is expected to be published soon by the Wisconsin Center for Education Research, headquartered on the campus. Evers and other DPI officials were briefed on a preliminary, 2016 version of the findings. The study by Goff and UW-Madison education graduation student Ellie M. Bruecker analyzed 194,495 applications for teaching vacancies in public school districts between January and October of 2014. The data came from a job-application website, the Wisconsin Education Career Access Network, and included those newly entering the profession as well as existing teachers. Evers comment that ""less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin"" doesn’t square with the study’s findings. Here are some key findings from the study: -- 54 percent of prospective teachers did not apply for any vacancies in a rural school. -- 40 percent applied to multiple types of districts, including rural ones. -- Less than 5 percent applied only to rural vacancies. That last conclusion reflects the claim made by Evers. But if that fact is what he was thinking of, his claim didn’t accurately reflect the report. Less than 5 percent of applicants applied exclusively to rural districts, but a total of 45 percent showed interest in rural vacancies. Goff said there is clearly an aversion to rural districts for many applicants. Another piece of evidence for that: The average applicant submits only 15 percent of their applications to rural vacancies. But, ""applicant pools in rural districts don’t look any different than applicant pools in urban areas or towns,"" Goff told us. They have the same number of applicants, on average, with similar levels of experience, certification, advanced degrees and competitiveness of undergraduate institution. Our rating Evers claimed a study of where teachers apply to work found that ""less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin."" The study found that schools in cities, suburbs or towns all draw more interest than rural districts, but Evers badly overstated the case.

New York state prohibits higher health insurance premiums for older residents
 ","Democrats in Congress say the Obamacare repeal and replacement bill would have allowed health insurance companies to charge older Americans more for coverage. The American Health Care Act -- pulled from the House floor last week after it became clear the plan would be defeated -- would have allowed insurance companies to charge older Americans up to five times more for health coverage than younger Americans. Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, addressed the issue during a town hall-style event on CNN before Republican leaders pulled the bill. ""In New York under our state insurance commissioner, we have what we call a one to one,"" Collins said. ""You cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person."" The Affordable Care Act remains the law. While insurance companies are still allowed to charge older Americans up to three times more for coverage under that law, Collins says that’s not the case in New York state. Is he right that New York state residents pay the same price for insurance regardless of age? New York state law New York state has had what’s called a ""community rating"" model of health insurance since 1993. It requires health insurance companies to charge the same price for coverage in select regions regardless of age, gender, occupation or health status. The bill, sponsored in 1992 by Assemblyman Pete Grannis, a Democrat from New York City, passed with bipartisan support from both chambers and then-Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. The bill changed the state’s insurance law from the federal model, which allows different pricing based on age, and guaranteed ""the premium for all persons covered by a policy or contract form is the same … without regard to age, sex, health status or occupation."" It remains on the books today and now includes the same protection for tobacco users. Although the price is the same for different ages within each region, the regions are allowed to have different prices statewide. There are eight regions in the state. Vermont is the only other state that requires the same health insurance price for all ages. What about federal law? Experts we spoke to said New York state’s model works with the Affordable Care Act and would not have changed under the American Health Care Act. ""Federal law preempts state law, but sometimes it creates a floor instead of a ceiling for actions that can be taken by the states,"" said Rachel Morgan of the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""You must also consider that states until recently were the principal regulators of the business of insurance and instituted requirements that best served their markets."" The floor, in this case, is the federal cap on age-based health care premiums. New York state’s law stands because its added restriction does not change federal law but supplements it. Our ruling Collins said in New York ""you cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person"" for health insurance. Collins is right. New York state has barred insurance companies from pricing based on age for more than two decades. Experts say the Affordable Care Act did not impact that law, and its would-be Republican replacement would not have either. We rate his claim True.","[('Rep.

Fake news wrongly says Ken Starr died in plane crash on way to testify against Hillary Clinton
","A fake news story claimed that the lawyer who investigated former President Bill Clinton prior to his impeachment died in a plane crash while on his way to give testimony about former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ""Ken Starr’s plane just disappeared on his way to D.C. to testify against Hillary,"" read the headline on a March 24, 2017, post on ConservativeFlashNews.com. The post was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to curtail fake news. While this post appears on several other websites, ConservativeFlashNews.com indicates that they ""cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information."" There is no immediately apparent way to contact the site. The story, which is fake, said Starr was flying to Washington when his plane crashed in Wilkershire, Md. — a town that, as far as we can tell, does not exist. The post said five people were killed in the crash. The post also said that Starr was going to testify before ""special investigative committee that has recently found itself investigating crimes from the 1990s,"" led by U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. There is no such committee, but Gowdy’s name likely was invoked because he was chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. That committee submitted its final report in July 2016. Starr’s investigation into the Clintons, starting with former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster’s death and the Whitewater land deal, eventually unearthed details of Bill Clinton allegedly lying in a deposition about an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. The allegations in the Starr Report led to Bill Clinton’s 1998 impeachment. More recently, Starr served as president and chancellor of Baylor University, but left amid accusations that he mishandled a sexual assault scandal to protect players on the school’s football team. As for the story that he died, its origins have roots in a well-known source of fabricated news. ConservativeFlashNews.com copied the story that appeared on the same date on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The post featured a photograph of a real fatal plane crash during a 2015 air show in England. The site has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked.

Florida U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho misleads on claim about Medicaid
","U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, is a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act but opposed his party’s health care plan. The ACA passed under President Barack Obama included the expansion of Medicaid, a program that provides health coverage for about 74 million poor Americans. (Yoho’s state of Florida rejected the expansion.) Yoho, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, says the law has driven people to Medicaid, a program he described as a worldwide failure. ""With the Affordable Care Act, what’s happened is, all these people have been running to Medicaid, and it’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care,"" he said in a March 14 interview on PBS, about a week and a half before the Republicans canceled a vote on their health care plan. Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney walked back the congressman’s statement somewhat when we asked for evidence that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world. ""Hindsight being 20/20, the congressman didn’t mean to use the word ‘worst,’ "" Kaveney said. ""The congressman was pointing out that since the implementation of ACA, health care trends have not improved."" Kaveney added: ""To say that Medicaid expansion under ACA has resulted in better health outcomes would be a very debatable point."" Experts we interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. Leighton Ku, an expert on health policy at George Washington University, said that Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, but research about outcomes comes with caveats. ""There is no question -- and there is a lot of research -- that Medicaid improves poor people's access to health care, in terms of seeing a doctor, getting medications, etc.,"" he told PolitiFact. ""The problem with comparing health outcomes is that Medicaid recipients start out sicker, both because they are poor, but also because people who are sick really need to get Medicaid to get access to care, while healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care."" Studies about Medicaid Yoho was referring to two articles in 2017 by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a policy director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Cass argued that Medicaid studies show that the program doesn’t improve public health. But there aren't studies comparing its health outcomes to other industrialized countries. ""Whether people on Medicaid have better or worse outcomes than people in other countries doesn’t tell you anything about the effectiveness of Medicaid,"" Cass told PolitiFact. ""The question is whether there are public programs that have as little effect on outcomes relative to the baseline of no-insurance in that country."" Let’s look at the studies that Cass cited, some of which we have reviewed before. Oregon study: Cass wrote that a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon showed ""recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years."" The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment compared about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. Over two years, the study found that while patients in the program initially reported feeling better, there was no real change in health indicators such as diabetes control, cholesterol or blood pressure. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. Harvard study: Harvard researchers compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine and New York with other states that made no change in the 2000s. ""Only one of the three achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality,"" Cass wrote. One of the study’s authors, Ben Sommers, said when examining each state individually only the largest state -- New York -- was significant on its own.  Sommers has since done additional research and found that deaths from causes most treatable with timely medical care — such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes — did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well. (Sommers did part-time work for the Obama administration.) Study on life expectancy and income: Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study was not about Medicaid, but found differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals is not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care. ""Our study shows that behavioral conditions such as smoking and obesity are very important in mortality,"" study author Raj Chetty told PolitiFact. ""The study does not imply that Medicaid is not important, let alone that it has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world."" Cass cited one positive health impact from Medicaid: He wrote that it ""may have significant positive effects on pregnant women and young children."" Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation looked at the big picture for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Kaiser reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the law. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. More research was needed, however, to know the effects on health outcomes. Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago professor of social services administration, said that Medicaid, much like private insurance, is a weaker tool in improving health outcomes than  experts would like to see. But Medicaid critics sometimes omit context about the program for the poor. ""Many studies that compare Medicaid recipients to others find negative associations between Medicaid and health for the simple reason that Medicaid serves individuals facing the greatest social and health risks,"" he said. ""These cannot be interpreted as identifying a harmful causal role of Medicaid."" Our ruling Yoho said ""It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care."" Yoho’s spokesman said that he didn’t mean to use the word ""worst."" His evidence focused on studies about Medicaid outcomes within the United States with no comparison to other countries. Yoho intended to argue that Medicaid under the ACA hasn’t improved health outcomes. Kaiser examined multiple studies and found Medicaid expansion improves access to care and self-reported health, but additional research is needed to determine effects on health outcomes. As far as Yoho’s original statement, we rate it False.","[('PBS Newshour, ""Freedom Caucus member Yoho thinks House health care bill will get amended,"" March 14, 2017', 'http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/freedom-caucus-member-yoho-thinks-house-health-care-bill-will-get-amended/'), ('Manhattan Institute senior fellow Oren Cass, ""Will repealing Obamacare kill people?"" 2017', 'No link'), ('National Review article by Oren Cass, ""No, Obamacare has not saved American lives,"" Feb. 27, 2017', 'https://www.manhattan-institute.org/sites/default/files/IB-OC-0217.pdf'), ('Harvard professor Benjamin Sommers, ""State Medicaid Expansions and Mortality, Revisited: A Cost-Benefit Analysis,"" June 1, 2016', 'No link'), ('Stanford University Raj Chetty, ""The Association Between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014,"" April 26, 2016', 'http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445260/obamacare-no-lives-saved'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""Data note: three findings about access to care and health outcomes in Medicaid,"" March 23, 2017', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""What is Medicaid’s impact on access to care, health outcomes, and quality of care?

Congress let Internet providers 'spy on' your underwear purchases, advocacy group says
","Your Internet service provider has intimate knowledge about your intimates, and a bill headed to President Donald Trump’s desk allows them to sell that information, says Internet privacy advocacy group Fight for the Future. Voting along party lines, Republicans in Congress recently passed a joint resolution that reverses a landmark Federal Communications Commission rule requiring Internet service providers (ISPs), like Comcast or Verizon, to ask customers for their explicit permission before handing user data over to advertisers and other third parties. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law. ""215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers,"" Fight for the Future tweeted March 28, after the bill passed the House. 215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers #BroadbandPrivacy pic.twitter.com/m1HkVptuNt Fight for the Future has the vote count right; 215 members of the House of Representatives voted for the measure. We decided to dig into whether the group is right about what the bill means for online shopping. ISPs and the bill Fight for the Future’s tweet might give the misleading impression that ISPs can’t already see their customers’ online purchases and sell that information. They can. Congress’ action just makes this explicitly legal. An ISP’s function is to connect its users to websites or online apps, and so it can see nearly everything its users do on the Internet, including what kind of underwear they buy. An advertiser might be interested in purchasing that information from an ISP because then it can predict whether a given user is more likely to respond to an ad for boxers, briefs or tighty-whities. Beyond shopping habits, ISPs and advertisers can glean more significant personal information about their customers from Internet browsing patterns — like that a spouse is contemplating divorce because he looked up ""best divorce lawyers in my area,"" or that a person has a chronic medical condition because she spent a long time reading certain pages on WebMD. In October 2016, the FCC established rules intended to give consumers more control over how ISPs used their data. The rules required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history, which would include underwear purchases. The rule also required the ISPs to get consent before sharing other ""sensitive information,"" like Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. Many Internet companies and trade associations had already committed to requiring consumers to opt-in before they can share that sort of information, per guidance from the Federal Trade Commission. But these opt-in rules never went into effect; Congress killed them in March 2017, months before the December 2017 start date. So ISPs can see and use customers’ web browsing data as they always have. ""Practically speaking, I expect consumers will see no change in how their data is collected and marketed,"" said Brent Skorup, a technology policy research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer said Congress’ vote was significant because it gives ISP companies explicit permission to engage in practices that some privacy advocates consider ""abusive,"" and it gives ISPs an incentive to invest in systems to further these practices. ISPs have been expanding the scope of their operations, merging with other varieties of service providers, such as Verizon purchasing AOL, or AT&T’s planned deal to purchase Time Warner, Inc. This, combined with Congress’ reversal of the FCC rules, might encourage ISPs to expand their role in online advertising, said Peter Swire, a professor at Georgia Tech and the chief counselor for privacy during President Bill Clinton’s administration. ""There’s a lot of online advertising today,"" Swire said. ""Now the big broadband companies will play more actively in that space."" Those who supported gutting the FCC rules argue that the regulations put ISPs at a disadvantage compared to other Internet companies, like search engines or social media sites, that already sell users’ data without first getting permission. They also say the rules stifle technology innovation. Privacy advocates, however, say that ISPs have an especially large window into its users Internet habits, and this rule could have opened up the possibility of beginning to enact privacy regulations on other web-based companies. ""This is troublesome because of the larger question: Is privacy opt in or opt out?"" said Jamie Winterton, director of strategy for Arizona State University’s Global Security Initiative. ""Can your browser behaviors be bought and sold?"" Privacy protections Though they can see a lot, there are limitations to what ISPs can see. Some websites use encryption, so the ISP can see the domain name but not the exact page on that website the user is browsing. A website is encrypted if the address starts with ""https"" not ""http."" For example, if a web user visit the Macy’s website, which is encrypted, their ISP will know they’re browsing the Macy’s website, but it won’t know if they’re shopping for underwear, a prom dress or bedding. (The article you’re currently reading is not encrypted.) However, if someone visits MeUndies.com right after visiting VictoriasSecret.com — both encrypted — an advertiser can probably make an educated guess that the person is in the market for some underwear. There are many more sophisticated ways an ISP or third party can glean information about a user even when the data is encrypted. Regardless, most ecommerce sites remain unencrypted, Swire said. An Internet user who really does not want an ISP tracking any of their data can use a Virtual Private Network, which, put simply, is a way to scramble all Internet traffic so the ISP and potential hackers can’t get at it. But this might not completely eliminate privacy concerns because some VPNs themselves don’t fully protect users’ data. ""If you don’t want any of your information out there, you’d have to do all sorts of things,"" Winterton said. ""It’s a lot to ask of people."" Our ruling Fight for the Future said, ""215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers."" ISPs can see most of the websites their customers visit. Congress, with 215 votes from the House, sent a bill to Trump’s desk that codified ISPs’ ability to sell their customers' web browsing data, including any online underwear purchases that aren’t encrypted. Regulations enacted in 2016 would have required ISPs to ask customers for explicit permission to share this data with advertisers or other third parties. But Congress acted before the regulations went into effect. Fight for the Future’s phrasing — and use of the loaded term ""spy"" — might lead people to think that Congress’ action gave ISPs new freedoms, but they could always view and sell users’ web browsing information. Now they have Congress’ stamp of approval to do so without getting users’ permission first. That context is important, so we rate Fight for the Future’s claim Mostly True.","[('Congress.gov, S.J.Res.34, accessed March 30, 2017', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/34'), ('FCC, ""FCC Adopts Privacy Rules To Give Broadband Consumers Increased Choice, Transparency And Security For Their Personal Data,"" Oct. 27, 2016', 'No link'), ('Georgia Tech, ""Online Privacy and ISPs: ISP Access to Consumer Data is Limited and Often Less than Access by Others,"" Feb. 29, 2016', 'https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-341937A1.pdf'), ('Upturn, ""What ISPs Can See,"" March 2016', 'No link'), ('Proskauer, ""The Clock Has Started: What ISPs Need to Do and When to Comply with the FCC’s Broadband Privacy Rules,"" Dec. 7, 2016', 'http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/online_privacy_and_isps.pdf'), ('NPR, ""As Congress Repeals Internet Privacy Rules, Putting Your Options In Perspective,"" March 28, 2017', 'No link'), ('Competitive Enterprise Institute, ""Six Reasons FCC Rules Aren’t Needed to Protect Privacy,"" March 27, 2017', 'https://www.teamupturn.com/reports/2016/what-isps-can-see#four-key-technical-clarifications'), ('New York Times, ""How the Republicans Sold Your Privacy to Internet Providers,"" March 29, 2017', 'No link'), ('CTIA, ""Internet Companies Reaffirm Consumer Privacy Principles As FCC Reviews Flawed Wheeler Era Broadband Rules,"" Jan. 27, 2017', 'http://privacylaw.proskauer.com/2016/12/articles/fcc/the-clock-has-started-what-isps-need-to-do-and-when-to-comply-with-the-fccs-broadband-privacy-rules/'), ('Email interview, Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer, March 30, 2017', 'No link'), ('Email interview, George Mason research fellow Brent Skorup, March 30, 2017', 'http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/03/28/521813464/as-congress-repeals-internet-privacy-rules-putting-your-options-in-perspective'), ('Email interview, Upturn principal Aaron Rieke, March 29, 2017', 'No link'), ('Phone interview, Georgia Tech professor Peter Swire, March 29, 2017', 'https://cei.org/blog/six-reasons-fcc-rules-aren%E2%80%99t-needed-protect-privacy'), ('Phone interview, Jamie Winterton, strategy director at ASU’s Global Security Initiative, March 29, 2017', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/30/fight-future/congress-let-internet-providers-spy-your-underwear/
"['Illinois', 'Jacqueline Collins ']","
Gov. Rauner has proposed funding cuts for autism
","Things are getting tense among members of the General Assembly as Illinois continues its historic budget impasse. Democrats and Republicans are hurling attacks at opposition party leaders, hoping to assign blame for the state’s lack of a budget for 22 months. Republicans continue to target Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, while Democrats, like state Sen. Jacqueline Collins of Chicago, often slam Gov. Bruce Rauner. In a Feb. 24 newsletter from state Sen. Collins, she zeroes in on several of Rauner’s claims as she attempts to debunk them. One of her counterclaims said: ""Fact: Governor Rauner has called every year for eliminating funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children."" We wondered: Did Rauner actually call for the elimination of these programs each year he’s been in office? Budget proposals and vetoed bills We contacted Kenneth Lowe, a media and outreach specialist for the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus, to see where the state senator found her sources. Lowe provided us with five instances from 2015 to 2017 in which the governor announced he intended to  freeze or cut homeless prevention, autism or after-school programs for at-risk youth. We looked into each instance to verify that it actually happened and to see whether it accurately depicts Collins’ claim. • Collins’ claim: On Feb. 18, 2015 Rauner announced his Fiscal Year 2016 budget in which he proposed freezing grant funding for autism and homeless prevention programs at DHS. He also called for the elimination of the After School Matters program at the Illinois State Board of Education.   • Our finding: Rauner’s FY16 budget proposal shows the governor did look to freeze funding for homeless and autism programs, as well as cut After School Matters.   • Collins’ claim: In April 2015, Rauner announced his plan to freeze funding for autism and homeless prevention. • Our findings: On April 3, 2015, Rauner did, in fact, call for a $26 million suspension in social services and public health grants. The Chicago Tribune reported, ""The Republican’s office released a list of targeted programs…that included funding to pay for…smoking cessation, teen programs, autism, and HIV and AIDS programs, among other things."" The Tribune story showed the governor called for a $1 million cut for autism programs, a $300,000 cut for Assistance for the Homeless and a $3.1 million cut to Teen REACH, an after-school program run by the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) for high-risk youth. The cuts were dubbed by Democrats as the ""Good Friday Massacre"" and funding to the programs was restored a few weeks later when the administration reported higher-than-expected tax revenue. • Collins’ claim: In June 2015, Rauner vetoed a bill that would fund autism programs and homeless prevention programs. • Our finding: On June 25, 2015, Rauner vetoed HB4165. The bill would have provided $4.3 million to the Autism Diagnosis Education Program and $4.5 million to Homeless Youth Services. It is worth noting, however, that the bill was in a batch of 19 budget bills Rauner vetoed simultaneously under a single veto message that faulted Democrats for passing a budget that was $4 billion in the red. ""We must be partners in enacting a balanced budget that meets critical public needs within the resources available. The surest way to do that is by enacting structural reforms inside government and economic reforms that stimulate our economy and bring new jobs to Illinois,"" Rauner wrote in his veto message. As he has said repeatedly since then, Rauner, at the time, had said he would look to new revenue sources if the General Assembly enacted parts of his ""Turnaround Agenda."" This became the opening salvo in a budget impasse that endures to this day. • Collins’ claim: Governor Rauner’s FY17 budget proposal called for the same types of freezes and cuts from his FY16 budget proposal. • Our finding: Rauner’s budget did call for these freezes and cuts. The Project for Autism, DHS’ Homelessness Prevention program and After School Matter wouldn’t have received funding. • Collins’ claim: Rauner, again, introduced a budget without funding the above-mentioned programs. • Our finding: Rauner’s proposed FY18 budget shows this claim is correct. By looking at Rauner’s budget proposals, vetoed bills and past news stories we found Rauner has called for the elimination and freezing of funding for autism, homelessness and after school programs each year he has been in office. However, Rauner has not been successful in his attempts to eliminate or freeze this funding, a point Collins’ email does not make. 'It’s not pretty’ Chris Mooney, director of the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, said claims like the ones in Collins’ email are common these days. Illinois has been without a budget for almost two years, and Mooney said it’s starting to grate on people. ""People inside and outside the legislative process are having their nerves frayed,"" Mooney said. ""There’s a lot of tension, especially in the statehouse because they can’t get their jobs done. That’s frustrating for anybody."" Mooney said this feeling is probably amplified after the 12-bill budget package known as the ""Grand Bargain"" stalled. ""It was the one real attempt the (state) Senate had and it was shot down,"" Mooney said. ""It offered hope and those hopes were dashed. It’s like we’re starting back at square one."" Our ruling In an email newsletter, state Sen. Jacqueline Collins accused Gov. Bruce Rauner of calling for the elimination of ""funding for afterschool programs for at-risk youth, homeless prevention services and programs that help autistic children"" each year he's been in office. A Democratic staffer pointed to five instances where Rauner proposed cuts or freezes to these three programs. We verified these instances by looking at Rauner’s current and former budget proposals, a vetoed bill and news stories.     Rauner has proposed budgets that would eliminate funding in the areas Collins cites. But his 2015 veto of a bill that contained autism funding was in the context of rejecting 19 budget bills on the grounds that the entire package was unbalanced. His veto message did not specifically mention eliminating autism funding. Rather, he said he was vetoing several bills because he wanted structural reforms as part of a balanced budget which majority Democrats did not send him. Collins’ statement is accurate, but needs clarification and additional information. We rate Collins’ claim Mostly True.","[('Email conversation with Ken Lowe, Media & Outreach Specialist for the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus, March 16, 2017', 'http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-rauner-social-services-20150404-story.html'), ('""Rauner suspends $26 million in social services, public health grants,"" Chicago Tribune. \xa0April 4, 2015.

Candidate says Wisconsin deserved a D+ grade on preparing students for college
","Lowell Holtz says voters should revolt on April 4 and dismiss Tony Evers from the head of the class -- his position as Wisconsin’s state superintendent of public instruction. In a recent attack on learning outcomes in the Evers era, the conservative challenger noted that Evers’ declared mission is ""Every Child a Graduate, College and Career Ready."" But among high schools in Wisconsin, ""roughly a third are missing the mark of graduating young adults who are college ready,"" Holtz wrote in a March 26, 2017 posting on his campaign web page. ""That’s a pass rate of 66.6 percent, which equates to a D+ on my grading scale,"" he wrote. To back his claim, Holtz cited data on how many graduating high school students need remedial help when they enter the University of Wisconsin System. Typically that involves assistance with math, but sometimes with English. Under a 2015 state law, high schools have to provide that information to the state Legislature. Holtz correctly says in his post that 175 schools were identified in the 2015 version of the report. That’s 34% of the 510 public high schools in the state -- apparently the ""roughly a third"" he spoke of. There are private schools in that 175, however, so the proper denominator (using both public and private schools) is 575. That means 30 percent of schools made the list. So Holtz is slightly off. More significantly, there’s a false precision problem that hurts his claim. In reality, it’s impossible for the public to see exactly how many schools had students who needed help. That’s because, as Holtz noted, only schools where 7 or more students need such help must be publicly identified by the university system. It’s a privacy measure meant to protect the identify of individual students. So it’s very likely more schools would be on the list if the privacy provision did not exist. Making the grade Is making the list proof that these schools are ""missing the mark"" and not worthy of a passing grade on graduating ""college-ready"" students, as Holtz says? Holtz argues it is, citing Evers’ ""Every Child a Graduate, College and Career Ready"" mission statement. Even if just a few students need extra help, Holtz categorizes that as a failure. Tom McCarthy, a spokesman at the Evers-led Department of Public Instruction, says the slogan means the goal is college or a career for each student. Given the phrasing, it’s easy to see how one might interpret it as college for ""every child,"" so Holtz’s  rhetoric doesn’t strike us as out of bounds. More importantly, though, there is a major problem in characterizing the list. The report doesn’t rank the schools or characterize their outcomes as passing or failing -- yet Holtz lumps all the schools on the list into one failing category. The list includes every school that had at least 7 students who needed help, regardless of the size of the senior class and no consideration of how many -- or few -- of its graduates are in the state university system. So the list includes many schools where you can count on two hands the number of students who needed remedial assistance. For instance, Brookfield East had 10 students who needed math help, landing it on Holt’s failure list, despite the fact the number represents just 7.7 percent of the school’s 130 UW-bound pupils. At the same time, the list includes a few schools where the rate is over 70 percent. (On average, it was 40 percent for math across all the listed schools). Many of the schools with higher rates have very few students going to the UW system. For example, Johnson Creek High School was listed as 80 percent needing math help -- or 8 of 10. Who is ready? Another factor in checking Holtz’s claim is how to define ""college ready."" Holtz says the need for remedial help is enough to show the students were not ready. But the students already were accepted into college. The need for any remedial help is established in placement tests after their acceptance. The rating About a third of Wisconsin’s high schools ""are missing the mark of graduating young adults who are college ready,"" Lowell Holtz claimed, a ""pass rate of 66.6 percent."" Holtz cites legitimate data and makes fair use of Evers’ own words to judge the incumbent’s record. But the limits of the data, and Holtz’s blanket characterization of 175 schools as failing on preparing students for college, create significant misperceptions. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts, our rating is Mostly False.","[('Lowell Holtz campaign blog post, March 26, 2017', 'http://www.kidservative.org/q-is-for-quality/'), ('Interview with Charles Sanger, president, CS Communications, spokesman for Holtz campaign, March 29, 2017', 'No link'), ('Interview with Thomas McCarthy, communications director, Department of Public Instruction, March 28, 2017', 'http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/0923jaglerreport.pdf'), ('University of Wisconsin System, (WI Act 28) Report on Remedial Education, Immediate New Freshmen from Wisconsin High Schools, Fall 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/30/lowell-holtz/candidate-says-wisconsin-deserved-d-grade-preparin/

Jeff Sessions exaggerates claim about 'sanctuary' policies and violating federal law
","Attorney General Jeff Sessions said ""sanctuary cities"" that won’t cooperate immigration authorities are acting unlawfully and stand to lose funds if they don’t comply. The Justice Department’s inspector general has determined that policies in such jurisdictions are illegal, Sessions said March 27. ""Not only do these policies endanger lives of every American, just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these policies also violate federal law,"" Sessions, who began leading the department this year under Trump’s administration, said during a White House press briefing. Is that accurate? Sessions is exaggerating what the inspector general actually said. Inspector general’s memo President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to cut federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities, claiming they harbor criminals and risk public safety. There is not a legal, federal definition for ""sanctuary cities,"" but they’re generally regarded as local governments that limit their cooperation with immigration officials. Usually they do that by refusing to hold people in local jails (beyond the time they would have been released) when asked to do so by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. That’s called a refusal to honor a detainer request. ICE detainers ask local law enforcement agencies to alert the federal agency of upcoming releases of individuals and to detain them for up to 48 hours so that immigration authorities can pick them up. Jurisdictions with ""sanctuary"" policies argue that they have good reasons not to co-operate with immigration officials. They say that their policies help build trust between local police and their community, and that their cities are not crime magnets. Amid Trump’s call to cut funding for sanctuary cities, some cities such as Boston and New York remain committed to policies that shield immigrants. Others, fearing a loss of money, have walked back their policies. A day after Trump signed an executive order to advance his promise, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez directed county officials to comply with detainer requests, though he had previously claimed his jurisdiction was not a sanctuary. Sessions was basing his claim that the cities were violating the law on an inspector general’s memo. In May 2016, Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general wrote a memo to the assistant attorney general for the Office of Justice Programs in response to queries on whether jurisdictions receiving department grants were violating the law, specifically 8 U.S. Code Section 1373. Section 1373 says federal, state or local government entities or officials may not prohibit or restrict the exchange of information with federal immigration officers regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any individual. Of the more than 140 jurisdictions in question, the inspector general’s office took a sample of 10 jurisdictions, which included the state of California, Chicago, and Miami-Dade County in Florida. It reviewed their policies regarding their interaction and communication with ICE and asked ICE officials for feedback. All 10 jurisdictions had policies limiting in some way their cooperation with ICE detainer requests, the May 2016 memo said. But local jails are not required by law to respond to detainers requests, and the handling of detainers is not addressed in Section 1373. Yet the May 2016 memo raised concerns about the wording in some local ordinances and how officials may be interpreting and applying them. For instance, a Chicago ordinance said, ""except as otherwise provided under applicable federal law, no agent or agency shall disclose information regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any person unless required to do so by legal process."" The inspector general’s office raised concerns on whether Chicago city employees were aware of their legal authority to act against the local ordinance and respond to ICE detainer requests. Policies in other jurisdictions besides Chicago ""may be causing local officials to believe and apply the policies in a manner that prohibits or restricts cooperation with ICE in all respects. That, of course, would be inconsistent with and prohibited by Section 1373."" A spokesman for Sessions highlighted the previous line as backup for the attorney general’s claim. But that line has a footnote, which says: ""The ICE officials we spoke with noted that no one at (Department of Homeland Security) or ICE has made a formal legal determination whether certain state and local laws or policies violate Section 1373, and we are unaware of any Department of Justice decision in that regard. These ICE officials were also unaware of any legal action taken by the federal government against a state or local jurisdiction to require cooperation."" Experts evaluate Sessions’ interpretation Several immigration law scholars we reached out to disagreed with Sessions’ read of the memo. We spoke with five immigration law scholars; four of them disagreed with Sessions' interpretation of the memo. The closest support for Sessions' claim came from Gabriel (Jack) Chin, a professor and director of clinical legal education at the University of California-Davis law school. The concerns raised by the inspector general give Sessions’ claim some credence, he said.  ""While there is a little hedge because no jurisdiction has been accused of violating 1373, or found to have done so, my reading is that some jurisdictions are in apparent violation of the law,"" Chin said. The other were more skeptical.  ""Sessions went beyond what the report said. The report expresses concern that some cities’ policies might violate section 1373, but in the end the report stops short of finding any violations,"" said Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law. ""In fact, the language of the report seems carefully chosen to limit itself to raising concerns without finding violations."" The ""may"" qualification in the report ""is far from a definitive conclusion that these policies are against the law,"" said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University who has opined in the Washington Post that Trump’s executive order related to so-called sanctuary cities is unconstitutional. ""The inspector general had no real information, but merely a vague idea that it was possible that in some jurisdictions policies may be causing a violation of Section 1373,"" said Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who used to run the civil rights office at Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. The argument in the inspector general's memo seems to be that the policies could violate Section 1373 as applied, noted Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&M University School of Law. ""But the inspector general recognizes that this argument would require a lot more systematic gathering of empirical information than what it did in its investigation,"" Pham said. ""Thus the carefully couched 'may be' language."" Our ruling Sessions said, ""Just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these (‘sanctuary’) policies also violate federal law."" A memo issued by the inspector general raised questions about how local officials may be interpreting and applying ordinances that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But the memo also explicitly said a formal legal determination on whether certain state and local laws or policies violate Section 1373 had not been made by immigration officials and that his office was unaware of any Justice Department decision in that regard. Sessions’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.","[('Justice Department, Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks on Sanctuary Jurisdictions, March 27, 2017', 'https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-sanctuary-jurisdictions'), ('Email exchange, Justice Department press office, March 27, 2017', 'No link'), ('Office of the Inspector General, Memo on jurisdictions and Section 1373 compliance, May 31, 2016', 'https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/1607.pdf'), ('PolitiFact, Trump-O-Meter, Cancel all funding of sanctuary cities', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, March 28, 2017', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1400/cancel-all-funding-sanctuary-cities/'), ('Email interview, Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, March 28, 2017', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/mar/30/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-misleads-saying-inspector-general-fo/

Fact-check: Is Florida House 'sanctuary' bill unlike anything else in the country?
","Florida House Republicans are following President Donald Trump’s lead by supporting legislation that requires jurisdictions to do away with practices that shield undocumented immigrants, which are known as ""sanctuary cities."" Rep. Larry Metz, R-Yalaha, sponsored a proposal (HB 697) that would require county and local law enforcement agencies to comply with and support enforcement of federal immigration law or face stiff penalties. The bill has moved along party lines in a couple of House committee hearings. It needs a full vote in the House and approval in the Senate, where it has not been heard at all, before it can reach Gov. Rick Scott’s desk and become law.. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, has raised strong objections. Smith tried to weaken the bill with six filed amendments in a March 21 hearing. After all six of his attempts failed, Smith argued that the bill’s enforcement penalties are uniquely harsh. ""It will be the only law of its kind in the nation,"" Smith said. This made us wonder: Is Florida considering one-of-a-kind legislation for sanctuary cities? It looks like Smith is basically right, if the law didn't undergo any significant changes and was signed by Scott. National experts agree that — to the best of their knowledge — while other states have taken up bills on sanctuary cities, no other law or pending bill goes as far in terms of the breadth of the prohibitions and the penalties imposed in HB 697. HB 697 offers an orginal mix of penalties There is no legal definition for sanctuary policies. The term is used to describe places that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The Trump administration has begun calling out cities and counties with these policies, and he promised to cancel all funding of sanctuary cities. Cities and counties that choose not to actively assist federal authorities in carrying out immigration enforcement duties argue that such practices negatively impact police-community relations, and that ultimately it's not their responsibility to enforce federal laws. Some argue that the tactics used to enforce these policies border on unconstitutional, too. The main way agencies refuse to comply is to not honor written requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain individuals for up to 48 hours longer than they would have been released. Metz’s bill doesn’t call out any specific places in Florida as sanctuary cities, but a staff analysis does mention a 2010 Miami-Dade policy as an example of place that might be affected by this bill. The county’s policy said that ICE detainers would only be honored if the federal government reimbursed the costs incurred. Miami-Dade mayor Carlos Giménez reversed the policy in January, putting him in the realm of compliance with Metz’s legislation. A major component of Metz’s HB 697 requires state and local entities, as well as law enforcement agencies to comply with the enforcement of federal immigration law 90 days after the law goes into effect. If they don’t? Cities and counties with those policies would face penalties that include: • a five-year suspension on receiving non-federal grant money from state and local entities that don’t honor immigration enforcement; • The threat of automatic suspension and removal from office for elected state officials accused of violating sanctuary prohibition policy; • A prohibition of public funds to reimburse or defend a public official who is accused of violating a sanctuary prohibition policy; and • civil fines if detainers are not honored starting Oct. 1. Smith said his research shows no other law in the United States goes that far. Smith found that Alabama, Georgia, Utah and North Carolina have laws that require entities to honor all ICE detainer and information requests, but still don’t go as far as HB 697. For example, Alabama law restricts funds, grants, or appropriations until a violation has ceased, but doesn’t have a provision to have a civil cause of action against an official if a person is injured by an undocumented immigrant. Georgia law authorizes local officials to cooperate with federal immigration officials, but doesn’t require it. Utah restricts sanctuary policies, but does not prescribe penalties. And North Carolina prohibits sanctuary cities, but there’s no enforcement mechanism. In addition, Indiana has a law that prohibited local governments from refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, but the penalties are lacking. It can be hard to say for certain if Smith is right, but national immigration experts agree with Smith’s point. ""If passed, that statement is accurate in that no such law is currently on the books, although several state anti-sanctuary bills are pending with some similar provisions,"" said Avideh Moussavian, a policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center. Smith’s research encompassed pending bills in other legislatures. While many states have pending legislation supporting compliance with ICE, he found, once again, that none of the penalties went as far as HB 697. Ann Morse, the director of the Immigrant Policy Project for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said her group is looking into 100 bills in more than 30 states related to local law enforcement and immigration. Morse said she couldn’t find any pending legislation with quite the penalties listed above. We also reached out to Monica Varsanyi, an associate professor at political science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY. Her research explores the explosion of state- and local-level ""immigration"" policy-making and she has authored several reports over the years regarding the topic. ""I can say that I haven’t seen anything like this bill,"" Varsanyi said. ""I can’t be 100 percent sure that there aren’t others out there, however."" Three other immigration law experts from around the country gave a similar assessment. The only other state considering a bill anywhere close to Florida’s bill is Texas, which is considering a piece of legislation that would prohibit sanctuary city policies and apply some of the same penalties included in HB 697, including withholding grant money and civil fines. The penalties in Florida’s bill go further by restricting grant funds for up to five years. Texas’ bill only withholds funds for the following year. Metz told PolitiFact Florida he got the idea to withhold grant money from the Texas bill but considered its language too general. Because this is the second year Metz has proposed this type of legislation, he was able to survey bills from the 2016 and 2017 session to see what was out there before finalizing HB 697. ""In some of the bills I surveyed, this year, they were looking at making it a criminal violation to have a sanctuary policy,"" Metz said. ""I did not go that route. I felt it should remain in the civil arena, but with significant penalties."" Our ruling Smith said that a proposed crackdown on Florida’s ""sanctuary cities"" HB 697 would be the ""only one of its kind in the nation."" Several states have come up with bills targeting so-called sanctuary cities. Among them, HB 697 in its current form is indeed unique in terms of the severity of the prohibitions and penalties against state and local entities that choose not to comply with federal immigration detainer requests. The Texas Legislature appears to have the next-closest version of this legislation.  We rate this statement Mostly True.","[('Email interview, Ann Morse, director, Immigrant Policy Project, National Conference of State Legislatures, March 28', 'https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/ice-and-border-patrol-abuses/immigration-detainers'), ('Email interview, Monica Varsanyi, an associate professor at political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY, March 28', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Avideh Moussavian, a policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, March 29.', 'http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB4'), ('Email Interview, Bill Hing, professor of law, School of Law, University of San Francisco, March 27', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Kevin Johnson, dean and professor of immigration and refugee law, University of California - Davis School of Law, March 27', 'http://www.ncsl.org/research/immigration/sanctuary-policy-faq635991795.aspx#history'), ('Email interview, Gabriel ""Jack"" Chin, immigration law scholar at the University of California-Davis, March 27', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Rep.

How much will global food demand grow by 2050?
","White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed global food demand to commemorate National Agriculture Day on March 21. ""Global food demand is expected to increase by 50 to 97 percent by 2050,"" Spicer said, using the claim to support President Trump’s desire to reduce regulations affecting American farmers and ranchers. We wondered how such an estimate would be created and if Spicer’s data was based on evidence. Projections on food increases Both the data the White House showed us and research we found supports the claim that food demand will increase in the coming decades. Yet estimates vary surrounding the level to which it will increase. One study from 2014 in the academic journal Agricultural Economics stated food demand might increase by 59 percent to 98 percent between 2005 and 2050. Another study contributed to the National Academy of Sciences in 2011 said crop demand might rise by 100 to 110 percent between 2005 and 2050. Those estimates are close to the increase of 50 percent to 97 percent Spicer mentioned, though Spicer’s claim didn’t specify a start date for his projection. (We asked for clarification but didn’t get a response.) The start date matters, because if it’s 2017 -- as a casual listener would probably assume -- then Spicer’s estimate is likely too high. Harry Kaiser, a Cornell University professor and an expert in food demand, said about a 39 percent increase in global food demand seemed more accurate (though he said other factors, like global changes in diet, might contribute to a higher estimate). He calculated that figure based on projected increases in population multiplied by projected increases in per-capita food demand using 2012 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. ""Bottom line: This is way lower than Spicer’s claim of between 50 to 90 percent growth in world food demand by 2050,"" he said. Richard Waite, an associate from from the World Resources Institute’s Food Program also told us that Spicer’s estimate was too high. He explained that forecasts of this nature ""can be a little misleading""  because the base year for frequently used data is often in the past. Waite estimated a roughly 45 percent increase in food demand from 2017, but noted that it was a fairly common ""mistake"" to use projected figures from 2006 in the way Spicer did. The World Resources Institute estimated about a 70 percent increase in global food demand between 2006 and 2050. Reasons for increasing global food demand Several factors impact rates of global food demand: growth in population and income are two of the most important ones. Estimates show the projected world population will be around 9.6 billion by 2050, up from roughly 7.5 billion currently, and per-capita income is expected to rise to 1.8 times what it was in 2012.  Population increases the number of mouths to feed, while income growth tends to increase the amount of calories the people eat. Income increases can also create a shift in diet as lower-income individuals may have better access to protein-heavy foods like livestock and fish as their incomes rise. For example, the World Resources Institute expects a 23 percent global increase in consumption of livestock and cattle between 2006 to 2050.  Our ruling Spicer said that global food demand would increase by 50 to 98 percent by 2050. Recent projections agree with general thrust of his forecast, but it seems likely that Spicer’s claim is a little too high to be completely on target.

Do undocumented immigrants have constitutional rights?
","As the Florida Legislature considers legislation to increase penalties for undocumented immigrants who have committed certain crimes, legislators and activists have pondered this question: What are the constitutional rights of these immigrants? HB 83 would increase penalties for certain violent offenses -- including sexual battery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, murder, and the use of a destructive device such as a bomb -- if the defendant was in the country illegally. The bill still has several hurdles before it reaches Gov. Rick Scott’s desk. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Dane Eagle, R-Cape Coral, argued at a March 27 House subcommittee hearing that the courts will ultimately have to rule on whether the legislation is constitutional. Based on some court decisions, Eagle said it is ""unclear if non-citizens can enjoy the same constitutional rights as citizens"" although he said that everyone is entitled to constitutional protections for due process. Francesca Menes, director of policy and advocacy for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, disagreed with Eagle. ""As an undocumented immigrant, you do have constitutional rights here in the United States,"" she said, ""and that has been said over and over in the courts, that they do have constitutional rights."" We found that undocumented immigrants do have constitutional rights -- but not all of the rights of citizens. (We have previously fact-checked a claim about whether unlawful presence in the United States is not a crime, a claim we ruled Mostly True.) Some rights, but not all A spokeswoman for the Florida Immigrant Coalition pointed to an article by an author of immigration books about constitutional protections for undocumented immigrants. We interviewed several legal scholars who agreed that undocumented immigrants have many constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech and religion, and if arrested, a right to a Miranda warning. ""There is no question that all persons in the United States including unauthorized migrants enjoy the protections of the Constitution,"" said Gabriel (Jack) Chin, law professor at University of California-Davis. ""There is no debate about that among legal scholars."" The Fifth Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment protects everyone from deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process of law, Chin said. There have been several court decisions dating back more than a century that outline the rights of undocumented immigrants. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Zadvydas vs. Davis (2001) that ""once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the due process clause applies to all persons within the United States."" In a Texas case, Plyler vs. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that non-citizen children must get a free K-12 education. But undocumented immigrants don’t share all of the rights held by citizens -- for example, they can’t vote in state and national elections. And Fordham law professor Jennifer Gordon said that some undocumented immigrants get almost no due process in removal proceedings. In 1996, Congress created expedited removal for undocumented immigrants without a hearing. Initially it only applied at the U.S. border. Then it was expanded to within 100 miles of a border for undocumented immigrants who had been in the country less than 14 days. President Donald Trump announced in January that his administration will apply the program anywhere in the United States to undocumented immigrants present less than two years. ""In the past, the government has largely prevailed when such programs have been challenged,"" Gordon said. ""However, the Trump administration is proposing to expand some of these programs to include many more undocumented immigrants; it remains to be seen if the expansion will be upheld."" The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule by June on whether undocumented immigrants in custody for deportation proceedings have a bond right to a hearing if their cases haven’t been dealt with in a timely manner. The ACLU filed the case on behalf of immigrants detained for more than six months. While defendants in criminal proceedings have a Sixth Amendment right to a government-appointed attorney if they are poor, that right doesn’t extend to immigration court, where the violations are considered civil and not criminal, said Cornell law professor Stephen W. Yale-Loehr. ""Yes, immigrants do have constitutional rights, but those rights are not equal to U.S. citizens,"" he said. ""They have due process rights, but when it comes to immigration court proceedings, those rights are often watered down by courts."" Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, said that although undocumented immigrants have constitutional rights, the question with the Florida law is whether it ""intrudes into the federal regulatory scheme."" When ruling on a case involving Arizona’s immigration law, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states can't enhance penalties for immigration violations but can ask for immigration status or ask the federal government to verify a suspect's status. ""Now, if the bill punishes criminal felonies, not immigration infractions, giving harsher punishments to illegal aliens, then I think it would be vulnerable to an equal protection challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment,"" Shapiro said. Our ruling Menes, speaking on behalf of the Florida Immigrant Coalition said, ""As an undocumented immigrant, you do have constitutional rights here in the United States."" Undocumented immigrants have many constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and religion. But they don’t share all the constitutional rights of citizens. For example, some undocumented immigrants in removal proceedings have not gotten due process in court, and they don’t have a right to a government-paid lawyer in immigration court.

Has California really created more than 2 million jobs since 2011?
","Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown was asked during his recent appearance on NBC's Meet the Press why so many voters in the Golden State supported Hillary Clinton for president. Brown, a four-term governor, said the reason is simple: California’s job growth and prosperity. In doing so, Brown repeated a claim we rated True in January 2016 about just how many jobs have been created in the state in recent years. ""People have jobs. 2.1 million jobs have been created in the last six or seven years,"" Brown said on March 26, 2017. ""So, I think it’s that sense of economic security that makes the difference. If we had the same insecurity as Akron, Ohio, Hillary would not have gotten the votes she got in California.""  Brown makes his jobs claim at about the 1:30 minute mark in the video above.  In his January 2016 State of the State Address, Brown accurately said ""Two million new jobs have been created,"" in California since 2011. Below is an updated look at California’s job numbers and the research that continues to back up this claim. Our research Six years ago, in January 2011 when Brown returned to the governor’s office, California had 14.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs. As of February 2017, the state had nearly 16.7 million of those jobs, according to data tracked monthly by the California Employment Development Department and closely watched by economists. That’s an increase of about 2.34 million. So, if anything, Brown is understating the job growth. Compared with seven years ago, the state has added about 2.44 million jobs. This is a ‘net job creation’ total. Many jobs were also lost during this period, but they were outnumbered by the gross total gained. As with our fact check in 2016, we examined nonfarm payrolls jobs. Economists consider that category the most reliable because it eliminates farm employment, which fluctuates considerably. Everyone in the nonfarm category is listed on a payroll and considered an employee. Our ruling California Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed on NBC's Meet the Press that ""2.1 million jobs have been created"" in the state in the last six or seven years. If anything, Brown slightly understated the number of net jobs created during that period. The total is closer to 2.34 million over the past six years, according to monthly job data tracked by the state and closely watched by economists. Brown made a similar claim that we rated True in January 2016. The numbers still add up in the governor’s favor. We rated it True.

John Cornyn claim about Texas Medicaid spending counts state plus federal aid
","Extolling the health care act that Republicans briefly advocated as an improvement on the Obamacare law, Sen. John Cornyn singled out how much Medicaid costs Texas state government. In March 9, 2017, Senate floor remarks brought to our attention by a reader, the Texas Republican prefaced his claim by saying state and federal governments ""spend an awful lot of money on Medicaid,"" the federal-state entitlement program providing health coverage to the poor, especially mothers, children and the disabled, which was launched by Congress in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. Cornyn went on: ""In Texas, for example, my state spent close to a third of its budget on Medicaid last year, a third of all state spending."" We emailed Cornyn’s office to request his backup, then turned to the authoritative May 2016 Fiscal Size-up report from the Legislative Budget Board, which advises state legislators on spending matters. That report, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie shortly advised by email, was the basis of Cornyn’s claim along with other published accounts of Medicaid’s share of the two-year budget approved by the 2015 Legislature. According to the report, the 2016-17 Texas budget devoted $61.2 billion in funds from all sources, including state and federal aid, to Medicaid, which lately has had a monthly caseload of 4.1 million residents, up from about 2.1 million in 2002, according to a 2017 LBB presentation --and that amount over the two years running through August 2017 accounted for 29.3 percent of $209.1 billion in All Funds appropriations. Federal funds drive Medicaid budgets because by law, the federal share of a state’s Medicaid expenditures can’t be less than 50 percent though the share is refined for each state using a formula comparing the state’s average per capita income to the national average. In Texas in fiscal 2016, the federal share broke out to about 57 percent, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Also, each Texas dollar spent on Medicaid that year was matched by $1.33 in federal aid, the foundation says. We noticed another way to frame the issue in that Cornyn referred to Medicaid accounting for one third of all ""state"" spending in 2016. That’s not correct. According to the Fiscal Size-up, the 2016-17 budget allocated $25.2 billion in state general revenue and GR from dedicated accounts — meaning state funds — to Medicaid. Those billions, we calculated, amounted to 22.1 percent of nearly $114 billion in total GR and GR-D spending in the two-year budget. Separately, we asked the Texas Health and Human Services Commission how much Medicaid absorbs in money budgeted by lawmakers. By email, Christine Mann shared an agency chart showing the escalating share of Medicaid spending in the budget, considering both state and federal aid, from fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2015. Medicaid absorbed about 20 percent of budgeted state and federal funds in 2000, the chart indicate, but it’s accounted for 25 percent or more of the All Funds budget since 2010.                    Spending decisions remain Mann also pointed out that exactly how much legislators commit to Medicaid for the budget that runs through August 2017 will depend on actions during the session that ends May 29. As of mid-March 2017, Mann said commission staff expected Medicaid spending to be around $63 billion in state and federal funds. Traditionally, lawmakers adjust for increases in Medicaid caseloads and costs that build up between sessions by signing off on short-term supplemental appropriations. A March 2017 LBB document summarizes a version of House Bill 2, which proposes additional spending through August 2017. From figures in the document, we calculated that lawmakers could end up authorizing $63.8 billion in spending, both state and federal, on Medicaid, through the 2016-17 biennium; barring changes, that would break out to 29.8 percent of the state’s total budgeted spending of $214.3 billion. We also sought insight from Oliver Bernstein of the budget-savvy liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities. Bernstein emailed us slightly different figures for what’s likely to be spent on Medicaid through August 2017. He otherwise suggested by email that Medicaid’s heightened share of total spending traces in part to cuts in state support for public schools and institutions of higher education; when other big items get whittled, Medicaid’s budgetary significance grows. Our ruling Cornyn said Texas ""spent close to a third of its budget on Medicaid last year, a third of all state spending."" Nearly 30 percent of state plus federal aid in the 2016-17 Texas budget went to Medicaid. About 22 percent of state funds alone was appropriated for Medicaid. We rate this claim Mostly True.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Missouri', 'Eric  Greitens']","
Greitens hasn't increased the education budget by 4 percent
","Gov. Eric Greitens announced his recommended budget for fiscal year 2018 at a preschool for students with special needs in Nixa, Mo., instead of at the Capitol in Jefferson City. By speaking at a preschool, the new Republican governor said he was highlighting his commitment to public elementary and secondary education. Greitens described the difficult challenge he encountered making cuts to balance Missouri's ""broken budget."" The budget was broken, he said, by decreased tax revenues paid by special interests and by rising health care costs due to the Affordable Care Act. He promised K-12 classrooms would be protected from budget cuts. After the speech, Greitens took questions from the press. One reporter asked for clarification about elementary and secondary education funding and higher education funding. Greitens said: ""K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. And just to be specific, I’ll give you the exact numbers. Last year it was $5,914,000,000. This year is $5,951,000,000. We’re actually increasing spending for K-12 education. There will be more money from gaming funds, federal funds and state funds into K-12 education. It is a total increase of 4.1 percent."" We wanted to check into this claim, especially because cuts Greitens proposed to school transportation would cause some schools to dip into other accounts to transport kids to and from school. Education department numbers Right off the bat, Greitens is correct in saying that the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would receive more total funding than in FY 2017 under his proposed FY 2018 budget. And the budgeted numbers he cited also check out. According to the governor's FY 2018 budget, last year the department received a total of $5,914,605,606 to fund public schools and other programs. This year Greitens recommends appropriating $5,950,859,927. But the governor said this was a 4.1 percent increase. The $36.3 million increase was actually an increase of 0.613 percent — just a little off. PolitiFact tried to get in contact with Greitens to understand where he came up with his 4.1 percent figure. His office referred us to the Department of Revenue, and his press secretary has not responded to our calls and emails. Throughout the speech, Greitens reiterated he was was increasing funds to K-12 education, but according to records available in the Office of Administration, he’s not increasing funds as much as previous years. Since unveiling his budget proposal, Greitens recommended that $11 million of $52 million received from a tobacco legal settlement be put toward K-12 school bus transportation. That increases the total amount for the department to $5.96 billion, or an 0.8 percent increase over the previous year. School transportation allocation Even with this additional money, Greitens’ proposal would still underfund school districts’ requests for reimbursement in transportation spending. To fully fund all of the school district's transportation requests, the department would need to dole out $280 million, said Roger Dorson, deputy commissioner of financial and administrative services for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The extra $11 million puts the total for transportation up to $80 million. School administrators were quick to point out when Greitens first unveiled his budget that school transportation funding decreased 34 percent from the previous year — or $36 million. To make up for this, administrators said they’d have to take money from classrooms or make changes to their local busing policy. By law, districts must transport students who live more than 3.5 miles from school, and the state will reimburse up to 75 percent of the total cost for the district. Additionally, the governor’s budget won’t fully fund the Foundation Formula by nearly $45 million. The formula determines how state money will be allocated to each district to ensure that every student, no matter where he or she lives, receives an adequate education. When the formula isn’t fully funded, schools must find other sources of money — or make cuts — to meet their financial needs, said Shari LaPage, the the chief budget officer of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Greitens is giving $3.2 million more to the formula than the previous fiscal year, yet the amount still isn’t enough to allocate the amount of money to each school as required by law. Since 2014, the Foundation Formula hasn’t been fully funded. Our ruling Greitens said, ""K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. ... It is a total increase of 4.1 percent."" Greitens is right that his proposal for FY 2018 would allocate more money to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, but he is overstates the size of the increase. Even after including the money from the tobacco legal settlement, the increase would still be less than 1 percent. And the funding for core K-12 education falls short of the state’s own benchmark formula. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Gov. Eric Greitens Budget Speech.

Philly mayor draws incorrect immigrant biz stat from flawed fact-sheet
","Immigrants are the drivers behind a large segment of small business growth in Philadelphia. But how large? Mayor Jim Kenney pegged it as the vast majority yesterday. It’s Immigrant Business Week in Philly, and while commemorating the week’s launch, Kenney tweeted: ""Kicking off Philly's first Immigrant Business Week! Immigrants are responsible for 96 percent of our small biz growth since 2000. #PHLimmigrantbiz."" This figure was sourced from a city fact-sheet on immigration and sanctuary cities. But here’s the thing: Both the tweet, and the fact-sheet from which it was drawn, are incorrect. After inquiries from PolitiFact Pennsylvania, a city spokeswoman called it ""mistake that we'll be correcting."" The fact-sheet cited a 2015 Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce report, which itself was referencing analysis produced by the Fiscal Policy Institute: immigrant business owners accounted for 96 percent of Main Street business growth in the city from 2000 to 2013. In that same time span, immigrant entrepreneurs represented 18 percent of Philadelphia’s small business growth overall. What are Main Street establishments, exactly? The research, which was co-produced by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, uses it as an umbrella term for the following categories of businesses: ""neighborhood services,"" like salons and laundromats; ""accommodation and food services,"" like taverns, restaurants, but also inns; ""retail"" including a wide range of shops. According to Pew, immigrants make up 13 percent of the city population. With an 18 percent share of small business growth, foreign-born entrepreneurs are more prone to open new businesses than their counterparts, and overwhelmingly so when it comes to opening Main Street businesses. ""This is not something unique to Philadelphia. It’s something we see nationally,"" explained Kate Brick, who edited the Fiscal Policy Institute and Americas Society/Council of the Americas report. Main Street establishments may be more attractive to this demographic, she added, because they pose a ""lower barrier of entry to starting a new business."" The report, which described these mom-and-pops as ""less capital intensive"" and ""small-scale"" also noted: ""Immigrants often get a foothold in this country by opening small businesses in run-down areas, which also have immigrant residents. A Dominican, Kurdish, or African immigrant may have a better sense of what their compatriots in the area would like to buy in a grocery or clothing store, or what would entice them to a restaurant.""  In 2013, 28 percent of Main Street businesses were immigrant-owned. As Billy Penn has reported, while millennials get much of the attention, immigrants are fueling Philadelphia’s population boom. That’s one reason why local immigrant business growth has been so impressive. Another, the report noted, are the city’s support through programs out of the Mayor’s Office and Office of Immigrant Affairs, as well as partnerships with organizations like the Welcoming Center. Further, foreign-born residents have played a heavy hand in rejuvenating commercial corridors like the Italian Market, which has become popular for Latino and Southeast Asian business owners in recent decades, and North Fifth Street. That corridor was once dominated by shop owners of German ancestry more than a half century ago, but it's now the cultural nerve center of the Barrio. After PolitiFact PA contacted representatives for the mayor, Kenney retweeted his earlier message with a new note that the figure was referring to Main Streets specifically. Since 2000, immigrants were responsible for 96% of Philly’s Main Street small biz growth. Get the facts: https://t.co/5Igw5ytfZM https://t.co/wDP8u0rybw     Our Ruling Kenney originally tweeted that ""immigrants are responsible for 96% of our small biz growth since 2000."" This is not true, and his office, after PolitiFact Pennsylvania made them aware of the error, has since acknowledged that.
